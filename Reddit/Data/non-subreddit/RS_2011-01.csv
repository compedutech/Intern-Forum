Over the holidays I received a new electronics kit and was **looking for some good projects to get under my belt** before applying for internships and whatnot.

I am in the last 6 months of college here in Pittsburgh PA. I am currently an IT student with a concentration in Network security and computer forensics. So, I'm in the beginning process of attempting to land a nice internship in IT security or computer forensics of some sort. 


My school is not too supportive in finding internships outside of the companies they seem to be partnered with. From what I have noticed, they see us students as a number.. so a help-desk job is what they will give me. (nothing against help-desk, but I already am help-desk and didn't attend college to keep my same job).


Anyway, is anyone familiar with a company/organization dealing anything I'm looking for? Hopefully near the Pittsburgh area :D 
I know its a long shot, but anything helps!


Thanks!"

Hopefully someone has some advice or a lost soul.,[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/euxbi/i_hate_my_life_and_where_i_am_hopefully_someone/,"My story.  I'm sure few will care, but hopefully there's someone out there with advice for me.

Over the past year or two I feel like I have gotten stuck in a rut in my life.  Every day feels like it's just going to be one big disappointment.  Ever since I went away to college, I feel like I've changed for the worst.  Two of my grandparents have passed away along with a close friend of mine who I used to work with.  I'm afraid to get close to anyone and let them know how I feel, I barely even talk to my parents about my personal life beyond on what they see from the outside.  I don't remember what it feels like to not be an insomniac, staring at the walls at night wishing everything was different.  I feel cold, unemotional, anxious.  I feel like everyone is trying to ridicule me and I'm quick to retaliate even when it is completely unwarranted.  I feel like I'm always letting everyone down, especially my parents.  The academic program I was in required the students to complete several semesters of internships with engineering firms, however I was one of the few students in the entire program to not get a job.  I have decent grades and pretty good people skills, but now I'm associated with all the fuck-ups who are failing out.  My family was counting on me to get a job to help pay for school, now we're tight on money.  The only time I feel happy is when I get high and I hate myself for this.  My dad was recently diagnosed with cancer and is back in the hospital.  I'm really scared what the future holds.  I need help but am too afraid to admit anything is wrong.  I hate my life and have been questioning if it's worth living anymore.  Hopefully someone has some advice on where to go or what to do, or even an anonymous face to listen to me rant about my troubles."
euvfm,7,2011-01-02,losing passion in everything i do,tiredatwork,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/euvfm/losing_passion_in_everything_i_do/,"Dear Reddit,
I feel myself slipping away. 

I graduated with a degree in Aerospace Engineering.  When I was a sophomore in college, I almost changed my degree to English (my passion at the time was literature) but changed my mind after talking to and being influenced by many people, including my mother. She was adamant that I stick to a more practical major, and while I did make an effort to go talk to an English advisor about changing my degree, I eventually settled back into Aerospace Engineering.  Coming from a Filipino upbringing, it is not uncommon to steer your children in the direction of math and engineering.  Please keep in mind, the decision I made to settle back into engineering took a great deal of thought (I wasn’t mindlessly “giving in” to my mother, as some of my peers claimed).  

Despite my lack of passion in the field, I managed to graduate as a Magna Cum Laude, studied abroad twice, and had two internships.   I was determined to make my undergrad experience as enriching as possible.

My confusion with my family and my upbringing led me discover another discipline that I came to really appreciate:  Sociology.  When I was in my 4th year (I did a self-initiated 5-year program on account of study abroad/internships), I picked up a minor in the subject.  After studying different facets of Sociology (including some classes I took while abroad in Southeast Asia), I quickly became interested in the field of International Development.  I’ve since been making very slow strides to directing my career into this direction.   When I was in undergrad, I joined the organization Engineers Without Borders and served as the “General Curriculum Chair.” I learned that it’s very easy to get caught up in this need to “introduce technology for the benefit of mankind” with total disregard for the complexity of social and cultural dynamics.  I tried my best to encourage interdisciplinary approaches to our work. 

Where am I now?  Since last May, I’ve been working as a design engineer at a large engineering company, one that everybody on Reddit is probably familiar with.   I work 7-4, walk through the actions, and find myself taking on more and more responsibility.  Reddit, I feel my mind slowly deteriorating. I live each day, stressed from deadlines and stressed from the engineers around me. There are days, seriously, where I go to the bathroom for the sole purpose of crying.  Then when I go home, I try to find a way to bury my thoughts, because I can hardly focus.  I listen to “inspiring music” and find myself feeling even more miserable for not making a change in my life.  I feel inadequate in knowledge and skill, and the thought of applying to grad school depresses me.  My ability to write effectively has gone down the shitter, and I hardly know how to express myself anymore.  

Realistically speaking, I should be incredibly grateful to be where I am now.  I have a solid job and a new car.  I live in a brand new city, and I’ve always loved to live in new places…. But…. interestingly, I’ve never been more depressed than I have been in the past 8 months.  It’s becoming almost a habit for me to sit still and start crying.  I’ve been thinking of seeing a counselor, because this “low cycle” is lasting far longer that I expected.  In the past, I’ve typically been able to deal with situational depression by consulting my friends, by writing, and then ultimately making a change. Now, I find that I lack the motivation that it takes to go places. 

I’ve been back home (family home) for the holidays, but will be returning back to my new home (work home) tomorrow.  I am going nuts right now because I’ve been crying a lot and I don’t really know how to deal with this.  I feel like I should go see a counselor, but if I was prescribed meds, I don’t know if I’d want to take them.  Like I said, I’ve always found a way out…

Just know I’m trying to make effort to get in the right direction.  The other day, in an attempt to start my New Year’s Resolutions, I called a University near my new home, and I may be able to talk to an advisor of the International Studies program.  I’m hoping they may give me some direction/guidance.  Also, I plan on eating a lot better and exercising a lot more.  Hopefully this can help me get back on track.

ev94p,1,2011-01-02,I need a sounding board:  Am I being a selfish asshole?,EquinsuOcha,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ev94p/i_need_a_sounding_board_am_i_being_a_selfish/,"Sit tight, this one is going to be a long story.  I'll try my best to keep it brief and not overwhelm you with the details, but I try and do some sort of self reflection from time to time (without the Stuart Smalley mirror), and really gauge if my behavior is out of line.  Strangely, I have a very supportive group of close friends, so I'd actually like to run all this by strangers, and get their opinions.


Backstory:  I met my current girlfriend, 15 years ago when I was in the Marines.  It was absolutely love at first sight, and we were together for two years.  Unfortunately, we broke up, due to a lot of immaturity on our parts, and the outside influence of people who did not approve of me, or my occupation (what kind of life are you expecting with him, he's probably cheating on you, etc.).  I got out of the Marines two years later, unable to recapture that kind of magic with another woman, and kinda bounced around from one shallow relationship to another.  Shortly thereafter, a friend recommended me to her niece, and we actually hit it off.  It wasn't overwhelming puppy love, but she was in to me, and I was in to her.  We dated long distance for three months, and I admittedly overlooked a lot of our incompatibilities because I was eager to get over my long lost love, and because all my friends I grew up with had paired off with wives and started families, and I subconsciously thought I should too.  We were engaged without even living together, and married a year later.  I relocated out of state to be with her, and supported both of us in a tiny rented room while she finished out the last year of school.  Things were good.  Sorta.


I got more promotions at work, she took unpaid internships to bolster her resume.  I made more money and used the GI Bill to buy a house, she quit her job to start her own consulting business, and worked from home.  The dot-com bubble burst right after 9/11, and I was laid off the same week she found out she was pregnant.


I'll spare you the details of the downfall of our relationship, but while money cannot buy you happiness, being poor affords you all kinds of misery.  I could not find work, and we ended up relocating to my hometown to live with my father.  The marriage did not last, and on my daughter's first birthday, my wife moved out with my little girl.  A few weeks later, she was dating someone else.  The marriage was over.


It took two years of fighting, angry hanging up the phone, and all kinds of name calling on her part, where I tried to take the high road, but admittedly failed many times, but in the end, we ended up calming things down, and acting civil to one another - for the sake of my daughter.  She's been with two more boyfriends by then, including a doctor who cheated on his admittedly failing marriage, and they move in together.  I don't say this to judge her, but it plays a part in their (my ex and her boyfriend) dynamic.  They were together for five years, but he never wanted to marry her, or have kids together.  He had one already from the previous marriage (where he got taken to the cleaners), and my daughter, whom he never engaged or attempted to get close to.  This bothered me a great deal, because in my absence, I was hoping he would step up and be a father figure to my little girl.  Instead, he was ""the boyfriend"" who competed with a 7 year old for mommy's attention.  In September of 2010, after 5 years together, they broke up.


In the meantime, I had been bouncing from shitty paying job to shitty paying job.  I sold cars.  I freelanced computer work.  I waited tables.  I made enough to barely get by, but never ahead.  I was constantly a burden to my family because I couldn't land on my feet.  All the bills from the divorce went to collections, and then to court.  I lost pretty much everything I had.  However, things were turning around, and I finally got a place of my own after crashing at my dad's for what seemed like forever.


Enter, the ex.  She calls me crying on a Friday night, saying she had just had an argument with the boyfriend, and needed a place for her and my daughter to stay.  Of course, I offered mine.  Three days later, she's moved in.  Make no mistake though, we are not together, either physically or emotionally.  


Since her departure, I bounced around again, and finally ended up reconnecting with my lost love on Facebook.  She lived out of the country and without getting into the details of her situation, could not drop everything and be with me.  We'd have to work at it, and see each other infrequently, but the fact that we'd rekindled something amazing, it was worth the hassle.  Still, I wasn't making good money, and every day was a struggle, between rent, child support, and food.

In October, I caught a break, and landed a contracting job that would take me overseas for a month or so, but the money was too good to turn down.  I let my ex, and my daughter, have the apartment.  I took off, and upon my return, was offered a job by the same company, but it was 4 hours away.  I said yes, because the money was even better.  This infuriated the ex, because she was getting accustomed to me watching my daughter while she went out, or ""took a break"" from being mommy for a while.  I understood, but I had to do what was best for me.  Child support never stopped, even though they were living with me.  I saw it as my duty.  And even though I live four hours away, I drive up every single weekend to be with my little girl.  My car is 11 years old, and has over 170k miles on it.  I even pay the cable at the apartment.


This brings me to where I am today.  I'm continuing the relationship with my girlfriend, and plan on flying out to see her.  My ex has now become accustomed to my presence on the weekends, and is upset.  She does not approve of the relationship, and uses her failed one as an example of making sacrifices in love for the benefit of our daughter.  Clearly, I disagree that they are similar stories.


Bare in mind, you're only getting my side of the story.  She often complains to me that she is a ""single mom"" with no one to help her, despite having my father only a few doors down, and her parents visiting frequently.  She is now legally bound to where she lives because of a post-judgement agreement that stemmed from her trying to illegally relocate (that's a whole other expensive story), and complains about this frequently.  She wants to relocate to her home town up in New York, although her parents no longer live there, and most of her friends have moved away.  I know, she is unhappy living where she is now, although part of me suspects that she would be unhappy no matter where she is.   My personal opinion is that she believes money is the only thing keeping her from being satisfied and fulfilled as a person, and she feels cheated that neither I as a geek or her ex as a doctor, could provide for her the life she wanted.  I frequently feel sorry for her, because she does make it sound like she is having a difficult go at life.  However, I also think she lacks perspective of how bad things could be, and I believe she takes my financial, emotional and physical contributions towards my daughter, for granted.


With all this being said, am I putting my own career, financial and romantic life ahead of the best interests of my daughter?  Or am I being guilted by a selfish woman who only sees me as a babysitter?  Admittedly, my perspective is skewed, so I'd like some real, honest input from anyone who is willing to contribute.

Thanks for reading."

ew9sz,2,2011-01-04,Possibly not seeing each other for half a year...,ZNDEGK,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ew9sz/possibly_not_seeing_each_other_for_half_a_year/,"I guess there are many posts about long distance relationships, but anyway...

My GF and I are both in college, having the times of our lives. We're together for almost a year now. I feel like she might be the one and it seems like she feels the same about me.

Being a master student, I was able to apply for an internship abroad. This will take place next summer for 10 weeks or so. I'm not sure yet which country I will work in, but there's a fairly big chance it will be USA or Canada (I'm from Europe). This means I won't see her during that period. At first I was afraid for our relationship, but then I realized 10 weeks apart is not the end of the world and this could be a once in a lifetime experience. So I decided to go for it, submitted my top-3 countries, and I'm currently awaiting response.

A few weeks ago, my GF attended an info session about Erasmus (a European student exchange programme). She heard the first semester of the next academic year would be her last chance to study abroad with this programme. She's currently considering her application for the programme.
Well, I was okay with being apart for 2 months, but if she decides to go for it, we won't see each other for almost half a year. Maybe a visit or 3, but I'm afraid that could not be sufficient. On the other hand, she would do it for the same reason I'm applying. I even think I sort of inspired her not to let go such a chance.

I told her about my concerns, and she's worried just as much as I am. However I never asked her not to do it, since I don't want to be responsible for her regretting such a decision.

Maybe this will have a happy end, and maybe all I need is some confidence about it. But I think my worries are fairly normal, aren't they? So anyone with good advice for my situation? Any stories about couples who survived or did not survive such a long time not seeing each other?

ew4pe,1,2011-01-04,"Hey fellow CFSers, I'm in a tough spot and could use some advice. ",[deleted],cfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/ew4pe/hey_fellow_cfsers_im_in_a_tough_spot_and_could/,"Here is a background about me, sorry if this is too long.  I've been sick for 9 years (started when I was 19). I was able to finish college because I had over a semesters worth of credits from internships and AP courses in high school; however, I was not able to pursue a career since working full time was not possible for me. I also am extremely symptomatic in the morning and find it impossible to do anything before 2pm (on occasions where I must force myself to be active in the morning it usually takes a day or two to recover). Over the years I found myself in a retail position where I was able to handle 3 days a week (about 15-18 hours) and still have energy to grab dinner with my friends after or leave my house on some days off. I was always frustrated that my income was way below the poverty line, but I have wonderful parents who help support me with food and shelter. 

After 3 years at this job I got extremely frustrated because there was no room for any promotions unless I was able to put in more hours (I tried working 30 hours a few times but felt a crash coming on and had to cut back). Eventually I left and pursued a career in real estate under the assumption that I could work part time and perhaps gain financial independence. This turned out to be a horrible decision. Even though I made some decent money (not nearly enough to move out and be on my own, but more than I had made previously) the hours were more than I could handle, especially since it included earlier hours on the weekends. Eventually I had a horrible relapse with a repeat of a flu-like illness that lasted 6 weeks and left me mostly bedridden for almost 3 months. Since then (2 years ago), I have struggled with various part time jobs where working only 6 hours a week was a huge challenge. 

Last March I tested borderline positive for Lyme disease (all previous tests came back negative). I started antibiotic treatment started feeling better. The improvement wasn't huge, but it allowed me to be active a little each day, even if it was only an hour or two. I was eventually laid off from my job, but was empowered by this new diagnosis and continued on different courses of antibiotics for almost 5 months. I would say the I reached a 40% improvement, but it was still far from a cure. 

At this point I decided to go back to the retail store I had worked at years earlier since I had a good balance there in the past. My plan was to start out part time and eventually work my way up through the company as I started to recover. I started working there about 6 weeks ago and have been on a downhill slope since. They have new rules where I must work at least 3 days a week, and right now that is a huge struggle. I barely have the energy to make it to work and most my days off are spent completely bedridden with headaches, nausea, body aches, and stomach pain that keeps me up at night. I am in so much discomfort after a shift it takes me hours to wind down and often sleeping more than 3 hours at a time is difficult as I'm either woken up by nausea or heart palpitations (my sleep patterns return to normal if I have a few days off in a row to just rest and recover). I have had a day or two where I have felt mostly ok, but am too scared to do anything but rest on those days in order to build up some energy for days where I have to work. 

So my decision is do I quit this job and focus on my health? Or hang in there and hope for the best?

If I quit this job I seem to have nowhere else to go. My resume is all over the place, with stretches of unemployment in between. I don't have the energy to fight for disability benefits, especially since what I qualify for would be extremely low considering I never had a decent paying job. I'd much rather find a part time job I could handle and get out of the house than sit at home and collect a check anyway (plus unemployment almost always leads me to depression). 

The main reason for me wanting to leave is that I currently do not have the energy to keep up with my doctors appointments. During the time I started this new job, my Lyme doctor recommended I try an herbal protocol that helped people where antibiotics failed. I have felt much worse since then, not sure if its because the pills are not working or the job is just beating me down too much. 

My hope was that my body would eventually adjust to these hours and I'd be able to supplement my therapy with acupuncture and Reiki to achieve the balance I had in the past. I am actually scheduled to take a beginners course in Reiki next week. This is going to require me to leave the house 5 days in a row (3 days for the course and then 2 for work), I am hoping the Reiki will work miracles as this is going ot be quite challenge (i have had success with Reiki treatments in the past, this course will teach me to self-treat at home which I can do each day). 

So what are your thoughts? Does it make sense to quit? Am I crazy for thinking I can hang in there and eventually start to feel better?

**TL;DR:** Current job is more than my body can handle at the moment, not sure if I should hang in there and hope I reach a balance or quit with no source of income or foreseeable employment options in the future. "
ew23g,0,2011-01-04,Always use a condom. (Craziest girl in the world),[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ew23g/always_use_a_condom_craziest_girl_in_the_world/,"Hello reddit, I thought I'd share my story with you. 
It all started a year ago when I was on my first year in Uni in England and met this girl. We quickly became friends. I never wanted anything more, because I knew she was kinda crazy; she was always getting awfully mad whenever I didn't wanna walk her home from every party and spend a lot of time with her. Needless to say, we stopped hanging out and even talking (couldn't be arsed with non stop drama). 


When we got back on our second year she started calling saying that she wants to meet up and tell me something. She was literally everywhere I was; parties, library - proper stalking. It started to be a little bit annoying so I said I'd meet her, thinking that she'd stop acting crazy. We met in this pub and, what do you know, she didn't say anything at all, as a matter of fact think she believed we were on a date. I met her on this next party (coincidence?) and she told me she's been in love with me for over a year now. I just said some stuff like ''Oh you shouldve told me that earlier, now it's not the same blah blah'' because I didn't wanna hurt her feelings by just saying - you're weird, leave me alone. This was my first mistake.


Few weeks later I saw her on another party and, I dunno how this happend but she ended up coming to my house with few other people for an afterparty. I kept drinking all night and I was really wasted, I even forgot she was there. At 4AM I went upstairs to go to sleep and guess who's lying in my bed? She said she's too drunk and asked if she could stay. I was really drunk and tired so I agreed - second mistake. We started spooning and she started rubbing her ass, then she took her bra off and everything. I was half asleep, but naturally I got a boner. Then she undressed completely and literally took my dick and put it in her fanny. She started moving and basically raping me while I was asleep. (Alright I know you can say that I should've stopped it, but remember the fact I was shitfaced. - third mistake) When we woke up the next day she thought we were a together now and acted like she was my girlfriend. I was paranoid she got pregnant so we bought the morning after pill just in case. 



This is where the crazy part starts. I was about to leave to America, bacause I was accepted on this student exchange program. She came to my house and said that she's got cancer and she will die in four months and I can't leave. Seriously. I knew she was a bit crazy but this is just a complete new level. I knew this story wasn't true because none of her friends, family knew about that. She didn't even go home for Christmas and kept working, she was also telling me about this internship she's gonna have in London in the summer.. That's not something a person with 4 months left would do. After that I decided to stop talking to her for good. On the 31st of January, at 10:30PM she sends me a message saying she did a pregnancy test and it's positive. So she basically ruined my new year's eve. I called her the next day and asked what's she talking about, it can't be possible. I bought two more tests because I needed to be sure she ain't lying. I invited her to my house and asked her to do the test - she wouldn't do it. Then she called me 5 hours before my flight to America that she did another test and it's positive again and she doesn't know what to do. I went to her house even though she was telling me not to and took the tests she did. THEY WERE ALL NEGATIVE. She was even trying to scratch some things off the test so the negative sign looks like positive. I should've called her a crazy lying bitch, but I just walked off with the biggest relief in my life. 


So please, if you don't wanna experience that kinda shit ALWAYS use a condom, or just don't have sex."

2.) I have been dealing with pretty bad iatrogenic medical problems for the last 2 years and I think I am mildly or even majorly depressed. This really impacted my sex life. I am still turned on by her and the female form in general, but I don't have enough energy and desire to have sex. Before my medical problems this wasn't really an issue.

3.) We were fighting over tons of little stuff about our future (I am atheist will I go to church, will our kids go to church, how many kids are we going to have, how big a house, politics). We are really different people, but fighting over this at that time was really stupid looking back at it.

Anyways, I was across the county by myself for an internship and my medical problems continued to get worse. Once we started fighting about all these little things I just felt it wasn't going to work out especially since I really never have enough energy or desire to have sex. For me the relationship had become platonic and I think deep down she held that against me. But she loved me more than anything… she would do anything for me and supported me throughout all our problems. 

But for some reason I felt like I needed to end the relationship. It was the toughest thing I have ever done, mainly because I care so much for her. She took it very hard, and I have been devastated. She didn’t understand and now she basically hates me. 

She was basically my best and only friend and life without her has been incredibly difficult.

I know I fucked up. I will never have a functional relationship because of my medical problems, yet she was willing to accept them and loved me all the same. I know that I damaged our relationship beyond repair and I don’t want to hurt her anymore. 

I have been so lonely these past couple months and knowing that she will be leaving to finish school in a couple days and I will be leaving to my job, and knowing that I probably won’t see her again is killing me. I don’t want to hurt her anymore but I really want to contact her. I miss her. What should I do?"

Naturally, I have gotten broken up with a lot of times because of my accessive studying.   I have decent marks but I feel like a CHILD because I have no life experiences.  My anxiety disorder has not made studying any easier over the years.  I feel burned out, or like I am in a rut.  I am also sick of having no money for fun stuff or adventures because I have to spend it all on tuition.

I find myself extreemly frustrated because I have lost the ability to force myself to study.  I love what I am studying, I am just bored of studying itself!  I want to experience other parts of life than studying.  I have an essay due tomorow and I haven't even started because I am so bored with school that I am having a lot of trouble focusing.

So I will be dropping 2 of my 4 courses because I can't stand it anymore and I want to go to a post-graduate program next january instead of grad school ( I don't need this year's courses for the post grad thing.  Also post graduate programs are shorter and easier than masters programs - yay!).  

I don't really know what I am looking for - advice maybe?  IDK I am just very bored and frustrated and I feel like I haven't really lived my life because I have studied the whole time.  People say ""take a year off and travel or work""  - to that I say: travel with what money?  Also YOU try getting a decent job with a bachelor of arts degree.  I thought I would just work and maybe if I am lucky, do some sort of internship or go to Quebec for some sort of french imersion summer job thing.  IDK.  Also I feel behind in school in general cause of the 2 years I took off for being sick.  I wish I had school all finished and had a career and an apartment and hobbies and live in a different city and had a life!! ARGH! I'm just bored and frustrated and sad :("
ewz76,13,2011-01-05,PETA,[deleted],AnimalRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalRights/comments/ewz76/peta/,"I have been working with PETA for the last couple of months and just wanted to throw this out there: I have definitely been guilty of going along with the crowd by agreeing that PETA is crazy. Recently I have stopped doing this because I have gotten to know many of the employees and interns over the past couple of years and have been lucky enough to be directly involved with their issues. Sometimes I get embarased or nervous telling people that I am an intern there but I fucking hate that. By talking shit about PETA, we are essentially degrading our own cause and clearly that's no going to convince anyone to go vegan, it's not educating curious people and it's certainly not helping the animals. PETA is a media whore because they don't have enough money to show nationwide PSAs, etc. If they did, the FCC probably wouldn't let them on the air anyway. When they have a shot at getting media attention, they have to do everything they can to take it. And honestly, wether you love them or hate them, they are probably the reason you are currently vegan. They are also probably the number one reason veganism has become mainstream. I think we all need to be honest about our thoughts about PETA, and even if you come to the conclusion that you still hate PETA, I think it would be a great idea if we found a way to stay positive about them when confronted. When a meat eater hears a vegan call PETA outlandish or over-the-top, it gives them a reason to view their undercover investigations as a lie, their message as ridiculous and therefore, a sorry excuse to continue supporting animal abuse.

ewyl2,12,2011-01-05,"IAM a middle child, the brother of two addicts.  Ask me anything/commiserate.",Blakest1,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ewyl2/iam_a_middle_child_the_brother_of_two_addicts_ask/,"It's been a long story, but it began when I was about ten years old.  My half-brother (six years older than I) struggled with the absence of his biological father, rejecting the best attempts by my own father and turning to marijuana.  No big deal, right?  I would tend to agree.  The only problem was that it didn't stop there.  I recall being about thirteen and having weekly telephone conversations with my brother about his exploits.  He had since moved back to live with his biological father and moved on to drugs like LSD, cocaine, what have you.  These were strange phone calls—a melange of nostalgia, proud boastings about parties attended, and warnings about the dangerous combination of tryptamine psychedelics and apartment balconies.  One thing I remember most clearly is that my brother claimed he would NEVER shoot up.


Of course that turned out to be a lie, and my brother found himself in and out of rehab, and eventually in a comatose state on the floor of his ""friend's"" house, having overdosed on a fentanyl patch which had been punctured with a needle in order to speed things up.  After this incident, he claimed to have suffered from tinnitus (a constant ringing in his ears) and erectile dysfunction, for which he took viagra (he was about 24 at the time, which is my current age).  By this point, I still considered him my brother, almost always omitting the word ""half"" from the hyphenate.  I felt bad for him—he claimed to have spiraled into addiction because of my father's constant badgering and accusations that my brother would ""never amount to anything.""


It could be that this was a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I like to believe that it was simply an apt prediction.  (Here is the point where I would say ""God only knows"" if I were a man of greater faith.)  Shortly after the coma incident, my brother—let's call him Tyler for the sake of discussion—met a nice girl and brought her to my Aunt's wedding.  She was in a nursing program and seemed to hold my brother together very nicely.  (The viagra must have worked for the ED.)


Sadly, Tyler's story is a predictable one, and he soon found himself returning to cocaine—at least that's what he confessed to at the time.    His nice new girlfriend broke ties with him due to a related fight and they parted ways for some time, during which Tyler returned to his old group of friends and, consequently, the drug binges.  Back to the highs, my brother must have forgotten about that girl amidst his many highs.  A year or so later, however, he hit a new low and recalled his lost love—let's cal her Angela.  (Oh, but that's too loaded of a name; I've only used it because it contains many of the same letters as her true identity, so let's just go with it.)


Angela had forgiven Tyler, and before we knew it, they were engaged to be married.  I was selected for the honor of Best Man.  For lack of a better word, this was fucking awesome.  I was proud of my brother for making good on all the times he had told me he would turn himself around.  This was real.


I prepared a toast for his stripperless bachelor party in which I reminisced about the days playing SNES games (he always made fun of me for jumping in real life whenever Mario did)—watching Ultimate Warrior and Bret the Hitman Hart wrestle each other.  In this well-received speech, I recalled how my brother had always tried out such moves as the Boston Crab.  Every time I would scream ""can't breath!"" Tyler would astutely remind me that ""if you can talk, you can breath.""  Sound logic.


The night of that party, just before sunset, Tyler and my friend James had left to buy another keg for the beer pong table—a trip which took much too long.  Shortly after their return, I found Tyler alone in his Trail Blazer, smoking a Parliament light.  I was suspicious at the time but, not wanting to be a buzzkill on his night, I left the issue alone.  I later learned that his lengthy expedition had included a side quest for some blow.  I am no longer on speaking terms with the friend who went with him that night.


Do I need to tell you that the marriage didn't last much over a year?  That should be obvious.  Tyler could not resist his own habits, even with a nurse-wife who craved a fixer-upper type such as my brother.  It was soon revealed to me that Tyler had in fact been shooting up, and that this had been going on for some time—perhaps as far back as his claim that he would ""NEVER shoot up.""


Since then, my brother and I have been in a limbo of fraternity, ignoring each other, reuniting, rinsing, repeating.  It was not until Christmas of 2009 that I swore him off forever, after a promise to send a gift card fell through when he fell out of touch.  Back to rehab we go.


There is more to this particular story, but you can just go back to the previous paragraphs, invent some new names for Angela, insert a child from a previous marriage, and remember to mention this time that Tyler frequently embezzles money from my widowed grandmother.



Then there is my sister.  A full sibling to me, Alexandra and I shared the perfunctory childhood tiffs, but stayed more or less out of the others' business.  It might be relevant to know that Alexandra was a very privileged youngest child and a great success in the Arabian Horse Show world—even receiving fan mail from some of her younger fans.


I suspect that her eating disorder may have been sparked by the aesthetic demands of Equitation, but whatever the case, she eventually decided that she suffered form ADHD and approached our family physician for an Adderall prescription.  I distinctly recall driving her home from school in my Jeep Grand Cherokee, advising her against the use of any amphetamines—prescription or not—in light of our older brother's propensity for addiction.


My advice was flagrantly disregarded, and Alexandra soon became known amongst our overlapping group of friends as the girl who would pay 40 dollars or more *wink wink nudge nudge knowwatimean say no more go no further* for a single pill.  In fact, I was at the bar the day after Christmas, celebrating a friend's birthday when someone asked me how she was and mentioned her notoriety for prostituting herself for amphetamine salts.


An important part of this story is that my sister had, through a series of mishaps, come to live with my girlfriend and myself.  Making herself quite at home, we discovered that many of our video game and DVD cases were empty, and that she had sold the discs in order to buy my mother a Christmas present.  The most sickening piece of this all is that the present was actually a replacement for an expensive photograph print Alexandra had taken from my mother to give to her boyfriend's parents as a gift the previous Christmas.  Worse still, the majority of the things she had stolen actually belonged to my girlfriend, who could not have been prepared for this kind of thing even if she WEREN'T an only child.


It was only tonight, when my parents came to take me to dinner, that I learned Alexandra is moving in with some wealthy family friends who know a ""holistic but NOT holistic"" healer who thinks she can help my sister.  I am pleased to finally have her bedless clusterfuck of a room opened up for more useful things, but I obviously wish things had not unravelled this way.


Me?  I'm currently in my internship year after graduating from a notable state university with honors, an award for Outstanding Student in a Foreign Language, and a member of Phi Beta Kappa.  Sure, I have my addictions—I chain-smoke whenever I write and I am a homebrewer who samples his product every night of the week—but guess what?  I'm on a career path and hope to have a novel completed by the year's end (no, it hardly relates to this story; I'm more the ergodic scientific literature type.)


Still, these things find me at night when I dream about my brother.  One evening we were back at my parents' house, regressed back to our youthful half-innocence and singing harmonies in the kitchen (my brother can't sing a note.)  In another dream, we sat in my Jeep and I held a penny in his face, screaming that it was worth less than his life to him.



So, Reddit, do you have addict siblings?  Friends?  How have you coped?  Have you?


If this experience is foreign to you, what else do you want to know?  There is so much to tell, I could write a book if I were so inclined—but as I said, I am more the ergodic science literature type.  Do your worst.


**Edit**
To everyone who has commented or will comment in the future:
I cannot thank you enough for your thoughtful responses to my story. I have never written at such length about my experiences and your stories, questions, and comments have helped me make sense of it all. I feel deeply for anyone undergoing a similar problem, and wish you all the best. I never expected this discussion to become so prolific—even if there are a thousand other IMAs with a thousand times the upvotes.
I am infinitely grateful for the chance to inspire—and be inspired by—my fellow Redditors. Quite frankly, I had been a lurker until last night when I was suddenly compelled to relate this sordid tale. So thanks again for joining me in the muck.
I haven't, (nor will I ever) escape the addictive tendencies that exist within my family. After all, I am half way through tonight's pack of American Spirits and three beers deep, but I am also a thousand words closer to my novel's completion, and can say with confidence that I changed peoples' lives at my internship today. Thanks again everyone.
I sound like I'm signing off, and that might be the case—the comments have really died down for now—but I hope this discussion continues here or elsewhere. (If I were a man of greater faith, this is the part where I would say God knows...) it will never end, but I have faith that we will find our way."
exy3e,1,2011-01-07,3L wondering if I should accept a job that doesn't require a law degree? ,majnunredfoot,lawvslife,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawvslife/comments/exy3e/3l_wondering_if_i_should_accept_a_job_that_doesnt/,"A little background: Before going to law school I was an actuary. It was pretty boring, but I did enjoy the ERISA compliance side of my job and I had always wanted to be a lawyer so I went to law school.

My frist year was horrid. My grades were putrid. Pulled a sweet 2.6. I didn't like the classes, but I probably should have at least put in some work instead of just using the year as a vacation from work. 

I took a course load that I loved the next semester, business enterprises, income taxation, ERISA, and I took a criminal procedures class because I thought ""hey, all the cool lawyers on TV are criminal defense attorneys."" Pulled a 3.8, but man, I didn't really understand the weight of the first year. 

Anyway, I kept taking similar classes, all the tax and criminal classes I could, especially the taxation courses geared towards ERISA. 

Anyway, I get a call from the old boss, he wants me to take over compliance on the defined benefits plans because I understand the actuarial and legal side of them. I can work from home, during non-crunch season, it won't take me more than 15 hours a week, during crunch season (about 1 month periods twice a year) the work load will probably hit almost 60 hours. The pay is dependent on how efficiently I can do things, gain new clients and bill. I think the low end is probably 50 grand, high end would only be about 90, and I'd probably need to do more work for that. 

The bright side is that a friend quit his big firm job, started doing solo criminal work and is doing well. His firm had him doing a lawyer on loan with the DA's office when I was there doing a clinic, and he got to watch me try a few cases on my student bar card and wants me to work for him. Up until now he usually pays me about 60 dollars per hour when I do work for him (research, prepping him for trial etc.)

The question is, should I continue to look for a a full-time job (I haven't had much luck in that arena, no law review, no formal internships), or should I stick with this road? 

Sometimes I think ""why do I care if I work at a firm, this would be a pretty nice lifestyle?"" Other times I think I want the security of a steady paycheck. "

I'm gonna try to keep it as short as I can.

In June I'll be graduating, and to carry on to a masters degree, I will need to do a year of (several) intern ship in my field.

I dream of seeing as much of the world as I can, and this would be an opportunity to live something different in an foreign country.

The problem is that my SO feels likes I will be abandoning her and she is sure i will cheat on her.
The thing is, she is my first girlfriend, and I never cheated on her nor do I intend to.

The other thing is, I might be going there with my best friend, which she hates, and I haven't told her this.

There's a great chance I don't find a job and that I'm unable to go, but I still want to do every thing I can to go there. I just want to have a life with the least bit of regrets, but is it selfish of me to go and leave my girlfriend for 6 months ?"

I've cut all contact, haven't seen her except to collect belongings. I still  love her, she says she still loves me. Reason for the breakup is that she hasn't gotten far enough in life (no internship or job) and the feeling that she needs to sort out personal issues.

Problem is, I think she is doing fine, good grades and working toward her career. Many of her insecurities resulted from me being cold and not opening myself up enough to form a deep connection. 

Having broken our engagement, she feels like she can't come back and needs to complete ""the process"" of being independent. I want to convince her otherwise, if we aren't in a relationship, I know I will permanently cut all contact to avoid pain-this goes against her wish to remain friends.

I know I fucked up royally and likely lost the future I saw with her. My reasoning is that I have nothing to lose, I will never see her again if I can't convince her to try again.

tl,dr; do you try to fix the unfixable?"

Have a few questions about what to expect...,friend168,chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/eypzl/moving_to_chicago_for_a_year_to_work_have_a_few/,"I have some friends over there and have the opportunity to live there for a year. I've decided to take opportunity and will be leaving some time in the summer after my exams. But i have a few questions, and since the people I know don't go on reddit, i figured I'd get honest answers from you guys...

1) i was in Chicago a few years a go with them and noticed a few Irish around. My friends say Irish are welcomed over there by most people. is this true?

2) I'm just finishing my third year of a computer science degree and part of my 12 month visa requirements is that i must work in an industry relative to my studies. Are there many IT jobs/internships in the city? i was on a Chicago jobs site and there seems lots from a company called Allstate.

3)i like to play football/soccer. are there any local amateur leagues, either 5 a side or 11 a side for someone to join?

any insight into what i have to expect would be appreciated. Also, any other tips or hints you think i should know or might help me.

cheers guys :)

EDIT: thanks for all the input guys. you all seem friendly and helpful. I'm looking forward to it much more because of this post.

as far as the Irish question. many Irish people go to Boston when working in the states so i knew there was an Irish community there. it's nice to know Chicago has somewhat of a community too and doesn't mind us going over there, stealing your jobs and women. 

with relation to what type of work i can do, [here is a link](http://www.it-tallaght.ie/FullTimeCourses/Computing/Name,17463,en.html) to the course I'm enrolled in and a list of subjects I've covered near the bottom of the page. by this summer I'll be finished semester 6. there is plenty of coding covered with java being the main language we've done but also c++ and c#. we also have done system analysis and design with UML for the full 3 years and i feel competent in the area too. The web design elements have covered HTML, XML, CSS and ASP.NET amongst others. There's also networking elements covering router configuration, network design and a couple different routing protocols. you can click on he modules to see more detail about any of them. 

I would be happy to work in any IT role that was offered to me and yes ideally near the city center. But it would need to pay a minimum of 750 dollars a month(visa requirements). there are plenty of tech support jobs in Ireland for college students wishing to take a year out so i was thinking maybe something similar but ideally something a little more challenging that would look nice on my CV when I've completed my degree would be preferable. i don't know what kind of money internships over over there, maybe some don't even pay at all. luckily the terms of visa give me up to 2 months to find a placement once I've arrived.

I'm sure a football/soccer game will be easy to find. i watch MLS games over here and the quality of the league has greatly improved over the past few years, in fact you guys played wonderful in the world cup last year and were unlucky to be knocked out the way you were. And having somewhere to watch the European football will be great. i hope to go to a few Chicago Fire games while I'm there if it's not too expensive or difficult to get tickets.

the bike idea suggested by bebob seems like a good idea and I'll certainly look into it if i get a placement within cycling distance.

anyway thanks again for all you comments and information. it's got me more excited about the trip and hopefully I'll have a wonderful year in your city. :)

TL;DR ... Thanks guys, can't wait!"
ezklo,17,2011-01-10,"My First Day in Hell

by Jack Handey",Benny_the_Jew,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ezklo/my_first_day_in_hell_by_jack_handey/,"My first day in Hell is drawing to a close. They don’t really have a sunset here, but the fires seem to dim a bit, and the screaming gets more subdued. Most of the demons are asleep now, their pointy tails curled up around them. They look so innocent, it’s hard to believe that just a few hours ago they were raping and torturing us.

The day started off at a party at the Chelsea Hotel, where some friends were daring me to do something. The next thing I knew, I was in Hell. At first, it seemed like a dream, but then I remembered that five-Martini dreams are usually a lot worse.

There’s a kind of customs station when you arrive here, where a skeleton in a black robe checks a big book to make sure your name’s there. And as he slowly scans the pages with his bony finger you can’t help thinking, Why does a skeleton need a robe? Especially since it’s so hot. That’s the first thing you notice about Hell, how hot it is. I know it’s a cliché, but it’s true. Fortunately, it’s a steamy, sulfury kind of hot. Like a spa or something.

You might think that people in Hell are all nude. But that’s a myth. You wear what you were last wearing on earth. For instance, I am dressed like the German U-boat captain in the movie “Das Boot,” because that’s what I wore to the party. It’s an easy costume, because all you really need is the hat. The bad part is, people are always asking you who you are, even in Hell. Come on! “Das Boot”!

The food here turns out to be surprisingly good. The trouble is, just about all of it is poisoned. So a few minutes after you finish eating you’re doubled over in agony. The weird thing is, as soon as you recover you’re ready to dig in all over again.

Despite the tasty food and warm weather, there’s a dark side to Hell. For one thing, it’s totally disorganized. That anything gets done down here is a miracle. You’ll be herded along in one big line, then it’ll separate into three lines, then the lines will all come back together again! For no apparent reason! It’s crazy. You try to ask a demon a question, but he just looks at you. I don’t mean to sound prejudiced, but you wonder if they even speak English.

To relieve the boredom, you can throw rocks at other people in line. They just think it was a demon. But I discovered the hard way that the demons don’t like it when they’re beating someone and you join in. 

It’s odd, but Hell can be a lonely place, even with so many people around. They all seem caught up in their own little worlds, running to and fro, wailing and tearing at their hair. You try to make conversation, but you can tell they’re not listening.

A malaise set in within a couple hours of my arriving. I thought getting a job might help. It turns out I have a lot of relatives in Hell, and, using connections, I became the assistant to a demon who pulls people’s teeth out. It wasn’t actually a job, more of an internship. But I was eager. And at first it was kind of interesting. After a while, though, you start asking yourself: Is this what I came to Hell for, to hand different kinds of pliers to a demon? I started wondering if I should even have come to Hell at all. Maybe I should have lived my life differently, and gone to Heaven instead.

I decided I had to get away—the endless lines, the senseless whipping, the forced sing-alongs. You get tired of trying to explain that you’ve already been branded, or that something that big won’t fit in your ear, even with a hammer. I wandered off. I needed some me time. I came to a cave and went inside. Maybe I would find a place to meditate, or some gold nuggets.

That’s when it happened, one of those moments which could only happen in Hell. I saw Satan. Some people have been in Hell for hundreds of years and have never seen Satan, but there he was: he was shorter than I thought he’d be, but he looked pretty good. He was standing on a big rock with his reading glasses on. I think he was practicing a speech. “Hey, Satan,” I yelled out, “how’s it going?” I was immediately set upon by demons. I can’t begin to describe the tortures they inflicted on me, because apparently they are trade secrets. Suffice it to say that, even as you endure all the pain, you find yourself thinking, Wow, how did they think of that?

My stitches are a little itchy, but at least the demons sewed most of my parts back on. More important, my faith in Hell as an exciting place where anything can happen has been restored.

I had better get some rest. They say the bees will be out soon and that it’s hard to sleep with the constant stinging. I lost my internship, but I was told I can reapply in a hundred years. Meanwhile, I’ve been assigned to a construction crew. Tomorrow we’re supposed to build a huge monolith, then take picks and shovels and tear it down, then beat each other to death. It sounds pointless to me, but what do I know. I’m new here."

Long post incoming, TL;DR at the bottom

I've been lurking for quite some time and today I need some advice, some context :

I'm a 28yo guy, not really the poster boy for alphaness per se (I'm short and look nothing like johnny depp :p), but being very confident and witty I never had any problems with girls.

I've not been in a LTR for some years, not willing to commit I prefered some short relationships but this is changing now and I'm looking for someone.

So I met a girl at work, younger than me (23) quite pretty and smart she's on an internship in HR for a year we're both hard workers so we only had a few interactions and they were only work related.

This changed about 3 weeks ago at a company dinner, she asked me if I knew how to dance, I replied that I only knew how to waltz (as I knew she played classical music) and she seemed quite pleased as she said (loosely translated) that ""it didn't reach a deaf ear"", sadly we didn't get the occasion to dance because the restaurant/bar/club closed as we just finished eating and we went seperate ways.

Since then she's been more friendly with me at work, we still don't see each other a lot because of the work, and because she's only there two days per week, but when we do see each other she smiles a lot, kino here and there, maintained eye contact, asking questions about me, well multiple IOI's.

But (you were waiting for this ""but"" :p) two problems :

- She seems to have a boyfriend, at least says her facebook page, not my style to background check her so I left it at that
- She works in HR :|

So that's where I need your advice, let it be clear that I don't fear being rejected but I'm in a limbo :

I don't want to nick my reputation at work, I've heard many times that relationships are no good at work, never experienced it the hard way (nor in any way), her talking about it with her/my boss would be an obviously bad thing.
I want it to be a LTR if possible, so her having a bf feels like i'm heading for the wall.

In any way I have to take a decision (giving up or getting frienzoned obviously not being options)

What should I do ? should I ask her out bluntly ? just asking for her number ? wait till her internship nearly finishes ? (10 f'ing monthes ...), 
This is a total unknown territory for me, I mean usually if I screw up, or be rejected or anything there are no consequences and I can instantly move on but that's not the case here and I was hoping someone would've had some advice about it, anything will be welcome

Thanks a lot for having read me

TL;DR : I want a LTR with an intern who works in HR in my company, getting multiple IOI's but she has a boyfriend and I don't want to screw my position up in the company, need some advice on what to do about it, thanks a lot "

[Card printing Los Angeles](http://www.printinglosangeles.org) is a printing process that not a lot of L.A. residence college students have difficulties with.

f2pjk,4,2011-01-15,Undergraduate research/internship opportunities,[deleted],math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/f2pjk/undergraduate_researchinternship_opportunities/,"Hi /r/math

Long time lurker here. I am an undergraduate math/econ major trying to find something to do next summer.

I have some internship experience developing software and assisting with quant models for a quantitative finance company. I've taken many applied math classes and have very strong programming skills and a lot of programming experience on my resume. I've also taken a few proof-based math and econ classes, but I tend to prefer applied computational classes.

After graduation I plan to go directly to industry without graduate school, so I'd prefer an internship in industry rather than an REU or as a research assistant at a university.

Did any of you have good internship experiences as undergraduates? Do any of you know of good places to look?"
f32e5,5,2011-01-15,"What do employers mean when they list ""proficiency in SAS"" as a job requirement?",BirthDeath,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/f32e5/what_do_employers_mean_when_they_list_proficiency/,"I am a statistics graduate student and am applying for summer internships, many of which require proficiency in SAS.  

This strikes me as a bit strange since my department almost exclusively uses R or (for computationally intensive tasks) lower level languages like FORTRAN or C.  

I had a license for SAS from when I worked on an empirical project in a different department and I used it extensively to create libraries to clean data and extract relevant variables.  I typically would then convert the data set to *.csv format and read it into R.  I rarely performed any extensive analysis within SAS; I found the interface to be a bit clunky.

Now, since my license expired, I do just about everything in R and my SAS skills have gotten a bit rusty.  I am a bit worried that my interviewers will ask me how to perform specific operations within SAS that I will not be able to answer.  

I can access SAS from my school's network, so I was going to try to brush up on it over the next few weeks.   Is there anything specific reference that I should go over, preferably a reference for people familiar with R who are converting to SAS (I know that the reverse is much more common)?

Finally, what is the role of SAS in the private sector (insurance/finance)?  Do they just use it to clean large data sets or do they use it to perform all of their analysis?

I didn't do anything I considered too extreme - I smoked pot and drank occasionally just like most of my other friends. I never saw anything wrong with this; I liked the way these substances made me feel and I didn't notice any devastating repercussions, so everything seemed fine from my perspective. 


While my other friends were smoking only on weekends, I had already made it a daily habit after smoking for only a month. A few months after that I had gained a reputation as being a pothead, and to be honest I was actually proud of it. I thought smoking pot made me look cool, and I was proud to have a well-known identity in my school. Before I was a pothead, I was just a nerdy, straight A student, but once I was known as a smoker I made so many new ""friends."" With my new persona, so many people would come up to me and say shit like, ""Yo I never knew you smoked, let's blaze sometime!""


A huge turning point in my life came when I was raiding a medicine cabinet in my house one day. My sister had broken her leg recently, but she didn't finish all of her Vicodin. Figuring there was virtually no chance in getting caught, I popped a few of them and immediately fell in love. Vicodin made me feel like I've never felt before. Normally I can be an anxious and timid person, but when I was on Vicodin I was on top of the world. I had no problem hitting on girls and I felt like I was the life of the party no matter where I went. 


In my mind, pills were safer than street drugs. Prescription drugs can't be harmful because they're used to treat and cure people, so how could they be bad for me? I had no problem stealing leftover prescriptions from my family. Things started to get even worse when I felt like I was in control and I knew too much for my own good. 



After trying Xanax a few times, I studied a lot on the symptoms of depression and anxiety and was able to get a 4mg/day prescription even though I definitely didn't need it. When I walked in to meet the psychiatrist, I had absolutely no problems coming up with traumatic childhood events that never happened and crying on the spot. I made up bullshit stories about how the world scared the shit out of me, how I was generally afraid of people, and how I felt like everybody else in the world was capable of connecting with people and feeling emotions that I would never be able to feel (these were all lies). Lying to people has become second nature to me. I'm an expert at manipulating people into getting what I want when it comes to this sort of thing.


As if that wasn't enough, I was able to find several sites operating out of the US that would allow you to buy schedule 4 drugs (mostly benzodiazepines), so I had a virtually unlimited supply of Xanax and Valium. 


I didn't use valium all that often because it made me too sedated, but Xanax has been great for me for a long time. Whenever I'd go to a party I'd bring my prescription bottle with me. I never drank on my own but will at parties, so when I went out it would involve me drinking straight vodka and popping xanax until I passed out. Usually I wouldn’t remember anything, but my friends would tell me I acted like a complete asshole, got trashed, and had to be babysat. I'd look at my prescription bottle the next morning and notice 20mg of Xanax gone (which is probably enough to sedate an elephant), but none of this phased me. I promised my friends I would be in more control next time, but I never was.


After graduating near the top of my class in high school, I began attending one of the top engineering schools in the US. I was heavily abusing Xanax and painkillers when I could get my hands on them. I really hated my experience at this school, but even know I don't know what to attribute this to (though my guess is drug abuse). I skipped most of my classes and opted to stay in my dorm room 24/7, and still managed to pull off straight C's. I was completely depressed and rightfully so - try sitting alone in a room all day and NOT be depressed. I eventually was able to have the psychiatrist and dean of students at the school set me up with a medical leave of absence, and I never went back to that school.


My parents insisted that I get a job if I'm not going to be a college, so I did. I knew my parents were going to suggest this and I knew I would get drug tested for a job, so I managed to stay clean for two months (this being in the only time in a span of 5 years where I could've passed a drug test). Because I was able to stop for this period of time, I didn't think for a second that I had a problem. Most people say ""I can quit whenever I want to"" but don't stop using, but I was actually able to do this for a short period of time, so I felt invincible. I landed a job as an intern in a technical department of a large company (30,000+ employees). 


After a few months of this job, I started to hate it. I hated every second of my existence for a while. Waking up early, dealing with uptight douches all day, and then being too exhausted after work to do anything. Taking a ton of Xanax helped get through the day, but I wasn't happy with my life or the direction it seemed to be going in. I felt trapped, like I was destined to work at a mind-numbing job for eternity.


Because my more successful friends were off at college now, the only friends I had left in my hometown were the druggies. I enjoyed having people my age to hang out with for once. My friends quickly introduced me to oxycontin and coke. When I first started smoking pot I swore to myself I would never use coke, so I stuck to oxycontin. In my eyes, oxycontin was equivalent to vicodin as they are both painkillers, but chemically speaking oxycontin is nearly identical to heroin. 


Needless to say, oxycontin was greater to me than anything I could imagine. I became incredibly enthusiastic at work, I never felt tired or exhausted, and I even found a girlfriend. At this point, I had completely fucked myself over. I felt like oxy made me a better person and made my life worthwhile, and this was a bad place for me to be in. I started using oxy all of the time, and for the first time in a while I started loving my life. My managers loved the work I was producing and loved my attitude. I was a fully functioning addict, and my life seemed perfect.


Then the withdrawals started. My dealer didn't have great oxy connections, so he didn't always have a supply (not to mention he charged me up the ass). When he didn't have oxy, I started using coke just so I could be high on something. Coke didn't give me the same euphoria that oxy did, but I felt happy to be alive when I was on it, so it got the job done. It wasn't long before I started snorting coke and oxy together - easily the best physical feeling I've ever felt and will probably ever feel - and I was easily spending $100+ a day on getting high. It easily got to the point where I'd wake up feeling sick every morning, but this was OK because I knew in a few seconds I'd feel great once I had a few lines in me.

Whenever I couldn't get my hands on anything, my life was horrible. It took all of the energy in the world just to get out of my bed, let alone work an 8 hour day. It was awful not being able to talk about it or get help for fear of consequences. It’s not like I could tell my boss “sorry I can’t come in today, I’m dope sick.” I can’t imagine Hell being any worse than being alive during those days, but that wouldn’t stop me from going back.

Despite being dry for even weeks at a time, the second I got a text from my dealer I would be all over it. I would drain my checkings and savings and stock up. Here I was - a 20 year old kid with absolutely no living expenses whatsoever making over $500 a week - and yet I never had over $100 in my bank account for more than a day. This didn't bother me at all though; as long as I was high I was happy and didn't have a care in the world.

It was a little less than a year after using oxy and coke that I OD'd. I've never seen so many people that I knew and loved so upset. I've never been especially close with my family. I never tell my brothers, sisters, or parents that I love them (and vice versa), and we're just not to open with each other. Seeing how much shit I put them through still makes me tear up though. My family was watching me in the ER while my body was lying lifeless. I can't even begin to imagine how awful of a sight it would be to see my son dying right in front of me with there being absolutely nothing I could do to help. I blacked out at around 5PM the day I overdosed, and didn't come to until around 8AM the next morning. It took a while for everything to sink in too. 


When I was discharged, I was pissed at my sister for throwing my drugs away, and I was pissed at my parents for monitoring all of my prescriptions and treating me like I was a baby. My parents had to essentially lock me in the house for two weeks otherwise we both know I would've gone out searching for drugs. After two weeks, I had scheduled an appointment to see a doctor about Suboxone treatment, and luckily that stuff is great at reducing cravings and preventing me from feeling sick.


It's been six months since I overdosed, I've seen so many people hurt from this, yet I haven't been completely clean. Despite every single negative incident that's occurred from drug use, I still have a desire to use. Addiction is the most confusing, fucked up beast in the world. I used to view myself as a successful, in-control person filled with potential, but now I'm at an incredibly vulnerable point in my life. Most people I know have a hard time trusting me (and if they don't, then they probably should), I've put others through so much emotional trauma, and I'm lucky to be alive right now. But even after writing about all of this damage, sometimes I struggle finding anything that will make me feel better than using oxy and coke. I've relapsed twice in the last six months or so, and even though these were small, isolated incidents, I still can't believe how I could go back to any of that.


One psychologist has really helped me open my eyes on this issue. When discussing painkillers he said this, ""Painkillers don't kill pain. You can't just target pain and kill it. Painkillers separate you so far from your body that nothing else matters."" I feel like I've wasted a very long time separating myself from reality. I used to be able to control my emotions and be artificially happy, but there's no reward in this. When I'm clean, I know I'm capable of experiencing a wider spectrum of emotions, both high and low. 


Dealing with the low is such a foreign experience to me. I have no way to cope with this. I used to think about suicide a lot after I overdosed and dedicated myself to getting clean, but these moments are becoming less frequent. Likewise, I still get cravings when I reminisce about the highs I used to get, but I realize my memory is very selective and forgets to remember the lows. I've gone days without moving or eating and I've broken down in tears countless times when I look back at how much I've screwed up and how much pain drugs have caused me, yet I still wish I could get high at least several times a day.


Addiction is the most illogical force in the universe, and I'm doing whatever I can to fight it. I'm taking the next semester off from school and going to a rehab clinic, so that's a start, but not a finish. I'm trying to find true happiness in every day activities, but it's impossible to forget the artificial happiness I know I can always get. All I can do now is remember my past and try to become a better person because of this.


I'm still in the early stages of recovery. Feel free to ask any questions no matter how offensive or insensitive they might be. Addiction is a hard thing for anybody to understand, and all I can do is offer my perspective. If nothing else, writing this has been therapeutic for me – anybody can benefit from a little introspection.

Needless to say, oxycontin was greater to me than anything I could imagine. I became incredibly enthusiastic at work, I never felt tired or exhausted, and I even found a girlfriend. At this point, I had completely fucked myself over. I felt like oxy made me a better person and made my life worthwhile, and this was a bad place for me to be in. I started using oxy all of the time, and for the first time in a while I started loving my life. My managers loved the work I was producing and loved my attitude. I was a fully functioning addict, and my life seemed perfect.

Then the withdrawals started. My dealer didn't have great oxy connections, so he didn't always have a supply (not to mention he charged me up the ass). When he didn't have oxy, I started using coke just so I could be high on something. Coke didn't give me the same euphoria that oxy did, but I felt happy to be alive when I was on it, so it got the job done. It wasn't long before I started snorting coke and oxy together - easily the best physical feeling I've ever felt and will probably ever feel - and I was easily spending $100+ a day on getting high. It easily got to the point where I'd wake up feeling sick every morning, but this was OK because I knew in a few seconds I'd feel great once I had a few lines in me.

Whenever I couldn't get my hands on anything, my life was horrible. It took all of the energy in the world just to get out of my bed, let alone work an 8 hour day. It was awful not being able to talk about it or get help for fear of consequences. It’s not like I could tell my boss “sorry I can’t come in today, I’m dope sick.” I can’t imagine Hell being any worse than being alive during those days, but that wouldn’t stop me from going back.

Despite being dry for even weeks at a time, the second I got a text from my dealer I would be all over it. I would drain my checkings and savings and stock up. Here I was - a 20 year old kid with absolutely no living expenses whatsoever making over $500 a week - and yet I never had over $100 in my bank account for more than a day. This didn't bother me at all though; as long as I was high I was happy and didn't have a care in the world.

It was a little less than a year after using oxy and coke that I OD'd. I've never seen so many people that I knew and loved so upset. I've never been especially close with my family. I never tell my brothers, sisters, or parents that I love them (and vice versa), and we're just not to open with each other. Seeing how much shit I put them through still makes me tear up though. My family was watching me in the ER while my body was lying lifeless. I can't even begin to imagine how awful of a sight it would be to see my son dying right in front of me with there being absolutely nothing I could do to help. I blacked out at around 5PM the day I overdosed, and didn't come to until around 8AM the next morning. It took a while for everything to sink in too. 

When I was discharged, I was pissed at my sister for throwing my drugs away, and I was pissed at my parents for monitoring all of my prescriptions and treating me like I was a baby. My parents had to essentially lock me in the house for two weeks otherwise we both know I would've gone out searching for drugs. After two weeks, I had scheduled an appointment to see a doctor about Suboxone treatment, and luckily that stuff is great at reducing cravings and preventing me from feeling sick.

It's been six months since I overdosed, I've seen so many people hurt from this, yet I haven't been completely clean. Despite every single negative incident that's occurred from drug use, I still have a desire to use. Addiction is the most confusing, fucked up beast in the world. I used to view myself as a successful, in-control person filled with potential, but now I'm at an incredibly vulnerable point in my life. Most people I know have a hard time trusting me (and if they don't, then they probably should), I've put others through so much emotional trauma, and I'm lucky to be alive right now. But even after writing about all of this damage, sometimes I struggle finding anything that will make me feel better than using oxy and coke. I've relapsed twice in the last six months or so, and even though these were small, isolated incidents, I still can't believe how I could go back to any of that.

One psychologist has really helped me open my eyes on this issue. When discussing painkillers he said this, ""Painkillers don't kill pain. You can't just target pain and kill it. Painkillers separate you so far from your body that nothing else matters."" I feel like I've wasted a very long time separating myself from reality. I used to be able to control my emotions and be artificially happy, but there's no reward in this. When I'm clean, I know I'm capable of experiencing a wider spectrum of emotions, both high and low. 

Dealing with the low is such a foreign experience to me. I have no way to cope with this. I used to think about suicide a lot after I overdosed and dedicated myself to getting clean, but these moments are becoming less frequent. Likewise, I still get cravings when I reminisce about the highs I used to get, but I realize my memory is very selective and forgets to remember the lows. I've gone days without moving or eating and I've broken down in tears countless times when I look back at how much I've screwed up and how much pain drugs have caused me, yet I still wish I could get high at least several times a day.

Addiction is the most illogical force in the universe, and I'm doing whatever I can to fight it. I'm taking the next semester off from school and going to a rehab clinic, so that's a start, but not a finish. I'm trying to find true happiness in every day activities, but it's impossible to forget the artificial happiness I know I can always get. All I can do now is remember my past and try to become a better person because of this.

I'm still in the early stages of recovery. Feel free to ask any questions no matter how offensive or insensitive they might be. Addiction is a hard thing for anybody to understand, and all I can do is offer my perspective. If nothing else, writing this has been therapeutic for me – anybody can benefit from a little introspection.

Food shopping became a regulated thing very quickly, as I realised how little money stretches in the real world! And due to meat being quite expensive in England I opted to lower my spending by buying less meat than usual. Throughout the 5 months my appetite for meat has seriously depleted and my consciousness of eating another animal awakened. If any of you have some thoughts on the pros and cons of Vegetarianism, it would be highly appreciated.



**EDIT:** This was my first real post on Reddit and I am amazed at the genuine and very insightful replies and messages received. From all of your thoughts and personal stories I have researched in to Vegetarianism more and I would like to give it a go. Some of the things I have seen on PETA and other sites similar have really opened my eyes to how badly animals are treated and I do not want to be a part of this process.

f3w9w,2,2011-01-17,I can't get over her. Finding someone else as good as her seems impossible,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/f3w9w/i_cant_get_over_her_finding_someone_else_as_good/,"So I dated a girl for six months. We're both 23 years old, she was freshly graduated from college, I still have a year left. We started off as friends, (she was dating someone else at the time) but a little over a month after she broke it off with him, we started going out.  Everything was FANTASTIC. We had tons of fun together, even when we were just sitting at home doing nothing. The sex was amazing (she would have 6+ O's per session). She was level headed, kind, caring, didn't pull any dramatic bullshit. We literally never fought, not once. Although I never told anyone until after we split up, I genuinely thought we would get married.

We dated for about a month in San Antonio, then she moved back home to Houston after she graduated. I found an internship in Houston that was worth coming for regardless of relationships, and I started looking at apartments and getting ready to move. Then about two months before I move to Houston she breaks it off. My internship is with the American Le Mans Series team Risi Competizione, and for someone who wants to work in racing, this is a huge opportunity. So I still moved here to Houston, even though we broke up.

When she broke it off she said she didn't know why she felt different now, and I believe her. Emotions don't always have a clear cause, I can understand that. It was just such a shock to have all my little day-dream fantasy future ideas yanked out from under me, with no warning, only two months before we could be together every day if we wanted. I think we kind of got stuck in the new-relationship-zone because of the distance. Every time we would visit each other it was like starting the relationship over in a tiny way, and right when we're feeling super comfortable again, one of us has to leave.

So anyway, I was head over heels in love with her, and I know she loved me too. Now I can't get over her. People always say ""think of the times when things weren't so good."" I can honestly say there weren't any. They also say ""date other people"" or ""sleep with someone else."" Done both, didn't help.

I don't believe in "" the one"", just one person for everyone. But I do believe that finding another person as great as she was is going to be really fucking hard. She was funny, she could speak spanish, she was easy going, she was amazing in bed, she was cute beyond belief, she was competitive (like me), she was giving, she was more than I could ever have asked for. Hell, she liked to give ME a massage before sex because it turned her on. How awesome is that?!

I just don't know what to do. I know that part of my longing for her is caused by my fear of being alone, of going through one shitty relationship after another trying to find someone who makes me as happy as she did. I know I'm a great catch. I'm smart, funny, driven, I'd like to think I'm attractive, and there's a very good chance I'll be a millionaire by the time I'm 26 (Oil found on family ranch). It's not finding someone else I'm afraid of, it's finding someone as good as her. I know there are plenty of fish in the sea, but not all the fish are equal."
f3kru,139,2011-01-16,My first encounter with the police: Did I do the right thing?,tehpolice,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/f3kru/my_first_encounter_with_the_police_did_i_do_the/,"Throwaway for whatever reason. By way of background I am a law student and an intern at a criminal defense firm. I have never had any experience with the police aside from a speeding ticket years ago. Prior to this incident I would be the first to side with the police, saying that most of the time they are just doing their job (irony, with me working for a defense firm but I digress.) This incident changed me. 

Last night at about 11 p.m. my girlfriend and I were having sex. Mid-coitus, we hear someone pounding at the door. I left my room (naked) and asked who it was through the door. I hear, “police, open the door right now!” I said I’m coming I’ll just be a minute and frantically searched for clothes to put on. They kept screaming to open the door immediately and continued to pound away. I was so frazzled it took me twice as long to get dressed, and although it felt like an eternity, it probably only took a minute or so. I finally crack open the door, and am greeted to 3 officers screaming at me to open the door fully. One was shining a flashlight in my face, and the other jammed her foot in the door way so I could not shut the door. I tried to remain as calm as possible, and asked what this was all about. They said someone called the police and said a woman was screaming for help inside my apartment. They asked me if I was alone, and I said no, my girlfriend is with me. By this time she had gotten dressed and came to the door to say hello. They were being very accusatory, asking me why I wouldn’t open the door fully and what was I hiding etc. I said I had nothing to hide but just that I respect my privacy. 

This is where things started getting scary. They asked if they could search my apartment. I said no. This refusal flipped a switch in all three of them. They started accusing me of doing illegal things in my apartment and that if I had nothing to hide, I should just let them search. We were doing nothing illegal at all, and I have no contraband in my apartment, but the way they were accusing and threatening me scared me to the point that I thought a search was crossing the line. I continued to refuse, saying that I know my Constitutional rights (I mentioned I was a law student.) That if they wanted to search they would need a warrant or exigent circumstances. I said that a neighbor’s phone call is not enough to give them justification to search my apartment, especially when both my girlfriend and I appeared at the door, and answered their initial questions. They became even more hostile, crowding around my door and raising their voices while expanding their chests. They said they wanted our IDs, and ordered me to go get them. I said no. I said we have done nothing wrong and I don’t want my name on some report for doing nothing except being in my home. At this point the woman became very angry. She said something like how about I drag your ass down to the station and take your fingerprints? 

So, I asked her if I was under arrest. They started backpedaling and wouldn’t answer that question. They were saying I wouldn’t give them our IDs because we must be criminals and we must be hiding something. I said of course not. Neither of us have any criminal history whatsoever. I got a speeding maybe 5 years ago. One of the officers started reading something from the law that says we need to cooperate or something. I said we have, but that I’m not letting them just search my home. At some point I said something about Fourth Amendment, and paraphrased it. They asked me to go get it (I said I have a copy). It was clear they wanted me to move away from the door so they could swing it open. So I said I’d be happy to get it if the officer would please remove her foot from the door way, I’d close the door, get the Constitution and return. She would not move her foot so I stayed at the door. 

At some point I turned my head away (looking back inside) and all three of them grabbed my arm and started pulling me out the front door. I physically could not have been pulled out because the door was shutting on me and I was wedged in the doorway. My girlfriend started screaming and I told her start recording this on her phone (she didn’t, it happened too fast). They kept pulling on my arm, and then pushed the door in and stormed into my apartment.  The two male officers stood on either side of me while the female searched my apartment. Of course she found nothing. At this point I was yelling in disbelief saying I thought we were living in America. One of the officers was screaming back at me, I thought it was going to escalate. In the scuffle through the front door, they pushed my girlfriend, and I had scratches and blood blisters on my arms from three people pulling on me. My back has about a 6” wide patch of skin scraped off from being wedged in the door as they were trying to pull me out front. Once they did the search they left in a hurry. I said I wanted all their names and badge numbers. She wrote them down and they left quickly without saying another word. The entire incident took probably ten minutes, and they left in about 30 seconds after searching my apartment. I was shocked, and am still a little shaken up about it. 

Today, I was thinking should I have just given them our IDs and let them search my home? If I had, it would have never gone this far and the entire encounter would have taken 30 seconds. But the way they were screaming at me from the beginning and the way they were acting was as if I’d murdered someone. Plus, they interrupted some fantastic sex. In all, as a law student it was a very eye opening experience. I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do, because things could have gotten out of hand quickly. But on the other hand I just spent an entire semester studying the Fourth Amendment and I don’t want strangers in my home due to an anonymous, and completely bogus, phone call from the neighbor. Doesn’t the Constitution mean anything anymore?

**tl;dr police physically tried to pull me out of my home and then searched my apartment when I refused.**

I'd meant to upgrade about a year ago, but then the recession happened, and  like a lot of people, suddenly upgrading a damaged but workable computer wasn't at the top of my priorities. 

After about 2 years of graduate school and using a computer that would randomly shut off I decided to upgrade. To put my financial situation in context am a semester away from finishing my Masters degree in International Economics and just landed a really great internship with a really great think tank. In essence, I have a really great opportunity to make some money in the near future, but right now I am not exactly flush with cash. I took the money that I saved this summer and others that I got from Christmas and bought a new Macbook. I figured, I will be making my living writing, so I might as well have something that works.

Flashcut to last Thursday, my computer is covered in wine and my $1000 investment in myself is now a $1000 doorstop. Even now I'm not sure how it happened. I wasn't drunk and I wasn't acting stupid, the glass just fell. It was the definition of an accident. The next day I had to head back to New Jersey to finish up some work at an academic journal that I edit, so my girlfriend took the broken computer to the Apple Store to plead with them. Her pleas fell on deaf ears. I guess the original guy was very condescending and simply said I was screwed because even though I had Apple Care, spills aren't covered. She made an appointment with the Genius Bar just to see what they had to say.

Today I took it to the Genius Bar and John was my savior. The computer was broke, it was my fault and Apple legally had no responsibility. I explained my situation to John, what happened, and he decided to pull some strings, bend some rules and managed to swap out my old wine soaked computer, for a new one.

Thank you John, you just saved a struggling graduate student $1,000. I guess the old reddit saying rings true, ""Today Me, Tomorrow You"""

This girl has been my roommate (we live in dorms at school together) for a year and a half now. We're both in our early 20s. 

- She has a steady boyfriend of 2 and a half years, who lives on the same floor as us.
- They like to make me uncomfortable when they're together and I'm in the room
- They like to try and make me leave the room so they can be alone

Sounds somewhat normal, right? I mean, girl has a boyfriend, wants roommate to leave... sexiled....

...no. It's not like that at all. 

When they're in here together, its all cutesy noises. Like a kitten or a baby cooing. For very long amounts of time. Maybe she's changing her clothes (under a blanket) and her bf makes ""ooooo.... aaaaaah...."" noises, like someone admiring a pretty painting in a museum. They talk cutesy baby talk all the time they're in the room together. It's even creepier when they're playing under the bed or something... cuz all I hear is cutesy noises.

So maybe you're like ""Oh, thats just when you're in there..."". Well, I've walked in on them too. When they totally don't expect it. He might be brushing her hair, and they'll be making cutesy noises. Or maybe they're playing paddy-cake.

Every night before bed, he comes in, and they talk in baby noises... Maybe he gives her a bedtime story? I can't really tell. But he'll kneel by her bed and talk gently for a little while, and she'll make baby coo noises... then he'll turn off the lights (regardless if I'm in here (studying/homework/playing games) or not) and leave. I mean, I guess every now and then to have your boyfriend come in for a long goodnight can be sweet, but every night?

In general, she has 3 modes. (1) Motherly to younger members of floor (2) OMG I'm a five year old (3) I need to go to work / study. #2 is the most common. She'll be playful with people, make pouty faces of ""Why won't you play with me?"" In that five year old tone. Try and get piggy back rides from guys on floor (she's rather tall... I feel sorry for the guy sometimes). Hold hands, swinging, skipping down the hallway, with just about any guy, maybe singing a song... She'll make ""cute"" cards that look like a five year old made them out of crayons and construction paper... Watch the tv shows and movies that we all watched when we were toddlers... 

Sidenote, she's on an internship right now, and I'm still in classes, and it happens to be my semester with the most work yet... so she goes to bed early, while I'll be in here studying pretty much all the time.. and complains to everyone how I'm always in the room and never give her and her boyfriend privacy... I have a boyfriend too, and occasionally do homework at his place, because I realize we do share the room and she'd probably like some alone time sometimes.. I do this mainly on weekends and maybe once or twice during the week... I mean, we share the room... 

TwoX, what do I do? Most people just say ""Um.. that's sick..."" and don't give me any advice... How do I deal with this? I'm starting to get fed up with the cute. It's driving me mad, and sometimes its just disturbing. Am I alone with having ever had to deal with this? How would you all confront this?

tl;dr: My roommate and her boyfriend are disturbingly, sickly cutesy together. How do I deal with this?"

Help,inneedofhelp33,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f463s/long_distance_relationship_with_end_in_sight_bf/,"I don’t really know how to begin this plea as it’s quite a long story. I had an awful conversation with my boyfriend a couple of hours ago that has left me devastated. We agreed to hang up, calm down, and pick up the conversation later tonight. With an hour to go before we’re supposed to talk, so many thoughts are running through my head and I don’t know what to say to him when the time comes. 

I love my boyfriend so much. He’s my best friend. When we’re together everything is in sync. The catch is, however, that we’re rarely together (physically). We’ve been in a long distance relationship for three years. We both live in the same state but go to school in different states. We see each other over breaks and whenever we can manage during the semester. It’s hard to be apart. He’s a year older than me and is graduating this spring. At first I was nervous about what our future could bring as he is applying to graduate schools across the country and in the United Kingdom.. I was worried that after graduation, our long distance relationship wouldn’t end but continue. In the past months, we’ve had an amazing time together, studying abroad in the summer together and living together during that time. We talked about how we would try as hard as possible to live together after I graduated in 2012. I am determined to find a way to be with him. 

Today, he told me that it finally hit him that he couldn’t keep doing a long distance relationship for four more years. He admitted that if he was accepted to the schools in the U.K, he might end our relationship. I guess what he said was a fact. I mean, I don’t want to do long distance for four more years either. He seems so defeated when I feel ready to accept the challenge. I’m working hard to save money to be able to make a move to be with him. I am frustrated he thinks I won’t be able to follow him, or I won’t want to. 

He also told me he doesn’t want me to ignore what I want to do in life by moving to be with him. He knows what he wants to do for graduate school and a career but I don’t. I don’t see moving to be with him as ignoring my dreams because my dreams aren’t so clear. I think its important to share what you love doing with someone who you love and that’s what I want to do by being with him. Am I wrong? Isn’t it more important to have friends and family than a six digit salary? I mean, I do have dreams. I am a very motivated person. In fact, I’m starting an internship with Canadian Embassy in two days. I have a double major and I’ve studied abroad three times. 

The real kicker, the thing that hurt the most is what happened next. I’ve been waiting all weekend to hear from him. He said he was going to send me an email on Friday in which he would explicitly write all of the things he wants to do to me the next time we see each other, which is my birthday, the first weekend in February. We had ‘fun’ on skype on Thursday. I put on lingerie, took it off for him to see. He told me during our skype date that he had written two pages of the email. I begged him to give me a ‘preview’ but he wouldn’t. He told me today that he hadn’t been able to write a sentence. He wasn’t inspired. 

I love this man dearly. I’ve told him so many times that I am committed to becoming a ‘normal couple’ and ending our long distance as soon as possible. Yet he hasn’t applied to any schools in the area where I currently go to school. Maybe there wouldn’t be much of a point to that as I graduate as well in 2012. He’s applied to so many schools in cities that I’d want to live in.. Why is he in such a funk? My family thinks he’s being lazy and selfish. But is it instead that he’s just being painfully frank? Even still, I can’t help but be hurt by his words. Reddit, I’m feeling extremely low. I hope you can offer some advice. 

EDIT: I just called him, as we planned and he told me he's watching a movie.. he'll 'call me back in a half an hour. don't worry.' :/?"

I'm not successful, but feel that I am on track to be successful.  I am graduate student in CS. I work with a MAJOR tech company in Silicon Valley and am making connections. I will most likely grab an internship that graduates from MIT will be begging for, even though I go to a small state school. I am published in research, and I love my field.  I love learning and feel that I can learn and contribute to the future of the human species. I now lecture at a University for CS stuff and writing. 

I am also terribly alone. I have loving, adorable wife, but  most of my day is spent alone in front of a computer: surfing the web, reading reddit (another addiction of mine), and then drinking, drinking, drinking. Occasionally (though not recently) I go out on the search for the hard dope. 

I'm winning the up hill battle from working class poor into middle class.  I have a shot at real opportunities... 

But I also spend days on end stuck in my room or apartment recovering from my hangovers. I spend weeks with physical manifestations of anxiety and guilt regarding all of my stupid decisions and regrets. I spontaneously shout out, as if in pain, when I think about the stupid shit I've done. I get kicked out of bars, and I piss random people off. 

I live in a upscale part of town next to a very famous university (that I don't attend). I thought that living here would make me drink less because of all the rich white people and education, but all it does is make me feel like I don't belong here, so I drink alone in my apartment and watch movies.   My drinking fuels my anxiety.

But I haven't hit bottom. 

I still have opportunities. I still impress people. I can speak in front of large crowds (probably my most marketable skill), but with individuals, I am gimped.  

Do I HAVE to hit rock bottom? I don't want to lose these opportunities. 

I have a drinking problem. I know this. It can unravel me.  

I just found /r/alcoholism tonight.  Yes, I've been drinking.  "
f6ne6,7,2011-01-21,Everything went better than expected,vesperka,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/f6ne6/everything_went_better_than_expected/,"**------BACKGROUND------**





I started an internship at a large company about two years ago, and back then I was a complete tool and a loser (even more than I am now). After a few months of sitting at my cubicle from 9-5 and never socializing, surprisingly I was invited to an after work party. We all ended up drinking, having a great time, and becoming good friends.

Unfortunately, today is my best friend and fellow Redditor [AMYALIDA](http://www.reddit.com/user/amyalida)'s last day at work. She's moving out of state and will be roughly a three hour drive away from where I live. I'm incredibly bummed that we're going to be so far apart. On top of that, today is the two year anniversary of her father passing away. We usually have a blast at work together, but given the circumstances I was half-expecting today to be more sad and depressing than enjoyable.


**------THE PRESENTS------**


**Anti-Diarrhea Medicine** - Amy majored in Psychology and is in the process of finishing up grad school now. She's going to be a therapist that specializes in marriage and family counseling. Since her clients will lie to her in an attempt to look like ""the good person"" in the relationship, Amy will undoubtedly have so much verbal diarrhea spewed at her. By keeping this medicine on her desk, she can simply tap the box to let her clients know that they're spewing BS.

*Side Note* I wasn't exactly sure what my best choice was here. I was browsing through the laxative aisle, but nothing jumped out at me. I went to speak with the pharmacist and asked him, ""What's the opposite of a laxative?"" He looked at me strangely and I just stood there silently for a few awkward seconds, and he eventually chimed in with, ""Well, we have Immodium that helps with diarrhea, it's in aisle nine."" I said, ""Perfect!"" and was on my way.

**Listerine Strips** - This goes hand in hand with the Immodium. Having shit spew out of your mouth would surely give you bad breath, so this is simply a must have for any therapist.

**Kleenex** - Amy is going to be dealing with a lot of cry-babies in her line of work. Hell, every time I had a problem with my girlfriend I would go crying to her. If Amy's clients are even half as over-sensitive as I am, then tissues are a must have. Alternatively, because some couples in therapy will be fighting, there's a good chance that the guys won't be getting laid. Luckily, Amy will be able to offer lonely males free tissues to help clean-up after their ""alone time.""

**Seventeen Magazine** - Let's face the facts people; everybody knows that majoring in psych is a joke. You're going to waste tons of money and years of your life learning a bunch of useless facts. Right now, Amy thinks happy couples should listen to each other, care about their partner's well being, and ""love"" each other, but she couldn't be more wrong. Hopefully this magazine will show her the light - if her female clients become dangerously skinny, dress like whores, and know forty-seven ways to please their men in bed, then Amy is destined to be a marriage savior.

**Fancy Feast** - Amy and her mom are absolutely in love with their two dogs. Recently, her friend Courtney baked special treats for Amy's dogs. The treats were just like regular cookies except without sugar (so they taste god-awful). Amy took a bite out of one, and needless to say it wasn't pleasant. I decided I would also get Amy a present for her dog, so I bought Fancy Feast cat food. This way it will probably taste better if Amy chooses to eat it (with the obvious ironic twist that cat food isn't meant for dogs).

**Used Pens** - Yesterday, Amy was at the desk of our old program manager (let's call her Chrissy). Amy commented on how organized Chrissy was; specifically, Amy was impressed with the way Chrissy color-coded events on her calendar. In a completely serious manner, Chrissy dug through her desk, found a few different colored pens, and said, ""Here you go Amy. I want you to have these. I hope you use them in the future."" That was Chrissy's only parting gift to Amy. Not to be outdone, I snagged a free box of pens from the supply closet. Before giving them to Amy, I tore open the box, threw away the caps to a few pans, and even chewed on one to make it look as used as possible. I will never be outdone.

I also bought Amy some Ghirardelli chocolates and Nutter Butter. There isn't a punch line or funny anecdote here - these desserts just kick ass.


**------CONCLUSION------**


I'm really happy with how today turned out. It sucks that the person who actually made me enjoy going to work every day is going to be leaving, but at the same time I'm glad that she's moving on to bigger and better things.

I wasn't sure how today was going to pan out at all. I knew it was going to be an emotional day for Amy because of the anniversary of her father's passing, but I was really hoping that we'd have a positive and memorable experience on our last day of working together. Amy absolutely loved the gifts, and I couldn't possibly be any happier with the way things turned out today. I hope the reddit community gets as much enjoyment from this story as I did.

**EDIT** - I can post this part now because it's after work. I had a little crush on her for a while, but nothing would ever happen because she's two years older and we're good friends. She didn't want to make a big deal out of goodbyes today, so her goodbyes to other people were casual. I was the only person to get a goodbye hug and now I feel like Barack Obama! Damn it feels good to be a gansta.

-**TL;DR**-

* Best friend / co-worker moving away for good today, also two year anniversary of her father's death.
* I buy a bunch of presents that seem lame, but there's a meaning to each gift.
* Potential setup for a depressing day ends up being a feel-good story for the day!
* I got hugged, feel like a boss.

I am about to complete a BA in Criminal Justice here in San Antonio. I am suppose to do an internship in the summer in order to complete my degree, but all the choices given to me are mainly police, law or judicial. I took an intro class for Computer Forensics as well as an intro class for forensics in general. I find that computer forensics/security is something I would like to get into. 

Ive been told that Computer Forensics is a rather new field so a lot of it is learning from the job. However I am unsure of places to check for an internship. The University I attend does not offer a computer forensic degree unfortunately. If need be there is a community college that offers a certificate program for computer forensics but I would like to use this internship to my advantage to gain some experience, even if it is just me shadowing over someone doing the actual work.

So I guess my question is could I obtain an internship without any actual specific computer forensics training other than the intro class to computer forensics and the degree in Criminal Justice focusing around forensics? I am located in San Antonio any help would be appreciated! "

This is a play by play of what happened through my perspective. I had just finished my shift at my Internship and proceeded to go home. I was driving down Royal Palm Blvd east bound to get to I-75.  After passing the intersection of Royal Palm Blvd. and Country isles rd., I see a black car start switching to the right most side turn lane, I proceed to speed up and pass him. Upon reaching the intersection of Royal Palm Blvd. and Weston rd. I notice I needed gas so I get on the right most turn lane. There are two gas stations there, which are Exxon and Mobil. I am waiting at the stop light at this intersection to turn right when suddenly a black car pulls up on my left side. No sirens were heard and no lights were on, I suddenly see a man maybe 200- 220 pounds about 6’2 come out dressed all in black with no official uniform. I notice he was charging at me with a violent expression on his face, and a hand near a side arm. I immediately feared for my life and hit the gas on my motorcycle trying to escape what I thought was a threat upon me. I turned right immediately on Weston Rd. weaving in and out of traffic trying to escape and protect myself from either serious bodily harm or death. I drove maybe 2 blocks down Weston rd. and did a U turn, trying to find a crowded environment for safety. Upon U turning I notice the lights on the Vehicle chasing me and immediately I stop. Upon Stopping I was tackled to the ground and stepped on. I was then hand cuffed. I told the police officers that I did not know they were police officers, and that I believed they were about to attack or kill me in the first confrontation. The officer who first got out of the car then proceeded to tell me and I quote: “that if I wanted to attack you I had enough time to do so.” If the officer had enough time to attack me how come he did not use any of this time to declare who he was? In the first initial encounter there was no siren, no lights, and no declaration of any kind that he was an officer of the law. I saw a well-built man dressed all in black charging at me with a deadly weapon and I feared for my life. I was then arrested and driven to their facility where they took all my property. What I believe happened is this, Police officers do not turn on any lights or sirens against motorcycle riders until they get close enough. This prevents them from getting scared and fleeing because they know they will have a hard time catching a sport bike. What these cops did was discriminate me and even after catching up they did not give any sign of warning or declaration of who they were. Here are some things about me which I can prove: I have just graduated from the university with a 3.5gpa cum laude, I have a 760 credit score with 100% on time payment, I just got a great internship at one of the best companies to work for in America, My license says safe driver, I am motorcycle endorsed, I am registered as an organ donor, I have a clean driving record, I do my taxes, I have done my jury duty, my motorcycle is registered under my sunpass, the bike’s tag is registered and up to date, and I am a law abiding citizen. I have absolutely no reason to run from the law, besides the fact they didn’t declare they had any affiliation with the law, until after they tackled and damaged my motorcycle (undrivable), helmet, and sending me to jail. I feel they wanted revenge because I passed them when they were changing lanes.  They discriminated against me and abused their power. 

What can I do? I need a lawyer now and not sure if I should go with ticket clinic or something. any advice appreciated. thanks

They charged me with reckless driving misdemeanor and sent me to jail for the night comments on the ticket: weaving in and out of traffic at high speeds. "

There's a good chance he might read this, as he introduced me to Reddit, but whatever. 

I broke up with my boyfriend of 3.5 years about a month ago (He's 22, I'm 21), and I'm still processing; I think it's finally starting to really hit me, and I miss him a lot. 

We started dating pretty soon after starting college (we'd been in the same social circle for several years before that) and have dated pretty solidly throughout. I thought we always had a pretty good relationship; we've argued on and off, but never very often or very seriously. 

I guess I think the big reason we called it quits was we just kind of grew apart. I'm close to graduating and starting to think about life after college, but he's still got a year or two (he's double-majoring, and working full-time as well).  I'm a science major, so I started to fill a lot of my time with internships and lab work, etc, and we weren't able to spend as much time together. I would be up and gone pretty early, and he would work into the evenings. We would only have maybe an hour or two before I had to go to bed, and rather than spending any time together, he would do something else. I laid a lot of the blame on him, but I think we both just kind of stopped prioritizing each other. 

When we had more free times on weekends, we still wouldn't do much together. We hardly went out, and when we did, one or the other of us wouldn't bother trying to enjoy ourselves. He also started to get very negative and critical, picking at every fault-he even commented negatively on my weight a few times; a big turnaround from the caring and supportive guy I was used to. I began to feel ignored and unappreciated, no matter how many times we talked about it. 

Let me pause here before everyone starts to think what a horrible guy he is--he's really not. 9 months ago when our relationship was stronger, he would always go out of his way to make me feel special and appreciated, even if it was just giving me a hug every time he saw me. He's never raised a hand towards anyone, he works really hard at work and at school, he's a great friend, brother, and son, and he's probably just about the most caring, loyal guy I've ever met. There would be no danger of him cheating, either, even if I did gain a little bit of holiday weight--he's terribly uncomfortable around most girls, and I stayed over a lot-5+ nights a week. 
Besides that, a lot of smaller things happened--he quit paying for dates altogether; blew me off to play video games or drink with his roommates--we even pretty much completely stopped having sex (Trust me, not by my choice). 

I was starting to think about the future, and although he made it clear that he really was thinking about marrying me, he wasn't ready to start making plans yet, and I didn't want to wait--the stagnation was getting to me. I wanted to talk about getting a place together once my lease runs out, and he wasn't interested for another 6 months to a year. 

We both had our faults-I was getting admittedly impatient, and he became increasingly distant and critical. We talked about it a lot, but it didn't seem to help. When we argued, I would end up hurt and angry and we wouldn't speak for a day or two, after which he would call and apologize for not appreciating me, and he would be very attentive for a short amount of time before falling back into bad habits. It just got worse and worse.
I think the final red flag for me was when I went out with male friends, he stopped checking up on me. He wasn't a jealous guy, but he's seen me when I'm drunk, so he used to check up on me once or twice every hour, to see if I needed a ride or was staying safe. I went out a few times with one friend (who could be a little predatory when under the influence) and he didn't message me even when the bars were closing. While this itself wasn't a big deal at all, it really made me think about where the relationship was headed. 

I think we both just kind of grew apart, and I called it quits after an argument. After a few days, he contacted me, heartrendingly upset, but I thought it would be best for us to move on. We really do love each other, but I don't think the relationship was going anywhere. 
Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read this, I just needed to let it out.

I'm a third year CS undergrad at the University of Arizona.  I started working at a department on campus in early 2008 and I've worked there ever since.  Now my job pretty much sucks.  Where most of the departments on campus have a fully staffed IT team, we have 2 part time students to cover everything (Server Administration, Help Desk, Database Administration, everything).

To make it short, I've had to pretty much take up all duties from software development for in-house software to Linux administration to helping everyone that walks through the god damn door.

My goal in life, however, is not to be a Sys Admin for the rest of my life, but to be a software engineer.  I have around a 3.75 major GPA and I have almost no accomplishments of my own, save for a MUD I programmed in my second semester in Java, which is my strongest language. Sure I know some C programming, and I've touched on Python, Prolog, Haskell, Ruby.  I know concepts like UML, Relational Databases, Design Patterns.

I'm at a point where everyone around me is getting internships and jobs at companies like Microsoft and Google.  I just feel like I'm getting left behind.  Every campus job I've applied for to try and break into software engineering has never warranted an interview, much less even a response. I've sent out my resume and applied to all the internships I could possible think of for this upcoming Summer, so I'm hoping for something promising there.

I thought just getting good grades in my classes would be enough to get me a decent job out of college, but I'm realizing now that that is not the case.  Hopefully it's not too late.

Why am I posting this?  Well I just need some advice, Reddit. What can I do to make myself more attractive to a software development position?  I think it may be my resume that needs the most work.  I like the look and feel of it, but the information on it is not really great for a dev job.

f9mu1,8,2011-01-26,She doesn't respect me,ijustwantrespect,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f9mu1/she_doesnt_respect_me/,"Me M32, her F22.  We've been dating a little over two months.

I'm dating a girl who is one of the most amazing women I've ever dated.  She's smart, funny, cute, and kind.  I feel like after a lifetime of looking for the right woman, I finally found her.

Sometimes I can't stand the way she treats me, though.  It started being a problem two weeks ago when we had made plans for the two of us to go out with my sister and one of my best friends, and she canceled on account of a prior engagement that she had forgotten about when making plans with me.  The next night we made plans to go to dinner and then dancing, and she completely blew off the dinner without telling me because she had errands to run.  When she called I told her it was too late to reschedule dinner for that evening if we still wanted to go dancing, and I guess she could tell I was angry, because when I picked her up a little while later the first thing she said was ""sorry"".  I accepted her apology and we went out and had fun anyway.

That didn't change anything, though.  A couple days later she had invited me to go to dinner with her and friend.  Then it turned into she just wanted to catch up with her friend on her own, but I'd see her after.  The day of, I mentioned what we would do after dinner, and she said ""we'll see"".  By the time she got back, she told me it was too late and she just wanted to be by herself.  I told her I was disappointed, but that didn't change anything.

A couple days after that, we agreed to see each other in the evening after we each did some various errands and other tasks on our own.  When it was getting near the appointed time I said I wanted to lift for about half an hour, so how about she come over in 45 minutes.  She said it would be fun to come watch me lift, so I said she could come over right away in that case.  She stopped responding at that point.  An hour and a half went by, after which I finally gave her a call and she said she decided to take a nap, but she was coming over right away.

I was angry that she didn't even bother to tell me, and when she showed up, I told her I wanted to date someone who would respect my time more than she had been.  I didn't know how to word it so I was standing up for myself without hurting her, but whatever I said it wasn't right; she gathered up her stuff and stormed off to her car, crying.  I talked her out of leaving but it was incredibly stressful.

It was to the point that a couple days later I called her, thinking of breaking it off.  She could tell I wanted a serious discussion and she invited me over to talk about it.  I thought we talked things over, and we wound up having a very fun weekend together.  

Monday of this week, though, we watched what I thought was a very depressing movie together.  It dealt with relationships failing and cheating in relationships, and after watching the movie we got into a serious discussion about some of our past relationships.  I could feel her pulling away from me and it kind of scared me, and I didn't know how to react.  

Yesterday, in fact, she told via IM that she wanted to spend a few days apart.  She wasn't sure how long, but she did make plans with me for this coming weekend.  I told her at first that I didn't like the idea, but that I could try to go along with it.  I couldn't stop thinking about this all day, though, and later in the afternoon I wrote her an IM asking her if she had already made plans for that evening.  When she said she hadn't, I suggested we forget about all the serious conversations and go do something fun in the evening.  She didn't reply for what I thought was a long time (it took almost half an hour for her to finally reply), and I was kind of panicking.  I finally decided to myself this is crap, I didn't deserve to be ignored in the middle of a serious conversation, and I wrote that it wasn't working and I didn't want to date her.  

She wrote back that she wasn't ignoring me (her parents had called) and then called me up to tell me that if I wanted to go do something fun with her that night, we could.  I was somewhat taken aback, but I agreed, since I still hoped we could work it out somehow.  Before we went out anywhere, she wanted to talk about how each of us were feeling, and it turned into a long enough conversation that we didn't have time to do anything other than hang out for a while at a coffeeshop.  It was actually quite pleasant.  When we got back, though, she started telling me it was silly to be upset over not replying for half an hour, silly to be upset over repeated flaking or extreme lateness, and that if I had broken up with her over these reasons it would be the silliest breakup ever.  I told her I felt disrespected in each of these incidents, but that I was sorry for hurting her and that I sincerely hoped we could work it out.

Incidentally, she's been working as an intern and looking for a more permanent job all over the country for the length of our relationship.  I always gave her honest advice about her job search, but I also told her I hoped she would find a job in the area.  It looks like she's going to take a job offer here, at least partly influenced by the fact that I'm here, so I have every reason to believe she thinks the relationship is serious.  She just doesn't respect my time or the way she makes me feel, and I don't know how to talk to her about this without it blowing up in my face.

That's where we stand now.  For the first two months she was the girl of my dreams, but the last two weeks have been a bit of a nightmare.  I even tried to break it off, but at first she ignored my attempt to break it off, and then she started telling me how wrong it was for me to even consider it.

Any suggestions?"
f9mdp,16,2011-01-26,"My sad story, ending in a query",terranphilosopher,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/f9mdp/my_sad_story_ending_in_a_query/,"**The Sad Story:**

In 2006, I lost my job (environmental scientist) due to drug testing (positive for THC metabolites).  I stayed at [0] for ~4 weeks, but I still produced a (barely-)positive result.  In previous cases, this was enough time, but I had put on a few (~15?) pounds, and my fat cells betrayed me.  

I'll add here that I have chronic pain from a ruptured lumbar disc.  I was on prescription meds (Bextra) for it, but then those meds were removed from the market (~2004?) when some troubling side effects came to light.  It turned out that incidence rate of some side effects (damaging heart valves, causing heart attacks &amp; strokes) was covered up/fudged by the manufacturer.  This experience caused me to lose trust in the medical/pharma industry, so from that point on I self-medicated with cannabis, and it worked like a charm.  I did not get a MMJ card, though I understand that my medical condition *may* now qualify me for it.  Now (Jan 2011), I have been without health insurance for ~4 years and have no money for a doctor's visit/MMJ card, so I guess that will have to wait.

I will (try to) refrain from ranting about the injustice of it all - how I was hurting no one, would never mix it with work, gained medical benefit from it, etc...

While working, I was good about saving money, so I had a substantial emergency fund piled up.  For some time (~2 years), I tried unsuccessfully to get another job in the field (environmental science/engineering/consulting), but getting fired for failing to comply with my previous employer's drug policy destroyed my ability to get another job in the field.

I will add here that this is the only job from which I have ever been fired.  Also, before this, I had never failed to get a job for which I interviewed.  Legally, I have never had so much as a speeding (or parking) ticket.

I enjoy life, and don't get too worried about material things (especially money), as long as I have enough to get by.  When I am old and gray, I want to look back and know that I lived my life on my own terms, and that I had as much fun as possible all the way through.  After much contemplation, I realize that I don't want to 'lie' any more - I will no longer seek work in pot-unfriendly fields.  I'll move to Montana and grow dental floss bushes if it comes to that.

Sadly, this country has gone through a bit of a drug-testing revolution/craze in the last 10 years.  An amazing (depressing) proportion of jobs now requires passing a pre-employment drug screen.  My new stance is going to severely limit my job options.

Luckily, I loved the T.A. work I did in grad school (Geology), so I decided to use my scientific knowledge and industry experience for the most honorable job on the planet - teaching.  I have always had it in mind that I might like teaching as a career, and now I had a reason to make the move.  Fast-forward 2 years.  I have recently (August 2010) completed my second Master's degree, this time in Teaching.  My student-teaching internship and WA teaching certification were completed in June &amp; July 2010, respectively. 

I am now looking for work as a teacher in WA state.  In the meantime, I am growing desperate for income to live on.

**The query:**

Does anyone in WA have work for an intelligent, hard-working ent with a couple of Master's degrees?  At this point I am looking for *anything* to live on while I try to find work teaching science.  Pride was left behind many moons ago - **any/all** offers will be considered.  AMA - I may reply in private message depending on the question.

edit: I live in the Seattle area

**TL;DR:**

* Failed drug test, lost job &amp; career, ruined life for 4 years (&amp; counting).  Do not emulate.

* AMA

* Got work?"

I recently had my first ""for-reals!"" girlfriend because I'm socially awkward around women. I can make friends or smalltalk, but moving past that is a mystery for me. Anyways, I was pursued for a little while by a friend of a friend, not knowing what to do or how to proceed until she basically took the reins and I went along. We were together for two months and spent a lot of time together, sleeping in the same bed more often than not, etc. I really enjoyed the intimacy and was having the time of my life. I felt like it could really go somewhere. Then she ended it, citing that she felt things were getting too serious and that she didn't want to do anything long distance if she got an internship outside of the state over the summer. I respected her decision and have stayed away from her. Our mutual friend has regular Wednesday night parties and I went last night, knowing that she'd be there, but thinking that I could handle it.

I couldn't.

She got there and I became completely introverted and couldn't look anyone in the face. We played a drinking game and she sat two chairs away from me. It killed me. I had to go to the bathroom twice to collect myself. It really destroyed me. Over the Christmas break I thought that I was doing okay, with just the regular amount of being sad, but seeing her again just ripped me to shreds. I feel that the only way to keep a healthy outlook is to avoid her and avoid putting myself into these situations, but that means that I'm leaving a lot of mutual friends behind.

What do I do? Has anyone resolved a conflict like this? Has anyone been in a position where things just went poorly and there was no resolution?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everybody. I think I just found my spine. Thanks especially to Raider_Grrrl for being blunt. I'm gonna go there next Wednesday and make a terrible fool of myself, just like I used to before we got together. :) And thinking back on the whole issue, I may drink less or just abstain. I don't drink heavily and I don't drink often, so I may have been a little depressed from the alcohol."

**edit**  Previous work experience includes two summer (4 month) internships. 

The first was with a custom machine builder for the converting industry. It involved a lot of design work of machines used in manufacturing lines.  Also included some hands on work (welding, machining, assembly etc)

Second internship was with a contract manufacturing company.  I held many responsibilities but my job could probably have been described as a project management roll.  At different times I handled everything from cost estimation on new quotes, to quality checks on existing contracts.  I helped develop the companies ISO 9001 QMS and did a fair amount of design work on various projects.

faixc,12,2011-01-27,Finances say the gym is no longer an option. Apartment workout hints/tips?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/faixc/finances_say_the_gym_is_no_longer_an_option/,"So this is my second thread in as many days (thanks to those who gave me food advice). I'm serious about trying to get my sorry ass in shape, but have come to realize today that between being unemployed for several months, plus with what is effectively and unpaid internship for the next several months, I will no longer be able to afford a gym membership. There is a decent chance I will be unemployed beyond the internship, so maintaining my gym membership simply may not be a viable option. To be honest, it's been stretching my finances already since it was a join-and-forget-about-it thing from awhile back. Additionally, the job will require me to put in work from home, so I can't really afford the 20-minute-each-way commute to a serviceable gym in terms of time.

I'm looking to maintain a workout, but have the unfortunate problem of living in a second-floor apartment. I do not have space for a squat rack or anything in the apartment, though I DO have a basement storage-room that I may be able to clean up enough to be a workout space.

Effectively, what I'm asking is: What is there that a broke-ass grad student can do at home to get a decent workout in? I can afford to spend $100-150, on some equipment. I have a couple of adjustable-weight dumbbells, and that's about it. 

I have read about the ""convict workout"", but that and anything that involves jumping/quick position changes would probably piss off my downstairs neighbors pretty quickly. There is also not much room for swinging around a bar for squats... so, I'm in a tough position.

I really want to work out/be able to work out. I live in a safe enough neighborhood that I COULD go out for a run, though the sidewalks are pretty fucked up (hello, winter), and accept that I'll look like a giant dork since I run funny. Biking outside isn't an option because the streets have narrowed dangerously this winter due to the massive amount of snow we have.


TL;DR: Gym membership no longer an option, live in a 2nd floor apartment with no extra space (storage room in basement). Budget $150. What can I do to work out at home without pissing off my neighbors?

While I was there my co-worker told me the BEST story I think I've ever heard. I'm a little drunk so I'll try to retell it as best as possible:

So, my co-worker knows someone that used to live with a bunch of people who owned this place in Arlington, VA [I won't say how he knows the guy for privacy reasons]. The house they lived in had a reasonably large front yard. They hated mowing the lawn so in an attempt to do away with this chore they decided to buy two goats to eat the grass on the lawn (side story: the goats ended up eating everything else except the grass. i.e. flowers, plants, bushes etc.). They kept the goats as pets anyway.

One of the housemates had been dating this girl for almost 10 years. They were madly in love and he finally popped the question. She said yes, and they were engaged. They settled on a house and paid for it but they were waiting to move in until after the wedding. The wedding was in California (home of the bride) and they flew out there one weekend to make the proper preparations. 

On one of their last errands they were picking out flowers and apparently the guy just had a melt down. He got freaked out by the wedding, cold feet, whatever you want to call it. He leaves his fiance standing there in the flower shop. For some reason he decides to go back to Virginia. Instead of flying, he rents a car and decides to cross-country it all the way home. On the way he stops in Las Vegas. He proceeds to blow everything he's worth on gambling, drugs, and hookers over the course of 5 days. 

Defeated and broke he decides to go home. He jumps in his car and starts heading home. On his way out of town he stops at one last strip club and meets a Filipino stripper/hooker. They spent the next couple nights together and he decides that he's in love with her. The ""picture-perfect couple"" starts driving back together and somehow decide to get married. So the guy calls up his buddies back home and has them arrange a wedding in their back yard. Left up to a few 20-something bros, these guys throw together the most ridiculous wedding ever. Provisions included chicken wings and two kegs of beer. 

The couple gets back and they have the marriage. The person that marries them is one of his buddies who spent a day getting an online certification for legal purposes. The wedding comprises of no family, only friends, and the person that walks the bride down the aisle is the dad of one of the housemates (apparently just because he's an old guy and it looks better to have an old guy walk the bride then some young bro). And here's the kicker, the ring-bearer was......wait for it.......one the two goats. I shit you not. They tied the rings to the goat's beard and led it down the fucking aisle. All the while this guy is lighting off fireworks in the background. 

But it's not done....

The house that the guy and the previous fiance had purchased before the break-up was still an issue. They had bought it together equally and neither of them would give it up. So the THREE of them ended up living in the same house for a while. Apparently the guy would intentionally leave the door open whilst banging his filipino-hooker-wife just so his ex would feel more incentive to move out. 

TL;DR - a guy dumps his fiance of whom he dated for nearly 10 years, looses all his money in Vegas, meets a filipino hooker and marries her with his pet goat as the ring bearer in just over 2 weeks.

I know what you're thinking. *Sounds Fake*. I didn't believe it either until my coworker whooped out his phone and pulled up the video of the wedding: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQVWHsIqlOc&amp;feature=player_embedded

THE END

p.s. Don't really know what happened after that. 
p.p.s. They eventually had to get rid of the goats due to some statute in Arlington banning livestock. "

Recently depression and loneliness has completely taken over my life.  For over two weeks I have barely left my apartment.  I'm a student and intern and I just didn't go to work or class and got fired from my government job.  I'm not even mad I feel relief.  I'm educated (in my last semester of grad school) but I don't care at all about finding a secure job.  The fact that my birthday was in that time made things even worse.  I really need support but I don't want to tell my family and I don't think I can change on my own. 

I'm not suicidal, I believe there are so many beautiful things in the world but I feel oppressed by groups of people in general.  I need help finding a reason to get through the day.  I can't see myself changing as long as I don't want to get out of bed in the morning.  I think I could be strong for others but not myself.  I'm in Washington DC I could really use some advice.  It would really help to have a friend listen in person.  "
fbotw,2,2011-01-30,At what point do I give up?,Oderint,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fbotw/at_what_point_do_i_give_up/,"I'll try and keep this brief with short, to-the-point statements.

1. Met a girl sophomore year of college. Started dating. Fell in love.
2. She went away for an internship. Broke up with me while there. There wasn't another guy, she just thought we weren't meant to be.
3. She comes back my junior year. I'm not over her. We talk. Eventually get back together. Relationship is ten times better this time around.
4. She goes off to another internship somewhere else. Comes back and breaks up with me. Break up is 100x worse than first time.
5. This time is so much worse than the first time. But we talk about it again and find out what we did wrong. Problem is she's about to go out of the country for six months so it doesn't make sense to get back together.
6. First few months she's there we talk like young honeymooners. Since Thanksgiving she's gotten cold.

Basically I love this girl. She's someone I can see myself marrying. We've been talking and it seems to me that she has forgotten what we talked about before she left the country. When we were together she would never tell me any problems she had with the relationship, then those problems would build, overwhelm her, and she'd break up with, all the while I thought everything was peachy because I can't read minds. Before she left she told me that she wanted to try again when she got back.  But as time goes on she gets colder.  I don't want to let her go, but something tells me I'm fighting a losing battle. I haven't given up because every time she's come back from being away we hit it off again and everything's great. I'm convinced she's just misinterpreting her feelings, but I don't know if that's the case, and if it is, I don't know how to explain that to her.

I've been honest with her. It sucks too because she doesn't get a lot of internet access over there and she works so much which makes calling hard to do sometimes too. I think that this lack of contact is making matters worse.

Is there some point I give up and stop trying to keep this girl? I'm not in any way confining her or asking her to do anything she doesn't want to do, but we've both said how happy we make the other person and I think it's fucking stupid that she is falling for the same mind-trap she fell for twice before.

Edit 2: Two more comments: 

1. We dated eight months the first time, five months the second time.
2. Even though we're both ""single"" while she's out of the country. On October 19th, which would have been our anniversary had we stayed together she wrote me (paraphrasing): *Happy Anniversary!! Can I still say that? If so then happy anniversary!! :) :)*

ALSO ON A SIDE NOTE: Is it normal for a person's feeling of love to fade a bit while separated from the person they love? I think it's the honeymoon effect which naturally dissolves into the next stage (whatever they call it). Where the hot fires of new romance fade a bit. I've also felt she takes this natural course of relationships to mean that we weren't right for each other.

Edit: 
tl;dr: Should you ever give up on a girl you truly love?
So much for keeping it brief.

Edit #3, UPDATE: I had sent her a letter trying to fix things, then after posting this and getting your responses, thinking about it and talking to some friends of mine, I decided to take all of your advice. I sent her a letter explaining that, while I still stand by what I said, I was throwing in the towel.  I told her I'm tired of making it a priority when she obviously isn't and how I realized that in this point in her life she doesn't want a relationship (via information I didn't give in my OP).  I got a call from her (missed it because of practice). In her voicemail she sounded...stoic. She wasn't sad, but she wasn't happy. I can only describe it as she was relieved I came to this realization, even though the whole thing didn't make her happy either.  I'll be keeping a small hope that in a few years when she's a bit more settled and myself as well, maybe something can happen, but as of right now I'm not going to worry about it.

Thanks for all your help Reddit."
