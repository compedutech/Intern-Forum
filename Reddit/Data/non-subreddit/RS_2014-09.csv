2f4m62,5,2014-08-31,Should I go back to school?,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2f4m62/should_i_go_back_to_school/,"Graduated with a math degree in 2013 from a Big Ten school, 2.86 GPA, I switched between majors up until my junior year so I didn't think about internships or really even look for them. I passed Exam P in January of this year, sitting for FM in October.


In the past year, my old uni just created an actuarial science major/program. Would there be any use in going back and getting a second degree with a potentially higher GPA? Right now I'm just considering working part time until I pass 1-2 more tests and teach myself Excel, VBA, and SQL. Thanks in advance."

I had many favorite series growing up and one of them was the batman animated series, but as I was in collage when the first episode aired I knew where to go in my career in animation. Thankfully at the end of my final year I had sent out a resume to warner brother’s entertainment and requested to be placed on the team that worked on the batman animated series, since there was an temporary opening in the animation touch up crew because a couple of the crew members were on leave for some personal emergencies. Now during the my time working there our office had gotten word that views began to lower once robin was placed in the cartoon and the network heads were getting worried that the show was going to fail, so warner brothers had us create a limited time running add asking the kids to vote whether or not to keep robin in the series, and a special episode that either had robin in it or wasn’t in it and the episode would be determined by the winning vote. When the voting was over the was a mass memo sent out that robin would be removed from the series and that it need to be Christmas related since the voting ended close to the holiday season. When the episode came into our office the crew and I had to proof watch the episode to see what need to be touched up and corrected for the final edit of the episode. When the crew and I sat all around the TV screen to watch the episode like we did for all of them this one didn’t have the beginning part of the show which I thought was odd all you could see was a black and a strange noise coming from the speakers which sounded like a moan covered in static then the title of the episode faded in with just the word “vote” on the screen then the episode began, it started off with robin and batman waking up in a cave with snow on the ground and they’re both hanging from their arms by ice which made me believe that they would be fighting Mr. Freeze in the episode and then we heard the same moaning sound off screen but it was much clearer now and had a gargling sound that made it sound like he was choking on water or blood, which the camera was turning too and what was making that sound came from what nightmare are made of. A sick looking half beetle half man with a pale white face dark whittles eyes and that you could only see the light shine on his pupils was just standing there looking at the heroes and quickly cut to a hyper realistic close up of his face just turning his eyes toward the camera and making that gargling moan never blinking and never taking his gaze off the viewer. It made me and some of the others a bit uncomfortable since this was a totally new villain that none of us had seen before, it then cut to the creature limping towards batman and robin, thinking the two would just break free with one of their gadgets before the creature reached them, we were all surprised that the two caped crusaders just hung there and began to scram  in terror the audio of the screams weren’t even of the voice actors like it was ripped out of a snuff film they sounded like they were being  murdered before this thing of a man was ever even close to them which made one of the female crew members leave the room. The screams became more of a whimper now and the beetle man turned to robin and broke him out of his icy shackles now screaming again the beetle man’s gargling moan turned more high pitched as his mouth rejected a pair of pinchers and dove them right into the top of robins head, the sounds of skull crunching and flesh-eating made most of the crew puke in disgust but I fought the urge, wanting the sadistic scene to end. The camera cuts to another detailed close up of robin and the creature now staring back at us while he empties the rest of the contents of robins skull, I finally couldn’t take any more of the gruesome footage and dove for the nearest trash can to puke out what I had for lunch that afternoon. Retuning to my seat it now showed a still shot of batman in horror a and a reflection of the beetle creature racing towards him, it’s shadow makes the screen go black as we hear yet again the mysterious scream from batman and then cuts to Bruce Wayne waking up in his bed soaked in sweat shrugging off the dream like nothing. The whole room took a sigh of relief as if the horrible part was over, the camera cuts to the bat cave with Alfred waiting for batman to suit up and then we see batman enter the shot, one of his hands over his head like he has a headache, it then shows a close up of Alfred asking if batman was alright but it was hard the focus on him because a faded reflection of robin was shown on the bat computer with robin fixated on the viewers with hollow black eyes and red pupils, he was only there for a few frames but it put a unnerving feeling  in all of us. The show continues like a normal episode with batman tracking a lead of some weapon smugglers in Gotham which leads batman to an abandon where house covered in snow the shot lingered on the building for a while like you were so post see something while this eerie silence went on in the background and a quiet sound of broken breathing over powered the video. I couldn’t make anything out until one of the guys stopped the tape and rewound it back, and pointed out in one of the warehouse’s windows the silhouette of robin and those creepy red pupils staring into the camera and at whoever is watching. Now that I saw the silhouette staring at me the silence and raspy breathing made the long drawn out shot seem like forever. It then cut to black with a door opening to cut out the darkness with a silhouette of batman entering the room and flicking the light switch on to show an empty room then suddenly it cuts black and a close up shot of robin appears with the same screaming he displayed in nightmare, his eyes are hollow again with blood red pupils and an open gaping mouth with no lips that didn’t move or animate just a still image of this horrible looking robin screaming that has haunted my dreams for almost 22 years now. The screaming slowed down to a moan that sounded far too familiar as it sounded exactly like the moaning from the beetle man. The shot had been going on for a good three minutes and the moan had stopped when it cut back to the cave that batman and robin were hanging in at the beginning, but when it was at the shot with batman and robin waking up to the moaning it was replaced with the jokers laugh and it was only batman hanging by his arms. We were expecting to see the beetle man at the end of the panning shot but it was the horrible looking robin standing there laughing like the joker, by this time half of the team had left the room and contacted the head animation department to see what the hell they were think with this episode so when one of the lead animators entered the room (his name slips my mind at the time I’m writing this article) to see a demonic looking robin on the screen the only thing to leave his mouth was “that’s not the episode ” we all turned back to the screen and the joker laugh ended and the screaming from before returned except this time it was more of a background noise when the voice of a young man spoke “catch me if you can” and the episode ended. After all we watched we demanded an explanation from the animator which he then shaded some light on the situation he told us that a prior intern had caused a delay on one of the previous episodes because when he pitched an idea for a new villain for batman to fight and was rejected he lashed out at the studio by replacing all the jokers animations with this grotesque looking beetle creature he called the pinch and assaulted a security guard of the building by stabbing him in the cheek with a letter opener ,a few months after the intern was fired the guard he stabbed went missing along with his partner who were both working the night shift the night they disappeared and were found dead a week after with their lips cut off and eyes cut out. To this day they haven’t been able to find the intern who killed those two men, and after viewing the lost episode we released the Christmas episode titled “Christmas with the joker” as a dark homage of an insane man with a twisted sense of humor.

2f4uq0,2,2014-08-31,I broke up with my girlfriend of three years today and there's a lot of stuff on my mind,starmiemd,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2f4uq0/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_three_years/,"We just talked for like twenty minutes and I told her how I felt- that I never felt like she cared about me and our relationship hasn't had any passion or intimacy and she's generally just been a bad friend who doesn't ever make time for me. She used to lie to me a lot which led to me being very paranoid about just talking to people in general and although she hasn't lied to me (as far as i know) in the past 6-ish months I still have the idea in the back of my head whenever we talk. We've pretty much literally been texting each other non-stop for three consecutive years. I think the longest we've gone without talking to each other has been no more than 24 hours. We started dating at the beginning of my junior year of high school so our last year together was long distance because we got into different colleges on opposite ends of the state. I don't really know what to do right now because she's all I can think about and she's all I've really had for the past couple years. Actually the reason I made this reddit account in the first place was to post in /r/longdistance to get advice for our relationship. 

Its been a year of college and I haven't really made any friends yet. I spent the majority of my first year just sitting in my room watching tv, eating, studying, sleeping, or playing computer games and otherwise wasting my time because I was never happy. Classes start for my second year in about a month and I've been very stressed out for the past four months because there was a complication with my housing application so I was unable to get on-campus housing for my second year, forcing me to find a place to live off-campus. The stress of finding a new place to live without my very few friends pretty much ruined any enjoyment I could've had so far this summer so I've been pretty miserable lately. I finally secured an apartment a week or so ago but I never got the relief I thought I would. I still feel as depressed as I have been feeling for months.

Pretty much everyone I know (parents, sister, acquaintances) call me sensitive and self-conscious and I don't really know what to think about it- I always feel like its some sort of insult and I should feel bad about myself even though I agree with them. It's kinda obvious to me that my (ex)-girlfriend hasn't really been finding me sexually attractive lately because our sex life has basically been nonexistent for months now. I've always found her extremely attractive and she claims she thinks the same of me but I don't see it. I don't really have much of an opinion of myself, I mean I'm like 5'10 and I weigh about 130 pounds so yeah I guess I'm a bit skinny but that doesn't really matter to me much and I think I have an average face but whatever. People either make fun of me for being skinny or tell me to go work out but I can never motivate myself to do anything it for some reason.

I pretty much think about suicide every day. I've been doing so for months, maybe years even, but the frequency a while ago is nowhere near the frequency now. I catch myself with suicidal thoughts every hour, every other hour, just generally pretty often. I don't have any motivation or drive to accomplish anything in my life anymore. I get jealous of everyone I know who are participating in internships, getting jobs, and getting good grades in classes they need for their major, and meanwhile I don't even have any sort of direction in my life. In high school I always told myself I would be a doctor but in retrospect I don't think I ever actually wanted to; it was probably me just saying something because everyone was saying something. I go to a well-known state university with a relatively high reputation but I'm not happy there at all. I've considered changing my major to computer science or something because I feel like I'm pretty good with computers, and I took a programming class this summer (basically the only useful thing I did the whole time) and it was okay I suppose. Nothing great but I didn't hate it or anything like that.

I got my wisdom teeth extracted last tuesday. I was basically drooling blood into toilet paper for the first 12 hours and after that I haven't really been able to eat anything besides smoothies, milkshakes, tomato soup, and yogurt and I've spent the last couple of days just sitting on my couch playing video games and trying to get my mind off the soreness in my jaw. I wanted my girlfriend to be there for me but she spends all day at her internship and she can't visit me in the evenings because her parents hate me and won't let her. I don't have anyone else to ask to spend time with me because the few high school friends I still have who live around me have went back to school either for summer sessions or for the start of their second years, since some of them are on the semester system. I've probably never felt so lonely and pathetic in my life. Today I really wanted to see her but she went to the gym and took a nap instead of making time to hang out with me and I guess it was the last straw for me or something because I was like fuck it and asked her to just drive over to my place for 15 minutes so we could just end it properly I guess. I've been craving tacos but I can't eat tacos. It sucks.

I don't know what to do about anything. I sincerely honestly want to kill myself. I can't seem to find any sort of solution to all the problems I feel like I have and I can't actually do the one thing I want to because for whatever reason I'm too scared to. And the only person I've ever talked to about my suicidal thoughts is her, and all she's always told me is that I should give it time because it will get better (been hearing that for a year now, it gets old haha) and that to think of how my family will feel if they find out I took my own life. I know they'll be upset. But I don't know why I have to care so much about it. I mean why am I the selfish one for killing myself, if obviously the person most affected by it is going to be me.

I'm sorry about this rant. I've been subscribed to the sub for a while now and I've always felt like I should post in it but I haven't been able to put any of my thoughts into words, and I still don't think I can, so sorry about how crappy my writing is. I'm just not good at talking about my feelings. But if you actually read this whole thing then thank you. I might be adding stuff to it if I can coherently write about any of it.

2f53uh,3,2014-09-01,Applying for grad school. I'm very nervous about taking the GRE,elmcityslim,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/2f53uh/applying_for_grad_school_im_very_nervous_about/,"So here are my stats:

I have a 3.38 GPA, 3.87 gpa for chemistry (my major), A;s in diff equations and calc III, B+'s in Calc 1, 2, and linear algebra. A's in all the physics classes I took (college physics I, II, modern physics, quantum mechanics). I have a year long research project in computational chemistry that is part of a larger project at a major university and I spent the summer interning at Gaussian, Inc. Outside of school, I do volunteer work with a fire department (I hear volunteer work helps), I have kick-ass letters of recommendation from seasoned instructors, and I wrote a really good SOP. I even have a nice CV. I already have a BS in computer science (I'm 30 and went back to school at 26 for nursing - I ended up in chemistry).

I'm freaking out about the GRE (general, not subject). I barely had any time to study for it this summer and I'm taking some practice test and getting an average of 14/20 in the quantitative reasoning section and 11/20 in verbal (also known as vocabulary hell). Going back to school as an adult allowd me less time to concentrate on my studies (hence the 3.4 gpa - I devoted most of my study time to coursework related to my major and basically lagged in any humanities course). And, unfortunately, between my internship and a second job, GRE prep was minimal. How important is an above average GRE score for grad school anyway? I'm also only applying to one: Wesleyan University.

Edit: I was typing so fast that I forgot a few more details. I'm worried because I'm a terrible standardized test taker. I have horrible test anxiety to the point that my school's disability center considered in an excusable academic disability (although I never took advantage of any resources they offered me). That's why I am so nervous. I just don't want to bomb the math section because I am actually quite good at math. The program I am applying to is in computational chemistry.

Edit 2: for anyone curious. Verbal 153, Quant 159. I'm going to go home now and kill myself. "
2f5cmk,1,2014-09-01,[RF] The Candidate (any feedback would be wonderful!),[deleted],shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/2f5cmk/rf_the_candidate_any_feedback_would_be_wonderful/,"The Candidate
	“I accept your nomination for President of the United States.” 
	With those few words, the young, ambitious New York Senator accepted the nomination on the grand stage of the Democratic National Convention in front of a robust crowd of his peers and fans. The venue glimmered with blue confetti and ribbon after the Senator’s response. Fellow Democrats applauded, fans cheered, and the entire room erupted with excitement. The Republicans had held the Presidency for four years already, and the conglomerate of Democrats across the nation had set their sights on 2016. They saw opportunity for change and options for success. They saw a chance to welcome a new era in American history. Their hopes rested on the back of one man: Patrick Ipsum. 
	
	Patrick had always fostered an interest in politics. He liked the interaction, the pressure, the importance of the job. All through his years of schooling, Patrick could be seen at the head of student government. It was in these early years of adolescence that Patrick developed his genuine personality, charisma, and honest aura, three characteristics that now stood at the foundation of Patrick’s image. People described Patrick as a people person: someone everyone knew, someone everyone had talked to, someone everyone could relate to. 
	Patrick graduated from New York University at the top of his class, double majoring in Political Science and International Affairs. He spent summers interning at city halls, mayor’s offices, and even the Governor’s office. Friends and family often praised Patrick for his ambition, confidence, and eloquence. Patrick could look at someone and instantly connect with his or her situation. It did not matter if they were friends for a lifetime or strangers off the street. 
	His mother supported him all throughout his life, helping him draw election posters in middle school, listening to campaign speeches in high school, commenting on slogan ideas. His father, on the other hand, a stoic, reserved man, remained aloof for most of his son’s endeavors. It seemed as if nothing Patrick had accomplished pleased his father, and this hurt Patrick tremendously. 
	
	“Mr. Ipsum, the question now goes to you. What is your stance on gay marriage?” 
	Patrick stood up straight behind the mahogany podium that shielded his lower body from the audience. His hands rested gently upon the sides of the dark wood as if cushioned by the softest of pillows. Not a blemish could be seen on his face and not a wrinkle could be spotted on his fine-pressed navy suit. The lights illuminated his soft face and the blue tie that sat with a perfect knot under his collar. 
	“I have said it before, and I will say it again. I believe that gay marriage should be legal in all of our glorious states. This is not a religious issue. This is an issue of equality. I would like to describe our nation as a place where all types of people can seek haven. No matter their sexuality. Gay or straight. If elected, I will continually support the passage of gay marriage laws until we reach a state of complete equality. Thank you.” 
	Patrick rested himself and looked to his opponent for a rebuttal. George Stultus, the hardcore conservative Senator of Alabama, stood at the other end of the stage behind a podium just like Patrick’s. His face showed the expression of an old, experienced man. A man who had spent a lifetime in politics, while Patrick had only begun his political career. 
	“This guy knows the game. He goes up there and makes me look like an inexperienced ass during the debate. He has been in politics for so long; he has an exact understanding of how to become President. Me, I’m some young Senator who decided to run and see what happens.” 
	“Listen to me, Patrick. I want you to shut the hell up for once second and take a deep breath. Why do you think I would sign on to run your campaign if I didn’t have a great deal of confidence in you? You need to stop this stuff right now and focus on the matter at hand. I don’t want to hear another word about this again. You understand me?” uttered Patrick’s campaign manager as he stormed of to attend to more pressing matters. 
		
	No one could ever prepare a presidential candidate for the rigorous campaign. Patrick began his campaign with rays of excitement, eagerness, and wonder. Traveling from town to town, city to city, state to state appealed to Patrick because it meant he could do what he did best: personal interaction. 
	“Why aren’t you that candidate for president? The Democratic one?” said an eager man standing above the table Patrick was seated at. 
	“Patrick Ipsum, pleased to meet you!” he said as he lifted the napkin from his lap and stood up to the great the fellow. “I am the man you are thinking of. I am trying to become the next president. You do have that right. Now, my friend, what is your name?”
	“Joe, sir. Joe Burns.”
	“Nice to meet you, Joe. What do you do for a living, Joe?”
	“Well,” after a long pause, “I’m actually unemployed for the moment. I was laid off about six months ago, and I haven’t been able to get back on my feet. This economy is just killing me right now.”
	“Joe, I am going to make you a promise. You elect me as president, and I will make it my duty to end this unemployment that continues to plague this glorious nation. I will put my word on that, my friend. You believe in me, and I pledge to make things better for you.” 
	“Mr. Ipsum,” taking a long gaze at the trusting eyes and genuine face that provided him with an unexpected warmth and connection, “I would just like to say thank you. You have my vote, for sure. Some of these big politicians in Washington don’t give a damn about the real Americans, but you seem different. God bless you.” 
	Even to the brightest of politicians, the campaign takes its toll and has different effects on everyone. The presidential race puts enormous stresses on the candidates and ultimately requires strength, resilience, and intelligence at all stages of the process. 
	“Are you kidding me? That is the second media attack this week. Why do they keep running these stories on us? God forbid, they run one harsh story on our opponent. I swear, I don’t think I’ve seen one negative story about that man. What, is he perfect? His campaign is flawless?”
	“Patrick, the media is one of the craziest things in America. They make up fat lies based on whispers of mendacity. If they hear even an iota of a somewhat juicy story, they will run it. I know it looks bad for us now, but you just have to wait. Stultus is going to be hit by some bad press soon, and you can mark my words on that. Nobody said this campaign would be easy, Patrick. I’ve run lots of campaigns, and one is more work than the last.”
	“It’s just so much damn stress. Everyday, I wake up and have to hope that the media isn’t against me. I have to hope that the public will still support me. I have to hope that nothing goes wrong. I don’t know if it is this media attack or the campaign in general, but I don’t feel too good about this whole thing anymore.”
	“Right now, I am going to talk to you as a friend, not as your official campaign manager. The only way for you to feel better and for the people to feel better about supporting you is to regain that sense of confidence that made you known. Get back the charm. Get back the old Patrick that everyone used to know and love. You do that, and I am willing to bet that you will have success in this race.”

	Patrick often remembered his father during the campaign. He remembered the blank face he’d always had when Patrick told him about his day at school. Patrick would tell his father about how he’d won the high school election, how he’d finally gotten that internship at the Governor’s office. Numerous achievements that all left his father apparently unchanged. 
	“Dad, I won the class election at school. You’re looking at the new Eleventh Grade Class President!” 
	“Oh, that’s great.”
	“It was a total landslide. The other candidate only got, like, twenty votes. I swept the entire election! I think it was my speech. I really tried to connect with the students. I think it worked. It might have been the awesome posters that Mom and I made.”
	“That’s great.”
	“Thanks,” Patrick said as he turned away from his father and made his way upstairs.
	The fact that his father never truly took pride in his son utterly tormented Patrick. This torment fermented into a deep, uninhibited drive for success in Patrick. Everything he had done, everything he would do was, in an effort to bring some sort of change to the blank, cold face of his father. 
	Patrick realized that his whole life had been an attempt to impress his father and finally gain his true pride. Patrick pushed himself to the limits with the hopes of attaining some sort of satisfaction. He desired a form of gratification; he wanted to hear an appreciation for all his hard work. Patrick Ipsum, a man who had already experienced a great amount of success in his life, could not accept the fact that his father never expressed pride for him. Patrick’s cold paternal relationship remained the sole problem in his life. To some extent, all that he had accomplished thus far, his stellar performance throughout school, his early success in the game of American politics, his chances of becoming the next United States’ President, did not mean anything to Patrick without a sense of love and pride.
	
	“My name is Patrick Ipsum. Believe in me. Believe in this nation. Vote Ipsum tomorrow!”
	Those words echoed over the loudspeaker at the high school stadium in Tampa Bay, Florida. Patrick stood upon the stage for what seemed like hours, smiling at the crowd of cheering supporters and waving feverishly at every single one. The effects of the campaign could be seen on Patrick as he stood on that stage. The youthful face that once glimmered with excitement was now speckled with blemishes and the occasional wrinkle. Patrick’s eyes did not show the expression of a hopeful, young Senator, but rather they depicted the expression of a man who had been changed. A man who had experienced firsthand the hardships and troubles with a political career. A young man who had come into this race with just too much on his plate. Patrick Ipsum represented a man who had tried to do everything but had not realized the difficulties of it all. 
	 Patrick dealt with the long nights, tiring commutes from state to state, and constant attention easily. The physical constraints of the campaign proved tough for the candidate, but rather the mental hardships of the campaign had broken down the once hopeful Senator. It was the doubt and the thought that all of the endless, stressful work could possibly amount to nothing that tormented Patrick. This factor, the unpredictability of the entire election, remained the only idea that infected Patrick’s brain and altered his mentality during the campaign. 
	
	The staff sat around the coffee table in Patrick Ipsum’s suite at the Hilton Hotel. Takeout food containers littered the floor, paper coffee cups spotted the tables and desks around the room, and individuals sat in chairs and on the floor. Faces were illuminated by the white glow of laptops and iPhones. The sound of vibrating phones and clattering keyboards buzzed around the room as members of the campaign calculated the probabilities and attempted to look up the current standings. The candidate, Patrick Ipsum, sat in an armchair, staring at the CNN broadcast on the television. Patrick looked at the screen with the blankest of expressions. 
	The race remained close for the entire night. Ipsum took the lead early, but then Stultus inched ahead. It went back and forth between the two hopeful candidates, but neither of the two achieved a substantial lead. The staff knew it would be a close one, but they had severely underestimated their opponent. Stultus took states that the staff had assured Ipsum he would sweep. Moods remained optimistic until Stultus took Florida. Once the state filled with red, the staff’s chat died to a silence. Everyone in the room knew how the night would turn out. 
	Patrick remained in his armchair for the remainder of the night. He remained in it when they announced Stultus’ victory. He remained in it when his staff began their work on a concession speech. He sat there, speechless with the same blank expression on his face. He reviewed the events of the last year of his life. He thought about the unthinkable amount of work he and his staff had put into this campaign for this, a loss. He was disappointed in himself. 
	A phone began vibrating on the coffee table. Once. Twice. Three times. Four. Patrick’s eyes jumped to the phone, realizing it was his own. He pulled himself up, slowly as if he were stuck to the chair. He read the name on the screen: Dad. His hand grasped the phone and pulled it close to his ear. 
	Patrick stared in disbelief at the phone for a second but then accepted the call. 
	“Son, It’s me, Dad. I know we haven’t talked in a while. I just wanted to call and let you know that I’m proud of you...” 
	The phone slowly slipped from Patrick’s grasp. As it fell to the floor, Patrick remained standing for a moment. He then returned to his relaxed position in the armchair. Patrick closed his eyes and smiled, wiping away the tears on his cheek. "

Patrick rested himself and looked to his opponent for a rebuttal. George Stultus, the hardcore conservative Senator of Alabama, stood at the other end of the stage behind a podium just like Patrick’s. His face showed the expression of an old, experienced man. A man who had spent a lifetime in politics, while Patrick had only begun his political career. 
	
“This guy knows the game. He goes up there and makes me look like an inexperienced ass during the debate. He has been in politics for so long; he has an exact understanding of how to become President. Me, I’m some young Senator who decided to run and see what happens.” 
	
“Listen to me, Patrick. I want you to shut the hell up for once second and take a deep breath. Why do you think I would sign on to run your campaign if I didn’t have a great deal of confidence in you? You need to stop this stuff right now and focus on the matter at hand. I don’t want to hear another word about this again. You understand me?” uttered Patrick’s campaign manager as he stormed of to attend to more pressing matters. 
	
No one could ever prepare a presidential candidate for the rigorous campaign. Patrick began his campaign with rays of excitement, eagerness, and wonder. Traveling from town to town, city to city, state to state appealed to Patrick because it meant he could do what he did best: personal interaction. 
	
“Why aren’t you that candidate for president? The Democratic one?” said an eager man standing above the table Patrick was seated at. 
	
“Patrick Ipsum, pleased to meet you!” he said as he lifted the napkin from his lap and stood up to the great the fellow. “I am the man you are thinking of. I am trying to become the next president. You do have that right. Now, my friend, what is your name?”
	
“Joe, sir. Joe Burns.”

“Nice to meet you, Joe. What do you do for a living, Joe?”

“Well,” after a long pause, “I’m actually unemployed for the moment. I was laid off about six months ago, and I haven’t been able to get back on my feet. This economy is just killing me right now.”
	
“Joe, I am going to make you a promise. You elect me as president, and I will make it my duty to end this unemployment that continues to plague this glorious nation. I will put my word on that, my friend. You believe in me, and I pledge to make things better for you.” 
	
“Mr. Ipsum,” taking a long gaze at the trusting eyes and genuine face that provided him with an unexpected warmth and connection, “I would just like to say thank you. You have my vote, for sure. Some of these big politicians in Washington don’t give a damn about the real Americans, but you seem different. God bless you.” 
	
Even to the brightest of politicians, the campaign takes its toll and has different effects on everyone. The presidential race puts enormous stresses on the candidates and ultimately requires strength, resilience, and intelligence at all stages of the process. 
	
“Are you kidding me? That is the second media attack this week. Why do they keep running these stories on us? God forbid, they run one harsh story on our opponent. I swear, I don’t think I’ve seen one negative story about that man. What, is he perfect? His campaign is flawless?”
	
“Patrick, the media is one of the craziest things in America. They make up fat lies based on whispers of mendacity. If they hear even an iota of a somewhat juicy story, they will run it. I know it looks bad for us now, but you just have to wait. Stultus is going to be hit by some bad press soon, and you can mark my words on that. Nobody said this campaign would be easy, Patrick. I’ve run lots of campaigns, and one is more work than the last.”
	
“It’s just so much damn stress. Everyday, I wake up and have to hope that the media isn’t against me. I have to hope that the public will still support me. I have to hope that nothing goes wrong. I don’t know if it is this media attack or the campaign in general, but I don’t feel too good about this whole thing anymore.”
	
“Right now, I am going to talk to you as a friend, not as your official campaign manager. The only way for you to feel better and for the people to feel better about supporting you is to regain that sense of confidence that made you known. Get back the charm. Get back the old Patrick that everyone used to know and love. You do that, and I am willing to bet that you will have success in this race.”
Patrick often remembered his father during the campaign. He remembered the blank face he’d always had when Patrick told him about his day at school. Patrick would tell his father about how he’d won the high school election, how he’d finally gotten that internship at the Governor’s office. Numerous achievements that all left his father apparently unchanged. 
	
“Dad, I won the class election at school. You’re looking at the new Eleventh Grade Class President!” 
	
“Oh, that’s great.”
	
“It was a total landslide. The other candidate only got, like, twenty votes. I swept the entire election! I think it was my speech. I really tried to connect with the students. I think it worked. It might have been the awesome posters that Mom and I made.”
	
“That’s great.”
	
“Thanks,” Patrick said as he turned away from his father and made his way upstairs.
	
The fact that his father never truly took pride in his son utterly tormented Patrick. This torment fermented into a deep, uninhibited drive for success in Patrick. Everything he had done, everything he would do was, in an effort to bring some sort of change to the blank, cold face of his father. 
	
Patrick realized that his whole life had been an attempt to impress his father and finally gain his true pride. Patrick pushed himself to the limits with the hopes of attaining some sort of satisfaction. He desired a form of gratification; he wanted to hear an appreciation for all his hard work. Patrick Ipsum, a man who had already experienced a great amount of success in his life, could not accept the fact that his father never expressed pride for him. Patrick’s cold paternal relationship remained the sole problem in his life. To some extent, all that he had accomplished thus far, his stellar performance throughout school, his early success in the game of American politics, his chances of becoming the next United States’ President, did not mean anything to Patrick without a sense of love and pride.
	
“My name is Patrick Ipsum. Believe in me. Believe in this nation. Vote Ipsum tomorrow!”
	
Those words echoed over the loudspeaker at the high school stadium in Tampa Bay, Florida. Patrick stood upon the stage for what seemed like hours, smiling at the crowd of cheering supporters and waving feverishly at every single one. The effects of the campaign could be seen on Patrick as he stood on that stage. The youthful face that once glimmered with excitement was now speckled with blemishes and the occasional wrinkle. Patrick’s eyes did not show the expression of a hopeful, young Senator, but rather they depicted the expression of a man who had been changed. A man who had experienced firsthand the hardships and troubles with a political career. A young man who had come into this race with just too much on his plate. Patrick Ipsum represented a man who had tried to do everything but had not realized the difficulties of it all. 
	
 Patrick dealt with the long nights, tiring commutes from state to state, and constant attention easily. The physical constraints of the campaign proved tough for the candidate, but rather the mental hardships of the campaign had broken down the once hopeful Senator. It was the doubt and the thought that all of the endless, stressful work could possibly amount to nothing that tormented Patrick. This factor, the unpredictability of the entire election, remained the only idea that infected Patrick’s brain and altered his mentality during the campaign. 
	
The staff sat around the coffee table in Patrick Ipsum’s suite at the Hilton Hotel. Takeout food containers littered the floor, paper coffee cups spotted the tables and desks around the room, and individuals sat in chairs and on the floor. Faces were illuminated by the white glow of laptops and iPhones. The sound of vibrating phones and clattering keyboards buzzed around the room as members of the campaign calculated the probabilities and attempted to look up the current standings. The candidate, Patrick Ipsum, sat in an armchair, staring at the CNN broadcast on the television. Patrick looked at the screen with the blankest of expressions. 
	
The race remained close for the entire night. Ipsum took the lead early, but then Stultus inched ahead. It went back and forth between the two hopeful candidates, but neither of the two achieved a substantial lead. The staff knew it would be a close one, but they had severely underestimated their opponent. Stultus took states that the staff had assured Ipsum he would sweep. Moods remained optimistic until Stultus took Florida. Once the state filled with red, the staff’s chat died to a silence. Everyone in the room knew how the night would turn out. 
	
Patrick remained in his armchair for the remainder of the night. He remained in it when they announced Stultus’ victory. He remained in it when his staff began their work on a concession speech. He sat there, speechless with the same blank expression on his face. He reviewed the events of the last year of his life. He thought about the unthinkable amount of work he and his staff had put into this campaign for this, a loss. He was disappointed in himself. 
	
A phone began vibrating on the coffee table. Once. Twice. Three times. Four. Patrick’s eyes jumped to the phone, realizing it was his own. He pulled himself up, slowly as if he were stuck to the chair. He read the name on the screen: Dad. His hand grasped the phone and pulled it close to his ear. 
	
Patrick stared in disbelief at the phone for a second but then accepted the call. 
	
“Son, It’s me, Dad. I know we haven’t talked in a while. I just wanted to call and let you know that I’m proud of you...” 
	
The phone slowly slipped from Patrick’s grasp. As it fell to the floor, Patrick remained standing for a moment. He then returned to his relaxed position in the armchair. Patrick closed his eyes and smiled, wiping away the tears on his cheek. "

Now before I go own a little back story as to my title...

&gt;   ""So I am the youngest of 4 boys. My mom was a widowed woman for since that happened and money was tight to say the least. I would only buy (and when I mean I, I mean my mom) clothing for school and shoes for school. Simple right? Ehh... I'm out of school now. For about year now. I've been living off of the same clothes that has been brought down by my brothers. I've been wearing the same slacks since high school (now they broke and I out grew them). I landed a job as an intern for a company that I'm working with closely now and they've asked me to dress more professionally because I'm really young and I teach other ""young"" students about computers, but that's besides the point. Today I went out and bought what I could. Two slacks and a belt. I plan to use that with my polos that have been ""donated"" by my boss. My budget is pretty small.""

  Now where is my question in all this? I need some advice on buying clothing for myself. 

*   **Budget** ($150 for now...as more money will be coming soon)


*   Geographic area (Is United States a geographic area?)


*   **Age** (18)

*   **Body type** (38x32 5'11 a little overweight but not too much)

*   **Personal style** (I love cargo pants... for like when I'm on my own type of thing, For work/teaching I was thinking something like business casual) 

Really what I need is some advice on buying at certain stores, what brands I should look out for, whats worth the premium price since I have never gone out to shop by my self. If there are some links you can give me that'd be great. 

Again sorry if this post can be answered just by reading the links I am just really looking for some advice from other people if they're on a tiny budget and how they get decent clothing for cheap and how to build a wardrobe. 

  *tl;dr - I haven't bought clothes for myself (like ever) and need some advice on building a wardrobe...*"
2f5fm8,1,2014-09-01,HTNGAF about feeling like I didn't take advantage of my college years?,[deleted],howtonotgiveafuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/2f5fm8/htngaf_about_feeling_like_i_didnt_take_advantage/,"Hey all.

This is something that has bugged me for a long time and it took a while to build up the gusto to post, but here it goes.

I'm in my last semester of college. I've done well grade wise (honors most semesters), have had some good work internships, etc. etc., but that's really where the positives ended for me in college.


I spent the first 3 years high as a kite with the same group of friends I met during Freshman move in. They are good guys and we're still close, but now that I don't smoke (as much), I feel like I've just wasted so much of my college opportunity. I barely met anyone. I've only been to one party. Don't really have friends outside my tiny stoner friend group.

And they don't do anything. Just sit around playing video games all day. They're nearly as bad as me, socially speaking.



I have anxiety, and it's really difficult for me to be social and meet new people and not come off as weird. I've never had many friends as a result. I think when I discovered weed it kind of took over my life as a coping mechanism, and next thing I know 3 years are gone behind me, and I haven't progressed any as a person. I haven't done the things you do in college; I haven't hooked up with anyone, I haven't dated or partied, I haven't experienced clubs or new things.. Just basically go to class, get high all day, and sleep.


And now on the cusp of graduating, I am filled with near crippling feelings of shame and self loathing, and feeling like I didn't take advantage of all the great social things I could have experienced... Particularly when it comes to relationships/sex, everyone keeps saying ""it'll never be as easy as college""... and that scares me.



I'm just full of so much regret and anger at myself, yet at the same time I'm so socially un-developed I don't know where to begin. I have a hard time even just holding conversations with people I don't know extremely well. I'm not very fit or thin. I don't really have appearance going for me. I just always feel like a social outcast and don't know how to fix it. I want to have friends and girls interested in me. I want to be invited to things. I want to experience life.

2f5ium,1,2014-09-01,I live in an upper middle class family and I feel completely lost.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2f5ium/i_live_in_an_upper_middle_class_family_and_i_feel/,"Been feeling pretty...indifferent at the moment. Not really sure if people read these anymore but I was scrolling through my phone and couldn't find anyone to talk or relate to about this subject. Up to this point honestly I have had everything handed to me on a silver platter. I don't consider myself lazy, I have worked shitty jobs as a busboy and have done years of community service. But I do tend to take things for granted like an internship this summer at an ad agency that I had absolutely no business to be in except for family connections (no pun intended). I did fine, regardless of the fact that everyone there had fancy degrees and I am struggling through community college. I have never been a great student and I know and accept it. My whole life I have struggled to grasp the concept of public education. Learning things that have no relevance to myself and having to memorize terms and math equations. I consider myself street smart, I love politics and personally I think the world is extremely fucked right now and everyone is kind of ignoring it but that isn't the time for that debate. Why the hell do we not consider peace more, honestly we have our bureaucratic heads shoved so far up our asses that we are arguing over racial issues, gay rights, everything that we shouldn't.Why not for once can't we agree that we are fucked. Let people live their lives they want to live, pursue happiness, and yet everyone has their two cents of how we should live. Wake the fuck up America, shit has hit the fan. And there is no one else to blame. I mean for fucks sake, why can't we even see that ISIL is everyones common enemy. (Ok so maybe there was time for that debate). Anyway, all of my good friends growing up in life are all at great universities, partying and probably doing a lot of drugs. I don't have much against drugs myself I have definitely passed the joint enough times in my life to say being high is an experience unlike none other. But college is not for me, everyone in my family extended and what not has some sort of degree. At family events, like christmas and ect. Every conversation is so, where are you going to school and saying a community college just deflates them. LikeI'm a fuck up, or I have let my parents down. Honestly I have let my parents down and yet they still go to bat for me and love me. And I am so thankful for them and my family. But I am not happy, I love writing, mob movies, playing xbox, reading, art,outdoors and women.  I had the privilege to travel to Europe 2 summers ago, and I fell in love with Dublin, Ireland. My great grandfather immigrated from there and I just felt the magic, the vibe, and the happiness. I wan't to get out, to live, to love, and to figure out. And yet that all costs money that I am struggling to get. I started my own business and it has been nothing but a pain in the ass. I used to be so motivated, but got completely bogged down by the legal process and all that bullshit. That is off topic, but the life in front of me right now is, struggle through school, get a good job off family connections, get married work until I'm 60 and then look back and think why the fuck did I do that...every day. That may be a cynical and unappreciative view, but that is how I see it. I hate it, why am I so inclined to go to school and then sit in an office, I did that all summer and it would drive me insane. I don't care about money I really do not. All money is ""is an accepted means of currency"" at least that is what I have concluded from my economics class. Working is literally trading hours of your life for cotton and then trading that cotton which is considered of value by the number on it, and you trade that for things that make you happy for a short term. Happy to me is being in a beautiful place, with a cold beer, a nice cute girl, a cigar, a book, and not too many worries of what to do next. I believe I have been born in the wrong time period. That was the longest thing I have written on reddit, on this fake account that I have all my porn subreddits on. Anyway if you read this all the way through I would to hear your thoughts and honestly thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. It really means a lot and if you guys have things going on in your life feel free to message me if no one else will listen like what happened to me earlier it is a shitty feeling that I don't want anyone to feel. Peace and love!

2f5xto,1,2014-09-01,Organizing a JavaScript internship,0xF013,javascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/2f5xto/organizing_a_javascript_internship/,"ok, here is my problem: I have been tasked with organizing a 1-month JavaScript internship in order to get some new js (jQuery, angular.js) developers for the company as it is nearly impossible to hire adequate people in this city (everybody gets the hell out of this country as soon as they reach the mid/senior level). 


Basically the company is looking to invite people from 2nd-4th year of university, college or people with other programming languages experience. The goal is to help them learn/transition to front-end programming (at least jQuery, at best angular.js). 

The thing is: I am a bit lost and don't know where to start. It would be good if you guys have some docs/papers on organizing IT training/internships. 

For the moment I've come up with the following ""plan"": give them a medium-sized task with briefings each morning about what's going bad, what was done, what wasn't and also be available for them 2-3 hours a day in order to answer their questions / explain some principles / help with some hard to debug stuff.

As a task I've come up with the most encountered outsource example: managing an array of data. Basically I want them to use jQuery, jQueryUi, some templating engine (handlebars, mustache, whatever) in order to build a small app. The app will consist of:

-  a table (I was planning jqGrid for that but screw it, it's very unfriendly for novices) that displays the data, a column with edit/delete buttons.
- ""add new"" button that will trigger a dialog with a form for creating a new record
- ""edit"" will trigger the same dialog but already populated
- ""delete"" will trigger a confirmation dialog
- a summary that will display a sum of each records' money field (basically an aggregation so that they'll have to keep track of the create/update/delete events).

One column will be a date so that they will have to learn some time formatting. Data will be held in localStorage in order to avoid any server/api setup.


After they do this, I would like them to do the same thing using angular.js (this part might be hard so I don't even want them to actually finish it, just to see how far they will go).

I will also supply them with links to tutorials, docs and best practices.

What do you guys think of this plan? I have never done such things before so I welcome any piece of advice.

Recently and unfortunately, my grandfather passed away. What I did not know until now is that he had been saving money his whole life for me, in the sum of 335k. And I'm not exactly sure what to do with it. Let me describe my current financial situation:

I recently graduated from medical school, and am currently in my intern year as a resident physician making 58k a year. Because of a combination of working my ass off for every scholarship I possibly could, saving up money from jobs, and my parents picking up the extra slack, I have zero debt.

I absolutely do not need this inherited money, and can live very comfortably and happily for the rest of my life without it. I am a frugal person by nature, and my future financial prospects are very good. So what I want to do is save it, grow it, and hopefully someday hand it to my children/grandchildren like my grandfather did for me. The only way I could ever see myself spending it is if there is some sort of catastrophic emergency.

Up until now (well basically, for the last 3 months), my financial strategy has been to contribute my $5500 a year to a Roth IRA, and put anything else I could save into an investment portfolio (40 percent into a low risk retire-by-2050 portfolio (FFFHX), and 60 percent into FUSVX, the fidelity spartan 500). My hospital offers a 403b but they do not match at all and do not offer a Roth option, so I didn't think it was worth it (but please inform me if I am wrong here, I can always start contributing to it!).

Now, I have no idea what to do with this 335k. Should I just dump it into the investment portfolio I described above? Should I invest it some other way? Am I even investing my earned money the right way? Do I need to utilize the 403b? If anyone could provide me any assistance, I would tremendously appreciate it. If you want to provide advice but need more info on my financial situation, please ask and I will respond ASAP!"

This is my last semester. I am finishing with a degree in EE with a good GPA and two internships under my belt as well as plenty of projects and marketable skills that I am confident in.

Here are my options:

http://i.imgur.com/cnQdLUw.png


I've been approved for the loan, however there are many different options and I'm not sure which one I should pick. Obviously its tempting to go for the low interest variable rate loan with the deferred interest payments. But I don't know how variable rates work, or how much they can vary, what they're tied to, etc.

I was wondering if you guys could either recommend one, or point me in the right direction so that I can educate myself enough to make the proper decision.

Here are some definitions from their website:

*Interest Payment:* Make interest payments but defer payments on the principal amount while in school and during the 6 month separation period.

*Fixed Payment:* Make fixed payments of $25 each month while in school and during the 6 month separation period. Interest will be charged and unpaid interest will be added to your loan.

*Deferred Payment:* Make no payments while in school and during the 6 month separation period. Interest will be charged and added to your loan.

2f6eq5,1,2014-09-01,Which DAW best matches your production style? (Here is my opinion from testing a few of them!),[deleted],WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/2f6eq5/which_daw_best_matches_your_production_style_here/,"From testing out the best DAWs, this is what I've come up with. This is just an opinion, and not a completely expert opinion, so feel free to argue it or disprove it.

**FL studio** is the best for someone who plays their own music on a MIDI controller and programs drums in graph form or with a drumpad. The technology available for chopping up samples, syncing vocals, recording outside audio, playing with internal audio files... yes, it's all there, but other programs do it much better. FL studio's specialty is the quickness of the interface and the piano roll. I have never found another program with a Piano Roll as good or as easy to use as FL studio's. I also like how quickly you can call up plugins, and the simplicity of the left-side browser is perfect for me. I am a little biased because I've never been able to be seduced away from FL for more than a few months in the years I've been doing music production. You can throw together a radio quality hip-hop track in under an hour if you have an idea for one and know the interface. In a YouTube interview / studio session, Young Chop said that he made Chief Keef's ""I Don't Like"" in a half hour on FL.

**Reason 5** I have not tried enough to actually give an opinion on. However, at the surface level, I think it falls in with FL studio as a program best used by someone who is inserting their own original music in MIDI form and programming drums with a pad/controller/pencil tool.

**Ableton** is the best program for people who don't play their own music or use a lot of synth VSTs, but instead are masters of chopping up samples and engineering already made sounds into new songs of their own. The audio editing ability, vocal syncing, remixing ability (for remixes of other people's songs), and mixer are all really good on Ableton, better than FL studio for sure, and probably the best that I have come across. If you're not the type that does a lot of sampling, and you're more of a keyboardist trying to make electronic music, it's not the DAW I would recommend.

**ProTools** doesn't really seem to be a full start-to-finish DAW as much as it is the premier POST-production tool for your song. ProTools is best used for mixing and mastering, and the power of it really comes into play when you are in a studio recording live instrumentation or vocals and mixing it all with ProTools. If you want a career in music production, learn any DAW that you want, but make sure you become familiar with ProTools also. Everyone should know how to use it a little bit. I have been looking at a few record studios in town to get an internship at, and ProTools proficiency has been a requirement stated in the job posting at 2/3 of them. 

**Logic Pro** seems to be a versatile mix of every program. I find the piano roll a little bit awkward, and the drum sequencer is hard to find, but once you start to understand how Logic works, it becomes a magically smooth interface to work across. You can put together full sounding songs (low, mid, high range, drum sequences)  REALLY fast. The CUSTOMIZATION of Logic is also incredibly superior to other programs. You can save everything you do, from simple drum sequences to originally created sounds to MIDI patterns, and then you can access it from other projects. You can program your own drum kits really easily, although you can also do that in FL. 

There is also a ton of stuff that can get you over a writer's block hump in logic. For example, there are lots of pre-programmed drum beats and you can save your own. The ""drummer"" plug-in can help lay down some drums that you can convert to your own custom drum packs and instantly have a cool-sounding drum pattern on your track, if say you were more of a keyboard player than a percussionist. 

Logic also has some great remixing ability and recording ability. I haven't gotten into audio editing in Logic so I won't comment on that.

My FAVORITE part about Logic is the Sequencer, or if you're familiar with FL, the ""Playlist"". It's so much better than FL studio's playlist. In Logic, you can edit each measure individually. Let's say you have a chord progression that goes C - G - F - F over and over again, but then you want to change it to C - Am - G - F .. in FL studio you have to copy the pattern, clone it to a new pattern, go into the piano roll, edit the notes, and then paste the new pattern onto the playlist. In Logic, you just click the 4-bar measure that goes C - G - F -F, you change it to  your desired C-G-Am-F, and it will only change that measure, not any of the other ones in the sequence. No need to copy patterns, paste, clone, and keep track of 25 different patterns in your step sequencer when arranging your track. Just a quick edit and now you have 2 slightly different patterns. This is REALLY convenient with drum sequences too.


**OVERALL** there was a day that Fruity Loops was a joke program for kids to get into music production, that day has long past. FL studio is a force to be reckoned with and I think that if FL studio 12 is done right, the audio editing and sampling features are ramped up, they make the program look a little more professional aesthetically, and if they have a proper Mac port, it will become the premier software to use by pro producers.  A few features in Logic need to be redesigned to be more easily accessible (ex. the drum sequencer shouldn't be a mixer effect, it should just be somewhere in the interface) and it will remain on top, with FL studio close behind, as the professional program to use. Ableton will never lose relevancy unless something else comes along that has better editing ability.

Next up on my list to try is **Bitwig**, has anyone given it a shot? I saw a tweet by deadmau5 saying that he was learning it, and I've seen a few articles saying that it's definitely an up-and-comer in the DAW universe.

P.S. I used **Cubase** for a few weeks and I honestly cannot get the hang of it. That's on me though, because I know Cubase is the go-to program for a lot of people. I can't speak on its strengths or weaknesses as a DAW."

This post might better belong on a different subreddit like /r/offmychest, or relationships, or anxiety, but after reading through some of the posts on r/depression, I still think that many of you can at least relate to how I’m feeling.  Throughout my life, I [28F] have been on a “quest” of sorts to find happiness in life.  I’ve managed to get through a lot of bumps in the road thus far, but I feel like I’m definitely in one of the lowest points right now.  To put it in a nutshell, I have major conflicts in several very important areas of my life, and the end result is anxiety and depression.  Not just any depression, but the kind that is so powerful that it is simply numbing.  As the world turns gray around me, I have become more withdrawn than ever.  I can’t go on like this any longer, so here I am.  Not really asking for advice (although I could probably use it) as much as just looking for a safe place to collect my thoughts and get them out for the first time.  This is a long post, so I’ll include a TL:DR, but I have also broken down my dilemmas into separate sections to make this easier to follow. 
     
Relationships:  So, this is an interesting area, and definitely the one I struggle with the most.  I am introverted, but I have never had problems making friends or dealing with people.  I was fairly popular growing up (although I still felt somehow disconnected from friends), and my family has always been extremely supportive.  I never went without anything.  Ever.  Still, I know now that there was something off about me.  My parents first became concerned when I wrote my own obituary as a school project at age 12.  For reasons still unknown to me I had always been morbid.  The older I got the worse it got.  I had severe anger problems and behavioral issues at school and home.  I tried cutting a few times, but didn’t get any satisfaction from it.  I think I partly did it for attention or as a call for help. I refused to talk to anyone who tried to get through to me and instead lashed out.  At 15, I was diagnosed with several mental disorders (and prescribed Lithium, Zoloft, among other anti-depressants).  After seeing the effects I decided the doctors were quacks and stopped taking the drugs.  I’m 28 now and haven’t taken a prescribed medication since then.  

Since I can remember I have had extremely low self-esteem.  It has always been related to my looks somehow.  I was overweight growing up – and this is a hard thing to go through as a kid.  I constantly compared myself to other people and still do.  I was always boy-crazy.  My father has always been a wonderful constant in my life, but for some reason I have had a lot of issues surrounding males.  I craved male attention to feel better about myself.  I hung around bad crowds and lost my virginity at 13 to a loser who never cared about me.  At 14, I was raped by a boy I knew.  I blocked it out and never told anyone, and worse, rationalized it in my head because it somehow made me feel desired.  I know it’s fucked.  I’m ashamed of that naivety, especially considering all the love there was to be had in my close friends and family.  Fast forward a few more years to age 19, where I met this guy and had a 4 –year-long relationship with him.  All 4 years were marked by horrible physical, mental, and emotional abuse.  He was a master manipulator and got into my head and convinced me that he was the best I could do because I was fat, ugly, etc.  He alienated me from all the good people in my life, because they took me away from him.  He hit me, choked me, cut me, humiliated me, cheated on me countless times, and fueled my self-loathing.  I always came back though.  I gained 70 lbs, which made my body image issues that much worse.  I also started messing around with drugs.  That was probably the lowest point in my life; I truly wished to be dead.  And no one knew it but me.  Finally I found the courage to tell my family what was happening, leave him, and get a restraining order.  That court date was so terrifying to see him again, but my life really turned around after that.   I lost the 70 lbs through diet and exercise, quit my job as a hairstylist, and put myself through engineering school.  I had many great successes in school and had a great support network there, although I never got the courage to talk to a counselor or support group about my past or current issues.  I also met my current boyfriend of 3.5 years there.  He is kind, passionate, and full of life, and I had never felt happier.  I had new standards for my life, and a new confidence, so I buried my past and moved on.  But something changed.  My new confidence and standards were all superficial, because I am back to self-loathing and have fallen into a deep depression.  I get so many compliments but the person I see in the mirror today is not who others see.  And it goes deeper than that…All I see is the person who my ex told me I was.  He still lives in my head, but he always has – even before I knew him he was there.  My relationship has suffered to the point of no return.  I’ve realized that my boyfriend and I are just different people and I’ve alienated myself from him.  I’m starting to resent him.  I feel terrible for it because although he is so irresponsible he is still a dedicated, great person.  He doesn’t deserve this, but I’ve realized that I will continue this dysfunctional pattern in all my relationships until I fix my self-problems.  I’m starting to think of the possibility of children, but obviously this is not the time.  I know he will be absolutely devastated if I end things, and although I am unhappy I don’t think I can take the stress of the break-up with all my other problems right now.

Job: I have a somewhat high-profile job at a mine and manufacturing facility.  I am the only female engineer and one of just a few women in 200+ employees which imposes some challenges, especially considering that I have to manage men who are old enough to be my father and have years of experience in the field.  I can deal with that challenge, but the job puts a lot of pressure on me to begin with.  The intern that worked for me is back in school now, so I have her projects to complete, and one of the other engineers recently got let go, so I got his two biggest projects dumped on my desk.  All on top of what I already have to do, which is a lot in itself.  I am now working 75 hrs/week just to try and stay afloat.  I have a strong feeling that my company wants me in management soon, so I know that this is all a “trial by fire” to see what my capabilities are.  I mostly like my job and I’m trying to rise to the challenge for myself, but it’s a tremendous amount of pressure.  I find myself resenting my boss (who is actually great most of the time) because I feel like my life has become all about work.  Hell, I’ve even spent a good part of this holiday weekend working from home because I have a super-critical installation coming up. I am in a bad mood a lot because of it and am failing at the pact I made with myself to not let work affect my emotions or quality of life.  Easier said than done.  I’m exhausted and hardly speak to my family more than once a week, and see them a couple times a year.  I don’t know what I would even do with a management promotion, because I don’t think I can handle any more responsibilities – plus these are “people management” responsibilities, so this is an entirely different kind of responsibility.  And frankly, I have enough of my own baggage – I don’t need to deal with other people’s shit on top of it.    

Legal: To make matters worse, I went and got myself in trouble.  A few months ago I was arrested and charged with an OWI.  That’s another long story, not for here.  I’ve never felt like a bigger failure as I did while wrapped up in a moth-eaten blanket in a jail cell all night and all of Mother’s Day.  I made a mistake, and although I barely blew over the legal limit I couldn’t shake the guilt of what could have happened.  My cousin killed two kids involuntarily when they ran a red light and he hit them, but he served years in prison since he had alcohol in his system.  I remember thinking how stupid he was for putting himself in that situation, but that easily could’ve happened to me that night.  I represented myself in court and got a plea bargain that dropped most of the charges, but increased my penalties.  I’m on probation for the next YEAR and all sorts of things that come with that.  Part of my agreement was that I would be eligible for a restricted driving license after my 30-day hard suspension was up.  So I arranged car pools for my 1-hour commute (no easy task while trying to keep my private legal matters to myself) for the whole 30 days.  A week later, the BMV still hasn’t processed the paperwork that the court has sent twice, so I still can’t legally drive.  If I am caught violating my probation I will go to jail for a year and my career aspirations will be up in smoke.  The good thing is that I have a court-ordered evaluation with a psychologist for a substance abuse treatment program coming up this week, and I am actually looking forward to it.  I am lucky enough to have health insurance that will pay towards it, so I am going to use this opportunity to try and face these demons for, well, the first time.  I want a future.  I want to know how to give love to myself and to others.  I am scared, but I think it’s the only option if I ever hope to get out of this vicious cycle of pain and hatred.  

So, here I am.  Congratulations and THANK YOU if you’ve made it to the end of this novel!  I don’t know what I am looking for.  Pity?  No.  Advice?  Perhaps.  Empathy? Yeah, probably.  Either way, this is the turning point, for better or worse.  

TL;DR -  I have suppressed a history of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse that has manifested itself into chronic self-loathing, anger, and depression.  I am on the breaking point from added stress from my relationship, job, and legal problems and need to find solace in something.  It’s affected all of my relationships and I am taking the first steps towards facing the demons.

2f6uau,4,2014-09-01,"Interesting Lifestyle, Boring Person",Jarikk,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2f6uau/interesting_lifestyle_boring_person/,"Hey Seddit,

Lately I’ve been going back to focusing on myself and one thing that I’ve noticed is that I feel like I have an interesting life, but I myself, am a boring person.  Let me explain how I see it.

Seddit always encouraged people to build an interesting life for yourself that you can be proud of.  For a long time, it’s all I’ve worked on.  I’m currently 22 and attending college. I play guitar and I do tons of martial arts (aikido, jiujitsu, taekwondo, weapons-training).  I regularly stay active by going to the gym, beach and hiking.  I have a decent job working retail which also allows me to stay up to date on how to dress, as well as a paid internship coming up at the end of the semester.  I also do a lot of other random things ranging from poker and playing the stock market to archery and meditation.  

Despite everything that I do, I feel like I’m a boring person personality-wise.  I drink but I don’t get drunk and I rarely go to clubs or bars.  I’ll go if my friends ask me to come out, but I’m never the one to suggest it.  I’m always the responsible one that either DD’s and babysits or has everyone asking if I’m having fun or not.  I am the least spontaneous person I know.  I always have to have things planned out and organized.  On one hand, it’s great that I can plan creative dates that girls have never been on before and they really enjoy it.  

On the other hand, I’ve never taken a girl on an “adventure.”  Things such as hiking dangerous places or round-island road trips are seen as adventurous, but they just never seem like they really are when I take them.  I’ve never had a girl say “I love how we can have so much fun doing nothing.”  It’s as if I had to rely on my creative ideas instead of my personality.  I bet you can remember those spontaneous nights where you have no plans (and if you did, that they never ended up working out) but wound up being the nights you always remember?  I don’t have those.  

I’ll throw in my background just in case it helps.  I used to play World of Warcraft 50-60 hours a week throughout high school until I found Seduction during my 2nd year of college.  I live in Hawaii where social circle game is pretty much the main if not only thing I can do.  My current sticking point is that I last 1-2 dates with every girl and they slowly drop out of my life.  I’m thinking it’s because of the reason I’m writing this post, but maybe there are other things you guys can suggest as to why.  Oh, and yeah I’m very hard on myself, but I think from reading this you already knew.

I guess the main thing I’m asking here more or less, is how to not have a boring personality.  For example, this post is really old http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/okjbx/how_to_become_a_less_boring_person/ but the top comments have the general advice that I am looking more towards.  I looked into it some more and found this http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/j9wop/10_lifestyle_tips/
What really shocked me was that he said some people try to “force their lifestyle down her throat which comes off as insecure/bragging,” and I couldn’t believe how true that was for me.  I always find myself purposely baiting girls into conversations that, when they reciprocate, allow me to tell them about my hobbies and life.  

In the moment, it feels like if they find out all the things I do compared to other guys around here, that it would fuel the attraction, but logically I know that this falls under ""trying to impress her.""  I've even gone into conversations saying ""I will not talk about my hobbies,"" and no matter what I always end up baiting the girl into it no matter how conscious I am of it.  I guess my pickup skills are where I need to focus my efforts on?  A lifestyle is supposed to be for yourself and to show that girls are not your number one priority.  However, I feel like because I’ve got everything sorted out EXCEPT girls, that they become my number one priority because it’s one of my biggest problems/flaws.

I know that was long, but if you read all that, I love you.

TL;DR: have the lifestyle, but boring personality isn’t up to par.

I recently became an intern at a web development company known as [Xepler](http://xepler.com). I recently completed my first test project there, which was a social network. I am looking to go from an average skilled dev to a great dev. 

I would like to become great at AngularJS to improve my Django skills and general web development skills but I am essentially just looking on some advice on how to bridge that gap between average and great. Staring at the Django docs just isn't quite cutting it."

How should I approach recruiters?
Should I be straight up and ask about summer internships, or should I ease into it?
What should I highlight I currently have 1 exam, and will be writing a second one in December, my gpa is 3.7 or 83% for us Canadians and I'm  experienced with excel. I have no past Actsci exp, but I am also a comp sci major and have web development experience.

2f7xzr,1,2014-09-01,"Am I just blaming my aunt/ngramda for my own failures? Be honest, please.",[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2f7xzr/am_i_just_blaming_my_auntngramda_for_my_own/,"For the record I am 24 years old, and a bit of a fuck up. but I've lived on my own more or less since I was 18. 20 if you don't count college.
So my aunt (who raised me from 14 on and is like my mom. She works for a very well known and very lucrative company) pushed me to take this internship right now rather than wait till I had saved up money and could afford it on my own, which is what I wanted to do. I told her ""fine but you and ngrandma have to help me pay for rent. If I end up homeless I am showing up at your door!"" I don't mind ngrandma giving me money, since she's promised me money for things over the years and backed out time and time again. As far as I am concerned, I'm just taking what she's owed me and ""forgot"".

Today is the second time she's paid for my rent. On the 28th she told me this is the last month they will help me with rent. I still have two more weeks of internship, my phone broke down, and I don't have a job right now, and rent is $625. I feel blind sided. I started crying. She said that I knew this wasn't going to be for long and insinuates that we discussed ending this and that I should have known about this. We did talk, in vague terms, but i thought they were going to pay until my internship was completed and I found work again. I told her that if she really believed I knew they were going to cut me off this month, why did she feel the need to tell me? Why didn't she mention this all the times I mentioned how grateful I was for them helping me and talked about future plans? Ironically, two days before  I had told her that my agoraphobia and panic attacks had come back and that I was spending the time not at my internship alternately having panic attacks or crying. 

So this conversation happens, ""Have I ever come to you guys asking for money for fun? For something flippant? I've been trying to be more social. You always say that I'm so different from everyone else my age, but I talk to others and their parents give them $20 bucks to go see a movie or $60 for some convention. Have I ever asked for money for something fun? I've only ever asked for money when I absolutely have to, when I need help. I literally can't get a job and make $725 ($100 for bus pass) in one month! Especially since a lot of places don't pay you until two weeks have elapsed. I have only ever come to you and asked you for help when I'm desperate. How am I supposed to do this."" ""No, I can't think of you asking for anything [for fun] right now, but not all people are like that. You think Ngrandma ever gave me money for something? If I wanted something I had to say 'can I wash the car for $20'.""

Prior to this conversation she had mentioned that ngrandma had wanted me to call her everyday and check in, to which I said no way in hell. I had said the words, ""Did you ever notice that when you guys treat me like an adult, I act like an adult?""

She brings this up, says that I wanted them to treat me like an adult.   She says something along the lines of, ""You want to talk about feeling betrayed? You always say you are going to do things like get your ADHD pills. If I had a dollar for every time you said that but didn't do it, I would be rich. Why don't you?"" ""The copay is $20."" ""Have we ever not given you money for medical expenses or reimbursed you if you come to us and ask?"" I hate asking them for money. It always feels like this big draining event, and I always feel uncomfortable doing this. It also always makes me feel obligated, which she scoffs at. ""You told ngrandma you'd look into loans [in case I was ever in a situation where I couldn't pay rent again], and you haven't, have you?"" I had asked a friend I knew who took out loans, and knew that because I had very poor credit (I let another aunt, n-aunt, put her bills in my name. BIG mistake.) and didn't have a job, that I couldn't get a loan without a co-signer. ""I looked into loans!"" ""For how long."" ""For um. For a day"" (yes, I lied). ""What sites did you go to?"" ""Well um. Okay. I lied. but I already know I won't be able to get a loan! and I did look it up for a good hour and I asked a friend-"" ""When will you learn to stop trusting things people say to you?! How is it fair that you lie to us like this, and you don't do things we say, and you always say your going to do things like get your ADHD pills, but you are the one that is betrayed?"" I stop and think, and to my horror I realize she's right, and I'm not feeling very good about myself because of this, and thinking that I need to take a serious look at my life and how well I keep my promises, ""but two wrongs don't make a right. At least tell me how I can possibly make that amount of money and find a job before the first!""

She tells me that ngrandma has assured her that I can get on government aid. Ngrandma believes a person can easily get on government aid, and stay on it for life. She believes (and has convinced my aunt) that a person can stay on unemployment for life. The only thing keeping people from free money is pride, apparently. 


That's it, really. Even though this isn't my money, and I say things without following through sometimes, I feel betrayed. I took  huge risk trusting my family like this, and had I known that they would cut me off this week I wouldn't have gone though with it. I would have said ""No"" and found a decent job. I was working at the beginning of this at the first place that became available- Burger King. It was horrible and for shit pay. Even though I went in telling them I wanted to work weekends because I would be doing an internship, and they said they were hiring for weekends, the scheduled me for weekdays. When my internship started, they said that they couldn't change my schedule. If I had had my way, I would have waited until I found a job as a busser or hostess and not have had to borrow from my family at all. Am I just spoiled? I know this isn't my money, and that it's a lot. Even split between ngrandma, it adds up. I just feel betrayed, and depressed, and my agoraphobia has been worse, to the point where I start having panic attacks if I run into my roommates. And I'm feeling like a failure, because a responsible adult would have started applying for work immediately after this happened.

I still need to study more before taking my certification test, as I've been away from medical assisting school for a year (I couldn't afford it at fist, was hating the idea of being  medical assistant but was pushed into it, and mother got sick and died, so I couldn't even enter a hospital without breaking down). So my internship is useless to me right now. 

Am I just  a complete failure looking to put the blame on others? "

2f8aok,1,2014-09-02,Am I depressed?,allthiswaiting,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2f8aok/am_i_depressed/,"Lately I've been thinking I'm depressed, but I'm not sure. I started feeling this way about a month ago and I checked out the symptoms and self tests and stuff, but I just don't know. When I was looking over all this stuff, I realized that I've had some of these symptoms for like a year and a half but lately it's just been worse. I really want to know what's going on with me.

I feel like I shouldn't be depressed because I'm going to my dream school, I just got a great internship, and I have friends, family, and a girlfriend who love me and care for me. I don't have any real problems, but I sometimes feel hopeless and sad for no reason.

Even now, while writing this, I have the thought that I'm not really depressed, and that I'm just in a funk and that I'm doing this for attention. I hate that thought, because I just couldn't stand myself if it was true. But I don't know if it is true.

The part about this that scares me the most is that I have these really frightening thoughts that just pop into my head out of nowhere. Most of the time it's just me insulting myself, almost like I'm trying to bully myself. I think I'm garbage, or worthless, or that I don't have a chance at a good future. The other stuff that pops in my head is way scarier. I get the thought that I should just kill myself. Like... you wouldn't have to finish this hour long drive if you drove off that bridge. You wouldn't need to study for that calculus test if you shot yourself in the head. You don't have to get out of bed if you don't wake up. I'm not suicidal, I know I don't want to die. But the fact that it's in my head still scares me.

There are times when I'm happy and excited, but lately they just seem few and far between. I just want to know if I'm actually depressed or if I'm just tricking myself into feeling this way. I have some/most of the symptoms, but I don't know if I'm actually feeling this way. I'm just really confused about what I'm feeling I guess. Is there any way I can know for sure? I think I might need help."
2f8bh8,18,2014-09-02,my [22f] bf [24m] is letting my problem with orgasming affect his ability or willingness to perform at all,throwaway80555,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2f8bh8/my_22f_bf_24m_is_letting_my_problem_with/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years, and living together for 3 years. In the beginning, we had loads of sex and I never had any issues cumming from any clitoral stimulation. I would cum in under 10 seconds sometimes.

Our frequency waned fairly normally over the years, but this past year we've had almost no sex. Seemingly related: when we DO have sex, he can't make me orgasm anymore. It's pretty much inexplicable, as nothing has really changed. But since I can still cum from masturbation I don't mind and I still love having sex with him.

I think it's been a real blow to his ego, and though he won't come out and say it, he's become really insecure about it. Thus, he's been entertaining the idea of sex less and less frequently. Back in February I told him that I was upset that he wasn't even trying to have sex with me anymore, but he brushed it off as ""not a big deal"" because ""all couples have sex sex as time goes on.""

This summer he's been out of state for an internship, and we met up at a friend's wedding out of town. I was looking forward to this opportunity to have sex since we hadn't seen each other in months. He went down on me and after a minute or two asked me ""what's wrong?"" since I hadn't cum yet. I said, ""nothing's wrong, I love you,"" genuinely enjoying myself. But I guess that was enough to just ruin everything for him, because even after using my mouth for 15 minutes he couldn't even get an erection. He didn't seem too disappointed that we won't see each other for another month and we couldn't even do it once.

He is a man of few words, so he hasn't (and probably never will) come right out and say that he feels insecure about anything. But I love him so much and I want to stay intimate with him, regardless of whether he can make me cum or not. I don't want to fake an orgasm either. How can I approach this topic again without him deflecting like last time?"
2f8v22,9,2014-09-02,Weekend from hell with NM,maybemoscow,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2f8v22/weekend_from_hell_with_nm/,"Hi guys!

First time poster here. Actually I wasn't even aware this existed till my friend pointed me the direction. For one thing, it's nice to see I'm not alone. I wasn't even aware that this whole Narcissistic mother thing was an actual thing. Like really, I'm so happy that I'm not alone.

My mother was never this bad. It's just been getting a lot worse. A lot worse. Earlier this February she visited me in college and even though I told her she didn't need to, she bought me $400 dollars worth of groceries. I knew this would come at the 'you're so useless and i have to do everything for you' price but I hadn't eaten proper food in months. We're in my flat and I ask her if I should put the sausages in the fridge (dumb question, i know) and she literally flips out at me from no where, telling me I'm a disappointment, that I am useless, that I ruin everything and this goes on for 15 mins before she storms out crying. I am left speechless and not knowing what to do, I call her a couple hours later, apologising for whatever I did wrong and I end up having dinner with her, even though it isn't without the 'you're a spoilt brat' look.

A week later, I get a message from her, saying she needs to talk with my sister and I (we go to the same college. She's a freshmen). She's gone back home now and she wants to skype with my dad. Seeing as my sister is just too ill, I get the pleasure of going first.  The camera turns on and she is sitting there with my dad, back home. They try and lure me in with some small talk but I tell them to cut the crap, I want to know what's going on. They tell me they're getting a divorce and a thousand ice-bucket challenges pour down on me. When they told me they needed to talk to me, 50% I thought my grandmother had finally dropped dead as her alcoholism had caught up, 49% they were selling the house and 1% divorce. My dad's answer to me freaking out: ""Oh don't worry-the dog will be the only collateral damage."" Yeah, not your two offspring that were conditioned to believe that you guys would be forever in love. I hung up even though my mother was like ""Oh I don't like leaving you like this."" Oh great. Thanks. Later, they send me a sad face emoticon. That clearly represents the crumbling of my family.

I didn't talk to my parents for 2 months and they hardly made contact with me. I fell into a depression but eventually got my act together, graduated from college with a good degree and moved to London for a job in publishing. All good. All happy. But while all this I barely talked to my parents and would only get snips of news from my sister who was stuck at home for the summer holidays. They came to my graduation but that was just pathetic and sad as a) this was the first time I'd properly seen them since the divorce and b) they were hiding it from my whole family so they still had their wedding rings on. Awkward.  

While in London, my mother would eventually call me up crying, my dad sending me depressing text messages. But I wasn't dealing with them and even though it depressed me that I no longer had the support system I'd been promised since birth, I held my head high and went on with my life.

Eventually I went home because my father missed me too much and really, I wanted to go home and take care of my father who was being hit really hard by all of this. He's a proud man so it was really depressing to see him crumble. My mother and father pick me up from the airport, faking the whole happy family shit. I tell my mother that it turns out that my job cannot pay me more (living off intern wages won't cut it in London) but I was going to find another job, I've done it before, blah blah. So I still had a job which in this economy was a miracle but hey, I wasn't making a ton of money. She flips out at me, tells me I'm a disappointment and that I have one month to find a job or she's dragging me back to my dead-end, drug-riddled village I grew up in. I flip out and tell her that's ridiculous but she's already telling me how spoilt I am and runs away crying.

This was only the beginning of the weekend from hell.  What was meant to be a weekend to take care of my father and try and figure out my next move, was actually just a complete disaster. Throughout the whole weekend, my mother would literally interrupt a nice conversation (and those were rare considering family situation) and force me to recount a golden tale of my childhood and then after that, tell her how much I loved her over and over again. This happened ten times a day. Saturday night; queue family dinner in a nice restaurant and my mother once more cuts the nice conversation and turns to me to ask me what my life plans are. I tell her some vague idea-heck I'm 21, I have no idea which brings me on the edge of an existential crisis every time I think about it-and she proceeds to tell me that that this is ridiculous, that she knows me better than I know myself and that I should be doing this. Thanks mother. Thank you for telling me what I should be doing. That night ends with her dragging us all out to a bar because she wanted to have fun. Talk about a strained situation.

The next day is my last day and even though I wanted to go to this certain beach, WE HAD to go to this ugly, shitty one because it was closest to my mother. My father is hopelessly in love with her which is just incredibly sad. Family BBQ planned, I cooked all the food and we sit down and once more nice conversation and my mother cuts in and asks me to tell a nice story of my youth in the most patronising tone ever. I lose it and tell her this is ridiculous and the fight starts escalating to points I hadn't dreamed imaginable. I can't even follow it, let alone my sister and father who are sitting silently next to us. Eventually it gets to the point where my mother yells at me, telling me I never open up. I tell her that this isn't really the best place to open up, we should go for coffee or something. She laughs at my face which further puts salt in the wound and I end up just telling her 'Fine want me to open up?!' And tell her about my depression, she laughs and yells 'Ever thought about me, you teenager?' Which winds me up to no end. Anyway, the conversation ends with her saying, verbatim, ""I don't care about your feelings."" Crying and running away, leaving my sister and I in complete and utter shock.

Oh, in all this she did something utterly disgusting. So, when I moved from college she stayed in my apartment and snooped around. There she found some very personal things I'd written during my depression. She uses this information as leverage to shut me up and end conversation. She knows that I know what she is talking about and instead of opening the discussion and doing the motherly thing of asking how I am, she will literally just say ""Oh like those letters"" in the middle of a conversation and I will look at her and she'll give me that poisonous look of 'Yeah, you better shut up' and I'm just forced to concede.

I leave the next day for the airport. For some ungodly reason she wants to come, even though we haven't talked since she ran off crying. She sits in the car with my dad talking about the most mundane things and eventually I hear her whisper 'Is she going to apologise? That brat.' As we draw nearer to the airport, I apologise for everything because that's the mature thing to do and she goes 'I'm done with you. I've raised a spoilt, teenage brat. I'm done with you.' I tell them that they can just drop me off at the entrance BUT NO THEY WANT TO GO IN AND CHECK-IN WITH ME. After a long drawn out check-in, I go to pass customs. I kiss my dad good bye, my mother waves at me, I fist pump in the air like in the last scene of The Breakfast club, yell 'FAMILY!' and walk in. Last image; my mother yelling at my father because he probably kissed me. I end up crying and shaking in this newfound anxiety my mother has triggered.

Anyway, this ended up being much longer than I thought. I needed to get this off my chest because I never talk about it with anyone and it's eating me on the inside. Thanks for reading though. It's nice to know someone is reading this!

2fa1js,3,2014-09-02,[26/m] met a girl (23/f) and for the first time in my life an effortlessly organic relationship budded but with a (fairly large) catch,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2fa1js/26m_met_a_girl_23f_and_for_the_first_time_in_my/,"**tl;dr**: Met a girl at a concert and spent that night and the next 2 days with her. We clicked immediately. The problem is that I live in the USA and she is here on an internship from Europe.  
  
I met a girl Friday night at a concert and the abnormal thing about this girl is that I immediately connected with her about every single thing. We both have the same choice of music, which explains why we were both at the concert, but our similarities diffuse across all aspects of our life.  
She is a very strong-willed, intelligent, goal-driven female and I am the same but to a lesser extent. I went to a prestigious college in the Midwest region of the USA but her college made mine seem like a pre-school. She is, however, humble about everything and I adore that trait in a person.  
We spent all night at the concert and I walked her to her car at about 3:30AM. We had been talking all night and I found out she has been in town for 3 months on an internship program and only had 11 days left in the program until she moves back home, and she lives far away. Like, Europe far away. Anyway, I asked her if she wanted to get dinner before she leaves town and she said, ""No."" I was taken back by this but then she smiled and whispered, ""Yes, I want to."" I like playful girls but that was a little rough.  
I left that night so happy because of how well I connected with her. I have had connections with girls in the past but never this naturally and never in such a fun, light-hearted, playful way. I have had to put zero effort into being with this girl because everything flows so perfectly. I usually end up saying something moronic around females but her and I talked for hours and it was flawless.  
  
Cut to the next day and I texted her to see if she wanted to hang out. I said ""screw it"" to the 3 day rule because she has to leave in only 11 days. She said that she was free and wanted to hang out. We went to dinner, shared a bottle of wine, got dessert, and during all of this I learned even more about her that made me like her (such as her relationship with her family, her food choices, her career path goals, and how she reaches over and gives me subtle kisses at the dinner table).  
The waiter brought out caesar's salad that was compliments of the chef. Although the intention was good I didn't appreciate it as much as other people because my least favorite food in the world is salad. However, there were 2 of the thickest cuts of bacon I have ever seen in my life sitting atop the salad so I spent no time at all divulging into that pre-dinner treat. To my surprise, and delight, she too hates salad. She ate the bacon and sent the salad back and we waited for our steaks to arrive.  
She asked what kind of wine we should get and I told her that we were eating steak so red wine was appropriate. She allowed me to pick the wine and I ordered a bottle of 2011 Malbec from California. She said she liked it but I could tell that it wasn't her favorite type. That's fine though, it worked out. She told me that she was testing me and that it was important that I know how to pair wines because that is a big part of her culture. I am glad that I have taken many winery tours, I never thought the knowledge would help me pass a test from a lady who requires the gentleman to know how to pair wines!  
I'll summarize a few things. After dinner we went to a chic rooftop club/bar, then went back to my place and swam and talked in the hot tub, then I drove her home and the whole time I kept finding out details about her that reeled me in. I'm hooked and want to get to know her even better.  
Fast forward another night and I brought a bottle of champagne to her house and we talked about cultural difference between our countries and then we spent the night cuddling and talking. The plan was to kick me out at 11pm but neither of us wanted that time to come. We ended up cuddling all night and waking up at random points in the night to share little kisses and just look at each other. The eye contact we share is indescribable. For the first time I really felt solace by looking into someone's eyes. Every single thing we do is cute, easy, and perfect. I love it because everything is perfect and hate it at the same time because of how limited our time is.  
Of course I want to see her and talk to her more but I just don't know what the outcome will be. I am an idealist so in my mind I see this somehow working out because she has expressed that her feelings are as strong as mine and I would walk to Mars just to hold her in my arms for a second. The problem is that for the time being it will be insanely difficult to manage. I know the whole saying ""there are plenty of fish in the sea"", but this is the first person I have come across where I've effortlessly acquired feelings for. I will admit that when she leaves I'll be heartbroken

2fae0o,10,2014-09-02,"My [26F] boyfriend [28M] of about a year just broke up with me, saying he has problems he needs to work out on his own but wants to stay in touch.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fae0o/my_26f_boyfriend_28m_of_about_a_year_just_broke/,"My boyfriend and I had a really great relationship - no fights, very comfortable with each other, he was always sweet and affectionate. I really love him, he's a pretty special guy. Then last week he broke up with me completely out of the blue. 


It turns out he's been struggling with a lot of issues that he hadn't told me about - he's in law school and failed some classes so he won't be graduating on time (he just started as a 3L), anxiety got the better of him over the summer with his internship on the other side of the country and he just stopped going for a while. He's said in the past that he has some anxiety and maybe depression issues, but I had absolutely no idea it had gotten this bad. He went on antidepressants about a month ago, which he told me about the day before he broke up with me. I told him at the time that I was hurt he hadn't mentioned it before - he knew I've been on them in the past and my dad also has bad depression, it wasn't like I would judge him, and I wanted to support him.


When he broke up with me, he admitted all of these things and said that while he doesn't really understand/can't put into words why, he feels like he has to sort them out on his own. He said I am the only thing that makes him happy in his life, but he used our relationship as a crutch to help him ignore his problems. He said he hadn't deliberately hidden them from me, but he didn't want them to spoil the one good thing that he had. I guess that a stressful first week of classes, and the fact that I was looking to move to an apartment near him, made him panic and break up with me because he was afraid it would be worse it he left it until later. He said that he's not sure if he has a future now with not being able to graduate on time and it wasn't fair for him to stay with me because of all this, but maybe, in the future, we can see where things go...


He is clearly a completely wreck about breaking up with me. He told me he's never been this torn up inside about anything before, and he would like to try to stay in my life if I am willing to let him (I am also the only friend he has here - he's quite introverted, and his other friends have transferred out or left). I told him that I'm not sure, I would have to see how much I could handle, as I am completely devastated about the breakup. He brought my things over yesterday and we talked a bit, and he emphasized that it absolutely wasn't me or our relationship, it was just him needing to focus on school and deal with his issues. He's agreed that he will see a school counselor to help him deal with things.


I don't know how to take all of this. I've been going back and forth between just being heartbroken, to being angry that he hid things from me until they got so bad, to being sympathetic and wanting to be there for him. I don't really know what to do. I feel like he's trying to push me away to protect me, and that he may not be feeling completely rational because of the anxiety. I kept saying I wanted to be there to support him, but he's adamant that he needs to break up with me for now, as much as it is breaking both our hearts. 


How do I handle this? I'm glad he's seeking help on his own - I definitely don't believe in ""fixing"" someone, but being supportive while someone fixes themselves is different. Do I try to stay to support him while he fixes himself even though he's ended things? Do I give myself space? Should I be more worried about both his problems and the fact that he hid them from me? I want to be there for him, I am pretty sure I want us to work things out (although I also don't want to just wait around for him), I'm just trying to figure out what is the best thing to do for both of us... I'm still in shock so it's hard to think straight.


---   
TL;DR Stressed out law school boyfriend broke up with me out of the blue, revealed he has a lot of problems he's ignored, but wants to stay in touch. How do I handle this?

2faf5m,3,2014-09-02,"My boyfriend [22M] and I [22F] of 2 years can see ourselves getting married, but break up instead",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2faf5m/my_boyfriend_22m_and_i_22f_of_2_years_can_see/,"My boyfriend and I got together always knowing there was an end in the future. First that was because we both didn't want anything serious (I'd just gotten out of a relationship that went years too long) and then later because I was close to graduating. He also had a coop so every other semester he was about 6 hours away and we could only see each other every few weeks. Even though we both took things slowly emotionally, we couldn't help but stay together because, surprise surprise, we actually really liked each other. 

A year later and a mere semester before I was due to graduate, we finally said ""I love you."" We both knew it long before but it seemed too hard to admit it. The next semester was again long distance, but amazing all the same since we still saw each other about every other week. The plan was to break up when I graduated. Instead, I ignored an internship offer and moved in with him for the summer (graduation present to myself). Absolutely the best summer of my life. I secretly hoped that living with him would prove we weren't right for each other, but instead I couldn't wait to be home with him and was never happier.

I'm now starting graduate school across the country while he stays behind to finish his last year of school. The program will take 5-6 years and on the low income of a grad student, I can't afford to buy tickets except maybe once a semester. 3 weeks of separation at a time sucked enough in the past. I always ended up crying and miserable because I missed him so much. Plus, after graduation, he'll likely end up even farther away because of the type of job he wants. Nothing that he's interested in is offered near me, not even anything in the field in fact, though he's tried to find something/anything. So, we finally broke it off. 

We always took emotions slow because it was too hard to feel them. It wasn't until the end that I really looked at us and realized that I could be happy spending the rest of my life with this guy and he felt the same. We're best friends and more than anything want to be friends for the rest of our lives. We don't want to have a long(er) distance relationship that eventually goes sour due to only seeing each other a few times a year and ends up ruining our deep friendship. 

We saw each other again recently and thought about getting back together because the past few weeks have been so hard for both of us. But we again couldn't find any better solutions other than to keep talking to each other like we have been, but as friends not lovers. 

So, 1) Is there actually any good way to stay together other than trying to ""tough it out"" as an exclusive, long distance couple?
2) How can I possibly move on from a relationship that was as close to perfect as I can imagine? I worry that I'll never be happy with anyone else because I'll know it's not as good as what I had before.

It seems ridiculous that we're so young and that I think I'll never find anyone again. I know it's probably not true and sounds so stupid. We both always laughed at people who got married right out of college, because how could you possibly know. But now I guess I understand them because while neither of us would want to even consider it until we're more financially stable and settled, I truly think we would have eventually, under different circumstances. 


---   
**tl;dr**: I had the most amazing relationship I could imagine, but knowing we won't see each other more than a handful of times over the next 5-6 years led to us separating as friends. Is there another way? If not, how do I get past this?"
2fanf3,99,2014-09-02,Inappropriate behaviour with a student (long long long),Mmmbq,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/2fanf3/inappropriate_behaviour_with_a_student_long_long/,"
I have lurked on this subreddit for a few years now and have finally created an account after an extremely erotic experience that took place this afternoon. For some background- I am a white male in my early fifties, working as a consultant plastic surgeon in a large university hospital. I am 6'1 and in relatively good shape, am married with two sons in their twenties. I work long hours, and I play golf with my colleagues and my sons at the weekend, my wife and I are no longer very close but we get on fine and I think we are both happy with how the situation is. I have always been faithful to her, apart from this one incident...

It began in June, when the new intake of medical students were coming in for two week trial rotations. They get randomly assigned to a team, just as a way of orientating them before they start their clinical teaching in September. When I arrived to the clinic on Monday morning my heart sank as I saw them there in their white coats, looking like lost little lambs, utterly useless, gaping around wide eyed and terrified. My patience with the students has long ago worn thin, and students on their first week in hospital are worst of all. I'll admit that I am very short with them, I have no tolerance for ignorance or lack of effort, and this occasion would be no different. There were five of them- three girls and two boys. I introduced myself and told them to each take a chart and bring in a patient to take a history and then present it to myself or whatever registrar is available when they're finished. They did as they were big, looking terrified, and I couldn't help but notice that one of the girls was extremely attractive. Of course, many if the students are attractive- they're young, intelligent girls- but I've never allowed my thoughts to stray too far. But this girl.. She was a little thing, about 5,2, slim but with these big, juicy, round breasts that she couldn't hide under the conservative blouse she was wearing. Her skin was pale, her hair blonde, her lips full and pink, and her cheeks flushed.

I put my coat and briefcase away, checked something with the nurses, and then looked down the hall- none of the students had finished the history yet. So I decided to interrupt one of them, and found myself walking past the other doors until I saw my little blonde, not meaning to pick her out but feeling irresistibly drawn to her. I walked in without knocking, and barked at her to give me the history and get on with it. She seemed taken aback, but began to tell me the history. Her voice was smooth and confident before I stopped her. I won't go in to too much detail here, but she made mistake after mistake- and each time I would interrupt her and correct her, perhaps unkindly- but it's the only way she will learn. After each interruption, I could see her cheeks flushing redder, her voice becoming unsteadier, and my dick getting harder. I could see how much she wanted to please me, how she would do anything I asked. After we dismissed the patient, we want back to the hall and I explained to her a few ways to improve her presenting style, all the while she stared at the ground. Then, feeling a bit guilty, I added that I hoped she wasn't upset but that this was my teaching style.

To my surprise her eyes flashed up to mine and she didn't blink, and her voice was back to its original, confident quality as she said 'You won't upset me that easily, I like to be spoken to directly.'  At this point my eyes flicked to her ID card, nestled on her breasts, hanging by a lanyard. Her name was Lucy. 

Over the next two weeks I found giving her more attention than the other four students, instead allowing the registrars and interns to guide the others. When I did speak to the other students, they were shy, overly polite, and seemed intimidated. But when I spoke to Lucy- gave her instructions, reprimanded her- she always met my eyes smiling, almost laughing, with a kind of mischievous and would simply respond 'yes, sir'. Maybe it was all in my head, but I felt like she was being flirtatious, that she sensed in me my desire for her, to dominate her and subdue her, so every time I gave her an order or reprimanded her, I'd see this gleam in her eye and I'd find my mind racing.

I masturbated every night while she was placed with us, thinking about her lips, her creamy pale skin, her huge soft breasts... I was both disappointed and relieved when she left, and there was no goodbye. I didn't expect to see her again. New batches of students came and went, and the cycle was fortunately broken.

Then today, I was seeing outpatients in my private clinic, where we do a lot more cosmetic procedures than we would in the public teaching hospital. I took up a chart for a new patient, and saw her name. She wanted a consultation for a breast reduction. I knew I should stop it, that she'd be embarrassed when she realised it was me and wouldn't want to go through with it, but part of me was thinking- surely she must know I work here? Could she have planned this? And the thought of seeing and touching her breasts without any wrong done was too good an opportunity to pass up. So I went to the reception and called her name.

Her hair was long and wavy, I'd never seen it down before. She walked toward me and smiled, showing no sign of surprise at seeing me, confirming my suspicion that she'd planned this. She came into the room- it's laid out a bit like a GP office, with a desk, computer, chairs and a bed. 

'Well, Lucy' I said, 'it's nice to see you again. I'm surprised you decided to come to me for this procedure.'

'Why would you be surprised?' she asked, 'you're the best.'

We carried on the discussion, making sure she was sure about the decision. It was actually going ahead like an ordinary consultation at this point, but the anticipation of exposing her was making me get hard- I was a bit concerned she would notice when we stood and moved to the bed.

I told her to sit on the bed and take her top and bra off when she was ready, and closed the curtain. She called me back in, and she was sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing just the frilly white skirt she had worn in. Her breasts were large, but her frame was so small, she probably wore a 30F (UK sizes), and they were very round and perky for breasts of that size. 

I walked over to her, ignoring my obvious erection, and put my hands on them, squeezing them gently. I Ran my finger along where we would need to cut, and told her there would be scars. I noticed her breathing was quickening, her breasts rinsing and falling. Her nipples were firm, but the room wasn't cold, and when I let my thumb brush against one of them she bit her lip hard- but not in time to conceal the soft moan that escaped her.

I stepped back from her, and looked at her furiously. 

'I don't think you came here for a consultation at all, did you Lucy?'

She shook her head, cheeks red, none of her previous mischief coming across.

At this point I wanted to tell her to get out, and we would forget it ever happened. But there was too much blood in my dick and not enough in my brain, so I put my left hand across her mouth and my right hand up her skirt. She wasn't wearing underwear and was drenched. My middle finger slid inside her, and I couldn't believe how snug and tight she was against my one finger. I slid my thumb over her clitoris and she was bucking and shaking against me almost instantly, stifling her moans against my hand and gushing all over my fingers.

'Don't make a noise' I whispered against her ear as I removed my hand from her mouth. 'Bend over the bed and spread your legs'.

She obeyed me instantly. And although I had come this far, something inside me didn't want to give her the satisfaction. She can't just come in to where I work, and reduce me to some sort of animal, who doesn't give a shit that he has a wife and just fucks the first beautiful girl who tries. So I kept my dick in my pants, and instead spanked her ass, hard, while she licked her own juice off my other hand. And then I told her to get out of my sight and not to come again.

She looked confused and upset as she left. I don't want trouble, but I can't stop thinking about her, and part of me hopes she will defy me and come back- and this time I will give her a real punishment...

I did not know where else to post this and figured here would be the best spot since we are all going through the same shit.

I have three outstanding offers for internships next summer - all three conflict with each other and splitting the summer is not an option.

- All 3 have a very high full time offer rate for 2L summer interns.

- 2 are biglaw with biglaw hours and pay.

- The other is a corporate/nonpracticing gig that pays ~115k starting out, working a 9/80 (forty hour weeks with every other friday off), and 4 weeks paid vacation.

- I am graduating law school with zero debt.

Right now I am leaning towards the nonpracticing gig. I really like the lifestyle and the fact that I will be able to have a life outside of work. My only hesitation is that accepting a nonpracticing gig is somewhat the point of no return and I will never practice - which I am ok with... but it is still a hard decision to make.

Sorry if this sounds like a humble brag or something because I do not mean it to be. I just appreciate this subreddit's perspective and you guys are the only ones that realize what goes into being a biglaw attorney.

Also, sorry for any typos - I am a little tipsy. It is 2L afterall. "

Feels like everything's not going to end up fine.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2fbehs/hard_to_breathe_feels_like_everythings_not_going/,"From about 11 o'clock last night to around 5 this afternoon, I either felt like I was about to have a panic attack or I did have one.  It was a constant feeling of suffocation, lightheadedness, and an upset stomach wrapped around my fear of rejection for an internship opportunity.  They were supposed to call today, and I never heard from then.  Naturally I am assuming the worst and to start tomorrow off with bad news that will basically guarantee I won't be able to graduate on time.  It just feels like everything is piling up right now at a time where usually I have the least amount of stress and anxiety.

I have always had anxiety, but over the last few months it has gone to extreme levels.  My first reoccurring panic attacks, constant stress, and I can't handle anything while I am feeling like this.  I can't even finish this paper which is due tonight.  This is my third attempt trying to make a post here.  I have been chickening out of everything.  As I get closer to having to join the workforce and the real world, I get the realization that I don't enjoy what I have trained to do, and I don't know what I enjoy.  I don't really enjoy anything right now.  I have been locked in my room staring at this unfinished paper and being on the verge of a meltdown.  I'm just hoping this will end at some point.

I guess there has been no point to this.  Just trying to get some of this immense pressure off of my chest I guess.  Thanks for reading all of this rambling if you made it this far."

Need advice desperately.,worstblackmailNA,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2fbld7/my_boyfriends_mother_has_gone_on_a_crazy/,"Sorry for long post.

Gonna keep this in bullet points seeing as I'm on my phone. Using different names for me and my bf.

Bf- Alex 
Me- Holly

My bf and I are both 20. We will have been dating for a year this October. 

We are in a long distance relationship from US to UK. I am English he is American. We met on study abroad so I left at the end of may for the UK. The best times to see each other would be the end of the summer and Xmas as our next summer breaks and spring break don't match up and after I graduate next year I will be working my ass of to move to America for a masters so have no time to be bringing my bf to UK.

I wanted him to book a flight to see me at the end of the aummer . I suggested it last Christmas and his parents said no we'd not been together long enough. So we waited as they were right. 

We brought it up again when we had been together 6 months and his dad said he would help if the flight was $800 and my bf got an internship over the summer and a 3.2 GPA for the year. He got both. 

Mid summer comes around and his dad explodes at him and says he won't help because by this point tickets are $1700. So my bf uses $1000 of his money from the summer to help me come here and I pay the $700 because his dad would have been so pissed off if my bf had come to the UK. Plus I could spend a month here vs him only having 2 weeks in the UK. This still sucked because I wanted to come and see my bf at Xmas and ski with him ( my mum was fine with this). But hey, bf can still come to the UK for Xmas right? 

Bf and I start talking about him coming for Xmas as I am here for my summer visit. We mention it to his dad and his dad is fine with it and said he will help financially. Bf was originally going to leave on the 24th and his dad said why not leave the 23rd so you can arrive in time for Xmas? Then his mum got wind of it and all hell breaks loose. 

His mum sends a string of passive aggressive emails along the lines of I can't believe you are doing this to me, I hope you reconsider, you're more concerned with keeping gf happy, I guess family means nothing to you, you're selfish, but you know do whatever I don't care ect ect. 

Then we wake up to this email from her
Dear Alex

Let me start off by saying that I love you and that this is more difficult for me to write than it is for you to hear.  I know that you have some difficult choices to make about your Christmas vacation but I just want to try to explain where I'm coming from.  Christmas is about family.  It is a tradition for most families to spend it together. A chance for all of us to reconnect after being apart for a while.  A chance to hang out, eat and play games.  It is very important to me, your dad, your brother and sister and your grandma for us to spend it together.  I know that it would mean a lot for Holly and her mom to have you there, but unfortunately they should not get that chance.  You see Alex, it would affect much more than just you.  They should not want to break our family up because it would mean a lot to them.  I would never ask that of any other family.  Christmas is for families.  If Holly really did care about you, she would not ask for you to be away from your family.  Don't you get that?  I have made many sacrifices for my family throughout the years and I will protect this family until the day I die.  I can't even believe that you would consider not being home for Christmas!  Are you really that selfish?  How could you?  Don't you realize how much it would hurt all of us?  Christmas is for families.  If you decide that you will not be here for Christmas, it tells me that you really don't want to be part of this family, and I will get the message loud and clear.  You don't get to be part of this family when it's convenient for you.  It's all or nothing.  You're in or you're out.  You get to enjoy the good, the bad and the ugly.  And as long as you don't have a family of your own, you should be home for Christmas.  Be very careful of your choice, because as far as I'm concerned, I will not forgive you.  If you choose not to be here for Christmas, that's your choice, but you are basically slamming the door on our faces.  I hope we mean more to you than that.  After all we have been your family for 20 years and it would be a shame to walk out now.  This is not something I can compromise on.  You can go to England the day after Christmas if you want, but my family will be together on Christmas Day.  I hope you will be part of it because we all care about you and want you home.  All my love,

Mamma


PS. I'm Italian and I'm Catholic...family means everything to me.  You should know that by now!

Help me!!!!!

Its not the first time she has done this. She exploded when she realised that Alex wasn't going to be home for labour day. Because Alex's brother recently graduated and moved 5 hours away for work. 

She will have everyone together for thanksgiving a month before Xmas. 

Alex spoke to his mom and told her he wasn't happy but in the end let her have her own way. 

I showed my mum the email and she was appaled. 

I would have been fine if she hadn't reacted like this and Alex could have stayed with his family for Xmas. But she just crossed a line for me and this is going to destroy my relationship with Alex because he is afraid to stand up to her. 

I need advice on how my bf can sort this shitstorm out. I know its not his fault his mum is like this but I can break up with him if he won't stand up for our relationship. 

We are skyping my mum tonight to discuss all that happened and need suggestions. 

I'm going to creep on this post from my main but if I missed something out I'll log back in. Or if it gets popular I'll answer questions. 


Tl:dr- my bfs mum went on a crazy Christmas rampage and now we're in a corner."
2fbtnh,7,2014-09-03,"I want to change my life, but I need help!",D12Fan,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2fbtnh/i_want_to_change_my_life_but_i_need_help/,"Hello Reddit!

I frequently lurk around here, but just have been super pissed at myself as of late. I just turned 19 over 3 months ago, for the majority of my life I have been labeled ""fatass"" ""obese as f*ck"", I want to change that PERMANENTLY. Part of me is angry, but the other part of me makes me realize these people are right. I am currently 5'9 and weigh ~300 Pounds. I have a story, but to cut it short, I used to live out in Houston until my parents decided to move to a small suburban town in Michigan. While in Houston, I would always go outside and play various sports with my friends, and had weighed at least ~205-210 at the time. It has now been almost 3 years since we moved away from Chicago, and I know I am gaining weight.

Knowing I am overweight, my doctor back in Houston would mention my bad cholesterol levels would be high, bringing it to my attention. Though, after moving, I honestly just got super lazy, as entering a new place, I would just go directly to school, and come back home. The worst part is, there is nothing nearby that is of walking distance, so I just stayed home, or if had to go somewhere, drive. I have wrapped up an entire year of college, and am vegetarian by religion (always been), though, the ""freshman 15"" really did kick in, as I know that the biggest contribution to my weight gain was because of the junk food (especially eating pizza almost every day).

The last time I visited a doctor for a blood test (1 year ago) she had told me my blood levels were fine, though I need to cut the weight, and my bad cholesterol level were too high. She was saying I can go a natural route to cut my weight and be completely healthy or she can prescribe me some form of medication (metformin I believe she mentioned, claiming I would use it until I reach my target weight) but from my reaction I immediately said I want to go the natural route.

It is now September of 2014, I have been working at an internship near my town at a local aviation shop, though, the job really is a computer desk job. From 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, I am slouched on a desk and keyboard. 

In all honesty, I really want to change my life. Lately, I have been having acne breakouts, ingrown hair acne all over my body (head, shoulders, stomach, and of course face) and the biggest cause from my research indicate that it is heavily influenced I find is the lack of a proper diet and being overweight. I have also noticed several things as well:

•	I once checked my blood glucose level after eating dinner (~30 minutes) and it was close to 180, but it had lowered back down to 90 within the next 6 hours). 
•	I am starting to build up a black neck, and I am hearing part of it is because of too much levels of sugar in the body causing resistance, and lack of exercise to get rid of it
•	I have insane amounts of stretch marks pretty much everywhere!
•	I am having acne breakouts all over my face, and body for that matter
•	I am sort of losing confidence in myself, I really want to ask a girl out on a date and what not, but knowing my physical situation, I shy away…

Reddit, my main question from this thread is this: I openly accept that I am beyond overweight, as I know and openly accept it. I want to change my life around and live a healthy life instead of hurting myself. I have low stamina, and playing things like full-court basketball makes me tired as I have to catch my breath constantly. Is there ANYWAY I can reverse this, I want to lose weight and build my body to play sports like basketball again without getting tired and out of breath.
I still have till the beginning of October till I move back onto my college campus, but I want to immediately shift things around in my life and clear up all these problems around me. I want to have a regimented schedule in place to help me lose my excess weight, clear these issues of ""high levels of bad cholesterol"" and any other possibly complications in result of being overweight (high sugar levels, fatigue, blood pressure issues, etc..)

As for diet, being a vegetarian (by religion) does anyone have ideas as to which foods I should look into, and possibly what a weekly schedule of ""breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks"" look like? I would love more insight on this. 
Lastly, what are some good exercise tips you guys would recommend? I hear Yoga really helps, anything that I can do indoors (inside my bedroom) would be preferred, but can try to go outside and do something else as well.

At the end, my goals are:
•	Have healthy blood glucose levels
•	Have healthy blood pressure levels 
•	Have health Cholesterol levels
•	No longer be obese/overweight, and be in a healthy weight range! 
•	Bring back my confidence and not be afraid of things because of how I look physically
•	Gain stamina, and not get tired from playing only 2 minutes of basketball
•	And lastly, change my life. Change how I eat, how I think, and just unlearn bad habits as eating an entire cone of ice cream, or eating a donut for breakfast
I greatly appreciate the support, and would love insight and tips that I can use to change my life.

P.S.
I am Male, Indian-American, and have no medical issues or am on any sort of medication.

My little story.",suburiboy,Throwers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Throwers/comments/2fby5l/anxiety_falling_in_love_and_yoyo_my_little_story/,"I have Social Anxiety Disorder.  That means that social situations give me panic, and I avoid them to avoid the pain.  I've even been in jail for my SAD; when a police officer pulled me over and I could not respond, he put me in jail for the night.

This past summer I had an internship in downtown DC.  My commute was about 1 hour, but I got used to it quickly enough.  It was a great experience.

In late June, I noticed my sister playing with a toy ""yoyo"", the kind that doesn't sleep.  As a Physics major, I thought that there must be more to this... So I did some googling and some youtubing.  I then got a duncan butterfly XT and started learning.  After a couple weeks and learning the basics, I got a magic T8 to start learning unresponsive.  

One Thursday in July, I was staying in town late playing kickball with the other interns.  I got onto the metro-train around 8, and it wasn't super crowded.  The train had to stop for ""schedule adjustment"" and I did the obvious thing: I got out my yoyo and started practicing brain twister(that is how much of a noob I was/am).  I got a loose bind, so one of my throws just dribbled out.  The girl sitting across the train from me giggled a bit.  A little embarrassed, I put my yoyo away.

I don't know what possessed me in that moment.  I said to the girl ""looks like I can't even use a yoyo.""  She retorted ""You were doing really well until you dropped it.""  (totally sounds like the start of a really bad rom-com).  We talked for the rest of the train ride.  We talked about our internships, school, batman, and more, and I didn't feel anxious.  She even laughed at my stupid jokes.  When we got off the train I waited for her after the turnstiles while she had some trouble with her fare-card.  I knew that this was someone I wanted to be friends with.  So I asked her if we could trade phone numbers, or Facebooks or something.  She agreed to being Facebook friends.

The next day I sent her a message suggesting that we meet for lunch next week. She said, ""let's do Friday"".  We traded phone numbers to make planning easier.  That whole week I was shitting bricks.  How could a ugly, fat, nervous wreck like me ask a girl like her to go to lunch with me?  We met up, got sandwiches and walked around the park.  My SAD never even mattered.  This girl was exactly the kind I would want to meet.  She was kind, generous, curious, and witty.  When we said good bye, she said ""have a good life.""  She had to go back west, and I'll never see her again.  When I got back to the office, one of my coworkers revealed that he followed me and took pictures of the ""date.""  Kinda creepy, But I'm glad that I have pictures...


I'm not sure that it was technically a ""date,"" but it was the closest thing I've ever been on; I've never had a girlfriend, so i don't really know what a date is.  In that moment, I felt normal.  I thought ""this must be how people without anxiety disorders feel.""  In that moment, I felt like someone was finally treating me like a real person, not a freak to be kept at arms length.  In a Goethe-esque sense, I wanted that moment to last forever (the condition under which Dr.Faust would be condemned).  In that moment I felt okay... I felt happy...


The only time I've approached a girl, asked for her phone number, and asked her on a ""date"" was all because of my yoyo...  Now I'm trying to learn to control my Anxiety Disorder, and trying to figure out kwijibo.  Hopefully I'll figure out both.

Thanks for reading...Thought yall might like it.


**TLDR**: Kid with Social Anxiety talked to a girl for the first time after a freak yoyo accident.

Edit: can do kwijibo."
2fcg07,0,2014-09-03,A story about a man who can't stop having extramarital affairs (Slightly NSFW),Integrs,ShortStoriesCritique,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStoriesCritique/comments/2fcg07/a_story_about_a_man_who_cant_stop_having/,"I pulled out and ejaculated on the small of her back, her ass, and the back of her thighs. Laughing, I gave her a slap on the behind and flopped down on the bed. Without a word, she stood up to go to the washroom. Still breathing heavily, I stared up at the ceiling. The mild orgasmic spasms were coming farther between now. My mind was blank.  
 

I could hear the shower running. I could smell our sex in the air. The sheets felt cool against my skin. My senses were coming back to me. Soon I'd be thinking about work. But not before my brain gave a proverbial nod of acknowledgement to the fact I just fucked a woman who wasn't my wife. So be it.   


The shower had stopped running. I figured she didn't take a full shower, just cleaned up the mess I made. The thought was somehow flattering. I liked that women were capable of worshiping me. That they tasted me, lusted for me, and thought about me even if I wasn't next to them. Surely, it was the closest thing a man had to being a god; one thirsty for adulation.  


She came back in the room, topless, her black lace panties already on. She looked at me and smiled, but said nothing. I gave her a quick wink. She went over to the dresser to pick out a new bra. I liked our familiarity. It was a routine already. One afternoon once or twice a month, unbridled passion, little time for anything else besides. She knew I was married and didn't press the issue. I expected it to end when she found someone serious, but had never voiced that concern.   


""I've got a meeting in thirty minutes, start getting ready."" 
""Right,"" I said, ""where are my pants?""
""Over here, by the desk chair.""

I got up and crossed the room to the chair. I put my arm around her waist as I passed her. Our eyes met, I gave her a kiss on the lips. She put on her bra, a white one with small, navy polka dots.   


Later that day, at home with Irene, a hint of guilt crept up on me. Irene was everything I wanted in a wife. Except that, too late, I had realized I didn't want a wife. I was good to her and she was good to me - whatever that means. We travelled together, had a wide circle of friends, attended various events in the city, all the typical husband wife stuff. We were also affectionate with each other so it wasn't as though I could complain about my frigid wife. Irene's sexuality was like a pit of perpetually hot coals. She may not have always wanted sex, but there was something under the surface that sometimes made me suspect I wasn't the only one pleasuring her.   


I never told her, but the thought of another man with Irene was arousing. Unlikely I'd watch, but as far as fantasies go, it was a good one. I already knew she once liked to hear about my conquests before we'd become an item. We didn't talk about it anymore but could she have changed that much? I know I didn't. The only thing that changed was recognizing I hadn't changed, and that I wouldn't.   


And then there was work.   



Earlier the same day, after the tryst with Greta but before coming home, I'd been proposing a new strategy for my department in the coming quarter. I'd been relaxed and the details of the plan came easily and naturally. Heads had bobbed the way I'd wanted them to bob and our CEOs only question had been, ""When can you start?"" I said next week, and the truth was, all my projections and plans had been drawn up from various Google searches. They did apply to our team, of course, but they were just internet suggestions. It was too easy and that worried me.  


I was enjoying the dinner preparations with Irene. We put on the TV, opened a Malbec, and talked about our respective days. She was telling me about a new intern whose ideas about disaster relief included twitter feeds and live streams. I told her that those were good avenues of information, but Irene said that it's people, not twitter who save lives. She had a point, but so did the intern. ""So what else is new?"" I asked her. Irene told me about the noise her car's been making recently and that she wants to take it to the shop. ""Can you pick me up from work, tomorrow?""  


Tomorrow after work I was supposed to be ""working late"". I told Irene it depended on how busy I am and when I'd finish for the day. She seemed a bit disappointed I couldn't give her an outright answer, but I didn't want to postpone the meeting with Helen. A former gymnast I'd met at the gym and not a beauty by any means. She sported rather ordinary features on a somewhat long face, but her body was built to fuck. Toned abdomen, firm thighs, taut ass.  She was in her mid-thirties, new to the city, and wanted me to help set up a VPN network in her home because she worked remotely. Right. She also knew I was married, but didn't mind telling me I had a ""sexy butt"".   


It was the novelty that did it for me, more than the sex. In over ten years of marriage, I'd never had 'bad sex' with Irene. It was at worst average and at best, the best. But it was always *her* breasts, *her* skin, *her* legs. Beautiful though they all were, they were too comfortable. Too familiar. It was the thrill of discovery that got me rock hard. How would she react to seeing me erect for the first time? How does she trim her pubic hair?  What kind of smell does she emanate? How does she stroke and how does she suck? These traits are almost unique in their nature. Sex does indeed feel more or less the same, but nothing can compare to the exploration and eventual conquest of a new world.   


And then there was Love. Did I truly love Irene? Not enough to forgo the pleasure of another woman's body. In truth, I'd be devastated if she left me. My pulse quickened to the verge of panic during the thought exercises I carried out semi-regularly. I would picture her large green eyes, full of pain, welling with tears. She would lock herself up in the room, or the bathroom, weeping quietly; hurt and destroyed. And then she would leave. No, I didn't actually think she ever had an affair, because if anybody truly loved me, it was Irene. And in my own way, I loved her too. But I knew that my affairs made my love less than absolute.   


When I held Irene, there was nothing else in the world. Her small frame fit into me perfectly. The smell of her hair in my nostrils filled me with the same comfort that grandma's cooking would bring me on the weekends we visited her. It was a sanctuary. When I held Irene there were no other women, nor did I want other women. But eventually, I had to let go.

2fcgpl,3,2014-09-03,[Feedback] Cheater - A short story about a man who keeps having affairs (Slightly NSFW),Integrs,WritersGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/2fcgpl/feedback_cheater_a_short_story_about_a_man_who/,"I pulled out and ejaculated on the small of her back, her ass, and the back of her thighs. Laughing, I gave her a slap on the behind and flopped down on the bed. Without a word, she stood up to go to the washroom. Still breathing heavily, I stared up at the ceiling. The mild orgasmic spasms were coming farther between now. My mind was blank.

I could hear the shower running. I could smell our sex in the air. The sheets felt cool against my skin. My senses were coming back to me. Soon I'd be thinking about work. But not before my brain gave a proverbial nod of acknowledgement to the fact I just fucked a woman who wasn't my wife. So be it.

The shower had stopped running. I figured she didn't take a full shower, just cleaned up the mess I made. The thought was somehow flattering. I liked that women were capable of worshiping me. That they tasted me, lusted for me, and thought about me even if I wasn't next to them. Surely, it was the closest thing a man had to being a god; one thirsty for adulation.

She came back in the room, topless, her black lace panties already on. She looked at me and smiled, but said nothing. I gave her a quick wink. She went over to the dresser to pick out a new bra. I liked our familiarity. It was a routine already. One afternoon once or twice a month, unbridled passion, little time for anything else besides. She knew I was married and didn't press the issue. I expected it to end when she found someone serious, but had never voiced that concern.

""I've got a meeting in thirty minutes, start getting ready."" ""Right,"" I said, ""where are my pants?"" ""Over here, by the desk chair.""

I got up and crossed the room to the chair. I put my arm around her waist as I passed her. Our eyes met, I gave her a kiss on the lips. She put on her bra, a white one with small, navy polka dots.

Later that day, at home with Irene, a hint of guilt crept up on me. Irene was everything I wanted in a wife. Except that, too late, I had realized I didn't want a wife. I was good to her and she was good to me - whatever that means. We travelled together, had a wide circle of friends, attended various events in the city, all the typical husband wife stuff.

2fcj4x,5,2014-09-03,"I feel like my boyfriend and I ate drifting apart, Advice?",thr8waway5,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/2fcj4x/i_feel_like_my_boyfriend_and_i_ate_drifting_apart/,"On Mobile

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little longer than two years. For the most part, these two years have been great, he even got me a promise ring for our anniversary. He's been nothing but kind, supportive, loving, and understanding all this time. 

I went on an internship this summer (both in college, I'm a year ahead). And ever since i came back i feel like we're a little off. I got involved in student torment this year and have things to do all day,  so does he with his classes. We definitely don't see each other as often as before... 

Ever since I came back home,  I've had several occasions where I felt like it's hopeless. We're both studying engineering, but because of what what we each want to do, I feel like the possibilities of staying together after college are slim. This is a conversation I've tried to bring up, but he doesn't want to talk about it, he says it's still a while away and there's time to figure it out. I'm not as optimistic as him. 

This has led me to be torn in half: pay off me wanna to just love by the moment and enjoy the time we have, we care deeply for each other, we might even love each other. Pary of me thinks I should forget about that and focus on spending the with my best friend and love. 

The other half feels like there's no point on staying in a relationship when it's likely not going to work. That part just wants to be single and enjoy that,  I'm in college after all. 

Because of this, I feel anxious and insecure and may be having some knee jerk reactions:

1. I'm developing a small crush on a guy in student government, rationally I know why it developed and I know that it's nothing compared to how I feel about my bf (its completely one sided and probably due to spending so much time working together). I'm starting to feel like he's the only one I can talk to about this, which was a big reason for me to post this,  I don't want to get emotional support from him while still in a relationship. 

2 I avoid my bf at times, I say I have to study or meetings, then I get depressed when he's legitimately busy studying

3. I get anxious when my bf tells me of a problem he's having academically. I think this one is due to the fact that a small party of me is afraid of him not graduating (Even though he's very smart) or of him feeling inferior to me (I get mostly As in class). Today when he told me about a test, I lethally told him I would usually listen and try to help but that I honestly could not do that today bc I was to stresses, he hung up soon after to study)

4. All of my friends are either his friends to our my brother's friends,  I don't feel comfortable talking to any of them about this so I ended up telling some of my worries to the other guy (the whole drifting apart bit) he did a great job at telling me I was doing great at SC (everyone there says so) and that he wants me happy (he was halfway drink with his buddies so not the best speech ever). The gist of it was don't worry and spend time with your bf. Taking to him actually helped me a bit.

5. I sometimes feel like I'm a robot when it comes to this stuff, that I don't feel things correctly or at all, I've been having a lot of these thoughts lately. 

So I'mat a Crossroads on what to do,  I know I have to talk to my bf, but I don't know how to bring it up. I feel like I'm getting a panic attack when I think about it, or think about not being with him. At the same time I don't want to feel like I settled down too soon, he's my first real bf and college doesn't last forever... I guess I just want some help spring through my own thoughts.
Right now there's times I just feel disgusted at myself...

Tl;dr I feel like my bf and I ate drifting, which has led to a bunch of self hating feelings, anxiety, and a panic crush and I don't know what to do. "
2fd8uw,2,2014-09-03,ME (24M) losing touch with my (25M) friend of 10+ years because his girlfriend (26?F). I don't know how else to put it. (wall of text),IMGOINGTOEATYOURMOM,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fd8uw/me_24m_losing_touch_with_my_25m_friend_of_10/,"Warning wall of text incoming along with backstory to put it in perspective.

My friends name is ""tony"". He is part of my group of my childhood friends that has been together since we were all very young. When I met him he was just some kid that said your mom was hot when she wasn't looking, and turned into a polite little gentleman when she was looking. Good times. 

The girls he is attracted to are heavy set, unattractive, and generally don't have their shit together. Before, I just assumed he was into BBW and would poke fun at him along with the rest of our group. Lately I look back and realize he is not and might have some serious self esteem issues concerning women. 

 His first LTR relationship was when he was 18-19 and ""isa"" (his then gf) was 24, over 260 lbs, with a 4 year old kid. It was toxic, he cheated on her a couple of times over the course of 3-4 years (maybe 4 times) with mostly other BBW...and my cousin. My cousin is actually really good looking and was a model. Me and my brother ""sean bean"" agreed to hook him up if he was looking for a new relationship. He cheated, cousin went back home from vacation, tony went back to Isa, and continued the cycle. 

I bring this up because this set the precedent for how bad his relationships would go in the future and the types of girls he dated. They were all...large and didn't have their shit together. He on the other hand always had a job, a car, helped his parents pay THEIR bills, and continued to learn about his job. I won't bring up examples but it got so bad, he stopped telling the group about what he was doing in the girl department. (we were all really close and always talked about our SOs, the girls we were seeing, the girls we had crushes on). We never made fun of the girls he was seeing after the ""isa"" incidents, we did scold him on being a shitty bf and stringing her along if he didn't see a future with her (plus the cheating thing with our cousin)

The group found out he wasn't a chubby chaser when he met the girl next door/that got away/etc. from high school one day. They had begun talking and (I was away for work in another state at the time) he introduced her to the group. She was (from what I hear) pretty, interesting, polite, had a well behaved kid, a good internship, a good job, continued education, the works. It didn't work out, they had been ""talking"" for 6-8 months and because he never asked her out she couldn't really wait for something that may not be serious. She took a job some where far away to provide for her kid. He took it hard, and still thinks about her to this day. 

Now on to his current GF. I will say his current gf is polite and seems to have some semblance of having her shit together. She is a heavy girl and got heavier as I've known her. When they met, I was overseas working so this is all coming from sean bean, the group, and his roommate ""legolas"". She has no friends and is not close to any family. She is anti-social by choice, and clings to tony pretty hard. Whenever I came to visit from work (4 years in total of vacations to back home every now and then) he would either be too busy to see me or have to bring her along. She would sit quietly in the corner and only interact when included by tony. he has jokingly asked me to be the best man, and has said she might the one.

legolas says that he basically never sees him because they go somewhere together or want their privacy. The most interaction any of the other group members have with him is 9gag spam. As grown men, we value sleepovers when we can have them. tony has been part of one in the last 4 years when his gf went on a trip to visit family...and he spent it on his phone 60% of the time. 

I basically feel like we're the back ups in case it doesn't work out (like previous relationships). essentially we don't talk unless I visit legolas. Should I accept this is how it will be? if they break up do I pretend it's normal again?

TL;DR super clingy girlfriend may become childhood friends wife. Don't know what to do. "
2fdf9q,2,2014-09-03,[Help] It's back... What should I do?,os3000,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2fdf9q/help_its_back_what_should_i_do/,"Yes, my anxiety is back. I've been dealing with it for the last five years. After 2 years it got better. It would come once in a while, but most of the time it was manageable and didn't it last long. But this time... it feels just like when it started.

The unfortunate part is that I'm pretty far away from my comfort zone, since I'm doing an internship abroad. I'm suppose to be done with it next week, but the I can't take this anymore. When I go to work, I get so anxious I can barely function. I've gotten a couple panic attacks these last week, accompanied with constant feeling of impending doom, derealization and a feeling like I'm about to get sick. Also, all the other symptoms like dizziness, upset stomach, numbness, etc., you know the drill. Especially when you start thinking you have other diseases, but lets not get into that, I have history of been quite the hypochondriac.

Right now, I can't pinpoint the reason for this, I was doing just fine and all of a sudden I start feeling like this. It's hard, especially since the place I'm in is so different from what I'm used to, that when I walk outside I feel like I'm in an alien planet. Right now, what my minds is telling me is to do is to stay in my room and don't come out until I have to leave, but the fact the I'm leaving soon makes me think I should try enjoy the rest of the days I have left.

I don't know what I should do, I feel like I should stop going to work, but what would they think. Is there any tips that I could follow that will keep the anxiety down maybe a bit so I can deal with it until I have to leave.

Thanks for reading this, makes me feel a lot better to get it out of my chest. "

2fdho9,38,2014-09-03,DAE go through a period where you believed you had really good parents?,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2fdho9/dae_go_through_a_period_where_you_believed_you/,"This may come across as very strange, but I'm genuinely curious if anyone else had this experience:

Growing up, crazy insane shit would be going on in the house.  I've posted before, so you may have read my accounts of these goings-on.  Basically, it seemed very obvious to me that the things going on could only be described as abuse and I thought this was obvious to everyone in the family.  OF COURSE we were a dysfunctional family and us kids were abused.

Flash forward to age 21/22.  I was writing an essay so I could get an internship working at an agency that helped abused children.  I wrote that I wanted to work there because I had been an abused child and could relate.  I ended up not sending that essay because I decided it was better not to reveal that about myself, but the unsent essay ended up sitting on my desk in my room.  

My mother found the essay, read it and confronted me about it.  She was furious.  I was confused by her anger because yeah, I was abused as a child.  Didn't she know that?  My mother reacted with such genuine disgust and revulsion that I would think that I was abused as a child, that it made me doubt reality.  Just from that one interaction, I decided that my mother was right, I hadn't been abused. I decided:

""I was a teenager and teenagers are hard to deal with.  It was mostly my fault""

""My parents practiced tough-love, and thank God they did because I'm a more successful person because of it.""

""My parent's parenting was unconventional but clearly superior to the way other people parent""

I went from believing I was abused to believing I was blessed! Anytime there was an abusive interaction, I decided that it was my fault and I needed to be better.  I actually felt bad that my parents had to have someone like me as a daughter.  

This continued until about 3 or 4 years ago when I realized that I had perfected my behavior but my family was still treating me like a teenager.  That's when I realized that it wasn't me and that yes, it was abuse."

There's multiple things I'm thinking about now; Do I change schools? Majors? I don't really want to start from scratch, plus I really dig computer science. How do I tell my family?

I always hoped I'd never need to post anything like this, but I guess the world is cruel. I guess I'll start at the beginning.

About this time last year, me and this girl started following each other on Twitter. I didn't know why at the time, but there was something special about her. But anyway, we occasionaly tweeted for a few months and started using Snapchat, and we were really getting on. Fast-forward to late January, and I asked her if I could have her number, she jumped at this chance and even downloaded Whatsapp just so she could talk to me. I could tell this was special.

Before her, I was a mess. I was depressed, I had a job I hated and the degree I was studying at the time was, and still is, practically worthless. But then she came along, and everything changed. She made life worth it. We hit it off so quickly and within two weeks we were messaging all day, every day, and both admitted that we had fallen for the other, hard. Not much else needs to be said about this, plus I'm in tears just typing this out, so it's hard. It was just an incredible 6 months, I've never been happier. She was my best friend, my soulmate, my everything. She is the first girl I've ever loved, and the first girl to make me feel like I'm worth something. 

I always planned to visit her, she lives in America while I live in the UK, so I saved up and I finally went to see her mid-August. Things had been hard for a month or so beforehand, but I just thought this was because our first visit was approaching and we both had a lot of expectations. Seeing her for the first time in person, oh man. Even more gorgeous than I ever thought possible. Hugging her for the first time just felt right. This was the beginning of my life, I knew it. I was so happy to just be with her. 

However, this is where the story takes a turn. I was over there for her 21st, and we went out with her family. This was my first time meeting any of her family, obviously, and I really wanted to make a good impression with her dad, but in doing so I didn't pay as much attention to her as she would've liked. Long story short, this upset her a lot, and we slept in different beds that night. I'd only been there 2 days at this point, but the tone of the visit was set. We had a few major arguments about us, both of us broke down crying a few times, and I really struggled to make up for my mistake, which is what it was, a mistake. But we still spoke, and we both said that we would try and work on things once I got back to England, and she even uttered the words ""we can do it"". The 7 hour flight back was excruciating.

Anyway, I got back last Thursday, and she probably sent me 4 messages before she told me she didn't want this anymore at the weekend. I proceeded to become a stage-10 clinger after this, and must've messaged her 15-20 times that night, just begging for another chance to work on things. Again, no reply from her except that she doesn't want it anymore. I eventually ""accepted"" this, and sent her a message a couple of nights ago just thanking her for everything and that my time with her was the happiest of my life. She replied a day later saying that she appreciated the message, and she's sorry but that we just aren't meant to be, that she doesn't feel anything anymore and she knows it's going to be impossible to get the spark back. This hurt me even more, and while I only sent her one message back before deleting her number, it still sounded pretty desperate, but I just don't know what to do. I genuinely cannot imagine not talking to her all day, I just can't. I don't want to.

The things we spoke about, fuck. We talked about marriage, moving in together when the distance is finally closed, what dog we would get, where we wanted to travel. We sent each other countless songs and messages professing how we feel. I've got a love letter from her in my drawer that makes me break down every single time I think about it. We had something special, and I just can't believe one mistake from me has led to her wanting to throw it all away.

As a side-note, she's going to be extremely stressed for the next few months. She's got two jobs, as well as an internship for college, and on top of all that she's in her final year so she's got her thesis to concentrate on. Deep down, part of me thinks that due to this stress, she'd just find it easier to end things rather than really try, but I dunno. Maybe I just think that because it makes me feel better. I just can't understand how everything we spoke about now means nothing to her. We were so close, we connected so well and were each others best friends. I don't understand. 

I don't know why I'm posting. I guess I just want advice on how to proceed. I know NC is the go-to method, but thinking of a life where I don't talk to this girl just depresses me and I don't want that life. I can't imagine my life without her. Nothing has any meaning anymore, I don't care about anything. The last few days have consisted of sleeping, waking up and crying until I can sleep again. I've been out with friends, it didn't help. Talking to my parents didn't help. Nothing is helping. I guess I just want to know that it'll get easier, and that I won't miss her as much, but I just can't see that as a reality. She was my light, and I'm nothing without her. 

If you read all this, thank you. I'm sorry it's a bit muddled, I broke down in tears numerous times while typing this and had to stop. Any advice/comments/questions will be amazingly appreciated. I suppose I just wanted to reach out to someone, anyone.

TL;DR: My LDR girlfriend of 7 months broke up with me after I visited her, and I'm struggling to imagine a life without her and I can't foresee things getting better. "

Bill : Common mistakes, getting 100% of your benefit",piedpipernyc,Veterans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/2fdyz0/the_gi_bill_common_mistakes_getting_100_of_your/,"Hello, I'm a US Navy Veteran who used the GI Bill and came out with a job 2.5 months after the last day of class. I want to give some common issues that you, as a newly released veteran, may encounter.  
  
*edit:*  Made corrections. This covers **only** the 9/11 GI Bill.
  
* **When will I get paid?**  
&gt; The VA, like the military, pays out 1 month behind.  
&gt; Start school in August? Get paid September.  
&gt; The exception to this is ""first payments"" and ""school changes"".  
&gt; Essentially if you just got your certificate of eligibility, your **school** VA rep will likely be slow as fuck to process the paperwork. Until the VA receives this paperwork from the school, VA will not be able to process a penny.  
&gt; It is therefor to your utter benefit to apply for a college and get in contact with the school's VA certifying official *months* before school starts.  
&gt; Even with prep, expect your first month's rent 1.5 months after school starts.  
&gt; It will be back paid.  
  
* **My housing allowance doesn't cover my rent, is too low**  
&gt; Do. The. Research.  
[Housing Allowance is based on zip code of your school.](http://militarybenefits.info/monthly-housing-allowance-mha-for-post-911-gi-bill/)  
&gt; When they told you G.I. Bill is a once in a life opportunity, they were not joking.
&gt; Almost all schools will accept you / be lenient on your SAT scores.  
&gt; Apply for your dream school, not the one ""back home"".  
&gt; Like the military, you can move back after you are finished.  
&gt; I say this because the disparity between zip codes can be enormous.  
&gt; Let's take a ""lazy"" Sailor, who after a tour in Norfolk decides to stay and go to college nearby.  
&gt; His Allowance? $1497.00  
&gt; That might be enough to pay rent, but not much more. Hard to say you're 100% dedicated to school when you have to get a full time job.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt; Now let's take a Sailor who did their homework, and decided, hmm, I'll go to school in London.  
&gt; Yes, I said London.  
&gt; Her allowance?  $3744 (nyu program) 
http://london.craigslist.co.uk/roo/  
&gt; Wowza! You can get a sublet for ~300 pounds!  
&gt; That's a difference of 90% of your allowance going for rent to 11%...
&gt; I dunno about you, but that's a lot of trips to Europe. Or even a nice nest egg.
&gt; It might even be enough to support your military wife's outrageous deployment spending habits!  
&gt; Let's bring it back to the states for a moment, we want zip codes with high Cost of Living.  
&gt; San Francisco: 3369.00  
&gt; NYC: 3744.00  
http://images.military.com/media/benefits/pdf/2014-with-dependents-bah-rates.pdf  
&gt; Only pay attention to the E-5 column.  
&gt; You can switch schools! The form is available online.  
https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits-portal/ebenefits.portal;EBEN_JSESSIONID=t0zpTpZQzpfs5ZmhB2nyvK99J1Lhw2D0Q1yJKlbT9q541NYpbL0T!-74644933!549966189?_nfpb=true&amp;_nfxr=false&amp;_pageLabel=Vonapp  
  
*  **The VA takes forever to answer / fix my issues. Phone support is down**  
&gt; I believe you. Most of veterans I've talked to hate the 1888 number with a vengeance.  
&gt; Guess what? VA has an email system JUST for G.I. Bill issues.  
&gt; This means no fighting against thousand of veterans!  
https://gibill.custhelp.com/app/ask/  
&gt; It's secure so feel free to add the the relevant documents, they do processing too!  
&gt; I've seen processing times as short as two days, and the reps are very helpful.  
  
* **Help! It's January 1st and I only got half my rent check XD !**  
&gt; Congress in their infinite wisdom, decided to stop paying for college breaks.  
&gt; This means during any break longer than a week, your next check will be smaller.  
&gt; Summer? Yeah, your ""housing"" isn't covered. Can't sleep in a classroom?  
&gt; How I survived this was saving. Being in a ""higher"" BAH area and saving Pell grants.  
&gt; I also did part-time contracting and other work that built my credibility as a professional and got me my current job.  
  
* **I'm utterly hating / failing a class. I'm just going to drop it.**  
&gt; *Stop!* Do not pass go, do not collect $200.  
&gt; The VA only pays for classes you attend. If you've already passed the course drop date, you are still liable for the bill.  
&gt; The VA would rather pay for an ""F"" or ""D"". If you drop the class at this point, expect to pay back a large amount of money.  
&gt; My perspective? Only certain jobs ask for grades, if yours is not one of them, bite the bullet and take the lower letter grade. You must complete attendance for the class.
  
* **Other helpful stuffs**  
&gt; I highly discourage using your GI Bill for anything other than full time.  
&gt; Your benefit is given by ""time"" and not ""usage"". 
&gt; This means my $10,000 full-time 3 month term is worth the same as your $600 part-time term to the VA. It's the veteran losing in that situation.  
&gt; Ideally, you'll take MORE than recommended credit hours. If your school is yellow ribbon, it's near impossible to go over your maximum tuition.  
&gt;  
&gt;.
&gt;    
&gt; Unless you are going for that perfect 4.0, it's worth taking that extra ""required"" class and getting a C.
&gt;  
&gt;.    
&gt;  
&gt; This is college. Just like military, it's up to you speak up if something is wrong.  
&gt; Can't turn that paper in on time? Grade circling the drain? Be proactive.  
&gt; Find out your professor's office hours and talk to them professionally.  
&gt; Never beg.  
&gt; Explain the situation, what's wrong, and ideas for ways you can make up the grade.  
&gt; 90% of the time they will help. Why? They've seen the tears, the lies and are typically refreshed by a student who is taking responsibility.  
&gt; Other 10%? Typically have very very bad ratings on ratemyprofessors.com (Always check before term)  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt; After college:  I'm assuming you went because you wanted a better paying job?  
http://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2enhic/as_a_recent_grad_you_go_to_college_to_become_more/  
&gt; The trend I've seen is only government agencies actually *want* to hire veterans.  
&gt; All the other companies are posturing as a marketing stunt.  
&gt; This means you need to take that large ""military"" experience block and fudge it a bit.  
&gt; Put it so US Navy, US Air Force etc gets alot of focus vs the job title (SGT, PO).  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt; The experience section needs to be broken down kindergarten style.  
&gt; E-6 with 3 years? ""Ability to lead, manage, and communicate professionally.""  
&gt; Nuclear Technician? ""Worked with system y, system q, tool v.""  
&gt; As you get contract work, part-time, internships, switch as many of the experience sections as you can under these section as you can without being called a liar.  
&gt; What civilian employers do is see military experience and their eyes literally gloss over or they skip it.  
&gt; I've seen it twice while watching them read my older resumes.  
&gt; What your doing here is putting in your real skills + experience and marketing appropriately.  
&gt; ""United States Marine Corp"" or ""US Army"" serve as *interest* points that differentiate you from other resumes, much as saying ""Won a nobel prize"" would.  
&gt;  
&gt; Lastly, City Government loves veterans.  
&gt; City jobs do not typically advertise openings outside their myriad Departmental websites, meaning you have an amazing chance to continue to serve your community."
2fe0fd,0,2014-09-03,I'm kinda battling with my own brain and suffering depression and anxiety about various things about myself.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2fe0fd/im_kinda_battling_with_my_own_brain_and_suffering/,"It's really really hard for me to put myself out here like this. I pretty much never post in big communities, especially Reddit, and ESPECIALLY about something so deeply personal, and I'm having to force myself to write this and at least talk to somebody, even if it's not my parents or someone like that who I should be talking to about this. I've been lurking here for a while now, just enjoying the content and reading comments and whatnot. Now that I'm here, I'm having trouble thinking of what to write, which is kinda typical, really.

Anyways, I've been sitting with my head in my hands whilst shaking a little thinking about the problems I have with myself. It mostly boils down to how much I hate my damn brain, usually when it comes to getting work done and focusing on tasks and making decisions and whatnot. I really need to tell someone about this and I'm too ashamed to talk to family about it.

At it's most basic, I've been having some real trouble with doing written work, things like essays or even just filling in online forms, where it sometimes feels like I'm putting things off (practically indefinitely, when it comes down to it) because I almost consider it to be like a mental torture in my mind. Lately it seems like learning new things, studying and writing up work and whatnot seems, in my mind, so difficult and boring that I sometimes feel actual physical anxiety thinking about doing things like that, like I'm considering taking a drill and jamming it into some body part of mine or some other painful thing.

It's been a bit of a problem for a few years now, but it's been really worse since I started university. In fact, I've completely missed a deadline for a really important piece of work like a few weeks ago which will probably mean I'll have to redo a year. I'm able to kick myself enough to do a basic plan of what to write about and find some books with good information in them, even thinking of a few sentences to begin writing with and flipping through the books to get an idea of their contents, but when it comes down to actually opening up a new word document and starting to type or actually actively reading for some time and taking in important information, my brain almost seizes up and immediately outputs an excuse to do the thing later or something stupid like that. When I inevitably miss deadlines, I'm mentally screaming at myself to just go do what I have to do, but I feel so anxious about it that it sometimes feels like an irrational fear or a phobia.

It pretty much makes me hate myself, and I feel ashamed about being unable to do stuff I have to do because I'm almost afraid of doing work. When I do actually do some work, I'm still constantly anxious about small details of the task and my mind is all over the place or (in the case of more straightforward, but dull, things as well as essays and whatnot) I just feel so mentally exhausted and dead that I often only get like 20-30 minutes of (really slow) work done in my own time. Really I sometimes feel like I have difficulty focusing on things because I'll sometimes just hop into my own head and start thinking about some tangential thing without even realizing it until I notice that I've not taken in a word someone's said for the past 10 or 20 seconds.

I really, really hate myself for this. I end up getting depressed and feeling guilty and hating myself for being a lazy git who isn't able to kick themselves into growing up and doing work, and that more often than not just saps any willpower I had left for getting the work done anyways.

I initially thought I had some form of ADD or something similar, because I would even sometimes get a bit hyper and end up annoying people inadvertently (which I do at times anyways) without meaning to, so I went to see a psychiatrist about it, and they said this difficulty focusing and such was being caused by general depression, and prescribed me to take anti-depressants (which I'm still taking), so now I never cry myself to sleep at night, at the very least (It happened rarely anyways, but I still felt shit most of the time). 

for a while, I thought I was better and was able to motivate myself to try and get some things done, but just now I've realized I still have this goddamn anxiety and general aversion and difficulty in doing tasks that are a bit difficult or tedious, and I still drift into my own head at times when I should be focusing on what people are saying, without even realizing. So I'm gonna make another appointment with the psychiatrist soon and see what to do from here, because I'm pretty sure I do actually have ADD or something and I can't stand it anymore.

Another thing I fucking hate myself for is the fact that I'm barely self-autonomous. Or, well, I can't think of the right word, but what I mean is that I almost never make my own decisions about things unless I'm by myself (and even then it's usually for something inconsequential like what to eat or what to spend my spare time doing) and I never have any clue about what new things to go see or do. Whenever I'm with people I'm often just passively following and letting others decide what to do or where to go and sometimes not even paying attention, because I end up in my own head by accident once again. I don't even really care what's going on at times, even if I should. If someone asks me to look and pick and put forward an idea for something, I'll start thinking about it, but again, it generally only works for inconsequential things. Ask me what I want to have a career in and I'll just say I've no idea.

My whole life other people were making decisions for me, namely, my parents and siblings (and friends, but again, for inconsequential things). I mean, I'll only ever go out if I either need something like groceries or whatever, or if a friend invites me out somewhere (and even then it's unlikely I'll go, due to not having the energy or motivation for nightclubs and pubs). My dad has been telling me what to study and signing me up for internships in his industry and saying I should take the chance and study abroad (which would probably be good for me), which I realize is a really good opportunity and that it's great experience, and I don't really mind doing it, but I'd be perfectly okay not doing it, as I don't really care. I even had to specifically say no to studying abroad because I didn't really want to do so enough to find out how to go about doing so on my own.

I pretty much never ever take the initiative to go out somewhere or plan a night out or a party or whatever, either. I always end up just sitting at home and only consider doing stuff like that upon the suggestion of others. I mean, really, left to my own devices, I'll just sit at home wasting time on a computer or whatever whilst eating and sleeping whenever seems right, only going out to buy food and whatnot. I never think to myself that I should actually do a new thing, and, as I said, I have pretty much no initiative or decisiveness. Fuck, I'll sometimes be unable to choose how to waste my damn time. I need reddit or youtube or something to show me some random stuff to spend time looking at. No decisions made by me.

Or, maybe only recently has it been happening more, because I recall really wanting to be a scientist when I was younger and making that choice myself because I found science and technical stuff to be fascinating and fun.

Which brings me to a similar thing I hate about myself, it's the fact that I lost the will and desire to learn. I think it started happening around halfway through secondary school (middle/high school for the Americans). I started finding science stuff just a chore and now, in lectures, I rarely find the things I'm studying actually interesting. 

It really really sucks, because I WANT to find it interesting, I WANT to enjoy technical things again, to look at a technical problem as a wonderful puzzle to ponder over and solve, but I just can't. Maybe it's the potential ADD, or the depression, or something like that, but I fucking hate my brain for it.

Worst of all, for many external things, like late homework affecting my grades and even my future career or the fact that I'll just keep getting more overweight and unhealthy if I don't go exercising more (I at least try not to eat unhealthily), deep down, right in my heart, I just don't care about myself. More often than not, I feel bad about things because of how it affects others and how they'll think of me or react to it, moreso than how it might affect me personally. I'll sometimes think to myself that if I were to die in a few minutes, I wouldn't really care. I'd probably be kinda relieved to not have to worry about my life anymore. Really, one of the only keeping myself from just killing myself is the fact that I'd leave behind family and friends that would be devastated about it, and the fact that I'd probably hate myself for doing so because it's the easy, cowardly way out. (You don't have to worry about me committing suicide, I'm not really considering it)

Whenever I think about it I feel horribly guilty and ashamed about all of this, mostly because my mother and father have put in so much work and sacrificed so much in order to give me such great opportunities in life and the chance to live a quite comfy life right now, as well. All they want for me is to live a happy, successful life, and every day it feels like I can't do that. I even feel ashamed for feeling sad about all this, I sometimes feel like I'm just feeling sorry for myself and that I should just shut up.

My life is fairly good compared to that of others, and it'll probably be great if I put in the effort, and I can't summon the willpower to make the most of it. That's kind of what it boils down to. I just don't have any willpower in me, and I can't find any, and it brings me shame. Fuck, I can't even go about calming myself down enough without having to talk to some people on the internet about it. I should really be waking up my parents and talking to them about all this, but I just can't handle the thought of disappointing them and I feel so ashamed about my problems that I can't bring myself to talk to them about it.

I, umm... Sorry for the huge post. I'm really scared about opening myself up so much like this. This isn't even a throwaway account, but I never post elsewhere, so I don't mind. 

If you don't want to read all that:

In short, I'm having difficulty with internal willpower to do things and I really hate my brain and myself and I feel really guilty and depressed about not being able to do the things I need to do for myself and my family. It makes me hate myself at times.

Sorry for bothering you guys about this. God, I'm frikkin' fighting with myself over hitting the submit button and actually posting this. Okay, fuck it, I'm just gonna click the button and hope for the best.

Edit: I forgot to add, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place for this. This was just the only subreddit I could think of to talk about this. Also, It's really late at night and I'm going to go to bed, so I won't be able to see replies until later. Again, sorry."
2fe319,4,2014-09-03,Mother woes,[deleted],BPDSOFFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDSOFFA/comments/2fe319/mother_woes/,"I'm a fairly no-nonsense person who has grown up in the shadow of my mothers BPD, chronic fatigue syndrome, and general shenanery. As a child my father would get mad at me when I would get mad at my mother (who was of course constantly throwing huge pissy fits over literally nothing at all). I've learned to walk on eggshells around her and since I graduated high school and went off to college and haven't had to really see her that much our relationship has/had improved.

For a little bit of background I am 29M, I was born in Oklahoma and adopted by my adoptive parents (mom and dad) when I was 3 days old. I am multi-racial (black/white, but I look... I dunno maybe Hispanic or native American or Samoan or Indian or..., no one can ever place me unless they actually guess that I am biracial, I don't look decidedly white or black) while my parents are/were Caucasian. They took me to Michigan after they adopted me where I lived until I was 9. Then my father got a promotion and we had to relocate to a suburb of Chicago (they kept the house in Michigan as a summer/lake home) where I lived until college. 

A lot of shit went down between me and my mother (and my mother and my father) in this period, but it's in the past and it isn't really worth mentioning since I assume you all know how BPD's behave. My father toughed it out, probably largely for my sake, and after I went off to college I was pretty excited because it is MUCH easier to handle my mother at a distance than it is to live with her. There were a few years in there where she actually bounced around from therapist to therapist, but she stopped getting treatment after I went off to college even though it helps immensely. 

My parents moved out of the house in the suburb of Chicago to a townhouse in a neighboring suburb while I was in undergraduate, my father retired (I didn't mention this I don't think by my parents are over 40 years older than me, so I am 29 and my mother is 71 and my father would have been older... spoiler, I'm getting there) and they bought a condo in Florida as a place where my father could fish and just relax in his advancing years. 

I graduated from undergraduate with a degree in psychology (yeah, mainly picked that major to learn how to better deal with people like my mother) rather uneventfully, and moved into their townhouse while I figured out what I wanted to do with my life. I probably spent around 9 months there and it got old pretty quick, but there it was nothing I hadn't experienced before and I just thought, ""once I just get out of here and figure out what I am going to do, it will be great"".

Well what I wanted to do was law school. Which I did. I started law school and moved into the city of Chicago with a few friends. It was great. My parents sold their town house and moved back to Michigan pretty much full time, save the winter months which they spent in Florida. I would see them over Holidays and sometimes they would drive into the city for an odd weekend (3 hrs between Chicago and the MI place) and we'd have dinner, but it was mostly just phone calls from a distance and me living my life, which I was more than happy with.

I graduated law school with great grades in Jan of 13 and had a paid internship at a small firm in the city which looked very promising to turn into an associates position upon my passing the bar, which I did in July/August of last year. 

And then on October 13, 2013, 5 days after my 29th birthday, 8 days after my parents came in to take me out to dinner for that birthday, 6 days after my dad drove to Florida to get the place ready for my mother to fly down from Michigan my father unexpectedly passed away.

Devastating in it's own right for my mother and I. He was truly my hero if I have ever had one, and he was the only person to put up with my mother (she no longer talks to her family. She wrote them off and some of them wrote her off as well. She did get along with her mother, but her mother had passed a few years before, and her father well before that).

Well I mean I had to take a sabbatical from my fledgling career to go and comfort my mother in the midst of this crisis. I am their only child after all and they have literally given me one of the most comfortable lives one could ask for at least in terms of financial security and material things so I drove to Michigan and was with my mother to help her get through the loss of her husband and my father.

I have no idea what I expected. I know my mom. I knew she was wholly dependent on my father and I was under no illusion that she wouldn't be wholly dependent on me, at least at first, but for some reason I though that maybe she'd changed, that she had stopped externalizing everything onto the world, just expecting everything to bend and break according to her slightest whim or taste. No. I am still here, in Michigan. I can't get a job here as I'm not liscenced, and the closest city that even has positions for attorneys is around 1.5 hours away. I have no connections. I have no girlfriend. I, luckily, do have a few friends from when I was a child that I have kept in touch with that have made a few of the weekends a bit more bearable and not mind numbingly boring.

I don't even mind being with her, REALLY, though. My main complaint is just how ungrateful she is. I had come close to leaving and moving back to Chicago more than a few times over the winter and early spring because ""I'm a no good bum that won't even get a law job and sucks up her money"". lolwut. I literally drive her to doctors appointments and sit there a good 15 hours a week. I have to drive her to casinos for 2 nights and 3 days a week so she can play her penny-slots. That's her ""therapy"" now. 

I have student loans for law school sitting in forbearance right now that are coming out of my ass.

My mother never worked a day in her life after she met my father.

He left her with close to 4M in the bank accounts and in assets. 

She can't help start paying down any of my student loans because ""she doesn't have any money"".

There is a bit of a silver lining, if you can call it that, which has come because I told her I would be leaving back for Chicago one way or the other at the end of the summer (I told her this in March) unless she started paying me to be her personal assistant (she ""can't drive"" and ""can't see"" and actually does fall semi-frequently so she does have mobility issues, but I don't think they are nearly as bad as she claims)(at the suggestion that she start paying me to do everything for her she told me about how she did it for her mother with no questions asked out of the goodness of her heart for 7 years) (the truth is she had a family and was financially stable and spent a week or weekend every other month at her mother's nursing home for 7 years, and I went with her on more than a few occasions. My mother was already like 55 or 60 at this point). 

So I gave her that ultimatum of either start paying me to stay in Michigan and be your lackey or I'm leaving at the end of summer and she ""semi-caved"", I guess, and bought a pretty sick condo in Chicago and is selling her condo in Florida next year (she can't go anyways because she refuses/""can't"" to or go anywhere by herself) so I have a place to live at least right off the bat... but I dunno, it really doesn't feel like a win at all. 

I want a normal life. I was so close. 

Just a little bit of a rant I guess. I'm moving back to Chicago at the end of this month. I just can't stand living with my mother. I've been out of work now for almost a year (oh yeah I forgot to mention that I was interviewing like in the Spring in Chicago and got offered a position but my mother guilted me into not taking it because I would be abandoning her in Michigan) and there is a lot of competition for lawyers and i'm nervious about that. I haven't had a steady girlfriend in the past year either and I am going to be 30. It wasn't supposed to go like this. I am good looking and educated and... living with my mother. fuck. my. life.

And it's not even like we're on great terms. I love her, of course, she's my mother. but I don't really like her because her illness. constantly talking shit about everyone once they are out of earshot, constantly talking shit about me to my face. lying and exaggerating constantly. so opinionated about the most mundane trivial shit. It's not ALWAYS like that, of course. we have our moments when we get along and she has a lot of great qualities when she isn't flying off the handle, but everything and anything can set her off, so it's like I just sort of try and answer her questions and agree with whatever she says or ignore (and I rarely agree with her opinions, mainly because she is a pessimist and cynical and I try to be an optimist and see the good in people, and she hates HATES when I don't agree with her or say things like ""there are other ways one could look at this that don't assume your oldest friend is a cocksucking asshole cunt bitch, and I just can't agree that this person is the most selfish person to ever walk the earth because they called 15 minutes after they said they were going to call you"") and that's like the extent of my conversations with her... and then she gets pissed because I don't talk to her enough...I just can't win.

Sorry for my pity story it really isn't that bad but I just found this sub and thought I would share my experience because I've never really talked to anyone who can relate. 

I have told her many many times she needs therapy for her personality disorder. She gets super pissed of course. I can't just leave her. She really doesn't have anyone that will deal with all her health issues, and she hasn't talked to any of her family in like 12 years (an because of that, neither have I). She talks to my dad's family but they live in New York. I am hoping it will be easier for her to get places on her own in Chicago because public transit is pretty easy, and I'll try to get her into therapy there too, but cutting her out of my life is not an option for multiple reasons, but mostly because she is my mom. And she's old... she's just so... old (well not THAT old, but 70's with mobility problems is old. She probably looks 5-10 yrs younger than she is and acts 5-20 yrs older than she is).

Anyways any comments or advice are appreciated; I don't have a TL;DR; I'm all pooped out writing the actual post."
2febki,9,2014-09-03,Had an unusually civil and candid conversation with my Father...then the TBM bullshit reared its ugly head.,ForlornKing,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2febki/had_an_unusually_civil_and_candid_conversation/,"TL;DR: My TBM dad just had to ruin an otherwise civil conversation when he accused me of looking for excuses to leave and then tried to control what I post on FB.

I swear I think there's a time limit on all my conversations with my TBM family where they say, ""Huh, it's been 30 minutes of civility, I think I'll be an asshole now."" 

I mentioned in a previous post about how I got into a huge argument a few weeks ago right after my bro's wedding when he decided to defend the clippers guy for his racism and then started talking about the ""gay conspiracy.""  Most of my conversations with my dad result in arguments like this so I avoid talking to him if at all possible.  

However, a few days ago I was offered a really great paid internship that could turn into a job in a really exciting career field and I was too excited not to share the news with family.  He was the first person available so we started talking. We were talking about school and work stuff and I mentioned that while I no longer believe in the Church the one thing I am grateful for is the exposure to public speaking I got growing up in the Church because it has helped in many of my classes (I'm in Law school).  

Of course, that lead to a discussion about my mission and I was pretty open with him about how negative my experience was with that and how it was the beginning of the end for my testimony.  He agreed that I had a particularly difficult mission and asked how that led to my disbelief. I told him about how underwhelmed I felt by Mormonism and how I thought my lack of enjoyment of Church stuff was my fault. It was the first time I felt like he was really listening to my account of my faith crises and I was hopeful for an era of increased understanding and civility with my dad... until he said, ""Okay so basically you weren't happy in the Church and decided to start looking for excuses to leave."" 

NO YOU CONDESCENDING ASSHOLE!!!! 

I firmly told him he was mistaken and that I had actually set out to prove in my mind and heart once and for all that the Church was true. 

He called me a liar, said I've always been a liar, and said that while I've calmed down a bit, when I first left, I was ""super anti"" and that everyone in the family felt like I was attacking them for their religion. 

I reminded him of all the terrible things everyone in the family said to me during that time and that I too felt continually attacked by everyone and was only trying to explain myself. He has no specific examples of ways I was ""anti"" but I have plenty of specific examples of how hurtful my family was to me during that time.  That calmed him down a bit as he realized that the hurt went both ways. 

He then said he needed to go, but he wanted to leave with one last piece of advice.  He told me to stop posting things on Facebook about my sinful lifestyle. Confused (I rarely use facebook and use custom settings for all my posts so my family doesn't see anything I post), I asked what he meant. Apparently, a couple weeks ago my exmo cousin posted a funny story about people smuggling in pork rinds and hard cider into a really nice restaurant and the conversation turned into us talking about food and wine pairings. This somehow got back to my mom who started crying when she heard. My dad said that if I didn't want to make my mom cry anymore I wouldn't mention alcohol or coffee or anything else sinful on my facebook. He went into a rant about how embarrassing it is to be my parent when I do things like that and how shameful it is for me to mention that I enjoy alcohol with a nice meal.

I scoffed and said, ""Mom's tears are not my problem, she has to come to terms with that on her own.  I'm don't flaunt my lifestyle, but I'm also not going to censor my life to hide your shame. Deal with it or don't contact me again."" 

My dad continued his rant about how I will never find a job because of this post, he said a good son would do whatever he could to prevent his mother from crying and that I've shown my ""true colors"" with my response. 

I hung up on him. He called me back and left a message saying that he appreciated how candid I was in our conversation and apologized for some of the things he said, yet he maintained that I keep anything in my life that does not comply with the standards of the Church to myself if want to have anything to do with the family. What. The. Fuck?

This was a couple days ago, I haven't responded.  Sorry for the super long post/rant I just can't handle shit like this and it even though it's been years since I left the Church it feels like I have made zero progress with my family. I just don't know how to navigate this crap and I'm about ready to give up on my parents completely."
2fece7,30,2014-09-03,Resume advice,baddapple,gameDevClassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/2fece7/resume_advice/,"I just finished looking through a 100+ resumes of computer science students graduating this spring. As I hiring manager I wanted to point out a couple things to help you stand out. 

- Don't just list your courses and the languages you learned
- Show me what you did or what you are capable of! 
     - Did you have an internship?
     - Did you work on a game on your own?
     - Did you participate in a Game Jam?
     - Show your passion
- Have a website 
    - This can show off you design and coding skills (Don't go overboard)
    - Provide Links to your projects
    - Provide demos you can download
    - Take time to explain why you built something a certain way or what you learned from the experience of coding the demo

I really don't care what you did in High School or what your GPA was back then. Unless you skipped High School and went straight to college or created your own startup. Tell me that story. 

Don't think you can graduate with a degree in CS and land a job in the gaming industry. You are not getting an accounting degree. The game industry is like the movie business. Show me your indie short or film. That is going to tell me what you can do and at the same time you can plan, start and complete a project. 

Stand out or you're going straight into the bin. Stop reading this and start making stuff! 

P.S. If you didn't go to college same rules apply. Build a resume of what you can do. I worked with a ton of talented people that never went to college or even were trained programmers. If you can do it show it. 

P.S.S I hope this helps someone. "
2feepr,3,2014-09-03,My story.,TigerGary,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2feepr/my_story/,"Please don't upvote this I just want to write my story in the hopes it makes me feel better.

	I actually have nobody to talk to about how I feel so maybe writing it down helps. Help isn’t there for me. I don’t trust anybody enough to talk to about what is going on inside my head. 

It all started when my father passed away 13 years ago. I was 9 and alone with my mother. We did have relatives and friends around us but that moment changed everything. I went from a happy little boy to a non-social person and locked myself up in my room 24/7. As years passed by, I had trouble sleeping on my own because I was scared losing the only that kept me alive, my mom. I went to talk to a therapist. It helped a little and I kept going there every 2 weeks for a couple of years. Several years later I lost both my grandmothers within a year. I was really close to breaking but knew I had to keep going for my mom. 

A turning point in my life was when I met my ex-girlfriend. It was the first time I was truly happy with how things went. She didn’t live close to me so I only went to see her in the weekends and vacations. After a great couple of years together with her, she realised she didn’t love me anymore so we split up. I lost some feelings for her so I wasn’t really heartbroken but it did hurt for sometime. Because I was away alot, I didn’t stay in touch with my friends, they moved on. It’s the only regret I have in life, losing them. I tried to get in touch with some but they all didn’t want to talk to me anymore. 

I was 16 at the time when it all went really dark. Family from my father’s side clashed with my mother over something that happened many many years ago, I’m still not sure what happened. It felt likei t was all my fault at the time. I started cutting myself, on places where nobody could see the cuts. It felt like I deserved the pain for being such a horrible person. I finished high school and didn’t know what to do with my life. After recommendations from teachers I joined a car mechanics class because I liked working on and with cars. I had to look for an internship but there was no company that would hire me. Maybe it was my looks, I don’t know. I got turned down at over 20 companies. 
I decided to quit the class and enroll into a “what do I want in life” kind of course. It didn’t help at all.

This is when I found my breaking point.
I was desperate, alone and afraid. I tried talking to my therapist about it but it didn’t helped at all. When I tried talking to my mom about it, she just burried me, talked me down so hard it still hurts and I still can’t talk to her about anything. I had one person in my life I could turn to, but I was to afraid to talk to him about it because I didn’t want to ruin the friendship. I started cutting myself everywhere, wearing longsleeves every day. Nobody noticed until one fatal day. My mom asked me if I wanted to go look for a new kitchen with her and her boyfriend. I went because I had nothing else to do. We went to a place to look for one and sat down with a friendly gentleman who helped us design a new kitchen. I accidentally rolled my sleeves up, my mom saw the scars and nearly fresh cuts. She immediatly freaked out and called a psychiatrist. To this day, that was the biggest idiot I’ve ever met. As I went there with my mom, the psychiatrist asked me several question and I awnsered, revealing how I truly felt for the first time. Instead of helping me, he asked me every single time how I, yes I, could fix the problem. If I knew, I wouldn’t have came here. That were the exact words when I stood up and just left. I never went back and a few days later I just had enough. 







I wrote a my suicide note and hid it in my room until I felt ready to just end it. I still remember the day well. It was the 28th of September, a week after my father died 8 years ago. I couldn’t go any further, I decided to end it. I didn’t want to do it at home, I didn’t want my mother to find me. So I went to the nearest railroad track. (Please people, if you truly think about suicide, don’t do it this way. Train personal have to call it in and they are the ones facing dead bodies daily.) I left my note on my desk and went on my way. As I got near the tracks, I heard the train passing my, thinking to myself; “today it all ends, no more suffering.” As I saw the next train coming, I sat down on the track and closed my eyes. To this day, I still hear the breaks of the train, the horns and people screaming. The train couldn’t stop in time. Suddenly I felt free and happy, I thought it was all over. But then I felt a sudden pull on my arm, someone pulled me of the tracks. I couldn’t fight it, I didn’t want to pull him with me. When I opened my eyes, I saw the only friend I had left in the World. He came to visit me, asking me if I had anything to do but I already left a few minutes before. He found the note and rushed to the tracks. Later he told me he knew I was troubled but didn’t want to ask about it, because he was scared of my reaction. When my mom heard the story she didn’t say anything, didn’t talk to me for days.. Somehow, to this day. I still wish I didn’t wrote a note and it all ended there. 

Fast forwarding a couple of months. I started working because I didn’t know what course I wanted to take in college. I worked for three years, worked 40 hours a week and I had fun at the job. Three years later I thought I found what I wanted to do. I left my job and went back to school. I always had trouble with schools, not with learning but with the teachers. Learning comes easy for me so I never have trouble keeping my grades up but I haven’t found a single teacher who actually cared for students. None. So I thought to myself; “college must be different, lets give it a try.” I got right in it and did two and a half year of college in one year. Leaving me just one and a half year in my second year to do. It all went well, good grades, new friend, nice teachers. But then I had to look for an intership. Something I’ve never wanted to do again in my life. A teacher told me he had a place where I could do it so I called them up and surely, I found one. 6 months later I finished it, learned practicly nothing. I never told my teachers because I didn’t want the time I’ve spend working there to be a waste. In the following six months, I finished the rest up and have only my final internship remaining.

The present. Three months ago my teacher told me he had another place for me, a good company with a proper assignment. I asked him several times if I needed to search for another place just in case. Everytime he told me No. So I didn’t and went on holiday. During these last 3 months, I asked my teacher several times for the companies name, Phone number and their supervisors name. I recieved the need information three weeks ago. When I was supposed to start my internship. I called them and they told me there was no space left for me to do my assigntment. I was gutted and told my teacher, telling me I had to find another internship a.s.a.p and gave me a list of companies. None, not a single companie had a spot left. Now my teachers are basically telling me to find it on my own. So I did.

Two weeks ago, a close friend of mine, someone who I call my father. Who always took care of me when I needed it the most.. Got diagnosed with Dementia. He’s only 55 years old. I am back at rock bottom. I never actually liked the classes I took. I just took them because I want to graduate. I really don't know what I want to do in life, I have no passion for something, no real talents and no social skills. I'm in desperate need of an internship with no help from the idiots who got me into this mess. Talking to my teachers had no use, I tried and they immediatly got up and told me I should just quit school. But the worst part for me is that my best friend at the moment is slowly dying. I have no more energy left to look for other companies, no clue what I want to do when I’m done, and I’m losing yet another father. I am not willing to end it, life is precious and there are so many things to see. Everybody is telling me I should just get up and look for opportunities. Not knowing how I feel. I just want to get rid of the pain I’ve been feeling for years. Everyday is a struggle, I can’t keep up with it anymore. I wish it all came to an end years ago. 

I would like to leave it with this description of how depression feels, how I feel at the moment. http://i.imgur.com/ihTnzCw.jpg

2fej2d,1,2014-09-03,Tips on covering smell of burned trees? Air vents specifically?,DayvyT,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2fej2d/tips_on_covering_smell_of_burned_trees_air_vents/,"Long time lurker in trees here, first time poster so ENTs I'm looking for your advice. I recently moved into an off-campus student house for the school year. Since i was in an internship program this is my 5th and final year at college and the majority of the people I met in my years have since graduated and moved on, thus I had to get a house with some strangers, still students however. I've only known them for a few days but so far they seem cool.

I proceeded to partake in trees last night, perhaps a bit foolishly for it being in a new house with people I don't really know. Apparently it danked hard as I am on the top floor and my roommate in the basement mentioned to me that he smelled it. He was quite cool about it to be honest, said he enjoys trees also but not indoors. There are two others in the house that were away at the time but I've been told they do not partake in trees. 

Now I know at this point many people want to say ""come on OP just go outside"" and believe me, that is my plan C if there is absolutely nothing else I can do about it. However I'm not convinced I have to go there just yet. 

I know I know, at this point I'm being slightly immature, and it really would be better for everyone if I just went outside, but I live in Canada and come November that is going to be quite difficult to do on a regular basis. Also i am quite a regular tree enthusiast, I would say I'm enjoying trees every 2-3 hours, so I would really like to not need to take everything outside and back in multiple times every day. So if you could all please try and help me by suggesting stealth strategies that don't result in me needing to take my activities permanently outdoors it would be much appreciated. I know it's unfair for my roommates to have to smell trees when they don't want to but I don't know what else to say except I really really really don't want to always HAVE to go outside to smoke. I thought those days were behind me after moving out with my parents years ago.

Anyway to explain the situation in greater detail: I'm pretty convinced the smell travels down through the vents. My room is rather large, not huge, but bigger than most rooms college students can get. The door to my room is considerably airtight on its own and I placed a towel under it. After coming up the stairs I could not smell anything in the hall until I entered my room, however I acknowledge I may be desensitized to the smell. But since the basement roommate was the one to notice it, I am very convinced my bedroom door was not the escape point but the vents, as there is a floor vent by the area I was partaking. 

I have since made a water bottle spoof and practiced the art of a one shot hit to minimize smell, those are obvious first steps. When it was smelled previously by my roommate, I was smoking with the window open and the ceiling fan on, the window seemed to blow the smoke back in if anything. Due to my concern with the vent, I'm worried the fan and window may actually be moving the smell around the house and thus hurting my cause rather than helping. What is r/trees though on this? Is there any point where the fan does more harm then good?

Also does anyone here have experience with covering a floor vent before? Or put dryer sheets in the vent along with covering with a blanket/towel? I'm new to covering vents so I'm wondering what some good strategies are that other ENTs have used. 

Thanks everyone for your time. I'm hoping I receive some good advice! "
2fejkn,2,2014-09-03,How do you motivate yourself to go to work everyday? (+venting),Bubblez88,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2fejkn/how_do_you_motivate_yourself_to_go_to_work/,"I really struggle with this.  I quit my job about 9 months ago because I was having very intrusive thoughts, blinded in rage all day everyday.  I feel like I've made a lot of progress since then, but sometimes I question myself if it's all for not.  How is it possible to work 40+ hours a week for so many years and not want to blow your brains out?  I lasted about 2.5 years before I was totally burnt out (I do have a myriad of personal problems too, and the last job I was at for 13 months was an awful fit for my personality in retrospect and I should've never taken it in the first place...)

I've seriously contemplated moving to a lower cost of living area, working part time.  I worked about 25 hours during an internship in college, and I found it the perfect balance of feeling accomplished in getting things done with having enough free time to unwind.  40 hours just seems unsustainable to me long-term.

I wish I had more confidence in meeting people and making new friendships, but I really don't.  So I'm scared to move away and be totally alone and be swallowed up in isolation even more.  I live with my father right now.  I'm fortunate to have a surplus of money saved up, and I pay him rent every month as I feel it is the right thing to do (rent basically just covers my half of the bills).

I don't want to sit at home all day, but I don't want to burn myself out to the 40 hour work week.  But it was really the last job that left me feeling super unfulfilled.  My first job was much more interesting but my personal problems and the death of my mother during my time working there just left my personal life feeling miserable, but I felt accomplished at work.

I recently investing most of my money and started tracking my finances, and I also investigated financial independence, so I've been trying to give myself practical reasons to go back to work full time, but I just can't get past the hurdle.  Part time seems like it would be great, but is it really sustainable?  I don't know what to do.....I hate that mild suicidal ideation has creeped back in to my head this past week after being clear of that for 4 months.  But this time of year is always troubling to me, and I also had a panic attack at work this same week last year...  I just have to accept the feelings instead of resisting them...just be kind to yourself.

I'm sorry I just needed to vent, and I'm really upset right now.  It's been a roller coaster of emotions all week long.  I feel very alone and isolated from people...but I need to try and foster those connections more.  Maybe do something different idk.

So how do you find the motivation to go to work everyday?  Is long term part time work realistic or am I living in a fantasy?  (BTW I do see a therapist and am on Lexapro, practice mindfulness meditation, journaling...I'm trying to get better but sometimes it just feels so overwhelming everything takes so much energy...)"

I was hoping to get some organizational input from you fine coders.

I need to have weekly events with multiple time slots. Slots can be taken up by users. Users can only take up one slot per event. Some slots need to have an upper limit on how many users can fill them. Each event has an upper limit, but one that can be reached with any combination of filled slots.

I'm thinking about creating an array to represent each event.  I think it's best to use symbols to identify slots, with multiple versions (i.e. :fridayNight1, :fridayNight2, :fridayNight3) to allow for n number of users, and just use a simple incrementor to keep track of total users.

Is there a better way to do this? If not, is a for loop and a .intern the best way to look for room in a slot?


Thanks, guys. I've learned a lot from this sub and it's one of my favorites."
2fexfc,3,2014-09-03,I have been betrayed by the TLDEF and its staff.,[deleted],TransSupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransSupport/comments/2fexfc/i_have_been_betrayed_by_the_tldef_and_its_staff/,"When my insurance denied in April my request for prior authorization of SRS, Noah Lewis of the TLDEF said in May they were going to take on my case and get interns and even a law firm involved, all for nothing but my name, face, and story if we won.  Fast forward, they had me send a request for more details of the denial in June Certified to my insurance company.  I gave him a picture of me as part of my part of the deal.

Well, the insurance company didn't respond in writing, and even though the letter was delivered according to USPS the insurance reps denied ever receiving it.  The reps then told me that they wouldn't send the details in writing, anyway.

This was getting around the start of August.  I talked to Noah about this and he said that the next step was to send the grievance letter.  As the month progressed and I talked to him more, he was saying his boss wasn't interested in taking up these kinds of cases, but that he would continue to work with me personally.

Last week, he told me TLDEF's name will not go on anything that will be sent to the insurance company, by the order of his supervisor.  He said, though, that he had the grievance letter and would send it to me via email by Friday of last week.  He sent nothing on Friday.

I called and spoke to him yesterday (Tuesday), and he seemed very evasive, he seemed to have a hard time finding words.  He said the grievance letter was written, with references and everything, but in third person.  I was like, OK, whatever.  And then he said that he was very busy with the tasks TLDEF set for him, but he would have an intern look it over and assured me he would send it to me via email by the end of the day yesterday (Tuesday).

Nothing came.  I have not since heard a peep from Noah Lewis or the rest of the TLDEF staff.

Noah Lewis and the rest of the TLDEF staff have gone back on their deal and betrayed me.

What's more, it looks like the personal prophecy I made years ago, that reads I would never get SRS no matter how much I wanted or needed it, a prophecy that I always rue, that I struggle to disprove, is well on its way to coming true.  This betrayal is just one more piece of evidence for this prophecy.

2ff11c,3,2014-09-03,I fucking hate job reviews,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ff11c/i_fucking_hate_job_reviews/,"Actually scratch that, I just hate my job. 

I'm an accountant for a really small company, we have around 130 employees with very small sales volume. This job is killing me inside. On a good day I *maybe* have a solid 3 hours of work to do. The rest of my time is spent ""analyzing"". I'm not even a financial analyst, but I still end up combing through data and just staring at financial statements all day. 

Most of the time I just try to give off the illusion that i'm being productive. I'm actually not being productive, most of the time i'm just fucking off on reddit. I get so bored out of my skull that browsing stupid websites is the only thing that prevents me from going completely insane. It's become such a bad habit that my coworkers will openly scorn and ridicule me for browsing on reddit. 

""This is a place you come to work, not mess around on the internet!"". 

Everyday somebody makes a little comment. 

The job reviews are the fucking worst though. Job reviews are essentially just another opportunity for my boss to remind me how little he thinks of me, he has never said a single positive thing to me

""you lack motivation...you aren't utilizing your full potential...you need to get creative and find ways to make yourself more useful""

and does this motivate me at all? Fucking nope, this place is hell and I have no desire to give it ""my full potential"". Why? Because

- I was hired as a salary employee. However, on my first day I find out that we are required to work 10 hour days. This was HUGELY misleading since I was basing my negotiated salary on 40 hour work weeks... not 50 hour work weeks. 

- Additionally i'm told that I can ""make my own hours"" meaning that as long as I log 10 hours and get my work done, I can come and go whenever I want! Awesome, I hate mornings so I can come in a bit later! So on my 2nd day I come in at 9am with the intention of leaving at 7pm. What happens? I get fucking **scorned** openly for being 2 hours late. Apparently the ""make your own hours"" thing was bullshit, and what my boss actually meant was that I have the choice of coming to work at either 5, 6 or 7 am. Now present day, if i'm even 5 minutes late I never hear the end of it. FUCK MY LIFE. 

- I'm in charge of payroll. I was scored openly for helping an employee fill out their w4 so they can change their tax withholding. Apparently I don't have the authority to do this... even though I clearly do since i'm in charge of all of payroll.

- One day I came down with pneumonia. I told my boss and let him know that I was going home... he advised me that wasn't a good idea and that I should go lay down on the bathroom floor until I felt better. He brought this up as a negative thing in my review. 

- I got a flat tire on my way to work. I sent my boss and coworker an email explaining why I would be late. When I got to work an hour late my coworker was passive aggressive to me all day and my boss sarcastically exclaimed ""here comes the night shift!"" when I arrived. 

- also during a review my boss criticized me for ""routinely getting up from my desk and taking 15 minute breaks"". It's because i'm fucking going to the bathroom. He also criticized me for me excessive use of vacation time... even though I finished the year with 3 unused days of vacation. FFS. 

- Our company mandates that we eat lunch at 11:30am. I'm never hungry this early, so I usually take my lunch around 12:30pm. NOPE! Apparently I don't have the freedom to decide when I eat because ""company policy"". Also, using the internet at lunch? NOPE! ""our employees usually don't use the internet"". 

- One day after work I had the bright idea of emptying out my coffee mug into a bush outside the office. The next day I had a strongly written e-mail about the incident waiting in my inbox.... that was addressed to everyone in the entire company. I had to attend a meeting with the HR director and my boss where I was told that this was ""unbecoming"" of me and the company. 

- Since i'm in charge of payroll, I had to attend some meeting with a bunch of engineers since the Engineering supervisor was complaining that the entry level engineers were being paid too low. The entry-level engineers make about 1.5x as much as me, and also get regular bonuses. I had to sit there while these people openly negotiated new salaries... while i'm still on the same low salary I made 2 years ago. 

- I was given a warning for providing a fellow accountant at the company with pertinent payroll records that they needed to do their job. 

- Also since i'm in charge of payroll, I know everyone's salary history, raises, bonuses etc... because of this I happily retain the knowledge that i'm one of the company's lowest paid employees! I also get the privilege of knowing that interns make as much as me, and new hires make at least 1.5x as much as me. We recently hired a former intern who already makes twice what I currently make... and he hasn't even graduated yet. I'm also consistently one of the only employees who does not receive a bonus. Also the disparity between average employees salary and the executive level salary makes my blood boil. 

this is just scratching the surface, and I also feel like i'm the only employee there that realizes how fucking crazy this place is... and i've worked at fortune 500 companies before.

2ff3ks,10,2014-09-03,So I was hoping I could have a little help on a project,EllieMayT,orioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/2ff3ks/so_i_was_hoping_i_could_have_a_little_help_on_a/,"So I am a public relations major and I am set to graduate in december. However because of various limitations I haven't had any real internships or jobs (other than designing the logo for my dad's business) in my 3.5 years at college (YAY for graduating early though). 

Tonight I realized that the best way to get my foot into the door is to open the door myself and considering my ultimate goal is to work in sports (specifically MLB) I want to start a sports blog (for like the 4th try) and actually stay with it.

This blog http://elliemaygrowingup.wordpress.com/ is probably the best attempt I ever had at running a blog but my ADHD and procrastination got in the way and it fell to the wayside. This new blog I plan is mainly going to be on the Orioles (with off season stories about other teams as well but mainly DA Bears). 

So what I am asking from you isn't much mainly I need help with a name. I was thinking Lady Os Bro, but I am certainly open to suggestions. But also I ask to have you guys hold me accountable. I want to make sure I post at least once a week and if i can't post that week I least post a blurb saying why (final semester of college it is going to get busy). I want this blog to be something I am proud to link to on my LinkedIn page as well as put on my resume. 

So please help, I will give upvotes (too broke for gifts of gold)

Thank you

TL;DR OP wants to start blog needs name ideas and people to hold her accountable

UPDATE: So I named my blog My Orange Crush (thank you /u/EliteAsFuk)  and apparently one of the themes i can use on wordpress is MLB and I think its gonna be good (and hopefully i can still write the occasional post on other sports)

I'm gonna work on my first intro post later (i have class soon) and i'll post the link when its up"
2ff4aa,2,2014-09-03,"I'm trying to woo an older woman. She's 20-something, I'm almost 19. Help?",[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2ff4aa/im_trying_to_woo_an_older_woman_shes_20something/,"So, I'll try to explain the situation as fully as possible. 

I was on the football (american) team all through my highschool career. The local University has a program within their sports medicine Masters degree program where they send their students to work with a highschool for a year as a job and as practical experience in their field. This girl, I'll call her Jane, was my school's sponsored student for my senior year. 

Due to my unconventional position on the team I essentially spent every day of the season sitting on the sideline with her, talking, laughing, having a good time. Usual stuff, became pretty good friends but never did anything outside of football. There was a very distinct line of course, for instance she refused to add any of the guys on the team on Facebook because it was ""inappropriate"" for her to associate that way with her athletes. Bear in mind that I understood that and never even asked her, that question was posed from thirsty guys other than me. 

At the time I had been considering taking up sports medicine once I graduated, and she invited me to be her intern once the season ended. I took her up on it and to be honest I didn't really learn a thing, I was mostly just there to hang out. Eventually the school year ended and we parted ways. She was assigned to a local college this year instead of our highschool and we hadn't spoken until just recently. 

My senior year my football team won a district championship, the first time in the history of our school. The school invited all the graduated seniors (that meaning me) back for the first home game of the season (last friday) to be recognized at halftime. I went of course, and who's there but Jane? She gave me a big hug and we caught up, but eventually split. While we were talking with some other people, the topic of facebook was brought up. ""Oh yeah I would add Roy on facebook. I mean I couldn't before but *now*..""

At the end of the games the fans are meant to come down from the stands onto the field to.. well I don't know why, it's tradition. Anyways I saw her talking with one of the female coaches and as I was waiting for her attention me ex-gf comes over to talk to me about some random stupid crap (she was previously very jealous of the time I spent with Jane, although Jane didn't know who she was) and as she walks up Jane turns to me and with a very much happy/excited demeanor goes:

 ""Yeah you might be seeing me around here more often! I get off work around four so..""

Me: ""Oh yeah my schedule is variable every week but if *you're* coming then I can for sure get off!"" 

Her: ""Oh cool! Text me later and tell me when you can come!""

We then started to talk about my work, I looked away just in time to see my ex's hurt face. She cheated on me, shit was so cash. 

I texted Jane last night to ask her if she wanted to go to the game this friday (but I didn't ask her out, I was intending on warming her up to me gradually), which was an away game. She was originally only speaking of going to the home game which are every other week, but this week's game was about half the distance from where she lives compared to a home game, and I was eager to see her/keep her thinking about me. She said that she would but that she was working a volleyball game at her school that night. I then asked her if she was still going to be able to go next friday, and she hasn't replied yet. 

Now normally I would take this as a sign that she wasn't interested, but she was the one that invited me to text her, so that doesn't quite mesh. 

* She is 23-25, 10/10, almost has a masters in sports medicine. Great personality, smart, same religion as me. 

* I am 18, 19 in October, unknown attractiveness (I assume I'm passable). I have a pretty good job at a barbecue restaurant and I'm going to college. 

* I can very much tell that there is a maturity difference between us. I just graduated highschool and she almost has a master's. She is living on her own in a place far from her family (she's from Jersey, we're in Florida). I live with my parents because it's cheap. 

Do I have a shot here? I don't want to misinterpret her or otherwise make things awkward for her to the point that she feels like she has to tell me to stop hitting on her. How long do I wait to text her again, assuming she doesn't reply soon? I don't want to appear clingy or otherwise too forward. She really seems way above what a guy my age is capable of having in a gf and I'm afraid of screwing this up. What do? 

**TL;DR:** I was 18, caught somewhere between boy and man. She was 23 and she was far from in-between."

One student brought up the fact he is prescribed and using medical cannabis due to him suffering MS, but was having trouble securing an internship due to his cannabis use. While I understand that it may seem to be hypocritical to counsel clients for a clean and sober life, while using cannabis himself, it sparked an interesting thought.

1. Should his medical cannabis usage prevent employment as an AOD counselor? It seems to me cannabis is making huge lee-ways for medical purposes, as much as any other Rx drug for chronic pains.

2. What are the opinions of those AOD/MFT counselor's that are in states (Washington/ Colorado) that have fully legalized cannabis use? 

It is understood that any drug (legal/illegal) can be abused, but what if the counselor used medical cannabis properly, like you'd expect any other person being prescribed Rx drugs?

Just wanted some thoughts on the subject and maybe links to forums/ articles on this subject.            "

###The ""Live-Stream""

About 45 minutes in, Rebecca and Steve hosted an impromptu Livestream in front of all of us, where they stood and answered all our questions for 45 minutes. While many of these overlapped with [questions asked by you](http://redd.it/2eunal), I didn't get a chance to have all of them answered, so I'll find a way to get the rest asked.

###Secrets of the Lotus

As the night went on, we learned a few interesting Lotus tidbits, and had quite a few goofy moments! Here are some of those hijinks from the Lotus!

&gt; **Orokin Knowledge**

The Lotus revealed some great trivia and hidden facts about Warframe. Here are some of the biggest mind-bombs we heard:

* Rebecca writes some dialogue for the Lotus
* Rebecca was chosen as Lotus due to lack of staff and placeholder VA. Statements like ""Oh my god, go left!"" were used to pitch the idea of a Lotus guide. When it was time to produce more dialogue, Rebecca was asked to continue. And the legend of the Valley Girl Lotus began.
* Rebecca started as an intern at Digital Extremes in the Community department, where most interns work
* Rebecca and Sheldon dueled in Magic: The Gathering to determine the fate of Kubrows. If Rebecca won, all Kubrows could be ""consigned to the Lotus."" If Sheldon won, presumably puppy blender! The Lotus is 007!
* The Lotus may be 2000 years old! And presumably immune to alcohol, or so she claims.
* Grineer alphabet was created as an AR-game gimmick for the Closed Beta signups of Warframe! If you hovered over the center, the text would be replaced with Grineer font. Few people deciphered the message (which was ""GrineerSystems.com""), but the font would later be used in assets themselves and define the Grineer as a race
* Did you know the Tenno have a font? Those fancy etchings in Orokin Towers, on Warframes, and [even the symbol below ""Founder"" on the Founder's Exclusive T-Shirt](http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/18/70/02/48/founde10.jpg) are hidden messages, and no Tenno has yet to decipher the script!
* The next Prime is ""Rebecca's favorite""

Steve also had some insight into ideas behind Warframe:

* Warframe [originally started as a pitch/tech demo for their new IP, Dark Sector](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mucf3kdVzes). Unfortuantely, every publisher they talked to wanted them to pursue another angle. For example, one stated ""your engine is great, you should make a civil war game!"" 
* With a lack of publisher interest and waning funds, DE had to curb to publisher demand and [repurposed Dark Sector into the game it ultimately became](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnsjVO3Y6Rw). Michael Rosenbaum, tho!
* When projects failed to generate revenue, the company experienced massive layoffs and the verge of bankruptcy. Steve realized old assets for Dark Sector were still on servers, so in a last attempt, the remaining team worked to create the game they envisioned almost a decade ago.
* That game is Warframe. The contribution of Founders, fans, and gamers was a profit surge, bringing the company back from the brink.
* So do 75% or Plat discounts hurt DE? Not any more! So many people buy Platinum, DE just needs to ensure there's a good reason to do so. Example mistake; no one bought Oberon for plat when he was easy to farm.

&gt; **Update 15 and the Future of Warframe**

There were many questions asked of Steve before and after the faux Live-stream. Here are some of his off-the-record answers!

* *Why has Focus system taken so long?* Balance issues! We had to prevent power creep. We need this system to work with existing powers, not replace them entirely.
* *Where did Arcwing come from? We noticed the Mag Prime lore entry!* Yeah! We've had it in our heads for a while and teased Arcwing in that loreIt was based off the long-requested ""space battles"" suggestion, but with a more Japanese twist. It was inspired in part by Robotech/Space Harrier. There will most likely be an event to accompany the Arcwing's debut.
* *I want more bars to fill! More stuff!* Proxy Wars! Gaining reputation with different factions might yield lucrative rewards.
* GOLEM WILL RETURN; Grineer Galleon-sized monster that must be fought with ARCHWING!

&gt; **""The Lotus"" Recipe**

The Lotus tried to create her own cocktail... The Lotus. The attempt combined Hpnotiq and Cranberry Juice to make a deep purple concoction, but didn't turn out as well as everyone hoped (it was brown)

&gt; **""Dear Diary""**

[The Lotus wrote a few diary entries over the course of the night.](http://imgur.com/a/Lw2Kb#0)"

Its extremely difficult to get hired because I am full time. I've gotten interviews but never hired because most jobs prefer I have like 4 days free to work.

2ffiqq,4,2014-09-04,My 2014 as a New Hypochondriac,Zagaholic,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/2ffiqq/my_2014_as_a_new_hypochondriac/,"Hello everyone.  This is the first time I've been on this subreddit, and I felt compelled to share my story.  Both because I am hoping it will be somewhat cathartic, and because I know whenever I can find someone who can relate to the way I think about these things, or have had similar experiences, it really helps me - at least momentarily.  In that regard, I hope that reading this may be of some help to even one person who may read this.

So, this all started I'm going to say in February of this year. I graduated college in May of 2013 and started working in finance in July 2013.  Throughout my whole life, including and especially college, I had a million things going on and handled any stress (pshh who gets stressed?) very well.  Between hockey, finance club, ambassador programs, leadership roles, part-time jobs, internships, partying with friends, you name it...I had always handled it like a champ.

The new job, being out of school, moving to a new city, leaving family, etc. was all very difficult and came with it's stress, but I was still mentally and physically fine.  Then one day I'm walking to the train after work, and out of NOWHERE I just think...shit I hope I don't have HIV or Cancer.  Seriously out of nowhere.  It was the little seed that planted the Shitstorm Garden from Hell that I'm now trying to demolish.

Once the thought was planted, I couldn't get it out of my head.  I spent hours every day trying to diagnose myself by eliminating symptoms or trying to convince myself I didn't have others.  I would stare at my mouth in the mirror probably 10 times a day looking at the white gunk at the back of my tongue, trying to tell myself it wasn't thrush (big HIV sign).  Through this process, I noticed a white bump on the inside of my lip.  I used to chew tobacco very VERY moderately (like maybe once or less for a short amount of time)..so I. lost. my shit.   

Here I was.  Staring oral cancer in the face.  Reality seemed to become more like a movie.  This couldn't really be happening to me...could it?  But...the statistics...the people who chew a can a day for 20 years and don't develop anything....*whispering mind says..what about the people who do it for two months and get their jaws removed*..is it growing..is it hurting..is it a sore...does it look like this picture on Google?  What about this one?

I finally made an appointment with an oral surgeon.  He looked at the bump and said..""It's a scar.  Have you been stressed?""  Me internally: ""FUCK YES I THINK I'M DYING"". Me externally: ""Um yeah I've been kinda stressed lately"".  He says it's all good I'm probably biting my lip in my sleep....BUT he follows up with..t""he top of your mouth is a little white though.  Have you ever chewed tobacco?""  OH SHIT YES I HAVE. FUCK. I told him I did occasionally. I asked him if it was anything  to worry about and he said no, it can be normal in some people, especially if it doesn't hurt.

So I go home and Google ""hard pallet of mouth white"".  Do it right now.  Try to find something that doesn't say oral cancer in the first few pages of results.  So here I am right back to square one losing my mind. 

So I make an appointment with a dentist (I'm new to the city so I have no doctors, dentists..etc.) I see her and feel like I have to be completely honest.  I tell her everything.  The worry, the chewing, the oral surgeon, the bump on my lip, the roof of my mouth.. etc.  She was a total sweetheart, checked everything out, and brought it a second doctor to check me out just to give me some peace of mind that I definitely did not have oral cancer.

I left the office feeling great...for about three days.  Wait...but what about this white stuff at the back of my tongue.  Is this normal? Does it bleed when I scrape it off?  Does it burn?  Is it anywhere else in my mouth? Can I scrape it off at all?  What does the almighty Google have to say about this? I'll give you one guess and at this point you shouldn't even need one.   

HIV.  My other huge fear.  Now I don't consider myself to be very promiscuous, but I rarely used protection with the girls I slept with because I was happy-go-lucky-invincible-king-of-the-world up until now. So is it likely? No...but HOW unlikely is it?  I'll tell you exactly how unlikely it is.  As a male, if you were to have unprotected sex with a female who is HIV positive, your chance of contracting HIV are approximately 4 in 10,000.  This assumes there are no open sores or other STD's present.  4 in 10,000 or .04%.  Okay well what are my chances of even running into someone with HIV?  There are approximately 1 million people with HIV living in the US, which has a population of approximately 300 million people.  1/300  equals  .0033 or .33%. However, out of those 1 million people with HIV, approximately 80% are MSM, or ""Men who have sex with men"".  So, to take my absurd and futile exercise in statistics a little further, let's say that my chance of meeting an HIV positive female is .2 * .0033 which equals .00066, or .06%.  Trust me, I broke this down even further into race and demographic, all trying to reassure my frantic, panicked, crazy, sure-of-death mind, but let's stop there.  Let's say I have a chance of meeting a female who is HIV positive of .06% * the chance of contracting HIV from her which is .04%.  .04 * .06  equals .0024%.

That.  Did.  Not. Matter.  It seriously didn't calm me at all.  I had also had night sweats about a month after my last sexual encounter.  Google common causes for night sweats.  Top 3 are: Menopause, Cancer, and HIV.  DEAR LORD I WAS PRAYING I WAS GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE AS A 22 YEAR OLD MALE.  I also had (still have)a single enlarged, painless tonsil.  Google that.  I'm now leaning towards hoping I have cancer, since that's another one on the scoreboard for HIV. 

I couldn't shake it, and I didn't have the guts to go get an at-home test. If it came back negative, would I really believe it?  Would I trust the result?  If it came back positive...what I am supposed to do..sit there with my head in my hands with no resources and have to go to a doctor anyway?

So I go to the doctor for a physical, and get blood work done. The story of the mishap of how I got my result only adds to the craziness, but I'm pretty positive no one is still reading so I won't include that.  HIV came back negative..(duh..I knew that the whole time..?).  Kidney function..normal.  Liver function.. normal.  Cholesterol..normal. Check,check,check,check.

I just got all the good news last week.  Two days ago, I woke up with the left side of my body feeling slightly different from the right side of my body, so I may have MS now.  Kidding....kind of but not really.  I also have an ENT appointment for the tonsil on Friday.  I'm going to look for a psychologist who specializes in hypochondria, because this has got to stop.

TL;DR Hypochondria is a monster. The mind is an incredibly powerful thing, and when you turn yours against yourself, it can be very hard to reverse.  Good luck everyone.  Chances are, we are all OK."
2ffl8o,5,2014-09-04,"Had some free time, fell off the wagon, climbed back onto it. [maybe Rant]",Ritter_der_Zwiebel,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2ffl8o/had_some_free_time_fell_off_the_wagon_climbed/,"Hey loseit, it's me again (after a really long time..)

I'll try to keep it short and sweet here. The essence of what I want to tell you is that I fell of the wagon spectacularly. Four weeks ago, my six months long internship ended and suddenly, there was all the free time for me to eat. So I did. I'd never thought I would, but I did. Suddenly, it was so hard, not to take another walk to the fridge, because hmm, *you could eat something, couldn't you?* I tried out some new recipes for cupcakes and other pastries and always told me *Well, you're making them for the bf/mother/sister/whatever and not for yourself*
Ha ha. I went back to telling me the same bullshit from about four months ago. And then, I did the worst thing of them all: I didn't log my food into MFP anymore, because I was ashamed of what I had become.

Then came my holiday trip to London. And I feasted. On crisps, on cupcakes, on sandwiches, on wraps, on e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g.
The result was not as devastating as I thought, but it had an impact nevertheless. 
I left my internship weighing nearly 135lbs. I came back from London weighing nearly 145lbs.  


Now uni will start again and I'm working 10 hours per week additionally, so I hope it will get better again. I feel the same motivation that I felt when I started the journey in may, but I'm now terrified of what could be if I fall off the wagon again. My goal of weighing 130lbs is not that far away anymore and I don't want to fuck this up again. I've been doing so well and I never came this far before.


I don't really know what I want to hear from you guys, maybe some kicks in the ass, maybe some *stop whining you little idiot*, I really don't know. But thank your very much for reading though and I wish you all the biggest amount of success on your journeys :)

2fflsa,79,2014-09-04,"So, my gunsmithing apprenticeship recently came to an end. My (novice) thoughts.",AugustSun,guns,https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/2fflsa/so_my_gunsmithing_apprenticeship_recently_came_to/,"So, a while ago, I managed to get a gunsmithing apprenticeship at my local shop. This was fortunate for me, as the shop that I worked at was largely a custom shop, so they had products for sale, but mostly made income based off of services. Thought I'd throw down my experience with it all.




**The People:**
The names are changed to prevent doxxing.




**Stephen:** Head smith, got his start when he was younger on automotive work. In his 30's, almost always wore Hawaiian shirts. Damn good smith, almost never lost his cool, very quiet, but still could be pretty lively. Disliked 5.56, enjoyed Slavic hardware more. Nicknamed me Joey, like the baby kangaroo, mostly because for some reason when I'm learning new things or the least experienced at something, I ask dumb questions. No idea why, most of the time I make sense, just not in that situation. ANYHOW, he did most of the mill/drill press work, trigger jobs, any sort of precision modification was his doing.




**Sam:** Assistant smith. Was 25, if I recall, so around my age. Was kinda your typical conservative gun owner, but largely stayed away from talking politics, like Stephen. Aside from that, cool customer, easy to shoot the shit with, pretty relaxed. He mostly did disassembly, cerakoting, lighter stuff like that, primarily. 




**Jim:** Owner of the business, started in another college town by Cerakoting for people in his garage. His fiance wanted to move here for nursing school, so he moved the business up here. Expanded it when he met Stephen to custom work, and so far, been doing pretty well. Even does some work for PDs in the metroplex. Early 30s, most likely, seemed like a decent dude, but kind of treated me like an idiot at times. And at times, I was, but some of the others were unwarranted, but I ignored it. Talked a lot about his experience in the Army to customers, but when I asked him about it when I started... He pretty much said he failed out of basic (said ""he had a falling out with his commander""). But hey, runs the business, has the connections, can't argue with the results.




**William**: FN rep for the store. In his 40's, William was a relaxed individual who had a decent finger on the pulse. Last I heard, he was acquiring semi-auto MP7's for the shop, or something of the like. Don't remember exactly. I asked him how he became a rep, he told me it mostly came from him hitting up every single trade show he could. Must be tough, but he seems to be doing well from it.




**Me:** College student, 21 years old, studying journalism (the fuck?), figured I'd try and get to know a little more about the field than just the specifications about how the world of gunsmithing goes. I got my hands dirty, did some work here and there, but mostly really light stuff.




**The experience:** I got quite a bit of insight from what they were laying down. Stephen especially let me know what he was doing and why. I distinctly remember the first thing I watched him do was a 1911 trigger job, taught me that the reason older weapons tend to run fairly smooth is because the friction between the metals causes the metals to smooth each other out, providing for an easier, more refined trigger pull. Learned the basic common functions of firearms, such as the sear and disconnect, the bolt cam, and a few other things. Basic assembly/disassembly came with it, as well, and many manuals and PDFs were perused. 




To me, though, it seemed the process took quite a while for a full cycle of work for some of these weapons. It was most likely because it's a small outfit that's only open from 11-5 typically, but there were just some guns that were problematic as hell. One specific instance that I remember was my first disassembly job, it was a Marlin Model 60. No matter how much we cleaned it, assembled and disassembled, it just wouldn't cycle. Finally, after forever, we determined that it was the elevator spring that was giving us shit. Ordered the new part, still hadn't been fixed by the time I left about 2 months later.




On the retail side, the shop carried mostly higher-end stuff. Jim liked more American-made weaponry, and as such rarely carried any Slavic stuff, much to Stephen's chagrin. Notable items included an M1a in a JAE chassis with a Nightforce scope on it, I believe? And had a JP Enterprises muzzle brake on it. One thing that bugged me was the DRD Paratus they had with the fucking hefty price tag of somewhere like $5,000. Just for a carbine-length piston .308 that's only real advantage/gimmick was that it broke down easily, and could fit into a special carry box after you did. Who am I to question, though, I'm just the intern. Also had a Dan Wesson CTG 6"" in .44 Mag that made me drool a little, though a little big for me. So basically what I'm getting at is, he carried a hodge-podge of firearms. Most of them were reputable (aside from a Fie Titan and a CAI AK).



**Fun stories:**


Remember when I said the shop did work for some of the local PDs? One distinct memory I had of this was a beautiful AR-10 that was cerakoted burnt-bronze, had an AAC QD brake, an AAC 762-SDN-6 on it. The guy who owned it lovingly named it ""Rick James"", and was an apt description considering how much work had been done to it.



Another fun one was when a customer brought in a semi-automatic Thompson replica made by Apache Arms. Had a rubber foregrip instead of the traditional wood, and had a rail with a red-dot reflex sight on top of it. Was pretty ugly. I come back the next day, found out it sheared one of the cases in half during test firing, and fired 25 rounds in full-auto fashion. Stephen called the guy after that, informing him of the event and letting him know he would be doing no additional work on it, as it was too dangerous to handle. We looked it up later in order to find reviews only to find that the company had shut its doors. Wonder why.



Longest work order, though, has to be a Remington Wingmaster Sam was Cerakoting. From the day I started apprenticing at the shop, it took nearly a month and a half to get to actually spraying it 3 different colors while using a LEAF WE FOUND ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE for a stencil, sticking it all in the oven, and getting it done. The guy was really nonchalant about the whole deal, though, so no harm, no foul.



**Conclusion summary:** So much bullshit.

No, but in reality, it was an interesting insight into how the business works, seeing the demographics (who knew old white guys liked guns!), and actually getting some hands on experience. Most of what I did was just cleaning jobs, but I didn't mind that at all. In fact, that was a fun aspect for me, felt like I was able to contribute. Fairly proud of the moment I was able to fully assemble and disassemble an unfamiliar firearm, even though it was just a shotgun. Just another step towards learning more, I guess. Thanks for reading!



**Additional bonus round:**

I visited Silencer Shop in Austin last weekend, and was very impressed. The guys obviously knew what they were talking about, kept it strictly about the industry, and seemed like a tight ship. According to one of the associates, all the AAC Cyclopses that are in circulation go through them, so that was interesting to me. Can't say I for sure believe him, but I don't know of any other store that focuses solely on silencers.

To see a miracle in any difficulty can be most challenging if one cannot find the underlying lesson within.

In the winter of 1993 I moved out of my Mother’s apartment in Queens and moved in with my best friend and her boyfriend, located about 15 blocks away. I had just landed a position as a paid intern at a Wall Street firm and was elated to have the means to start a new life on my own.

Just two months after my journey began however, my internship became non-existent and halted with no prior notice. With delusions of grandeur I was almost sure this internship would last forever, and didn’t find it necessary to save any money I had earned in the previous months. Within a week I was forced to make some drastic decisions.

After a horrible day at the office I couldn’t wait to get home. As soon as I walked through the door I slammed my keys on the kitchen table, stomped into my room and contemplated my next move. I was too embarrassed and couldn’t bring myself to ask if I could move back in with my Mother, but I was still a teenager and was doubtful I could find an apartment of my own. What was I to do?

Despite my frazzled state I recalled this poignant quote, sent from a beloved friend…

“Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.” — J.K. Rowling

Yes, at the time I was on the threshold of rock bottom; burned out from work, broke, depressed and wallowing in self-pity. There was nothing left to do but calmly take a seat on my bed and take a long, deep breath. The solution appeared instantaneously with each moment.

[Day 4 - End!](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/2fjpr8/week_of_the_ice_cream_shop_day_4_end/)

Normally I write about my experiences in the meat department, but this week I decided to change things up and will share four stories of my time at a big family restaurant known for their ice cream. I worked at this place for a total of nine months before I hastily quit my job.

---

As I continued working in the dishroom, I felt that I should confront Allie about finally getting the raise I was promised when I took the job. I found her in the manager's office, where she always was during her shift, and confronted her.

&gt;Me:""Hey, Allie. You have a minute? I want to talk to you about something.""

&gt;Allie:""Sure, Chili - what do you need?""

I went on to discuss the fact that I had been there six months now, and still had no raise that I was promised. I also never received any training for other parts of the restaurant I had been promised my second month in.

&gt;Allie:""Oh, well, I know we haven't bumped your pay up yet, but we're working on it.""

*This is the same thing you've been telling me for six months now,* my mind said angrily.

&gt;Allie:""And as far as other training goes, how would you like to do inventory with me Mondays?""

&gt;Me:""Sure, when do I show up?""

&gt;Allie:""4 AM."" *She handed me a long sheet with a list of everything we could have in inventory.* ""Learn this sheet and try to memorize it by Monday.""

&gt;Me:""...You know I work until 1 AM Sundays and have class Mondays at 11, right?""

&gt;Allie:""Yeah, but we'll be done by 10. So I'll see you Monday.""

---

The next weekend I worked with my favorite manager, Bob, and brought this to his attention. 

Bob was a large man, but the kindest guy you'll come across. He was also a total sci fi geek like me, which was how we bonded to be great friends during my time there. We would lend each other movies and recommend TV shows for each other to check out, and it made it something to look forward to during my shifts.

Bob told me ""don't worry about it"", and he'll talk with Allie about moving me somewhere else in the restaurant and getting me my pay raise. 

During our usual lunch conversation, I noticed something off about Bob.

&gt;Bob:""...and then there's this guy on the Enterprise who's -""

&gt;Me:""Sorry to bother you, Bob, but are you okay? You seem kind of pale...""

&gt;Bob:""Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just feeling a little light headed today. I found out a few weeks ago I have diabetes and have to change my diet. It has not been an easy few weeks.""

And I was ready to leave it at that. 

However, I noticed, he began sweating a lot, and had to take frequent breaks to catch his breath. I approached him once again.

&gt;Me:""Bob, are you *sure* you're alright? I can bring you across the street to the hospital...you're really not looking well, man...""

&gt;Bob:""Yeah, I'm fine...I just need to get through this shift and I'll go to the doctor tomorrow.""

But Bob kept looking worse as the night went on, and despite many of the servers begging him to go to the hospital, he eventually just said he had to leave and go home early. Besides, he would be going to the hospital tomorrow on his day off.

Sunday I came in, and was immediately called to the side by Allie.

&gt;Allie:""Chili, I know you and Bob are good friends, so I wanted to tell you privately before word got out to the rest of the staff...Bob died in his sleep last night.""

I didn't know what to say. It hit me like a ton of bricks, because I saw this coming last night. We *all* saw this coming last night.

&gt;Allie:""The doctors said he had a blood clot that killed him, but it didn't show up in the bloodwork he had done a few weeks ago.""

And, just like that, the main reason I kept looking forward to my job was gone.

---

A couple weeks later I was visiting home for my birthday, and had to go to the grocery store to get some food for dinner. 

I went up to the meat department and ran into Meat Manager, and we caught up on how the department was doing and how my job was going. I then threw a random idea out:

&gt;Me:""So Meat Manager, if I were to *hypothetically* ask to get some hours here for the weekends, you think I'd be able to negotiate some kind of raise out of Store Manager?""

&gt;Meat Manager:""...I'll see what I can do.""

&gt;Me:""No, I really *was* just asking, I-""

&gt;Meat Manager:""Chili - I'll see you next week.""

---

Meat Manager got me as many hours as I wanted and got Store Manager to call me for a decent pay raise, making it worth it to leave my job at the restaurant and go back to the meat department. I also found out they had already put me on the schedule, giving me one week to quit the restaurant.

Of course, this was the week Allie took her vacation.

I didn't want to say I was leaving because the place was terrible or because I hated Allie and her extreme incompetence, so I figured I'd just make up a reason as I go along.

I went into the restaurant that week to give my one week notice to Judy, the waitress assigned temporary manager for the week.

&gt;Me:""Hey Judy, I know Allie isn't here, but I have to give my notice that I'm leaving.""

&gt;Judy:""Aw, it sucks to see you leave! So you'll be leaving in two weeks?""

&gt;Me: *chuckling nervously*""Ha, well, actually I'll need to quit the end of this week...Sunday will have to be my last day.""

&gt;Judy:""What?! Why? I'm already writing out next week's schedule and you and Anthony are our only dishwashers!""

&gt;Me:""Well that's something Allie said she'd take care of months ago, but I need to leave because I'm starting an internship!""

The perfect lie, an internship! They knew I had been searching for one when I started the job, this could work out perfectly!

&gt;Judy:""Congrats! What company will you be working for?!""

In a sudden state of panic, I came up with one of the most ridiculous answers I could have improvised.

&gt;Me:""...Google. Yeah, Google called me and said they wanted me to do a new type of internship where I'll be working from home. It's really good for the computer stuff I'm doing at school, I'm very excited. If I'm lucky, I may even get a job there!""

*Crap, that was the dumbest thing ever, no way anyone will believe this!* I thought, assured that I would be called out on my lie. I waited for her response, which was probably immediate, but seemed like an eternity waiting for her reaction.

&gt;Judy:""That is so cool! I can't believe it! You know, after you fixed Holly's phone a few months back, we figured you were some sort of computer genius! Well done, Chili! I mean, it sucks to see you go, but I'll work something out and try to get a hold of Allie for you. I'll see you Saturday then!""

I left, completely flabbergasted and excited. *I'm finally leaving this place,* I thought, *all I have to do is survive this weekend.*

*How bad can it be?*"

I was an on again off again addict to prescription pain pills. For 6 years I abused this drug.

It wasn't until the beginning of this year I found myself deep into the addiction. Selling prized possessions, buying things to sell, and stealing.

It affected every aspect of my life and ended up costing me a good job. The day I was let go I fell deep into a depression swing. I couldn't do it anymore. I was spending 100+ dollars a DAY to support my habit and it had to stop.

I came clean with my fam, friends, and SO. I have intern lost some of this but still have great support from those that matter. I am 34 days clean and counting. It's hard but has been getting easier and easier by the day.

To those who still struggle. Look deep inside yourself. Find that one or many reasons to quit. Even if it's just a little bit here or little bit there. Try and stop. Seek help. Ask those who have been where you are at now.

I was fortunate enough to have a few friends that had this very struggle and are the ones who I talk to EVERY DAY for guidance.

Last year I started pushing my girlfriend away by being high all the time. I never did what she wanted me to do and all I did was sit around and smoke all day. This summer she left the state for an internship and I decided I was going to stop smoking and work on being a better person for her and also for me. A week before I was supposed to come and see her, she broke up with me. She wouldn't talk to me about it until almost a month later once we got back to college. Once she broke up with me I picked up that night and have smoked almost every single night and a few days since then. 

I decided to stop smoking yesterday however I only ate an apple the entire day. The only time I even felt hungry was when I was talking to my ex and she was comforting me. Last night I didn't fall asleep until 3 and woke up at 5 and 7 and finally got out of bed at 9. This morning I could only eat a piece of one egg before I felt like I was going to throw up.

I know that smoking isn't good for me especially now. It makes me shy, self conscious, I second guess myself, and I'm much less social which is not good for me right now since I am living by myself. I know I can do school while being high all the time as I did that last year, but I feel like I just smoked away almost half of college and at least 1 or 2 years of my life. But right now it just helps so much. 

I feel like I can't loose both weed and my girlfriend at the same time but I also don't want to just be high all of the time."

My gf and I have been fighting A LOT and she always makes me out to be the bad guy. It's frustrating that I'm the one that's always the problem. Now, it has boiled down to me smoking too much. I offered to throw it away, and she still wasn't happy. She saw that as simple appeasement. I just want us to be happy, but nothing seems good enough. 

I'm a smart, good looking guy who is pretty popular, but she insists on getting hung up on how much weed I smoke. She has gone so far as to say its repulsive... 

I love this girl, but why can't she just stop complaining about shit I do, especially when I offer to give it up.

We click really well personality wise, but she gets super bitch on me over trivial matters and goes off. 

Is it really that big a deal when I smoke once a day (and only at night when I have no more work to do!). I just don't have much to do, and if we are gonna watch tv, I wanna smoke.... Am I being immature, or is she just being overbearing.

We fight over all kinds of things recently, and I don't know when to call it quits or work with her. 

She lives with me, maybe that's part of the problem? Please help

Edit: our last fight before this one was when I tried to apologize about a previous fight and she gave me this disdainful look. And I said, ""babe I'm trying to be nice and work this out."" And she responded by saying, "" ya well you're not."" Then i got up and left. She then threw a tantrum saying it wasn't fair that I walked away when I didn't like when she did.... She then proceeded to storm out of the apartment.

-I graduated last year with a degree in Chemical Engineering, concentration in Biochemistry, minor in Math.

-I have never had an actuarial internship, as I only recently decided that this was the career for me.

-I, unfortunately, have been unemployed for the past year. I realized that I wanted to become an actuary when it became apparent to me that I had no motivation to pursue a career in engineering, most likely the reason I was not able to find a position.

-I passed FM in August, and plan on passing P in November.

By using my connections in the industry, I have been able to wrangle a phone interview with a certain large insurance company in New England next week for an entry level position. I realize that without my connection, I would have had little to no shot at even being considered, and I'm sure there are countless candidates who are also being interviewed who have much better qualifications than I do. That being said, this is a fantastic opportunity for me. So, having never had an interview of this nature in this industry, I was wondering if anyone could provide me with any advice on how to stand out against better qualified candidates, or just general advice on how these calls usually go and what sort of things they might ask me. Also, more specifically, how should I explain my career change before my first career even started, and how should I go about explaining my unemployment? Should I just be upfront?

Thanks guys! This sub has been a huge help in getting me started in my journey. Hopefully one day I'll be the one giving out the advice."

2fhalw,1,2014-09-04,"How necessary is sedation, really? (Especially for patients with anxiety)",scorinth,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/2fhalw/how_necessary_is_sedation_really_especially_for/,"I'm hoping for an answer that's kind of general, but as for myself, right now:

* 27y/o Male
* 6'0""
* ~300 lbs. (Please don't get on me for this. I'm already working on it.)
* White
* Midwest US
* ADHD, Elevated blood pressure, Obesity
* Amphetamine salts, 30mg/day, for ADHD. Lisinopril, 20mg/day, blood pressure.

Honestly, this is a simple question with a bit of a back story. To try to keep a long story short, I have ""slightly"" elevated blood pressure, but I experience really severe anxiety in certain situations, especially when going in for medical procedures. When I had to have my wisdom teeth removed, the surgeon did not offer me any guidance, only saying ""You can do it with sedation, or without."" (Thanks, bro.) I thought I'd do it with sedation, just because I anticipated being anxious during the procedure and wanted to make things go more easily.

It turns out this was a mistake, for two different reasons: When I went in to the oral surgery department for the extractions, just the experience of being prepared for it started to set me off. As I admitted to my psychiatrist later, around the time they had finished hooking me up to the monitor and kicked my boyfriend out of the room to administer the sedative, it was sheer force of will that kept me from trying to jump up and leave. So this whole thing that I thought would ease my anxiety in fact multiplied it. Secondly, this anxiety wasn't just a ""feeling"", it was having a marked effect on my blood pressure - I could read ~135/95 when it took the first measurement, and it was around the time that it broke 180/120 that the surgeon called it off and told me to go do another consultation before making an appointment to try again.

This time, the woman I saw at the clinic (I don't have a regular primary care physician) told me that we probably had enough evidence to prescribe lisinopril for my blood pressure, but actually - I mean ***literally*** laughed out loud when I gave her the ""request for consult"" form from the surgeon. I hadn't read the paper myself, and when I asked what was so funny, she said ""He needs your diastolic to be below 100... I could have just sent you right back because it has been every time we've measured!""

Then the day came that I actually had the teeth out. Physically, I felt fine, but I've done a lot of reading about ""conscious sedation"", and it honestly creeps me out. It disturbs me that it's becoming more and more common, and that the doctors I've talked to all admit that they've pressured patients to do it because it makes things ""go smoother,"" even though a growing number of patients have concerns about conscious sedation.

I'm an atheist. I don't believe in God or any of that stuff, but I think I've discovered a ""religious belief"". I don't want to be sedated unless I'm all the way under, with general anesthetic. I understand that it's going to be less ""pleasant"" to do a lot of things with local anesthetic without sedation, and that it would be much more dangerous to do general anesthesia when sedation is an option, but to me there's a deeper question about honesty and experience and at this point, my policy going forward is ""No sedation without general anesthesia. Give me a local - like you should be doing with sedation, anyway - and I have the willpower to sit through it.""

When I talked to my psychiatrist about it, she prescribed ""Hydroxyzine Pamoate to control the symptoms of anxiety and help you relax, but without the creepy effects of other sedatives"" and recommended that I take it before procedures - after talking with the doctor who will be performing it, of course!

My sister the ER intern, on the other hand, reacted quite strongly, as if she was shocked by even the suggestion, and said ""You can't do that, you know!"" ""Can't do what? Do something like a colonoscopy without a sedative?"" ""No!""

So what's the deal? Is it unreasonable to refuse sedation? Is there some way I can reliably make my wishes known? Is there a better way to handle anxiety?

EDIT: Deleted a loose story thread."

The last three years have been an emotional roller-coaster. Lots of anxiety, feelings of extreme loneliness and probably depression, all for no apparent reason. I have difficulties staying focused,  my performance in university have plummeted. I have little energy to put into my hobbies and have gone from someone who used to organize things in for example the board game club or football team to someone who just goes to the different activities, and I am probably at least 30 minutes late to whatever I do. So I guess I am a pretty typical guy who writes to this subreddit and I do not intend to write all the little details off my not-so-fun life. 

I want to get some of the immense frustration regarding my parents (mostly my father) off my chest. I feel they are so incapable of listening to me it's insulting.
When my problems began it took ""only"" a couple months to realize my problems wouldn't end by themselves or normal effort like they used to and I sought help. Both from friends, teachers and from professionals with varied result and from my parents.

When I started to fail classes and my parents asked why I truthfully told them I had had a ""really rough time"", ""problem sleeping"" and that I didn't know why. I didn't know nor do I know why I started sleeping only a few or fifteen hours a night, frequently waking up with strong feelings of fleeing or hiding and having little energy to keep up in school or my spare time activities. My mother basically interrogated me, accusing me of taking drugs, insisting that drugs could cause experiences like mine. At the time I barely drank alcohol and it together with coffee, if it counts, are the only mind-altering substances I have ever used. My father at the time didn't seem to notice I told him about my worries. But over the years he has been far worse. 

When my father wants to talk to me he only ever do it in situations when we are alone where I physically or figuratively can't escape. Such as when we are together alone in a car, when he places himself slightly behind me and between me and any potential ""escape route"". I don't know whats worse, that I can read him like a book in advance and sense that I will have a ""discussion"" with him, that his advice are painfully simplistic, that he doesn't listen to me or that he is dishonest. Either way I feel like a prey when he have a ""discussion"" with me and that there is nothing I can do to improve my situation as soon as he start. It's almost like an invisible hand grab my intestines and twist them until I can feel the pain in my fingers and toes.

When I tell him to  not ""trap"" me because I become upset he ignores me.
When I tell him I feel unfocused I'm told to focus.  
When I tell him I feel anxiety without reason he's happy I'm excited for X.  
When I tell him anxiety isn't a postive feeling he doesn't now what anxiety is.  
When I tell him I do not know why I have feeling X, I'm told I'm hiding something.
When I tell him I feel lonely I get the advice to **not** spend time with my friends or hobbies.    
When I tell them about exciting spare time activity X, I'm told to stop with it.  

My parents, in particular my father, are bottomless pits of not-listening. He seem to be oblivious to the fact he often use what I say to make some kind non-advice. It is like he first decides he want to tell me something, he the ignores what I say at best, but usually take what I say and turn it against me. 

During this spring he has started to ask my therapist questions via email that he doesn't ask me at all. The questions are usually pretty trivial but it is insulting that he can call me the day before a meeting and talk about the weather or something and the next day I have to authorize my therapist to answer the email. When I confront him that this bothers me, and that he can ask me questions, he doesn't remember to have sent any emails at all.

It seem like my parents think I'm hiding something from them when in fact I put so much of effort into saying exactly what mean and not something vague and ambiguous. They often continue their ""interrogations"" until I ""snap""(the longest I have kept them going was about six hours). I've found that a fist slammed into the table or similar theatre acting is the only way to make them stop. When I finally act I often hear that my behaviour isn't normal and that I should calm down.

If I tell them that I don't think they listen they can respond with ""you don't really mean that, we love you"" or something else that isn't necessarily wrong but totally misses my point. I feel like they are immune to anything I say and that there is nothing I can say to make them satisfied. 

It hurts so much more when they ignore or misinterpret me than when they blatantly blame my situation on laziness or me partying too much. My parents have no direct insight in my daily life except what I tell them. Yet they have constantly tell me to do or not do thing. I get critique whatever I do. If I go to a social activity I'm told not to because it requires too much time and/or money. If do not go I'm told to not isolate my self. If I apply for 12 summer internships and then study for an exam, I either have applied for too few internships or put too few hours studying for an exam.

Why should I care? I am a grown up(ish) who haven't lived with my parents for close to 10 years. I could just ignore them? Old normal me could maybe have done so, but current on an emotional roller-coaster me wants to feel my parents trust me. It is such a weird dissonance between the ""interrogations"" I have to go through because they want to know how I feel while at the same time, nothing I say have any meaning to them. Not even normal words that where made up to describe certain thing words like ""anxiety"", ""loneliness"", ""frustration"" or ""stop"".

It really hurts my relationship with them, the plain thought of having a discussion with can cause me to bundle up in fetal position on the floor."
2fhfpr,3,2014-09-04,Regretting my major and life decisions in general,Ryliemn,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2fhfpr/regretting_my_major_and_life_decisions_in_general/,"Tomorrow I'm ending a 12 week software development internship with a huge software company. December I'll be graduating with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science degree with a 3.9 GPA, all just after I turn 21. I should be extremely thankful in regards to how well my life is going and how well it's going to go if I keep it up.

I feel miserable when I think about that prospect though. I hated the internship. The thought of doing that for the rest of my life as a career? Nothing sounds worse.

I should have just majored in music. That's what I really love to do. Nothing makes me happier than sitting in front of a piano and playing, or composing something new. I understand that with a job in software development I could easily be making six figures within the next five years, but even knowing that, I feel like I'd be much happier taking a job composing music that just allowed me to financially barely scrape by.

I go online and look at degree programs for music at colleges in my area and just daydream about living that life. But then there's all the debt. With my CS degree I'm graduating with extremely minimal debt thanks to grants and scholarships, but that's because a lot of organizations are eager to throw money at people getting STEM degrees. Not so much with music degrees.

But at the same time, I'm only 20. Still really young. It'd be a drastic change from the lifestyle I was expecting to have after I graduated but I feel like it would be worth it. But the logical part of my brain is still telling me it'd be a bad idea.

I dunno what to do."
2fi4ol,1,2014-09-04,Not sure where to start,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2fi4ol/not_sure_where_to_start/,"So this is my first time and post on this subreddit, and I normally would not like to put my guilt on other people, let alone strangers but it's something I'm having more and more trouble dealing with.

I guess I'll start with a little about me, I'm a 21 year old senior accounting and psych major in college in the new england area. Over the summer I think is where depression really started to sink in. Internships are a massive push point at my school, and I was unfortunate enough to not get one (despite a fairly high GPA) and by the time I had found out from the last firm there was no hiring for summer jobs near me. I had the entire summer basically to myself as friends from college were back home, friends from home were off doing their work and could not help but get lost in thought for a long time. 

I guess the major thing is I just feel alone. I haven't realistically had any kind of serious relationship (2 in early high school but only a couple months a piece) and while it was something I was looking forward to fixing in college, 3 years later here I am at the start of my senior year with nothing changed. 

I spent a lot of time thinking why and that kind of seems to be the reason why I've been in my ""funk"" the last half year. The best time to meet girls at my school is a drunken weekend encounter, and being that I'm neither attractive enough (I feel I'm average at best) or have the interest in one night stands (more interested in a relationship, not saying it has to lead to marriage but a one night thing doesn't really help cope with the loneliness, or I imagine it doesn't) so I have a horrible time with introductions and trying to break the ice. Financially, my state is a wreck so even if I could break the ice and find a girl who might like me I don't think I could be a ""good boyfriend"" anyway, can't afford many dinners/dates/etc. 

With all the free time I had I spent a lot of time watching tv/movies/etc just to fill the time or get my mind off of it but I found that it seemed like everything had some ""picture perfect"" love story and it just made me feel worse. I ended up spending a good chunk of time on a chat site where I regularly started talking to one girl in particular. I spent the next 2ish months talking to her daily, sharing everything and we both felt it was (emotionally) an ideal relationship. She started sending pictures (both sfw and nsfw) without me even asking once, and finally I felt at least like I had something with someone, still keeping it in the back of my mind that there would never actually be physical contact (she's in the midwest). She never asked for anything back but eventually I sent her back a picture (chest up, so sfw) and instantly the mood changed. I don't know how to describe it but you could just tell there was less interest there, originally there was the feeling that if there was a way to make it work, we would, but now it seemed more like a chore to talk to me, and that destroyed my confidence completely. I'm still struggling with that, that basically told me I had the personality to be in a decent relationship but if I'm instantly unattractive that doesn't really matter. 



Sorry for the long post, I just don't have anyone I feel I can turn to comfortably. I don't really know exactly what it is I'm looking for, maybe just if anyone else has been in a similar position what maybe has worked for them... Thank you and I hope I'll be able to help this community in the future."

I've been following Bitcoin for about a year now and was excited about the technology since I first heard of it. I made my purchase soon after learning about it from youtube videos, Andreas Antonopoulos, reading of the white paper, and of course lurking r/bitcoin. 

During this time I was studying as a student in counselling and had a chance to intern at a local not-for-profits where I helped to educate others in the community about what I knew of Bitcoin, some of the reasons why it was created, and the potential for it to be used as a resource stream for those who cannot afford traditional marketing or accept funds with ease from people beyond local contributors. The people working around me became interested on the topic so I printed off pamphlets and educated staff, and even the executive director of the organization on Bitcoin. I ended up doing 40 minute long talks on the subject during lunch hours, and I even had a chance to pass a pamphlet to some Mormons who came to visit my house.

As my internship came to a close, I proposed to the director that we begin accepting donations for Bitcoin. I argued that we are located in a very small city (capital of a province with a mere 56,000 people), with very little exposure and that if we begin accepting Bitcoin, we may have contributors who would also like to help others get the mental health support they need. To my surprise, she agreed, and I quickly set up a paper wallet for her with the block chain app to watch the address, and double checked with the CRA to ensure that all loose ends were tied. This was done just a few months ago!

This past Sunday, I was asked to volunteer at a donation booth. I made an album to promote the organization since I didn't think they were getting any attention from locals (especially with Bitcoin...people didn't even ask any questions about it), and my previous post on the organization on r/bitcoin hadn't done very well at all. But I didn't lose hope!

I created and posted my album, and today I checked my watch only wallets for fun and realized that there was a 0.09903147 BTC donation made by 1C5bjkN7raNdjBXJGKFpg1u7HLD1oF4ffo! 

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION! I screamed at my sleeping boyfriend out of excitement! I also spammed my research supervisor and the director about the great news too! After a year of blank stares and a lot of skepticism from my friends, there's finally some good that I was able to give someone through Bitcoin!

Whoever you are, internet friend, Family Enrichment Counselling Services thanks you immensely! And I thank you personally as well! You've contributed to two causes that I believe in passionately.

**TL;DR**  AAAH BITCOINS FOR CHARITY!!! HOLY CRAP SOMEONE DONATED THAT WASN'T ME! THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!

2fiktn,2,2014-09-04,"Me [25 M] with my girlfriend [26 F] - Girlfriend is one in a million on some levels, but I'm not getting what I want, and I cannot bring myself to end it.",maestro47,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fiktn/me_25_m_with_my_girlfriend_26_f_girlfriend_is_one/,"**Some necessary background:**  Starting in adolescence I became very shy and have had much trouble building relationships with many people, particularly sexual relationships with women, ever since then.

Parents have had a very tumultuous relationship for a very long time, and have been depressed / often unhappy for years.  My mother is particularly emotional.  I became very quiet and withdrawn.   

I went to therapy for a little while in high school and the therapist said that my parents infantilized me and that I needed to become more independent, which I agreed with.  Never seemed to fix the situation.

Fast forward through college (and three sexless years, even though I'm fit + good looking)... I'm 25 and relatively successful, but pretty unhappy.

I don't have as many friends as I used to, and the best ones I've had for a long time all seem to have one thing in common:  we all had very controlling mothers.

A past girlfriend was very, very depressed, and I wanted out but didn't have the balls to break things off until one day she very subtly hinted at the idea, of which I took advantage.


**Current Girlfriend**
I immediately clicked with my current girlfriend, now of about a year, and she has amazing qualities and unique, shared interests with me I don't honestly expect to find in anyone else, but she has some issues.

She has always been overweight; she's very pretty+cute, but the weight is an issue and sexually I have not been very attracted to her. If she lost it, she'd be amazingly attractive.  She's had a serious problem with me being away from her for more than a day or so.  3months in she wanted me to move in and cried when I declined.  She gets jealous when I go snowboarding on weekends and upset that I ""ignore"" or ""forget"" her.  

We share aspirations, and she is the most supportive partner I've had.  She does tons of things for me; she even got me life insurance through her company.

I've gone along with ""moving in"" and a lot of typically ""serious"" gestures, but I'm not 100% into the relationship.  She has issues that need to be dealt with, particularly anger.

I have a pretty big deficiency in having formed groups of friends and having the wild, crazy college fun (with girls too) that I want, and I cannot be happy until I fix my own issues.

I started seeing a psych recently, but he is an intern and probably not too experienced. However, we've talked about my ""authenticity"" and speaking up for myself, which I didn't seem to get to do without repercussion in my younger years, and he's noted my almost non-existent attention to my own feelings and needs.  (I'm so much the easy-going nice-guy that never makes a fuss).

My big problem is ending the relationship.  I'm very invested in it, and I don't want to make my girlfriend so unhappy, because I know it will devastate her.  The relationship brings me a lot of happiness too, but I don't think I will ever be happy until I can fix my own relationship-forming issues and ""get"" the things I've wanted, of which forming sexual relationships with attractive women is admittedly one.  Maybe I can find happiness in this one?

I honestly cannot bring myself to end it, and I also fear that I'll lose the amazingness that I *do* have.  I feel like I'd have a mid-life crisis by the age of 30 if I didn't.

I would really appreciate some guidance here.  Thanks so much.


---   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend is a person I could spend lots of my life with, but she is not perfect.  She does so much for me that I could never repay her, but not all of my needs are met and part of me wants to be single and fix my shyness issues and practice forming relationships with others, including women.  A lot of our life together isn't the one I really saw myself having, and I'm very torn."

They want to measure your brain-dick and move on.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2fiqx4/tech_interviewers_dont_give_2_shits_about_you/,"Since when was asking a brain teaser the criteria for finding high quality employees? Or avid contributors? Or engaged socially functional individuals with a long term interest in corporate success? Or people with the wherewithal to document their code and design for maintainability? Brain teasers are pretty good at finding people with high IQ's. Have an IQ of 130 and you'll pass most brain teasers fairly easily.

I'm not a genius. I'm smart, I was lucky to have smart parents. I was lucky to have the opportunities to study things like programming. I'm pretty dang good at it. But if I have to implement a complex data structure, it usually takes several hours. Luckily for us programmers, 90% of the time or better is spent implementing really boring things, rather than implementing really exciting difficult things. When we implement those exciting things, even the best programmer aught to start with design, the test suite, and god-forbid, just a pinch of literature rather than going Rambo on the keyboard to hope that your first implementation works perfectly.

Which brings me to my frustration today. I was disqualified for a job because it took me too long to implement an efficient Sudoku solution checker. A brain game. Never-mind my demonstrable open source contributions, never mind my internships, never mind my functional and public open-source web app. FML, maybe this isn't an industry for me. My interviewer set down the phone mid interview and talked to his buddies then, from all the typing I heard, I assume he was answering emails or something. 

It is all really discouraging."
2fk8jr,1,2014-09-05,Signed for my first job out of college. Read through the FAQs but have questions about savings/budgeting.,financebitch,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2fk8jr/signed_for_my_first_job_out_of_college_read/,"Long-time lurker, posting with a throwaway to avoid revealing sensitive information.

I'm 21 and graduating college (undergrad) in May, and just signed my very first full-time employment contract. I have a few months to start planning for it (still finishing up college) but the prospect of managing my finances is a little intimidating. My parents helped put me through college, but they live in another country and do not know anything about personal finances in the US. So I've been doing research on my own on reddit PF and elsewhere.

Income and financial situation is something as follows:

- 1st year total comp ~175k. 105k base, 25k signing bonus, 45k year-end bonus (guaranteed, not variable)
- 2nd year total comp: 165-200k. 105k base, 60k-100k year-end bonus, performance-based.
- zero debt (got a bunch of credit cards, always pay them off on time; parents paid for college, and got financial aid)
- aiming for ~1.7-2k/month in rent
- no car, and not planning on buying one (live in NYC)
- no fiancee/wife/family. don't expect one until late 20s.

After 2 years (if I decide to stay with this firm) my contract is renegotiated. The industry has an average salary of something like 300-400k so I do expect upward movement in income.

I am wondering this: **is there any sense in maxing out 401k/IRA contributions at this point?**

Since I'm only making &lt;200k, that 17.5k deduction from my paycheque for the 401k contribution limit might feel a little painful. Since I'm just starting my career, it feels too early to save for retirement. (Man, that's so far away! Can't even imagine it.) I will say I have grown accustomed to a more expensive lifestyle. I worked an internship this summer making &gt;100k, and those nights out at clubs and bars really do weigh down on the wallet. My industry generally has rapid salary growth, and many of my older colleagues/friends have passed the 1M mark by age 30. By that point, my spending should increase much less than my income, so I expect that it would be much easier to save for retirement, since I'll have more spare income sitting around to invest in savings-type funds.

Probably sounds a bit immature coming from a 21-year-old but I do want to spend as much of my early-20s as possible having fun. So spending the extra cash on clubs and booze is a much more appealing prospect than saving for retirement, which might be 40 years away. Can someone convince me otherwise?

It's generally hard to find advice that helps me in my situation. Most PF threads and resources online are geared to either an older demographic, or a much lower income bracket. What would you recommend I do in terms of savings at my income level and age?

One more question, which might be a bit harder to answer: **How do I find a good accountant specializing in international taxes?**

I'm currently a citizen and tax-resident of another country while studying in the US. My school has helped me through 1040NR filings with all the appropriate tax treaties. However, my work will involve me transitioning to a resident visa, meaning I will have to file as resident alien in the US, and most likely give up my tax residency in my home country. There are a lot of complications with this that may be too long to explain in a thread here so I will omit them. I have spoken to a few people at H&amp;R Block but they seemed only moderately helpful. I'm willing to put in a couple grand a year if a good accountant can help me optimize my taxes in the long-run, given my somewhat-complicated international tax position.

We both knew about each other but never really got to talking. Seemed to have really hit things off but I had a large move planned for the next four months. Started off the new school year with all the welcome back parties and got to talking with her and we really hit things off over a couple days.
 
 
After the end of the first night we stood in the parking lot at the bar and just talked for what must have been at least an hour. Ended with her giving me her number before leaving to drive. I followed her home to make sure she was safe (coincidentally she lives like 3 blocks from me, and we both were DDs) and that was the end of the night. 
 
 
Next day we chatted back and forth asking about our plans and what we had going on. I spent the day packing and talking with her seeing if she was going to come out for my last night in town. I got all my stuff ready to go in the early evening and decided to see if she wanted to tag along to a friends house for drinks beforehand. Picked her up and we drove over there and things were off just as we had left them the previous night. Headed to the big party and spent some time together there as well. After everything shut down we ended up walking to a lounge I had access to on campus. 
 
 
This is kinda where the rough spot I'm in starts, I had multiple opportunities to make a ""move"" but didn't. The night just kept going as we talked and listened to music together for 4 hours going back and forth flirting. It was quite obvious we had a connection just from the way we were engaging each other. After we left the lounge we climbed onto one of the rooftops on campus and huddled next to each other and chatted for another hour. Ended up taking her back to her place and we just sat next to eachother outside, clearly we both didn't want the night to end as I was leaving in the morning for 4 months. Ended up saying goodbye, I don't even think I gave her a hug or anything, and left.
 
 
Next day I'm on the road and its fairly early get a text from her seeing how things were going. Talked back and forth while I was driving nothing too crazy but kept a conversation going most of the day. I ended up finding out from a buddy that called me early in the day that she wanted him to go for dinner with her. I'm decent friends with the guy and gave me a call wondering what our situation was as he didn't want either of us to get played or step on eachother. I told him we pretty much just hung out and it was just a weird situation because I was moving. They dated for a few months but he told me he probably wasn't going to get back with her but would let me know if anything happened. He really didn't care if anything happened just wanted to be straight with me.
 
 
So here I am a little over two days from my last night with her wondering what I should do, if this is worth pursuing, etc and I haven't heard from her since yesterday. The whole situation was one of those were I wasn't event looking for a relationship as I was moving across the country for my dream internship for 4 months.

We were both working bad hours, and really busy (I went on vacation for 13 or so days a week after we met, she went on Vacation for 7 days the day after I got back) so we ended up texting a lot.  A lot.


After she gets back, on a Sunday, we go out to eat, then watch movies.  We do the same thing Tuesday, and Friday she spends the night with me.  Everything's going amazing, we just click really well, only problem is that I have a really bad fear to get close to someone, like we didn't have sex and she told me that I should be sleeping closer to her and pulled my arm over her.


We're talking constantly at this point.  She texts me Saturday night and complains that she's stuck at her sister's (were supposed to go to a concert) and wishes I could get her (was at my sister's wedding).  I sent her a picture of me and my niece and she starts saying she's supposed to be in my nieces spot.


Next week we see a movie and go back to my place after and we're lying on the bed and she's rubbing my leg with her foot and I put my arm around her and pulled her to me but I didn't try anything.. still nervous.


We talked the day after and she was talking about how yeah, she was turned on but she didn't want to 'jump me' besides my dog was in the room and that creeps her out.


We make plans for me to spend the night with her while she dog sits her cousin, and that night we were watching a movie and she says that she has to go to get her friend who was incredibly drunk so she drops me off at my house, and when she's dropping me off I told her that I have serious feelings for her, but I'm scared so I want to take it slow.  She tells me back she prefers it that way too.


Well, after that day it got awkward, talking became MUCH more spaced out, she would regularly ignore my texts too, we didn't talk for the rest of the weekend.


Monday I asked her what we were and she said friends, and asked me why people always want to date her and shut me down hard.  So I tried that whole 'friends' game for a couple weeks.


Well last week I had enough of that, and on Wednesday I sat her down and said hey I don't want this, I want to be in a relationship with you, is that possible.  She said that it is, I asked if she was being honest and she said she was.  Later when we were talking she said back when she spent the night, way back when, she was testing if we were a good 'fit' and that we weren't, and that's that.  I asked her about the fact that just hours ago she said we could possibly get in a relationship and she said she said it because she didn't want to lose our friendship.


I deleted her # and off facebook, but looking back at it, she obviously felt something after she slept over.. we regularly talked about being a couple, sex, and shit like that before that day with her drunk friend.


I don't get it, should I hit her back up?  Or leave it be?


TLDR: Girl stayed the night with me, talked about having sex/couple shit next week, randomly one day changes everything, says staying the night she felt nothing and we're only friends

Edit - If anyone wants a picture to see how it was before and after I can oblige"

My question is: what types of opportunities for after college are available? By that I mean, is the job market flooded by former students? It doesn't have to be centered in Stillwater, I just want to know if companies are reaching out to students with internship opportunities and things of that nature.

I'm thinking about engineering, specifically computer. Bonus points if anyone could review their program/related ones!

Thank you in advance, sorry this is kind of a lengthy post!!"

Cal Poly is decently ranked and, even out of state, costs 2/3 the local meh-rated private school. Also, I'll be able to feel my feet in january.

Hundreds of ships to buy and customise, A universe you and your faction can mould.
* We get a cool trailer of course!
* Lots of media talk and promo work with PC Gamer talking up the amazing Faction Warfare over planets.
* Eventually closed beta comes around and you can participate if you buy into the founders program for only $80 but you get 4 founders ships for it and some more Universe Creds you can use to buy hangar space and paint.
* There's two solar systems at this time and game play revolves around teams of 8 dog fighting in space, no planet landing or interaction is currently available.
* The XP system is only a place holder, they're looking at a talent system and yeah we know half the current ones don't work, we'll fix it...
* A couple more solar systems are added some have really hot suns, some have really cold or dead suns.
* Not enough people use Pin Point Laser Cannons (PPLCs) so PGI buff them
* A few more ships are added including some that let you cloak your team
* Everyone now uses PPLCs and the dogfights are over in seconds as engines assplode!
* Not enough people use rockets in dog fighting so PGI buff them. Thus begins the Rocketapocalypse for a few weeks until they fix it.
* A new giant solar system is added, it takes 10 minutes of flying before you find anyone if you're not sniped from a million miles away first by a PPLC boat.
* ""There's no problems with PPLCs"" according to PGI ""You're on an island if you think that"" is a famous twitter quote from the owner of PGI.
* They add in Planetary Capturing as a first sign towards Faction Warfare. You capture planets by hanging around in orbit for a couple of minutes
* PPLCs are still horribly broken
* More ships are added and they start adding Heroic Ships that give you a bonus to your credits and XP.
* Open Beta, don't worry Faction Warfare is just around the corner, we expect it in the next few months, we're sorry
* Couple more big solar systems with hot suns that everyone hates dog fighting in.
* Launch day! PPLC's are unbalanced still and no Faction Warfare (but they're working on it). Meanwhile ships sit in orbit 'capturing' planets and sniping each other.
* State of the game. PGI now mention they've just started on the design work for Faction Warfare after two years of promising it.
* UI2 comes out, because UI1 was holding them back from developing you know, everything. It sucks.
* The Super Space Ship Reinforcement pack. Some reallly cool looking space ships in a $80 pack come out, we all buy it. Turns out the ships are mostly crap anyway but you can't actually find anything out about them until they're released.
* We get another new solar system with a slightly colder sun and weird sound distortion
* Yeah, in case you're wondering PPLC's are still unbalanced but PGI actually now say they're looking into them.
* ACHIEVEMENTS OMG!!!111ONEONE
* Super Alien Force Pack! Now you can buy Alien ships with amazing tech that PGI have 'balanced'. For $500 you can buy a golden alien ship
* Alien Ships are not balanced
* We get a map of the universe made by an intern in flash added to our UI. FACTION WARFARE IS COMING
* Faction Warfare isn't coming. Meanwhile PPLC's finally get a bit of a nerf and your skill tree still sucks and half the options don't work.
* Now the Alien Ship cash purchases have dried up they begin to nerf them
* PGI annouce a new IP funded by certainly not your alien ship money.
* The PGI/IGP owners drive around laughing in lambourghinis as people STILL bought into them."

Revising my portfolio. 
Created professional website where I blog about PR/Marketing related topics. 
Applied to ALL PR/Marketing related jobs at my level and above, whether at an agency or in-house.
Interviewed at many places. 

The interviews always seem to go so well. The interviewer and I get along. They really love my experience and say how I'd be a great fit with their company. But then... I don't get hired. There's someone else who either has more experience or has experience that more closely matches what the needs of the position. 

I'm at my wit's end. 

I have a Bachelors and Masters in PR &amp; Marketing. I have five internships and three years of agency experience under my belt. I have networked with so many people in the Boston PR/Marketing world.

We share a car and I often need to pick him up from work while I'm on lunch. I have to relieve my coworker at the same time each day when I return. He has just received a promotion and has been working hard to get his department in shape, often working off the clock to make sure things are taken care of. I sometimes wait 45 minutes after his shift for him to finish his work.

I try to be patient, but I get annoyed. I can't help but feel that he doesn't appreciate my responsibilities, or values them less than his own. 
On top of this, I get very snappy when I'm stressed. I work full time, attend college, and have to decide in the next few weeks if I should follow my passion and leave a job I enjoy by taking an unpaid internship. 

Basically, we are both under a lot of pressure. I know that I get short tempered when under stress, so how can I mask my frustration, at least in front of others?

Currently the night shift on my unit is ridiculously understaffed, while our day shift is overstaffed and getting new nursing interns every month. 

I personally am NOT a morning person (can stay up easily until 4am and sleep in until 11:30am on my days off...on DAYS) and the $6 shift-diff sounds amazing.

However, I've worked on days for about a year now and I absolutely LOVE the people I work with on days. I've found giving report to the people on nights to be difficult at times. As some of them just try to chew you up and spit you out...or rag on you about stupid stuff. As far as I know, no one on nights dislikes me, but I don't particularly feel connected to many of them...aside from former day shifters switched to nights.

So my question is this: What are the pros and cons of switching to nights? Would you recommend it? Is it worth it to leave a good group of coworkers and head into the unknown/to people you're not quite sure about?

I just want some other peoples opinions... thanks so much :)"
2fo7mr,1,2014-09-06,Me [19 M] with my girlfriend [18 F] of nearly 2 years are in a long distance relationship. Should we opt for an open relationship?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fo7mr/me_19_m_with_my_girlfriend_18_f_of_nearly_2_years/,"Here's background to our relationship: I live in Canada. She lives in the UK. We started talking in July 2012 and made it ""official"" in December 2012. I visited her for the first time in March 2012. Since then, we've done 5 more trips ever 3 months (on average).


We've had our issues... we broke up for a month a while back, but got back together. It's hard to figure out if we should stay together or not simply because we live so far apart... once it's over, it's over. It's not like I can just call her up and ask to go to coffee and catch up and shit. Aside from this... another problem has come up.


Having to wait so long to see her, and adore her and connect really sucks. But I love her to death. I really do! We're very different but at the end of the day, she loves me and I can't ask for anything more. She's very sexual too, probably has a higher sex drive than me to be honest. But it really sucks having to wait 3-4 months just to see her for a week or two... and this is going to go on for another few years as we're both in higher education.


I've been reading up a lot about open relationships lately and seeing both sides of the spectrum. I'm in love with my girlfriend and I don't have feelings for anyone else emotionally... but as a human being, I can see a lot of women and just see that they're really good looking... as vice versa. And obviously I don't act on that... But I was just thinking, maybe a lot of our stresses and stuff could be resolved through an open relationship? Get it on with whomever - friends, strangers, prostitute, whatever. For physical contact and nothing else?


It's also important to note that I've never been with anyone else other than her, and she hasn't been with anyone else either. We were each other's firsts. And I'll be honest, I'm kind of disappointed I never got with anyone else before her. Because I don't want to break up with her JUST to be with other people. But it would be so nice to see other people and just experience new bodies and reactions and fantasies... I don't really have that and neither does she.


So I guess what I'm really asking is - a) what do you think of open relationships in general? b) if you've had one, or are in one, how do you manage it? What's too far? How do you communicate about it? How do you bring that up with your partner without hurting their feelings? How do you deal with possible jealousy?


I love my girlfriend. I don't want to break up with her just for sex, and I won't. IF anything, this would be consensual between the both of us to allow us to be with other people whilst we're apart. And who knows, maybe even threesomes haha. I just know that I want to be with other people because I've never had that, and I really think it can help both of us - emotionally and also in the bedroom together. I don't know. Help. Lol.
Sorry for the long post. Serious replies please.


ALSO - breaking up isn’t  really an option for us. I love her very much and she's planning on coming here next year for an internship. We're working through everything. It's more about the physicality of the relationship. We talk on the phone everyday almost. So it’s really about the physical aspect and the longing to feel that with someone. Obviously it’s better with the person we love, but just to give us more diversity since we’ve been with no one else… so when you’re replying, please don’t mention breaking up because that’s not an option. :)

EDIT: EDIT: I haven't mentioned marriage... in fact, I actually ask her not to talk about it since we're not there yet and to focus on now. Nobody seems to understand what I'm asking. I know that I may not end up with this girl. I'm not naive. And while I haven't fucked other girls, I've been close to them and have been in love before... or had strong feelings. I know what I like and what I want and right now, I have that. WE both just don't have the physical side of it very often, and whilst we're going really strong, I think it would be silly to break up with her JUST for that fact... I'd like to keep running this as far as it will go... if we marry, we marry. If we break up, we break up. Please understand that. I'm not breaking up with her just to have sex. I'm asking about an open relationship BECAUSE we're going strong right now. But I'd like to see others... and I'm sure she would like to experiment with other guys too considering I'm the only one she's been with. This is about sex and being with other bodies and nothing else. I understand we may not last, but I'm NOT breaking up with her just for sex. I was wondering of how we can do this whilst still remanning in this relationship. There's nothing else right now giving us a reason to break up. So please, stop mentioning we're young. I know this. I know we may not last. But right now, we're going 2 years strong. She's a big part of my life. I'm only wondering about how to be with other people while staying with her... because if we DO stay together, it'd be more regretful when I'm 30 or 40 and haven't been with other people... but again, I'm not breaking up with her just for sex. And as of now, nothing else is giving me a reason to do that. :)

Life made a complete 180 on me in a matter of 2 months :(",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fpumr/me_21f_with_my_sort_of_ldr_boyfriend_21m_of_about/,"I'm gonna try to keep this short.



***Background info:***



So august last year i moved to another country (other side of the world for me) for an internship. Day 4 of feeling super lonely in that new country, i meet a guy in a store. He was in that country to do an internship too, was finished and on his way back home to his own country. We go for coffee, get along great and we became boyfriend and girlfriend. He decides to stay with me instead of going home. He has always told me he is a free spirit. We talked about threesomes etc, that sorta stuff. I'm kind of a free spirit myself, i understand a guy's need for sex and that for him sex and love are two different things. I'm chill with that thought, as long as i'm his number one and i can trust and build on him.



Everything went great for the 5 monts that I had my internship. My going home date comes closer and I decide to stay longer in that foreign country (with him). Eventually after 7 monts in total i have to go home and he goes back to his country as well. 



Now, about three weeks before I was going home, something really fucked up happened. We were travelling the country and were staying at a beach place in a tent. After setting up the tent he goes to do his thing while i sort some stuff out in the tent. In there if found a ripped condom package. WTF. For me, this is the first time using the tent, but he used it about two weeks earlier to go to that same beach place (the city we were originally staying in didn't have a beach close by). 



I  confront him about it, he admits he had sex with a girl. I'm heartbroken, but also understand his need for other ""flavours"" of girls. If it is purely for sex, and not love, i can understand it. I've told him this before, since we spoke about this stuff regularly.
Things were a little awkward between us but we didn't break it off explicitly. 
So about 4 days later, i go to sleep in our tent. He was still out doing his thing, but when i woke up, he was not there. Turns out, he was fucking another girl (a different girls than the first time). I was crying histarically, because WTF, i was like 20 meters away. I was done with his shit, and left that fucking awful beachtown, and went back to the city i was living in.



One week before my flight, he comes to my place to pick up his stuff. He says sorry, crying and all that and we get back together. We feel as strong together as we did before all this awful shit went down, but eventually i have to go home.



I spend some time with my family back at home and after 6 weeks I go visit him in his home country for about 2 months. This was absolutely great, the best time i've ever had. No issues with infidelity, just absolutely great. Him telling me that i am the love of his life, telling me he wants to be with me forever. He even cried a few times because ""he loves me so much and doesn't ever want to lose me"".



***Current situation:***



We both had to go back to school so i got back to my homecountry about 2 monts ago. We chatted regularly and skyped sometimes. We both agreed that we want to be with each other, but since its not possible right now, we'll just kind of be free for now (not officially together, but we still love each other). 



**So i moved to a new city here in my home country about a month ago and school started last week. And i'm a fucking mess. 
I don't know anyone here but i've been in this situation before (new city, being alone blabla) so i thought i would be fine, that i would be able to build a new life here (as I have before). I've been doing everything to meet new people (being open and talking with strangers, going to meet-ups by myself etc), but i feel so fucking lonely. 
I wanted to go out this weekend and contacted the few people that i met here, but no one really responded, or they already had things to do and didn't invite me (even after me saying I didn't have any plans for the night yet). Some one would hit me up later, but of course didn't** 



**Meanwhile, my ""boyfriend"" is on the other side of the world, having a great time in college (he is naturally spontaneous and popular). I hear from him maybe once a week, very briefly, we don't really skype anymore and he has told me he just wants to do his own thing (untill we can be with each other again). He still tells me that he really is ""mine forever"", that was the outcome of the talk we had about this. He said; "" If anything i will have to ditch some poor girl and break her heart once we can be together again"", ""I'm just being a little player and puppy in [his college town] for a bit. And then i will come find you"", ""i love you so much"", ""just know that i really am forever yours"".**


**So yeah, apart from that, we don't really talk that much anymore. And it hurts the shit out of me. I feel a big void.**



I've been dealing with depression before, and even though i thought i was ""cured"" half a year ago, i can feel it coming back. I'm such a fucking mess. **I went to bed at ten o'clock this friday and saturday, because no one wanted to hang out. I've been crying in my bed and i woke up this morning crying too.** 



I feel so lonely, i don't have any friends here and the guy i thought i could build on and would be there for me forever, is just doing his own thing, not really caring about me.



What the fuck happened? :( Half a year ago life was fantastic, and now I just want to get hit by a car so i can be in the hospital for a few weeks so i dont have to deal with this shit.



**How the hell to i turn this around? I'm so over it, constantly trying to hang out with people and inviting them to do things, while no one ever invites me or reciprocates. What the fuck am i doing wrong? And any advice on the sort-of-boyfriend situation?**



---   
TLDR; after a fantastic year abroad (apart from some infidelity issues) with my boyfriend that I met over there, we both had to go back to school (on the other side of the world). He's doing great and having fun, not really caring about me, while i'm here being lonely and depressed because 1. I can't seem to make new friends and 2. I feel like i'm dealing with a break-up. It's too much for me to handle and i feel my depression coming back.  "

He was not the big name he would become just a few years later, but around Chicago he was a big enough name that I recognized who he was when I saw him.  His book had just been published and he had received some recognition locally for it, and I had actually seen him on campus a couple of times the year before.  He was an “up and comer”.
 
Anyways, I got the chance to attend this big dinner/party/celebration event downtown that had everybody who was anybody in Chicago at the time.  It was an event that took place just before the big Democratic Party convention.  The mayor was to give a talk and I was told to do a write up of the mayor’s comments and if possible, get a short interview.  (I did not get the interview)  I would figure about three or four hundred people were there.  Lots of money and power in the room.  As the night went on the drinking and noise levels both escalated.  I remember being a bit shocked to see these kind of people carrying on like they were, but it was also exciting to be around it.  I want to emphasize though that I was not drinking.  I was clear headed the entire night.  I saw what I saw.  I know what I know.
 
Just before I was going to leave, I ran into one of my professors and sat down to have a talk.  I remember being pretty excited that she actually remembered me, and even more excited that she seemed to want to ask me how I was doing and what not.  I also remember she did seem a little drunk.  We ended up sitting and talking for almost an hour and by the time she stood up to leave there were maybe just twenty or so people still hanging around.  Everyone else had left.

2fqn2n,2,2014-09-07,Migrating Google Calendar API from v2 to v3... I'm completely lost,ubccompscistudent,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/2fqn2n/migrating_google_calendar_api_from_v2_to_v3_im/,"I'm 3 days into my first internship and I feel completely overwhelmed with my first task. I am supposed to migrate our packages that rely on the Google Calendar API from version 2 (which, as some of you will know, is being deprecated on November 17) to version 3.

I have never used the API before and I can't find any lengthy examples online. The official API has a ""How to Migrate"" guide, but it is a tiny example that covers a low fraction of the number of classes involved in the migration. So right now, I'm pouring through the following Javadocs, trying to learn how the calendar currently works, and map it to how it should work with version 3.

[Old google client library (calendar packages included)](https://developers.google.com/gdata/javadoc/)

[New google client library](http://javadoc.google-http-java-client.googlecode.com/hg/1.19.0/index.html)

[New google Calendar library](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/calendar/v3/java/latest/)

To me, I would think Google Calendar would be a widely used API and thus have many examples of how to migrate online, but I have only found less than a handful of examples, and they're all short.

Do I not understand how to read API docs or something? I've been reading over every link on the official API and I still don't understand how it works. It's like I've missed a course on how to use APIs in Java programming.

Sorry this turned into an anxious rant, but I'm feeling so lost and none of my courses or side projects prepared me for this."

2fqyh6,2,2014-09-07,"Me [26 f], how do I accept my life the way it is and deal with how things have turned out?",so_hopeless,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fqyh6/me_26_f_how_do_i_accept_my_life_the_way_it_is_and/,"So this will be a long read. About me, I am a 26 year old female, and I am in graduate school for biology. Always been an introvert, it takes me a while to ‘connect’ with people but once I get to know them I can open up a bit.  I think the few people who know me well would say I am fun to be around.  I am at a point in my life where I just really hate what I do, I have no motivation to go into a lab and run experiments every day, and I now I have no friends.  It takes all of my willpower to get out of bed, and make it through the days, most nights I just wish I could go to bed and never wake up.  Background on how I get here??


So a few years ago, I moved from (a third world) country to the U.S for college. I was a pre-med/biology major with hopes of going to medical school. I have always wanted to become a doctor from ever since I was a small child. But as time went on, I realized that getting into Med school in the U.S would not be easy as an International student would not be easy, there’s no way I could ever afford to pay for it. Hell, even with scholarships I was struggling to pay for college. Anyway I tried to make the best of my college experience, did internships and volunteered, and made some really good lifelong friends. Graduation was looming, and I need to do something with my life.  So what did I do, I applied to grad school and I got it. So in 2012 after graduation, I moved to a new town and embark on this new journey, and since then my life has just eroded to shit.


Things started out ‘okay’. I mean it’s always hard to get adjusted when one moves to a new city. So I thought I would give it sometime. I completed my rotations and chose a thesis lab about 2 years ago. For two years now, I have been working on a project that is going nowhere, I have accomplished nothing, and I think the last two years of my life have been a complete waste. Additionally I have made no friends here, there’s not one person I can call a friend here after two years.  I hate everything about my life right now, and I really don’t know how I made it thus far. I am also jealous of my friends, and other people I knew from college and internships.   I spend hours on FB (hate to admit it but it’s the truth) looking at friends in medical school or in their respective career field doing what they love. It makes me so sad that I am here doing something I do not feel passionate about.  It’s especially hard when I graduated at the top of my class and people who struggled to get by in college, are doing what I’ve always wanted to do. I’ve never been much an outgoing person, but in college I made some ready good friends (4) of them. We have kept in contact via text but with time that contact had decreased. I seem pictures on FB of how they’ve moved on with their lives and made new friends, and for some reason I am really hurt by this.


I am realized that I might be depressed, and through my school I was able to see a therapist. I have been six times, but now I need to go through my insurance (and pay) if I want to continue which makes things a lot more complicated. My therapist told me the main source of my unhappiness and melancholy seems to be school. She had encouraged me to try some things and see if I observed any changes in my life. She encouraged me to see an N.P physiatrist to get on anti-depressants, to join a support group, join a meet-up and maybe find somewhere to volunteer. The thing is I haven’t done any of these things. I have looked at the support groups/meet-up online but I never get around to doing it. I just feel like I don’t have the energy or drive to do anything. You’d thing that I would be excited to meet new people since a lot of days I feel incredibly lonely. Un-top of all this, I have really bad anxiety with regards to some basic things (mainly driving and doctor/dentist visits). 


Ideally I would just leave grad school, but I would have to move back to my home country. I can’t just say here. I spoke to my family (mother and aunt; dad is not in the picture). I told them that I was really unhappy here; they tell me they can hear it in my voice.  However I was told that if I left to return home, I basically would bring shame to my family and they told me I was selfish.  If I left I probably wouldn’t even have a home to stay. They explained to me that I should thankful for this wonderful opportunity, I am going to school full tuition paid with a stipend, and that a lot of people would dream for this. But this is not my dream.  They told me I should think about all the people wanting an education and here I am wasting this opportunity.
At this point I just feel like I should continue with life this way? After all there are people who have it a lot worst that me, and a lot of this is maybe my fault since I decided to go to grad school in the first place.

 At 26, I am friendless, lonely, never been in a relationship or had a bf, bitter and apathetic, hate what I do all day-everyday, but how do I continue living this way? Wish I were never born/never existed to not have to deal with any of this. How do I accept my life for what it is?

TLDR; 26 f, unhappy with life, no friends, grad school not working out for me, family would possibly disown me if I left!
Anyone been in a similar situation or has any words of advice for me?  How do I accept my life for what it is?

Thanks again for your time.

2frdm3,1,2014-09-07,I am sick of my ex,Kev0kev,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2frdm3/i_am_sick_of_my_ex/,"My ex and I broke up a few months ago. I found TRP around that time. She came running back to me for a while. One day I tried to initiate morning sex after she spent the night at my house, and she said no. I told her what I thought about her and kicked her out. We aren't talking, I deleted her number. I got an internship in another state over the summer and spent all my time there, working. I have no clue what she did.

Since I got back in town I have started running down my old trail, which happens to go passed the house she lives in. I'm not going to change my running path for that bitch, no matter what she says. I've only seen her outside once before, but I just kept going.

Until last night. I was running passed and I saw her outside of her house with a guy. This guy was a ""friend"" of hers the whole time we were dating. She knew him before she met me and would go to dinner with him once a week. She invited me to go with them once, and I could tell, that bastard wanted to fuck her. At the time I had fun with it, made him pretty jealous. And after the dinner I asked her if she knew her ""friend"" had a thing for her. She said that he didn't and played stupid. I told her not to see him anymore, but she didn't listen to me. She kept going to dinner with him. Even once, after a fight she met him and his frat bros to go drinking. I don't think she ever cheated on me, but now I don't know.

She was outside of her house, intimately hugging the guy. The slut was embracing her ""friend"" who was ""there for her"" while we were dating. I wanted so badly to go punch the asshole, but all I could think of was him drilling my girlfriend in her bed while we were dating.

I've learned a lot since I swallowed the red pill. But I am so angry at this cunt. I acted beta. I told her I loved her while we were dating, I didn't dread game her, I let her boss me around and make decisions and say no to me. This asshole is an Alpha, he is taller than me and worked at an internship on Wall Street this summer. The slut was swinging branches and I am so angry.

How can I handle this the red pill way?"

2frs9a,11,2014-09-07,Something to consider about returning Brawl veterans and the leaked CSS,supdog13,smashbros,https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/2frs9a/something_to_consider_about_returning_brawl/,"* So with all the theories floating around about who the last 5 will be, I've thought about why these specific final 5 weren't featured in the alleged ESRB CSS (if the final 5 exist at all). For the sake of argument, let's assume they do exist. Now the main theory behind who was unlocked and who wasn't has to do with who Nintendo needed to report to the ESRB. For example, Bowser Jr. because of his cannons, Shulk because of his sword, and Falco because of his gun. So it makes sense that those ""violent"" character are unlocked. But why were there veterans unlocked who wouldn't matter to ESRB, like Mr. Game and Watch, Ness, and Dr. Mario?  Why those characters are not others? They seemed to be unlocked arbitrarily (if the final 5 do exist). What violence does Mr. G&amp;W and Ness feature that Ice Climbers and Ridley do not?



* For the final 5 that are newcomers, this could potentially make sense: Sakurai didn't want to reveal new characters he didn't need to because he sought to minimize leaks throughout development, especially of newcomers. Ridley/Mewtwo/etc. are relatively hyped characters, so it COULD make sense that they remained locked. 


* However, this is particularly worrisome for Brawl veterans: Wolf, Ice Climbers, and Lucas. Why would Sakurai/Nintendo hide them? They didn't hide G&amp;W or Ness, but they just decided to hide Wolf, Ice Climbers, and Lucas? Especially if you consider how similar Ness and Lucas are and that Wolf has a gun, it just seems very inconsistent that these characters would remain locked. Furthermore, there isn't any reasonable hype behind these characters. They're vets. The reasonable, average fan would believe that they would return. I really doubt that Sakurai is actively reading message boards to the point that he knows players are nervous about W/IC/L being cut.  So why hide them? Why even cut them for a Wii U DLC release? What I'm saying is, unless Sakurai is extremely inconsistent about who unlocked for the ESRB, it is very unlikely that a Brawl vet is part of the final 5. 



* **TL;DR** Why did the ESRB video include some vets that wouldn't need ESRB monitoring (G&amp;W and Ness), but not include others that may be part of the final 5? (Lucas/IC/Wolf). I believe that if the final 5 exist, they need to be tame enough to not need ESRB verification and most likely are not veterans, as there was no apparent reason to hide veterans (unlike hyped newcomers). 

* **edit:** So from what we've discussed, I think there are two likely scenarios: 

1. the ESRB needs images and videos from a copy of the game that the player will have, not the developer copy. So it COULD make sense that an intern or whatever had to manually unlock this questionable content, and in the process of doing so, unlocked some characters that didn't need to be checked by the ESRB. But to we'd need to know what the ESRB rules are to really verify this.

2. there is no final 5, the leaked CSS is the final roster. In my opinion, this seems more likely...I just don't see why Nintendo would jump through all these hoops. I think the ESRB just wants to see content, and leaving content out seems fishy. "

it's my first proper internship and i don't have any development skills, so i will be looking around Melbourne for the right person/business to develop this app. 

It's essentially an app which needs to be able to have maps integrated into it, as the app involves tours around certain locations in melbourne etc. 

I've never went out in search for an app developer before and having a look around on google, a lot of businesses have popped up but they all specialise in something different, so i'm just not sure what the best way to look would be. would it be best to plan out what i want the app to do, drawing etc. and then send a mass email out to a lot of the melbourne based ones and see what they come back with?

Christmas, 1998. At 5 AM, a young /u/tjrieves is already up and waiting in front of his parents' door. Once the adults finally wake up at 9, the boy hurls himself down the stairs and lands like a leopard or maybe some sort of bird of prey. The presents are mocking him, sarcastically begging to be torn open. What they don't know is that today is the day of their reckoning. With the ferocity of a puma, or maybe a weasel, the ginger child rips apart the gift wrap one present at a time. The first present is a Megazord. Cool. A tear is shed for a package of socks. More tears for a shirt. Then *it* is opened. The angels will sing of this day for all of eternity. Sitting on a throne of shredded wrapping paper and lies about Santa is an Optimus Prime toy, in all its glory and splendor. 

Three days later the toy is broken.

Meanwhile for the past millions of years, the Autobots have been fighting the Decepticons for control of their home planet Cybertron. For six years, the mods of /r/Transformers have been fighting other mods for title of the coolest subreddit. Today, that subreddit is /r/Transformers. The subreddit that speaks so much to the five-year-old me with the broken Optimus Prime toy.

Transformers, robots that can shape shift into anything from cars and planes to cassettes and guns, have been hugely popular since they were brought to the US by Hasbro in 1984, and have since spawned multiple [toy lines](http://www.unicron.com/tfitem/toylist_menu.php), [television series](http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/27/the-history-of-transformers-on-tv), [comic series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(comics\)), an [animated movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie), and for better or worse, a [live-action movie franchise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series\)). The Transformers community outside of Reddit is very large and very active with events such as the annual [BotCon](http://www.botcon.com/BotCon2014/).

Members of /r/Transformers frequently share their [sprawling collections](http://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2dm069/coll_now_3_shelves/) or post [custom creations](http://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2dds6e/figured_id_share_my_lego_optimus_very_blocky_but/) to show off to the community. Many other posts are information on [where to pick up the latest (or cheapest) toys](https://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2esw6x/mp_prowl_is_available_on_truca/) or [which comics to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2eto6t/a_lot_of_you_my_not_realize_this_but_some_of_the/). Almost all posts on /r/Transformers are original content, ensuring fresh posts and quality content, as well as lively discussion.

If you think you can handle the awesomeness of fighting robots that Transform and shoot laser guns, check out /r/Transformers today!

&gt;## 1. Before we start, Autobots or Decepticons?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** Autobots

&gt;&gt;**icefox** Both!

&gt;##2. Tell us about yourselves!

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I'm Canadian, and Proud! I'm 34 yrs old, and have a loving wife and a beautiful daughter. I'm currently unemployed, so if anyone ever figures out a way to make money at Moderating sub-Reddits... let me know!

&gt;##3. How long have you been fans of Transformers?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I have been a Transformers fan since the very start! I was 4 years old, and into cars, so my parents felt the logical progression would be robots, and Transformers fit perfectly into that plan. I remember seeing the '86 movie in the theater, and as a 6 yr old I cried when Optimus died. From there on out... I was hooked!

&gt;&gt;**icefox** As a kid in the 80's and only had three original G1 toys, but in 2000 with the return of cars and trucks in RID followed by alternators, masterpiece, and the amazing WST lines it was hard not to get back in.

&gt;##4. How did you get involved in /r/Transformers?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I've been subscriber (or Redditbot) to this sub for years! I recall that when I joined there was only about 800 of us, and now there are over 6000! Only recently have I become a Moderator here, and as an active user I think I have brought some fun to this sub.

&gt;&gt;**icefox** I created /r/Transformers as soon as users were given the ability to create subreddits (6 years ago now). According to http://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/about.json we are one of the earliest user-created subreddits. I created /r/Transformers because I wanted to have a much richer method of discussion than what all transformer sites allowed. Replying to a specific comment and viewing all of the comments in one go was (and still is for some transformer news sites) impossible. It might have been too soon as at first there was not enough user on reddit to sustain a /r/transformers subreddit, but several years later I realized that there were hundreds of users subscribed and so I started regularly posting content and very quickly the community emerged and we rapidly grew.

&gt;##5. Who is your favorite character?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** Jetfire

&gt;&gt;**icefox** HotRod

&gt;##6. What's your favorite Transformers series, and why?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I'm a G1 fan through and through! I grew up on the stuff, and the '86 movie is still something I watch at least once a year.

&gt;&gt;**icefox** In the cartoon universe, the Animated cartoon was very well written and my favorite. In the toy universe it would have to be the combination of CHUG with its fantastic update to the G1 line followed by the Alternator line which was an amazing line both in articulation and detail, but also in value with each toy running only $20.

&gt;##7. Give a small description of your subreddit!

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** The Transformers subreddit is for people that like robots, but also like cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, planes, helicopters, trains, guns, dinosuars, tanks, spaceships, animals, monsters, cassettes, radios, and... bigger robots made out of multiple robots.

&gt;&gt;**icefox** /r/Transformers is a news and discussion site made by Transformers fans. We typically get much of the latest news from Hasbro and 3rd parties, but we also have a wide range of Transformers topics including fans showing off their custom paint jobs on a toy, comic and toy reviews, photos of toys in amusing locations/poses, AMA's with voice artists, toys identification, one of a kind (truly unique and there is only 1 of) items on ebay, and anything more that fans find amusing that is related to transformers. We actively encourage users to post links to original content which results in the subreddit containing much more than what the standard transformers news sites carry on their main page.

We (the counselors, college-age interns) would pick up at-risk kids and take them out to activities.  One morning, we went to the local mall to see a movie.  I was sitting on a bench with a few kids waiting for the others to arrive.  A big line of people getting their movie tickets were about ten feet away from us.  I put my coffee on the floor near the bench.  A minute later, one of the kids inadvertently kicked the coffee over, spilling it on the floor (although I thought I did it myself at the time).  My thought process went like this:

1. *I need to make sure this gets cleaned up.*

2. I walk into the theater section and notify an employee.  *A janitor will clean it up.*

I returned to the bench with the kid, knowing that soon the coffee would be cleaned up.  I saw some of the other counselors arriving at the door, so I got up with  the kids to walk over.  As we were walking, a man in line addressed me.  ""You could get some paper towels and clean that up,"" he said.  A bit shaken (from the criticism I guess), I replied, ""I told someone who works here, someone should be here to clean it up soon.""  As I walked with the kids, one of them (12 years old) turned to me and said, ""wait, are you really not going to clean that up?""  I turned back and looked at the mess, where a bystander has taken it upon himself to get some paper towels and clean up my mess.  I felt bad that he was cleaning up after me, so I went back over and told him I'd finish the job.  After a moment, an amiable employee of the mall wandered from another part of the mall with a walkie talkie and assured me that a janitor would be over to clean it up and that I didn't have to worry about it.  I asked ""are you sure?""  She said yes, so I returned to the camp group.  I was shaken up about the whole incident until we started to watch the movie ten minutes later.  None of the other counselors realized what I had done, which was sort of reassuring.

Was I being narcissistic, or was I just being a brat by expecting someone else to clean up after me?"

in terms of the actual app, it needs to be maps integrated for the self guided tours for customers to be able to use themselves. i want to have like sub sections of like restaurants, bars, certain shopping places, bike tours, record stores, art etc with self guided tours mapped on a map just like the maps app. 

if anyone has seen the trip advisor city guide app [here](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/tripadvisor-offline-city-guides/id480066121?mt=8) something sort of like that, those general ideas (i realise they are a huge organisation), but obviously we will have our own tours and the like on there, but the idea is something very much along those lines. 

what would be the best way to go about this? should i start drawing up very rough design ideas and how i want things to look, what should go where etc? i literally have no idea where to begin as it's my first time having to get an app developed, and although i haven't started the internship yet (this friday) i just wanted to get a bit of a head start. 

how should i look for the right developer (australia), as i've read there are a lot of people doing dodgy work for clients and i want to get it right. what should i look out for.

thank you for any feedback and suggestions. "

Christmas, 1998. At 5 AM, a young /u/tjrieves is already up and waiting in front of his parents' door. Once the adults finally wake up at 9, the boy hurls himself down the stairs and lands like a leopard or maybe some sort of bird of prey. The presents are mocking him, sarcastically begging to be torn open. What they don't know is that today is the day of their reckoning. With the ferocity of a puma, or maybe a weasel, the ginger child rips apart the gift wrap one present at a time. The first present is a Megazord. Cool. A tear is shed for a package of socks. More tears for a shirt. Then *it* is opened. The angels will sing of this day for all of eternity. Sitting on a throne of shredded wrapping paper and lies about Santa is an Optimus Prime toy, in all its glory and splendor. 

Three days later the toy is broken.

Meanwhile for the past millions of years, the Autobots have been fighting the Decepticons for control of their home planet Cybertron. For six years, the mods of /r/Transformers have been fighting other mods for title of the coolest subreddit. Today, that subreddit is /r/Transformers. The subreddit that speaks so much to the five-year-old me with the broken Optimus Prime toy.

Transformers, robots that can shape shift into anything from cars and planes to cassettes and guns, have been hugely popular since they were brought to the US by Hasbro in 1984, and have since spawned multiple [toy lines](http://www.unicron.com/tfitem/toylist_menu.php), [television series](http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/27/the-history-of-transformers-on-tv), [comic series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(comics\)), an [animated movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie), and for better or worse, a [live-action movie franchise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_(film_series\)). The Transformers community outside of Reddit is very large and very active with events such as the annual [BotCon](http://www.botcon.com/BotCon2014/).

Members of /r/Transformers frequently share their [sprawling collections](http://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2dm069/coll_now_3_shelves/) or post [custom creations](http://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2dds6e/figured_id_share_my_lego_optimus_very_blocky_but/) to show off to the community. Many other posts are information on [where to pick up the latest (or cheapest) toys](https://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2esw6x/mp_prowl_is_available_on_truca/) or [which comics to read](https://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/2eto6t/a_lot_of_you_my_not_realize_this_but_some_of_the/). Almost all posts on /r/Transformers are original content, ensuring fresh posts and quality content, as well as lively discussion.

If you think you can handle the awesomeness of fighting robots that Transform and shoot laser guns, check out /r/Transformers today!

&gt;## 1. Before we start, Autobots or Decepticons?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** Autobots

&gt;&gt;**icefox** Both!

&gt;##2. Tell us about yourselves!

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I'm Canadian, and Proud! I'm 34 yrs old, and have a loving wife and a beautiful daughter. I'm currently unemployed, so if anyone ever figures out a way to make money at Moderating sub-Reddits... let me know!

&gt;##3. How long have you been fans of Transformers?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I have been a Transformers fan since the very start! I was 4 years old, and into cars, so my parents felt the logical progression would be robots, and Transformers fit perfectly into that plan. I remember seeing the '86 movie in the theater, and as a 6 yr old I cried when Optimus died. From there on out... I was hooked!

&gt;&gt;**icefox** As a kid in the 80's and only had three original G1 toys, but in 2000 with the return of cars and trucks in RID followed by alternators, masterpiece, and the amazing WST lines it was hard not to get back in.

&gt;##4. How did you get involved in /r/Transformers?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I've been subscriber (or Redditbot) to this sub for years! I recall that when I joined there was only about 800 of us, and now there are over 6000! Only recently have I become a Moderator here, and as an active user I think I have brought some fun to this sub.

&gt;&gt;**icefox** I created /r/Transformers as soon as users were given the ability to create subreddits (6 years ago now). According to http://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/about.json we are one of the earliest user-created subreddits. I created /r/Transformers because I wanted to have a much richer method of discussion than what all transformer sites allowed. Replying to a specific comment and viewing all of the comments in one go was (and still is for some transformer news sites) impossible. It might have been too soon as at first there was not enough user on reddit to sustain a /r/transformers subreddit, but several years later I realized that there were hundreds of users subscribed and so I started regularly posting content and very quickly the community emerged and we rapidly grew.

&gt;##5. Who is your favorite character?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** Jetfire

&gt;&gt;**icefox** HotRod

&gt;##6. What's your favorite Transformers series, and why?

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** I'm a G1 fan through and through! I grew up on the stuff, and the '86 movie is still something I watch at least once a year.

&gt;&gt;**icefox** In the cartoon universe, the Animated cartoon was very well written and my favorite. In the toy universe it would have to be the combination of CHUG with its fantastic update to the G1 line followed by the Alternator line which was an amazing line both in articulation and detail, but also in value with each toy running only $20.

&gt;##7. Give a small description of your subreddit!

&gt;&gt;**dlaughy** The Transformers subreddit is for people that like robots, but also like cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, planes, helicopters, trains, guns, dinosuars, tanks, spaceships, animals, monsters, cassettes, radios, and... bigger robots made out of multiple robots.

&gt;&gt;**icefox** /r/Transformers is a news and discussion site made by Transformers fans. We typically get much of the latest news from Hasbro and 3rd parties, but we also have a wide range of Transformers topics including fans showing off their custom paint jobs on a toy, comic and toy reviews, photos of toys in amusing locations/poses, AMA's with voice artists, toys identification, one of a kind (truly unique and there is only 1 of) items on ebay, and anything more that fans find amusing that is related to transformers. We actively encourage users to post links to original content which results in the subreddit containing much more than what the standard transformers news sites carry on their main page.

I know she respects me a lot and possibly looks up to me for my experiences and knowledge. I've been meeting her a few times a week for about two weeks now. We meet up with one or two other people to do interview prep stuff and end up mostly goofing off and just talking. This past weekend we went to a competition (36 hours long) and didn't really get much done but we just spent a lot of time talking. She looked through my old facebook photos and notes and read them, I did the same with hers. I know she's very nice and friendly to most people, but I can't tell for sure if she likes me or if she just thinks of me as a good friend. I do end up giving her a lot of advice on various things and sort of coach her with interview questionss. She's opened up to me quite a bit about some personal stuff and I thinking she might have already friend-zoned me. I was thinking of just telling her that I like her, but I'm scared she doesn't feel the same and it'll make things super awkward. What do you all think?"
2fsiig,1,2014-09-08,Fuck. What did i do wrong?,Sorua,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2fsiig/fuck_what_did_i_do_wrong/,"Where to begin? I'm here to ask you the simple question: What the fuck happened?

Note: I do apologize for any typos, i really hate this asus keyboard.

Well, this story is somewhat very recent. It started in my sophmore year. I met a girl, who we shall call S, that i had only seen my freshman year. We had the same lunch together, i sat with my friends, but apparently she knew some of them, so she sat with us. At the time, i liked a totally different girl, who is now my bestfriend: let's call her M. So, up to speed, this is beginning of sophmore year, im totally in love with M, who has no idea i like her, but we are really good friends. At these lunches, I always teased S with my friends. S had a boyfriend, some cunty ginger who i hated. YSO the eyar went on, i had 3 classes with M, so we got really close (emotionally), but i made the mistake of asking her out. I did it around beginning of December, and she did what i had planned. She went to her best female friend, and asked what to say. After this little event was over, she wasn't phased by it at all, i just continued liking her until closer to the end of the year. After all these lunches, it turns out S broke up with her boyfriend during early november, before i asked M. S broke up with her boyfriend because she satarted liking me, and all of my friends knew that except me. They even placed bets that we (S and Me) would be together before the end of the year. Fast forward to may, end of my sophmore year: I had no fuckign idea S liked me, and my feelings for M were still going strong. I took the hints that S liked me from feb until may, but never thought much of it. So in May, i had this whole epiphany: S was a girl who hugged, but she only hugged her bestfriends and the person she liked. THat's when it hit me, that i have spent an entire year squandering time over M, when the person i like is right in front of me. Don't ask me how that shit works, hormones or whatever right? Anyways, my feelings changed but not completely. I like both of them, i wanted to be with the one i started liking in the first place, as to not seem liek an unloyal guy. Only my male best friend, let's call him C, knew about my feelings for M, and M's bestfriend. Fastforward a week or two, it's the last 3 weeks of school, and i make a move on S. Not much, i just held her hand as we walked togeter through an empty hall. I walked her to class, gave her a hug and then we didnt talk till mid june. I was in london, it was my birthday, I received a message from her on FB saying ""Hey, long time no see, i miss you! How have you been?"". I had completely forgotten about the existence of everyone in America, and then it all comes rushing back to me: oh shit, i have feelings for this girl. Fast forwards some, it's about to be August (pretty uneventful summer without internet). First day of school coming up, get my schedule, and she wants to see mine. We have no classes together at all, but in between all passing periods we would be able to see eachother. We hug and shit, and i guess it became a thing. At this point, M is totally out of the picture. We stop talking for the most part until later. Back to S: After the hugging and 4 months of doing this, we are in a skyp call, cause we started skyping like every other night. We talk about our feelings and whatever, and i realize this girl and i have really good chemistry. On december 19th, the question came up, and i just asked her ""are we a thing?"" and she rpelies ""do you want us to be a thing"" and i say yes. SO there is that. basically from December to this past July, we dated. We got a LOT of stuff done on our checklist. We did the do, and whatever else. She was my first kiss (First kiss in junior year? scrub) and the first person i did the do with. We closer than any couple in the entire fucking state, i can gaurentee it. So, her parents are very strict, so we had to keep our relationship hush hush. She taked about me to her parents, but only that i was a great friend and whatever else she did. She got a job an son became very 'tired' from workin 8 hour shifts. I have a paid internship at a big company, and surprisingly get paid quite a lot. I was happy for her, he got her first job, but she still couldnt drive. That means we wwont be abe to see each other. COme to the end of the school year, we were the happiest people ever. And now we are in the summer (June 2014), we start talking a little less cause we both get really busy, i dont get to see her for a month and get really emotional about it, forgtting how strict her parents are. I said to her i dont get to see you at all, our relationship isnt goign to work. I was stupid because she lost hope in our relationship too. It kep going for a month until july, we were barely talking at all, i hadnt gotten a text form her in 4 days. I asked her what's up, why she hasnt texted me in 4 days at least saying hi im alive. and her response was ""im really tired from work"" and so i get all agitated about this because how hard is it to send a text? July 4th is he birthday, and in may we planned that i would meet her parents on her birthday. She broke up with me 2 days before, at night right after my work shift. She said we need to talk and being the emotion shitfuck that i was, i got all excited because i would finally get to talk to her, if not see her. I didnt even think to notice that she would break up with me. She did, with the reason being ""I've become independent, and I dont need someone who is emotionally dependent on me to weigh me down"", i was still all excited and w/e so it didnt process till the next day. THen came July 4th, her brithday. I bought her a necklace and ass tons of fireworks so we could go have fun. I saw on fb that she posted her bday pictures and they were all happy and shit, and i was devastated. I ended up writing close to 17 pages front and back of my feelings. THen we didnt talk until a couple days ago, when i saw her after my first period class. She was all happy, and i nearly pissed my pants. I still have feelings for her. I felt liek a 6 year old. We skype later that night, and i asked can we just be friend who talk, and so we did just that, but before we started talking about stuff, she asked me ""are you hoping to do something with this?"" and i said no, even though i planned on asking her out again. Next day, i couldnt take it, i had to tell her how i feel. I spent  7 months with this girl, some may understand, others wont. I spent 7 months building a relationship with  this girl and she just threw it away. I wanted her back so badshe was my world. I forgot to mention, int he summer my life got really tough, and i told her i needed a break just to get my shit straight. I was less than a hair away from suicide and she talked me out of it (Dont worry, i havent had those thoughts since then, and im pretty stable now). She saved my life, and that made me love her even more. Yeah, like i said, 7 months, closer than anyone, and she threw it away. I trie getting her back with basically what i wrote in my little essay on my feelings. I basically reiterated all of the good things that came out of our relationship, and she simply replied ""I've moved on, you should too"".


I don't plan on giving up so easily, call me what you will. I love this girl more than words can express, she has been there for me when i needed her, and i KNOW i did the same. I just want some advice on whatever. She was the first girl i kissed, the first one i did anything with, i don't want to lose her. Help?"

2fsxam,6,2014-09-08,Me (20F) and my now ex-boyfriend/best friend (25M) broke up. What now?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2fsxam/me_20f_and_my_now_exboyfriendbest_friend_25m/,"Sorry, it's kinda long. Granted it has only been a couple days so my emotions are very raw right now, and I apologize. 

So my ex-boyfriend and I were best friends for about 2 years before we decided we wanted to try a romantic relationship. We dated for 8 or 9 months. We broke up the other day (he initiated).

The issue wasn't that we didn't get along, we actually get along great. We didn't have a single fight in our entire time together. His issues with the relationship stemmed from our age gap and how we're in different places in our lives at the moment. He told me that he loved me, but not romantically. He realized a couple weeks ago that his feelings for me were more of a sister he never had more than a romantic thing due to our age gap. He said it just made him uncomfortable and he can't get over it. 

I completely understood where he was coming from, and we had a very amiable break up. We talked at length about it and I feel that he and I really discussed our fears and issues and what this means for our relationship now. I disagree that the age gap was a problem, as I never viewed it as a issue, but I was not going to force him to stay with me when he didn't want to. 

Here's where my issue arises. With all my previous breakups, I have been able to cut ties and walk away and feel fine after a week or so. I am not friends with any of my ex-boyfriends, mostly because they are all not very good people. 

However, with this relationship, I don't want to cut ties and never speak to him again, and neither does he. He and I were such integral parts in each others's lives before (even as platonic friends) that I know I would like to eventually be friends again. He told me his hope is that we can just go back to how we were before we dated. I told him I was going to need time, and I didn't know how long that would take.

I am currently in no-contact, I deleted my Facebook, and have plans to stay busy with friends, work, school, and my internship. I have been doing some thinking for the past couple days, and at this moment, I am unsure if it would be good idea for us to continue a friendship after this, especially one where we were close as we were before.

My reasoning for this is as follows: The entire time we were friends, I dealt with this constant struggle of having feelings for him and not wanting to say anything for fear of ruining our friendship. Eventually, I got up the courage to tell him and that's how he and I decided to try. Since it didn't work out, I'm afraid that because, at least on my side, I've never had a true ""platonic"" relationship with him, I will find it hard to separate my romantic feelings from my platonic feelings for him. I think I am off to a good start though, as I am not even upset he's not my boyfriend anymore, I'm more upset I can't talk to the one person I always went to for support.       

I am afraid that because we dated and I allowed my small schoolgirl crush on him to develop into full blown love for another individual I won't be able to be close friends with him again. I already dealt with being friends with him for two years, constantly frustrated with my feelings for him. I am not sure if I can do it again. I think we would be fine being friends again up until he started seeing someone else. That would crush me more than anything that he would be giving her the love that I so desired from him. I don't think a friendship like that would be fair for either of us, because I don't want to get hurt again and I don't want him to feel like shit for hurting me again.

I really don't want to end our friendship for the foreseeable future but right now I'm not seeing any other choice.

Bascially, what I'm trying to ask is how the hell do I separate my romantic and platonic feelings for him in my mind? Will I ever be able to be best friends with him again? Would it even be a good idea for us to try be friends again? Also, how do I know that I am ready to contact him again? I hope it will be soon because I miss him in my life immensely. Or do you guys agree that I should just end our friendship for the time being and tell him we can try again in a couple years when he and I are both older?     



---   
**tl;dr**: Best friend and I of 2 years dated for about 9 months. Broke up due to age gap and different places in life. As he said, ""right people, wrong time."" Not sure if I will ever be able to shake romantic feelings for him. Should I keep doing no contact until I am ready to be friends again (which I don't know when I will be ready for), or should I end the friendship for the foreseeable future?"

2ft63v,25,2014-09-08,[Text] Some of the best advice I've used to turn my life around.,throwkittens123,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/2ft63v/text_some_of_the_best_advice_ive_used_to_turn_my/,"**1. Take 100% responsibility for your life.**

I'll let Jack Canfield say it:

&gt; “One of the most pervasive myths in the American culture today is that we are entitled to a great life—that somehow, somewhere, someone (certainly not us) is responsible for filling our lives with continual happiness, exciting career options, nurturing family time, and blissful personal relationships simply because we exist.

&gt; But the real truth—and the one lesson this whole book is based on—is that there is only one person responsible for the quality of the life you live.

&gt; That person is you.

&gt; If you want to be successful, you have to take 100% responsibility for everything that you experience in your life. This includes the level of your achievements, the results you produce, the quality of your relationships, the state of your health and physical fitness, your income, your debts, your feelings—everything!

&gt; This is not easy."" - Jack Canfield ""The Success Principles""

That completely changed my mindset. I used to blame everything else for my life. My parents, the school, the government. Until those paragraphs hit me like a brick. Complaints and excuses were no longer valid anymore. Either I did the work or I didn't. Either I manned up or I didn't. Either I go to the gym or I didn't. Either I did my travel research or I didn't. No excuses. No complaints. Man up and get the work done.

**2. Replace ""should"" with ""it would be ____ if"".**

Should is a toxic statement, because you're not obligated to do anything. So whenever you say ""should"" it just feels slightly demotivating and most of the time you end up not doing it anyway. Solution: replace should with ""it would be _____ if"", and fill in the blank with appropriate benefits.

So instead of saying ""I should really study for my Calc midterm"", say ""It would be so beneficial to my GPA if I study early for my Calc midterm."". Notice a difference? First statement sounds like a run of the mill ""I'm lazy and I should start working"" while the second one sounds like ""Fuck, it WOULD be to my benefit to do it (but I'm not obligated to). It would really benefit my life!""

Examples:
* ""I should go travelling"" *Yup. Everyone should go travelling. I've seen those travellers who have done it and so I should do it too.*

* ""It would be life changing to travel to somewhere I'm interested in"" *Yeah it would be life changing! Travel sounds like something I would really love doing. It would really benefit me if I spent some time to travel.*

* ""I shouldn't eat that cookie"" *Yeah, I've heard those obesity stories, I shouldn't really eat candy.*

* ""It would be really beneficial to your health if you don't eat that cookie"" *That's true, damn, it really would benefit me if I don't eat that cookie!*

* ""I should go to the gym"" *Yeah, everyone says exercise is good, everyone should go to the gym*

* ""It would be so great if I went to the gym. The benefits are countless."" *Oh wow hell yeah I'm gonna go to the gym, gotta reap those benefits!!*

**3. If someone has done it so can you.**

We humans are very capable creatures. You are a human. You can do it. Don't be limited by what the world has taught you. *If someone has done it so can you.*. Don't think you can work for NASA? Well thousands of people have done it. And they probably can tell you how you can do it too if you ask them. In fact if you are reading this right now you have the capability to work at Google. There's a bunch of books written about Google interviews questions out there. There's a bunch of books on programming, on algorithms, heck even basic math if you're not good at it. What differentiates those who work at Google and you is 10,000 hours.

Want to be an alpha male? There's tons of guides online on how to work out, eat right, and hit on girls.

Want to go climb Mt. Everest? Many people have done it, so can you. In fact some people have done it without oxygen. Just ask them how they trained for it, and you can start training for it too.

**4. Surround yourself with awesome people.**

It is said that you are the average of the five people you hang around with the most. Personally I've found it to be true. A lot of my high school friends smoked weed and did a lot of experimental drugs. Well I used to think that stuff was cool so I signed up to live with them. Boy what a disaster. One of them slept all day and played video games, while the other wasn't getting anywhere with his life other than smoking shittons of weed and experimenting with drugs. Then one night both of them overdosed on some weird shit because they were ""bored and didn't have anything better to do"" and I simply noped the fuck out of there. It was a total shitshow.

Now I'm in two very awesome clubs at my University, surrounded by people with internships to big name companies. Let me tell you being around people who gave fucks about their lives is so so good. I was surrounded by people who wanted to learn from me, and people who could teach me many things. I mean the energy is just so much better, so much more positive than being around people who hated school work and hated life.

In fact you can surround yourself with positive and amazing people RIGHT NOW. Podcasts are amazing for this. I highly recommend The Art of Charm podcast because the host interviews super successful people in all areas of life and how they got their shit together. I listen to it at the gym and it was a big part of me turning my life around, because I would just be bombarded with positive vibes of ""work hard, study hard, and be a MAN"".

Help in running Lost Mines of Phandelver for 7 PCs.",IndividualNo6,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2ft749/new_to_dming_new_to_5e_help_in_running_lost_mines/,"As the title suggests, I'm new to DMing after the DM from my previous 4e game asked me to take on the role so he can focus on his studies more. 

I'm taking this opportunity to transition the group to 5e and have bought the Starter Set with that in mind. The one issue I have is that beyond our initial group we've had a few other friends (who've never played before) express interest in playing, bringing the total number up to 7 (with an 8th joining us when he gets back from an internship, abroad hopefully after we've completed the lost mines). 

I know the ideal solution would be to keep it maxed at 5 but I'm an inclusive sort of guy and I'd like to give everyone an opportunity to play if I can. With that in mind I thought I'd whip up another 2 characters (possibly a 3rd contingency one as well incase we're still playing when the intern gets back) as I'd like to get everyone involved and understanding the game before having to deal complicating it with character creation. 

So with that in mind has anyone ran the campaign with 7-8 players, using pre-gens and if so what did you do for the extra PCs? I was thinking of building a melee ranger, and a druid. 

Also what did you do for the Traits, Ideals, Flaws and especially Bonds? EDIT: also the Personal Goal?

Lastly, I'm not to concerned about the first few encounters as I understand they can be pretty deadly even with 5 so with 7 it might actually balance it out a bit but towards the middle/end I'm worried it might become a cake walk.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance."

For instance not name any specifics here but I'm currently studying at a community college and i'm considering a few schools in the University of California School system. my top choice is the flagship of the system but i'm not confident that i'll get due to the fact that my major is highly competitive on the other hand my second choice is the school my mother just will not allow me to go due to the fact that its a ""party school' while I refute that universities college of engineering is ranked amongst top ten in the world but she still wont accept it even if that school was in reality my first choice even before setting my hopes on my first choice, but yet she's totally fine wit me going to the UC in riverside while yeah it's an **ok** school their program isn't even ranked as well as my other choices plus considering the location chances of potential recruiters and internships are fairly slim i'd imagine or for that matter not as abundant as my other choices. I don't know what to think but what can I do? 

Another thing is she seems fairly against me going abroad, I mean i get it it'd be only natural for parent to feel that about way about their child going off to another country but in all due respect the country I intend on going to is safer then here in the states. Plus I may not even stay there that long and I mean If I do then so be it. I was talking to her the other about an internship position i found that was perfect! It listed all of the requirements that  they wanted and I had for the most part and to make things better its paid and in the city If i ever lived in the country I'd would like to live in. But the only reason why i'm considering applying is I have to be available for 6 months but even the fact that I had mentioned it to her she got really hot headed. I mean dam in that case fuck it let me drop out of school get trade and get a shabby apartment in Downey or Whittier and live out the rest of my life not knowing whats outside ( I apologize I ranted a little bit) of course i didn't tell her that i thought it. I don't know I mean am I being to inconsiderate? 

Anyways I really appreciate everyone taking the time to read my post I really needed to just get that off of my chest and vent a little. There might be some spelling/grammar so if I catch any I'll fix it asap

2ftoh1,4,2014-09-08,I'm not sure what to do about Husband's depression and avoidance of school,Awww-Shucks,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/2ftoh1/im_not_sure_what_to_do_about_husbands_depression/,"I feel worried about our future right now. In December I had to leave work after no longer being able to do anything, because of pain from an autoimmune disease (trust me when I say my work and I exhausted all resources to try to figure out if I could still do anything.) Previous to that I had been supporting my husband and I while he went to school for the past two years. We are living with my mother and all housing bills are being taken care of, so we are currently safe on that front.
 

Since my husband has started at a University (previously he was a community college where the work load was much less) he has been falling further and further into stress and now depression. This is alarming to me, because it's not usual for him. We just came to the realization this semester that he is depressed and since then I have tried to be supportive and helpful. He will not take traditional medication with the exception of the rare ibuprofen, so I have been giving him vitamins and trying to encourage him to exercise. His main interest is gaming, and now cards/board games (which I like so much better, because it means socializing.) We have had a lot of arguments in the past about his lack of control when it comes to his hobbies and the fact that it is the number one priority in his life. This past week he was talking to me about how his friend asked him if he wanted to join in on an RPG group they were starting and I said that I didn't think it was a good idea and we talked about why, but that I wanted him to do whatever he needed to do to make himself mentally healthy and happy. At that point he thought my points were valid for why it would be a bad decision. I said that if he did decide to join the RPG group that he needed to sacrifice something else that did not include school or our relationship. I hoped that he would make the right decision in not joining as it is a lot of time investment and I didn't know where he would borrow that from. He decided to join and now has to be there every other week or he won't be able to stay in the group. He has spent the last two days building a character and talking back and forth on facebook with friends. I barely saw him do any of the schoolwork he had previously been stressed out about. He had missed his first real meeting with reps from businesses that he could intern for, because he did not prepare, because he ""didn't want to."" Because he missed that meeting he has to attend every single other one without missing even an hour to stay in the honors society he was asked to join and paid for (it is the top society in our region that you can be accepted in to for his career path and the most likely to get you an internship.)  He is doing a lot of things like this recently with not doing schoolwork and saying ""I don't feel like it"" and has now gone in to a complete avoidance with this new RPG group. 


I'm no longer sure what to do and feel like I have exhausted all efforts. I brought it up multiple times yesterday saying ""You're dedicating too much time on this"" and him surprisingly saying ""I know, I'm sorry"" (which I think is the first time I have heard him genuinely say sorry in probably 2 years without yelling it.) I was so proud by his responses and being level headed and vocal instead of having a melt down and becoming aggressive and angry (his usual mode) that I sat down and tried to ask him questions about the game to encourage more open dialog, and praised him for how he chose to respond to me. I was completely and pleasantly surprised. I tried to come up with a solution. I suggested I change his facebook password and he could check facebook every two hours and have dedicated time every night if possible to work on his character as well, and he seemed to think that MIGHT be okay. I love seeing him happy and excited and especially love how much he was responding to things I was saying. I want him to be able to come out of his depression and to have a good relationship again. Then this morning I said I was going to change his password while he was at school, because he woke up and immediately started working on it again and he flipped out and started yelling and slamming doors. I don't want to be controlling or a mother, but I'm not sure what else do to. We honestly can't risk his GPA falling, as it may be what best represents him in a future interview, which is what he himself told me. He said the other day he was worried about failing this semester (though he has a 4.0) and now it's like he has completely forgotten he has said that. When we were discussing the RPG problems, there was a long pause and I asked him if he can drop out and he said ""I think the final drop out date is in October"" and I'm like ""Wait... Are you talking about dropping out of your classes?,"" because his mind automatically went to dropping out of school versus the RPG and he seemed to think I would support this. I feel like I have no control in our lives anymore and that these decisions he is making are going to affect both of our futures as I will no longer be able to support us or myself and have exhausted my savings just helping to get us to this point.  


   His hobbies have always had a huge affect on our relationship, though I've stopped minding the past few months and have just focused on other things. Our partnership is definitely suffering from his depression. He's not even sure how he feels about me anymore, though he still cares for me. I am quite alone on my side. I continue taking care of him and hope that things change, but this issue with school as well as his new RPG hobby has me at a loss for what to do. I just wanted him to be happy and to feel like he still had lots of choices (that I hoped he would make responsibly) in his life and won't be strangled by a tie, but I don't want everything that we have worked for to have been for nothing and I don't want to feel like a mother anymore, but can't stop worrying if he's doing what he's suppose to. Any advice on how to handle this from a different perspective? 



TL;DR: Depressed husband has a new hobby and is making it his top priority, allowing school to suffer. I'm not sure how to fix it. 

Also - Sorry, for the life of me I can not figure out how to separate paragraphs. Any help there, by someone patient would also be very appreciated."
2ftvfc,2,2014-09-08,Me [21M] with my GF [21F] of 3 months are putting our LDR on hold. Need help coping.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ftvfc/me_21m_with_my_gf_21f_of_3_months_are_putting_our/,"I met this girl in May and worked an internship with her all summer. We fell in love and have been inseparable ever since, but she goes to school 800 miles away from my school. I drove to her this  weekend and we came to the conclusion that it would be best to put things on hold and just live our last year of college to the fullest without getting caught up in the baggage that comes with LDRs, especially since we realized when we visit each other, the last day of the visit would be filled with tears and sadness. 

We tried LDR for a month and she told me she spent a lot of nights crying feeling guilty that she felt like she wasn't putting in as much into the relationship as I was, and that she feels bad that I'm basically ready to settle down and commit to her and she wasn't. She kept reassuring me it's not because she wants to date other guys, but because our lives are so disconnected when she's at school and she spends most days in a funk feeling sad and missing me (which is true, she has called me crying in the middle of the night a couple times). 

Obviously her happiness is super important to me and I don't want her to feel sad all the time because we're not at the same school, so we're trying to slow it down and keep a safe distance for the time being. We live right by each other so I'll see her on breaks but I just need some words of encouragement or tips and tricks on how to deal with this sort of situation. This is the first time I've had a basically mutual ""break-up"" and we're both on good terms and we talked today. We also talked about how we should talk less just to make it easier on both of us. She has gone through something similar before where she said she wasn't happy at school at all and would only look forward to seeing her S.O at the time, so I'm glad she has brought this to our attention early before we started resenting each other. 

I would go to the ends of the earth for this girl and I just need some help from this great community. I've dealt with breakups before but none like this. 

Feel free to ask any questions.

Giving me 75% stock and 25% bonds. I would have liked to be closer to 20% bonds but I can't afford to because of the minimum investment.

This will leave me with about $3000 in the bank as a safety net, and as my school is already paid for, I don't think I will have any problems with this setup. Any suggestions, encouragment or criticism?

Also, which of these should I claim in my Roth IRA? I am planning on putting the bonds in there, and I know i can only put in $5500, but does that mean I can't put in part of the other ones in my IRA as well?"

I went through the whole doctor circuit in high school-- neurologists, massage therapy, hormone treatment, etc... You name it, I've tried it. I was even hospitalized for 9 days so they could stick an IV in me with a cocktail of 6 different medications and monitor me for effects. It obviously affected my social life and grades so much that I had to be pulled out of school and finish my diploma online. It was torture and I was so drugged up that I barely remember my high school years.

When I moved up to university I decided to cut out all the medications since they didn't work. The side effects of changing meds every 2-3 months was worse than the actual pain and I knew I couldn't go through that with university classes. Freshman year I was introduced to weed and I immediately found relief. I resisted regular use for 2 years because I was wary, but I've been a regular smoker for a year now and it has helped me in more ways that you can imagine. I went from sleeping a minimum of 14-16 hours a day with bare minimum activity and socialization, to working 3 separate internships, with classes, and freelance work all within the past year. I'm doing better than I ever dreamed.

Of course I'm dry at the moment and am currently going through a crazy intense migraine that has me completely incapacitated, but I was bored and loopy, so I thought you guys would like to hear my story. Thanks so much, you guys really are an amazing community. "

I'm having a very hard night with my fiancee.  She's a great girl, I love her, I want to marry her but she is extremely privileged and I think it all came boiling over tonight.  I'm happy that her family has money (she has a very very middle class job), because she has very expensive tastes. 

I have an extremely good job, with pay in 6 figures.  I'll be paying most of the mortgage each month.   

To preface, her mother is here, which isn't helping anything.  Also to preface, only daughter, loaded family.  No student loans, free cars, basically everything paid for -- not necessarily a trust fund girl, but coming into a lot of money.  Granted, her parents raised her well, work hard, and are great people. 

I came from very humble beginnings.  Grew up on Walmart specials, mac and cheese, and usually nothing to eat but cereal.  Raised well, worked hard to get a degree (1st in my family to get one!), then networked the shit outta everything to get an internship and work my way up to where I am now.  I work 45-50 hours a week, if not 60 most weeks and have to commute 45 minutes each way.   

We've been on the house hunt for awhile now.  I'm extremely leery of buying a house because I feel the market is going to top out again and we need to be careful on making such a large purchase.  I also bought a house years ago which immediately tanked and I lost tens of thousands of dollars.

My future wife is sick of living in an apartment.  We live together now in a very large apartment in a very nice part of town, with ample storage and room.  It's not a cheap place to live and I have to commute a long ways.

She wants a house.  I know this.  She wants a house very badly.  She also has a crap ton of requirements that goes into the house.  When looking last week, I thought we found something that we both liked, within our budget.  She said this place is ""perfect"", I ""love it"", and what I thought from our previous conversations.  I said, if we both love it and think it's good, we should make an offer.  She said no because we just got started shopping (partly true, that was the 4th or 5th house we physically saw, but we've been shopping online for months).  She said today I dont' want to make an offer because it doesn't feel right?  Doesn't feel right?  What does that mean?  I manage to keep my cool and talk in a normal voice, she's bawling, calling me ""ridiculous"" and stomping off into the other room, which sets her mom off -- slamming the door to our porch, breaking our blinds. 

To clarify, I don't know what she wants.  I've tried talking to her, but I think she wants the ""perfect"" home.  Which means fits everything she wants in an over-inflated housing market (where I live), means that a house is out of our price range.  I ask her that we may need to think about our budget and make sure that we're fitting a budget and you may need to make sacrifices on what you want for something to live in.  It got to the point and she said, whatever, I'm going shopping for the house on my own.  I said, we found a house that we already like in our price range and what we want...why aren't we moving on an offer?  She said FINE, LETS BUY THE FUCKING HOUSE THEN.  

This does not go over well.  Not only does she say that I'm being ridiculous (which I immediately go on the defensive for -- it's ridiculous to be concerned about budget???), but she thinks we can get it all for what we want to pay.  Long argument short, her mother gets involved and I'm now a hated man.  Same woman who said she's so happy because I treat her so well just the night before.  

It's really really hard trying to stand my ground especially with the people who are paying for our wedding and giving us a generous downpayment gift.  I also don't want to let her get whatever she wants, because it's just fueling (what I think) is the problem -- she's gotten whatever she's wanted and never really had to work for anything and doesn't understand really what it takes to be in want.  

===========
Sorry, had to rant.  Any advice or comments are welcome.  PM me if you'd like.  
===========

Another thing that I dislike about her is that she doesn't really work for anything.  She signed up for a triathlon and waited until the 3 weeks before to start training.  I've done triathlon's before and know that it can be done, but shouldn't.  Her next task?  A full marathon.  We're 8 weeks out and she's done one week of running...two weeks ago.  I wish she knew what it took to put blood sweat and tears into something and earn it rather than limp through.  I'm not sure how I can inspire that for her.  I love her and want to help, but I just want to have my feelings and needs met and I don't want to be given everything.  I've made it clear that our children are paying for their own way.  We will help, but they have to want/earn it.  "
2fw37z,1,2014-09-09,The long college grind..... I can't even picture what fun is anymore.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2fw37z/the_long_college_grind_i_cant_even_picture_what/,"Well hopefully this doesn't get too long but, Thank you for sticking with me....

Background: I'm 23, been in college 5 years, with only a sophomore standing towards a bachelor's degree and now a low GPA of 2.5 (2.67 in my major). 

I remember going into college with a positive uplifting feeling everyday. Nothing could get me down, not even failing a class... I would just try again looking at my mistakes. I worked towards Everything on the Computer science check list. All my friends on and off campus looked up to me, I founded from the ground up the largest club on campus for 3 years and still running. Everything was fun....

Winter 2013 I started my first university CS class. I had built up to this point at a community college and finally transferred in. My GPA at this point was a 2.64 I ended the first term with a B all around in my major. My second term ended with a C. The class was just hard, I was fearful of every test I took (being only a midterm and final) Now at the university classes I wanted to maintain strong GPA for the advertised internships  and other work study programs. My adviser also pointed out that I had a low GPA in my major and to enter the program I needed atleast a 3.0 so I was advised to take the class over for a higher grade.

Which was over the summer, I usually had no problem taking classes over the summer, But something came over me. The class felt harder than before... everything was rushed and I just didn't feel like trying anymore. I also was only taking 1 class... So when the final came around the class was allowed to turn in all the homework on the absolute last day with a VERY minor late fee a few days after the final.. 

I took to final, felt like I was doing worse in the class, I was backed up on 2 out of 5 assignments... So I quite literally just quit, I went to my friends house on the final turn in night telling my self I'd finish it and turn it in. but I just didn't care... I had calculated my minimum score I needed to pass and was doubtful I got even close. I just dropped the assignment and didn't turn it in....

Later I found out I got an 83% on the final (better than I hoped, first time I got like a 51%) however I was flunked from the course for not turning all the assignments in.. Also dropping my GPA to a low 1.6 placing me on academic warning... I tried to make up all sorts of excuses and lies to little myself out but nothing worked.

At this point I'm really surprised I was able to hold things together and switch gears to finish my Track science credits, math credits and some left behind Computer classes.... That was fall... The plan was to take a full year of boring difficult classes with the lingering doubt that it would all just be to take more pointless classes.

The year was horrid... I didn't even care about any form of learning, just anything to pass through the classes and not fail. I even worked my way into academic accommodations, which I very quickly began to use to cheat on tests... Yes Straight up cheat after awhile, I still got C;s in these classes with massive extended time and all the knowledge of the internet I couldn't even fathom an A...

This summer was the last class I needed to take, and frankly I didn't care about it at all. But of course I managed to be just stupid enough for just below passing... cheating on all the tests... I still have to repeat it...

Than something very interesting happened tonight when I found my grade... before I was having a crisis with paying for my college failures but just now I got confirmed that money was no longer an issue... when I mentioned I have to repeat the class, my mom asked me to take another class that I thought would be fun...

Quite literally my mind was just blank... I was angry sure... but not upset enough to blank myself... I was asked to take any class I wanted on campus that I thought would be fun... and I just couldn't think of anything on the entire list of classes everything was just a let down...

Now I know the first signs of serious depression are complete loss of interest in things normally found interesting... I am seeing a professional on this started years ago, he saw I was really depressed this summer.

And its really true. I used to be a competitive gamer, on top of all the trending games. though now I can't even find myself playing a PC game for more than 30 mins without being down and depressed. I moved on to horrid mobile games because they waste time. 

I've spent thousands of dollars on MTG in the past 5 years, when about to attend a huge regional tournament event out of state that I already paid for. My first thought was that it would be pointless to go... Thinking I'd just enter in to lose and get nothing from it... after attending I can't play at my local card store without the deep sense that to Competitively play the game I need to move to out of to get any better so it constantly feels like its pointless to even play locally....

And now when faced with a chance to take any class, at no cost to me, that is ""fun"" I can't even picture what is ""fun"" anymore. My life just feels void and empty.

I've been in college for 5 years now.... I have the standing of a sophomore.... My sister who entered 4 years after me has about the same standing as me.... I have to attend a special meeting to review my Academic Warning.... Which I can't even think about doing without beginning to tear up. As it just lays out that the last 5 years of my life might as well be wasted.

Well there is tons more to talk about. but the bottom line is I'm just straight done with college... I don't even care about learning anymore, I just want to get through it... and go to the void which is unemployment...? I feel absolutely backed into a corner on options with college.....

I'll answer any questions, despite my emotion I'm very stable minded (Hopefully) Any input is helpful. Some personal questions I will request to be done through PM. I made a new account as to not ruin my reputation with my friends and be accused to academic dishonesty. I WILL delete this thread when I feel its value is at a close."

It's something that is a ""dream job"" for many people, something he did extensive schooling and internships for, and something for which good job opportunities are few and far between. So when he got an amazing job offer on the other side of the country from where we lived, there was no question-- he had to take it. He already had a fine job, but this was pretty much the best opportunity for him anywhere in the entire world. There's no way he would have said no to it, and no way he's going to give up on it now in spite of the things in my below post.


I work in a tech field where jobs are plentiful, and I was already very bored with my (now previous) job, so I figured I'd just go with him. I had never been to the area where his new job is located, but everyone seemed to love it, so I figured it would be fine. I didn't think there was any reason to assume it'd be any better or worse than anywhere else.



However, it's not. This may quite possibly be the worst place I have ever been (maybe not counting that time I had to stop at a gas station in West Virginia), and that is saying something. It doesn't take a lot to make me happy, but there is just no way I could be happy here. I don't think the details are particularly relevant, but suffice to say I literally couldn't even have imagined a place I would hate as much as this one, and none of the things I hate are things that are mutable or things that I could ever see myself growing to like. For example, if you've lived most of your life in a major, liberal city with nice cool weather, taking the subway everywhere, picture how you'd feel in a sprawling suburban hellscape built on a swamp with nothing but strip malls and subdivisions as far as the eye can see. As a note, he hates it here too, but feels like he has no choice but to stay due to this job.


Anyway, thus ends the complaining part of my backstory. Here's the deal about our relationship: we are both pretty unconventional people who never really thought we'd end up getting married or ""settling down"". We are childfree, so kids aren't a factor now and never will be. When we realized our relationship was getting serious, we had a talk and agreed that if we ever ended up needing or wanting to live apart for work-related reasons, that would be fine, and we'd do everything we could to see each other as much as possible.


So in theory, I'd just nope the fuck out of here back to my home city or the previous place we lived. But the thing is, when we made that agreement, we were both thinking of the short-ish project-specific roles that often come up for his type of job-- that is to say, things that might take him to a different place for a few months, or maybe a year. That'd be one thing. But this is a rare permanent job, and he intends to stay in it indefinitely-- or for at least 5 years or so.


If this was a project job, I'd just go somewhere else and we'd visit each other and that would be fine-- we already did that once due to my job. Or if I didn't hate this place so incredibly much, I would stay and deal with it. But life is short, and I seriously can't imagine dealing with this place for half a decade.


ETA: Probably relevant to mention that my home city and the place where we previously lived are pretty much an entire day of travel away from here, and an expensive plane ticket. However, there is one city I like that is sort of in this region, about 4.5 hours' drive from here. It is possible that as a compromise, if I left I could go there instead of back home. I don't know if that's really any better, though, since 9 hours of driving isn't something that anyone is going to do every weekend.

What would you do?

---   
**tl;dr**: I moved far away for my fiance's job, and I hate it here so, so much. Should I take him up on our agreement that we'd both be fine with a LDR and just try to visit as much as possible, or is that unrealistic given that he may be here indefinitely?"

First time poster here. I am currently in school and managed to land an internship this semester. My work has some old IBM servers that they are no longer using and said I could have. I was wondering if there would be any worth in getting them and upgrading them to a [dual-core processor](http://www.amazon.com/Intel-Pentium-3-4Ghz-Fsb800Mhz-Lga775/dp/B000IEO964/ref=pd_rhf_schuc_s_cp_3_Z617?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=195R12TPZ91RE7EMEKEF). I doubt they could run Windows Server 2012 but I could at least have some linux systems running. 
Also, they come stock with 2GBs of RAM and a Pentium 4 processor.


Edit: I'm heeding your advice. I'm looking around on eBay and local shops to see if I can't find something better."

**New Today On Civcraft** 

* No Changes to Civcraft today

------

**New Today on Civtest**

* No Changes to Civtest for today

-----------------------
**Bugs And Development Focus**

* Hopefully we get a working version of the new alts list plugin in time for basic testing before the end of this week, I still don't totally understand what messed up with it in testing. 

* Yesterdays testing event brought up some issues that need to be addressed, the update system for Pearl's seems to be robust but saving may need some work, things seem to work fine after the fixes from the last couple of days though, please try pearling people on Civtest and working through the basics. 

* Did anyone notice anything about Bastion stacking during the event? block breaks should have damaged overlapping bastions, we do know Bastion worked ok which means we will be putting this new version online with the update. 

* There was a minor fix for Factorymod that prevents it from wiping the entire existing factory database. 

* We still need to get a working version of the new alts list to test out before putting that online for good, going to be a little interesting seeing how well that does work. 

* As Discussed yesterday ExpensiveBeacons is going for a lore based block cost before it actually goes online, although it will be running in its current state during the testing event, since the lore block will be only a minor change we can still test it during the event just fine, but we do need to work on deciding a cost before we go live with it on Civcraft, also a factory structure for it is an interesting challenge.

----------------

**Ongoing Subjects**


* [Bobpndrgn](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/29uyp2/wip_posterad_design_i_whipped_up_in_an_hour_or/) has put some work into a new advertising poster for Civcraft, its quite nice, although I am thinking that we may want to do a re-write of that sidebar text. He is also working on new subreddit css style, which I look forward to seeing. 

* WildWeazel did a great job of putting together [past advertising efforts](https://pay.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/27agfw/morning_changelog_20140604/chz2a2x) so that we can take a look at how to design a new campaign best. 

---------
**ttk2's thinking corner**

* Today's changelog is brief and afternoon because I spent all morning at my Uni's career fair event trying to land an internship. Microsoft was the only major tech player there (unless you could IBM) and talking to their recruiters was a whole different ball game than the others, the rest where like shooting fish in a barrel, good GPA, have an idea what you are talking about and they seemed happy. The Microsoft recruiter was the only one to ask some basic algorithms questions and hone in on Civcraft being the important part of my resume. I might have even managed a few companies not looking for Computer Engineers to consider me. Also piles of swag. 

* On an actual Civcraft note we are going to need some spot testing for various changes before going into production with 1.7.10 this weekend, please take the time to look at the development section and work on the things i talk about there, its essential that those things happen if we want a stable and smooth transition to 1.7.10.

2fxk3y,2,2014-09-09,"Ups, downs, and how? The story of my multisport journey[Wall of text]",Tullyswimmer,triathlon,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/2fxk3y/ups_downs_and_how_the_story_of_my_multisport/,"As I sit here sore after my latest ride, I thought I'd write something blog-esque (since I don't have one). If you don't want to read it all, jump to the ""Today"" section at the bottom.

**The Roots**

To start my story into the world of multisport, we have to turn the calendar back 8 years, to 2006. (Has it really been that long?) I was swimming in high school, after 6 or so years swimming club, specializing in distance/middle distance. My school didn't have a team, so I had to swim independent with a local one about 20 minutes away. I had a fantastic coach, and had the best season of my life. End of the year, I'm hitting 5:29 for a 500yd freestyle (1:06/100 for all you tri geeks. But then, this is yards, not meters. So 1:08? 1:10?). Great. 

Next year comes up, and suddenly I can't swim independent anywhere, no team has the spots, and my school AD screwed something up. It was also too late in the club season to join. So I was SOL. I resigned myself to ""there's always next year"" and decided to do indoor track. They made me a thrower, which pissed me off. I wanted to train for running, and a guy who's 5'10"" and 180 is not the best throwing material. Plus, our runners were all members of our state champion cross country team.


**The top of the slope**

On to next year. Senior year of high school, I've already picked out and applied to my dream college, and they're only a D3 school, so well within my swimming abilities. I decide to not pursue independent varsity swimming, since I had difficulty the previous year, and go straight for club. It's gonna be a time commitment, I played soccer in the fall and would play lacrosse in the spring. So a few weeks into the season we have our first meet. I get put in the 500, obviously, and dog it out in 6:30. What? What the hell happened in a year off? I figured I just needed some more practice and was out of shape. How wrong I was.

Now, I need to provide some context. The pool I'm swimming in is a YMCA pool, that's about 30 years old, and very poorly ventilated, with, as you might suspect, a high chlorine content. I noticed once during practice that I was having trouble breathing and my chest was tight. It scared the shit out of me, because I knew what that could mean, and had absolutely no explanation.

So we went to my allergist, and he did some tests. Turns out, I had asthma that was triggered by chlorine. I still do. I simply could not handle the amount of chlorine fumes I was inhaling every practice. So I had to quit. It wasn't worth risking my health and having to take 3 inhalers a practice. And, as fate would have it, it was, you guessed it, too late to swim varsity at another school. So another season of being a thrower on the indoor track team. Great.

Worst of all, my hopes of swimming in college were dashed. Nobody, even at D3, would take a distance/breaststroke specialist whose top times were in 10th grade and had seen them decline. I assumed I had just peaked.

**And down the slope we go**

It's now spring of 2009. I'm wrapping up my first year of school, and although I avoided the ""freshman 15"" by and large (I still hadn't started drinking, surprisingly), my physical activity is limited to walking to classes and playing roller hockey for a few hours once a week. I go on spring break with a group of students from my school who are doing some charity work, and meet this really cute girl who absolutely loves running (more on her later). She convinces me to start running a little bit, and join the running club at school. I've never been much of one for distance running, but whatever, she's single, I'm single, she's cute... You know.

Summer rolls around and I'm lifeguarding at a camp. I've been a lifeguard since I was 15, so it's just natural for me as a summer job. It was at this point that things started to look up for me and I got interested in multisport. I found that I was still an incredibly strong swimmer, and I was gaining running endurance though I still wasn't fast.

Back to school in the fall, and I'm back in running club with this girl. I had a good fall season, and even decent races during the winter, getting down to a 21:30 5k at one point, which still ranks as the fastest one I've done. Granted, it was a little less than 5k, 3 miles exactly, but you know, close enough.

By the time spring 2010 rolled around, I'm ready to buy my first decent bike, and start riding it regularly. At this point, I'm still unsure of my desire to do multisport, but I figure a good mountain bike is a good investment. That summer, I taught roller hockey at a summer camp, so I was still keeping myself in shape. During one of my days off, I had returned home to get a new pair of running shoes. While at my local store, I spotted a sign for a triathlon at the same lake I had worked at for the previous 6 summers. I finally decided that this would be the year.

**The rise of Multisport**

August 2010, I'm doing my first tri ever. It's a short olympic distance (1500m swim, 24 mi bike, ""10k"" that was 5.8 miles). I finished in 2:38. Which to this day is my oly PR. I loved it, and was instantly hooked. I could take advantage of my swimming experience, and I wasn't allergic to open water, just chlorine. I resolved that I'd do a half ironman the next year. There was one in my hometown that had been inagurated in 2010, so I figured why the hell not. As a bonus, I could evenly split the bike course into two 38 mile loops from my house, so training would be easy.

Unfortunately, over the fall and winter of 2010 and into 2011, two things happened: 1) I had a roommate who was 21 2) I turned 21. This was a problem, because as it turns out, I love beer. So I started drinking, not heavily, not a lot, but I started. At the same time, I started playing ice hockey and working out. 

I was still running a little bit, but not as much as when I had met this cute girl. We started dating in 2010. And, to my surprise, she, though a weak swimmer, had said that she wanted to do a half ironman with me in 2011. Ok, that's fine.

**I think I have a problem**

So in 2011, come spring, I got an internship that would last until august, near my house, so I lived at home, got a proper road bike, slapped some aeros and pedals on it, and started training for my half ironman. As a bonus, I was working construction, so even when I wasn't training, I was still physically active. I did a few sprints, and kept training for my half. As a bonus, this cute girl I had been seeing was now training too, though she was 2 hours away at school. I went up every weekend, and we did a few sprints, to get her feet wet.

The time came for a repeat of the olympic I had done the year before, my first tri. It was my girlfriend's first tri, too. My time wasn't that great, but that was partly due to a small wooden box that was being held by my sister. I was distracted.

I proposed to my girlfriend as soon as she crossed the finish line of her first olympic tri. She said yes. Sure, my time wasn't great, but at that point, I didn't care. 

My first half iron was scheduled to be that September. I had plans to visit some friends from school who lived in New Hampshire at the end of my summer, since I had about a month between the end of my internship and the start of school. Now, as many of you know, August in NH means one thing for triathletes. Timberman. I signed up four weeks before the race, as it had landed at the end of the week I planned on visiting, and I was prepared. What an experience. 

I've written up a race report on that, I think, but suffice it to say, it was an incredible weekend. From me volunteering my mountain bike to a guy who had his frame crack on the way up to do the sprint, to eating dinner with Scott Rigsby, to having Chrissie Wellington hang my finisher medal on my neck, it was an experience I'll never forget. 6:55. 

I finished Syracuse a month later, in 7:15ish, due mostly to the ridiculous bike course that has become infamous in the 70.3 circuit. That marked the end of the 2011 season.

**Over the edge**

Between the 2011 and 2012 tri season was another year of college. And a lot of drinking. I was a junior at this point, in year 3 of 5, and despite me saying it would never happen, I started drinking more during that winter. I was also curling (yes, the Scottish sport) 4 nights a week. And getting drinks after every time. 

As luck/fate would have it, I had an internship for the entire year on campus, and then another one immediately after nearby. So I went full ham and in 2012 got a proper tri bike, wetsuit, and such. Unfortunately, during that time, my weight had crept up into the clydesdale range. 

Never fear though, I found races with the ""C"" age group, and was racing almost every weekend during the summer of 2012. I podiumed at several, but never got my times back down to where they had been before. Granted, the summer of 2012 was brutally hot up here, and with distance variations in races, it's entirely possible that I was actually at my fastest. 

Unfortunately I tri'd too hard and ran out of money for 70.3 Muskoka at the end of 2012, so I pushed it back to 2013.

**The downfall**

Through the winter of 2012/2013, I continued curling, playing hockey, and of course, drinking. It was my last year of 5 of my program at college, I was graduating in may, I was getting married in June. The year absolutely flew by, and despite playing hockey for 3-4 days a week and working out 2 more, my weight crept up to 210 or so. No worries, I'd get it back down in the summer.

Summer of 2013, I've just got married, the new wife and I are all excited to train for Muskoka. I've just landed a contract job in the town I went to school in, which is a dream come true, almost, for me. The town had a great multisport community, I was a member of the tri club, and there was plenty of good biking and running roads to be had. 

I said it was a dream come true, almost. The almost was that it was a contract job, with shitty benefits, and the wife wasn't working, as she was working on a Master's degree in education. We didn't have a lot of money to put away, but we managed. We trained, but didn't do too many races.

Then, in July of 2013, my life totally changed. I got a job offer in New Hampshire that I would start 3 weeks before Muskoka. I couldn't back out, but worse yet, I couldn't train... I had to move 400+ miles away. The job had fantastic benefits, paid well, and would allow my wife to finish her master's without worrying about having to work full time at the same time. Not to mention, it was close to Timberman, and NH in general is a very active-lifestyle friendly state.

But like I said, we didn't train. It was stressful. We just didn't have time. I worked second shift, so it was either work out before work or not at all. And I've always been terrible about morning workouts.

Muskoka came and went. It was a great road trip, almost 600 miles, 11 hours of driving each way. I slogged through and finished in 7:58, and unfortunately my wife got pulled. We didn't expect much better. It sucked. Almost as much as the 3 bonus miles on that damn bike ride.

I had also developed an affinity for playing videogames in college, and I spent far too much time, and money, on them. I had no desire to work out. Videogames helped me de-stress, they were fun, and I could do it after I worked. So that became my life. Unfortunately.

Winter 2013 into this spring, the wife and I were house hunting. By this point, all thought of multisport training had gone out the window, and we were more stressed than ever before. But the videogames and beer didn't stop. Nor did the weight gain. The heaviest I got was 230. I hated it, but I could never bring myself to get out and do something.

We finally bought a house in April of this year. And then spent the next two months fixing it up, and it's still not done. We moved in in June, and then things started to settle down.

Unfortunately, my work schedule didn't change, and for the most part, neither did my lifestyle. Add to that that I work until midnight on Saturdays, and couldn't (still can't) take time off, tris were out of the question. 

**Today**

So why did I write all of this? Because I just (at least just before I started) got back from a 7.7 mile bike ride, that took me almost 40 minutes to complete. 3 miles now takes me about 30 minutes to run. I had to get off and push my bike up the hill a few times. I feel defeated, discouraged, and wondering ""how in the hell did I go from a 7:10 mile to a 9:50 mile and from 21 mph pace to 14 mph? 

The answer is simple. I got complacent. I didn't realize how much maintenance this lifestyle takes. I'm sure I can get it back. I have plans to do Timberman next year, and a 140.6 in 2016 (Not sure which yet, honestly... Tempted to do IMFL). 

But don't ever shortchange yourself. Even if it's just 20 minutes, get out and run a few times a week. Never underestimate how fast you can fall and how far you can fall. I realized that I got on and actually rode my road bike for the first time in almost TWO YEARS today. (Normally I train on my tri bike, but didn't feel like it today) I got my first new pair of running shoes (where the main intention was to run, not just because I needed new shoes) in almost a year and a half this past weekend. 

""I can skip today"" will turn into ""I can skip this week"" in the blink of an eye. A training drought of weeks can turn into a training drought of months just as quickly.

Even if you think it comes naturally, you have to realize it doesn't. I'm living proof of that. The season is winding down for me, but I can still cross country ski during the winter, and play hockey. I've still got a month or two of decent training weather left.

I can turn this around, and by this time next year, I'm sure I can turn my 6:55 half iron into a 6:15 half iron. I just have to actually do it.

Again, sorry for the wall of text, but I had to get it out.

2fxo1s,7,2014-09-09,Lost ENFP in need of advice.,throwawayENFP,ENFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFP/comments/2fxo1s/lost_enfp_in_need_of_advice/,"Hi all. So I'm going to start this by saying it will probably be a longer post, but I desperately need some unbiased advice from people like me. Throwaway for fairly obvious reasons.

There are so many things happening in my life that I am unprepared for. I am a junior at a university majoring in Computer Science. I have done very well in my life up until this point. I have had three jobs in my field, including two internships at very respectable companies, and I have an interview for a third with one of the ""Big 4"" software companies based in Seattle. Everything is going great, right?

Wrong. For months, I have been trying to figure out the next phase of my life. Up until about 4 or 5 months ago, I thought my plan would be to move with my girlfriend to Seattle upon graduation, but she fell out of love with me and left around May, which devastated me, as she and I were living together and I really did love her. Right around this time, the friends I hoped would help get me through it and talk to me completely abandoned me, and any new ones I made left once the summer ended. So I have been relatively alone for about 3 months now. I live alone now as well. I feel as if I will never love again, and that even if I get into a relationship, no matter what happens, I won't feel that ""spark"" that we as ENFPs seem to need in order to actually commit to someone. I am also 21, and I currently live in Iowa with no intentions of living in the midwest upon graduation, so I feel like even if I meet someone now, the relationship will be entirely frivolous and inevitably end as I graduate. Who would possibly move 1000 miles with me with only a year of dating? Not to mention, the University I go to doesn't really have the groups of people that interest me (I'm more of a liberal minded person. My friends would call me an idealistic hipster. Not many of those in a redneck Iowa engineering town).

In addition to the relationship ending, I have been having a personality crisis of sorts. While I enjoy coding as a hobby, I really don't want to make a career out of it, but I am far to in debt and into my classes for switching majors to be a feasible option. I don't want to work for a soulless corporation that only cares about turning a profit, I want to help others. I want to change the world and interact with people, not stare at a computer screen all day, even if it is good money. I see coding as a hobby, but it doesn't allow me to interact with people in the way that I want and I can't see myself doing it without becoming incredibly depressed over time. I know I should be happy with this, but I can't help feeling that I am making a terrible decision by making the ""safe"" decision to get my degree and go into programming.

In conclusion, I'm scared, guys. I feel alone, like nobody understands me. My family thinks my ideas to travel and forgo the 9 to 5 are absolutely insane, and I am usually labeled the outcast of my family, the immature, irrational one. I'm wondering what I can do to help improve my current situation, or if anyone else has ever gone through what I am going through and gotten out on the other side okay. If anyone has any advice, it would be most appreciated. I feel pretty pathetic for having to post this, and for having no one else to turn to.


TL;DR: Scared, alone, confused about my future, feeling hopeless. Help.

2fxt37,1,2014-09-09,Upset about my boyfriend,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2fxt37/upset_about_my_boyfriend/,"Just some background info; we are a gay couple, we've been together for about a year and a half, we met on a gay dating app and we have previously talked about using it while together, but I'll get into that later.

I'm just going to go through it chronologically, so here it goes.

So I love my boyfriend very much, still do, that's what makes it hurt. So everything was going fine, happy, unawares, content. His birthday is 2 days after mine and we hadn't been on a proper date in so long I wanted to do something special, like go to the movies, just the two of us. 

I finally confirm with him that we'll go on my birthday the day before. He leaves my house to go back to his and I go to my grandmother's gushing about how I'm going going to the movies with him and how I'm looking forward to it. Cut to 4 hours later and I get back home to receive a text saying ""....I can't come over tomorrow anymore. I got invited to a surprise party for *friend's name*!"". No sorry, no invitation for me to come (I've meet that friend only 3 times), I felt like crap. I then proceeded to hardly talk to him for the rest of the night and my birthday, I wasn't feeling particularly talkative to him.

So it's my birthday, I've only seen a few of my family members in the morning and I'm now home alone at my mums house for the rest of the night, cue Bridget Joneses diary music. I just felt horrible, it reminded me heavily of when my friends used to exclude me all the time. Then I get a rejection email for a summer vacation internship, oh I just felt great that night.

So its the day in between our birthdays and a dinner at my grandmother's was planned with my family, followed by a night out with another one of my boyfriends friends to gay bar. My boyfriend decides to come to my grandmother's because it would be easier to travel to the city if he drove. I branch up how crappy my night was and he explains how his friends birthday is the same as mine and how he doesn't see them often (he really doesn't). He said he's told me before, but I don't remember. At this point I was more upset about the way he cancelled anyway.

So we talk, I still feel a bit meh, but definitely feeling better. We go into the city and meet his (other) friend. I've met him before, he's nice, but I find out another person neither one of us have met is coming too. He seems fine though. So we head out and have a reasonably fun night. Now I don't go out often and it was only my second time to any day bar/club, I also get real nervous in crowds. The two other guys we're with smoke so they kept going to the smoking area to have one, after the first time my boyfriend joins in. He had never show while we've been together, but has done so before. I got a little annoyed, because I didn't go into the smoking area, hate it, so I was left alone somewhere while they puffed tobacco. My anxiety kicked in again it reminded me of being excluded and other unpleasant memories. I end up getting drunk and pass out in bed while those three are left on the couch back at the hotel room. 

The next day I feel horrible, physically and emotionally, and nothing really happens. My boyfriend stays at mine and I enjoyed his company. 

The next day after that I go to his house and, looking through his comments on here, and with his help, I find a comment where he mentions he ""...sometimes doubts we'll stay together"". Ugh, that kind of hurt. In pretty sure that comment was made already 4 or 5 months into the relationship, at least. I had been beaten into a very sensitive person so it kind of hit me hard. At this point my mind starts wondering if he's happy in our relationship, with me, and if he still thinks that. 

So, the next day, 2 days after his birthday and 4 days after mine, we meet in the city after I had to go to uni. While he was looking for a picture on his phone I notice a few of a baked person. My mind for crazy and I get nervous. I ask about them and he gets kind of nervous and doesn't want to talk about it, mainly because we were in public, but what I gathered was that they were of him, "" for comparison"" to his he used to look.

I asked to see the pictures and he says later. At his house I ask again a couple of times, and either he doesn't hear me or he misunderstands. Eventually we're sitting on his bed and he let's me. They are all of himself, but I notice a group of pics all from an app of someone else. My mind continues to go crazy. 

He takes the phone off me and uses it for an hour for something. When he finished I ask to look at them again and he flat out says no. Also, his photos are password protected by one that even I don't know, so that only adds to my suspicions. I get emotional, upset, so I decide to go on a walk. He decided to join, asking me if he can cause he knows something's up. I say yes and while we walk he keeps asking me if anything is wrong.

I finally open up, saying how I feel like crap about everything and how I was afraid of losing him. It was a good discussion and I felt better after his reassurances.

Then later I remember the pics, and because he wants me to be more open I ask him if he still talks to people and swaps pics. He says yes, and at that point my heart sinks, I don't know what to say, and I feel horrible to found out I was right. We had talked about it early in the relationship, he said he doesn't mind if I do it cause he does. I don't tell him to stop because I know it doesn't mean anything I didn't want him to fell like I'm telling him how to be, he has a thing about jealousy. Anyway, back to the new revelation, he says that he doesn't tell me because he thought it was better that way, how it doesn't mean anything, and that he thought I wanted to not know, and to just assume he still does it. Well I didn't know, didn't assume, for all this time I had no inkling he was doing it, and it hurt, I don't like when he basically keeps things from me, this especially. I say how I don't do it and how it does seem like a slight form of cheating. He straight away says he'll stop because he doesn't want to hurt me. I believe him, he honestly thought he was doing the best thing for me but it wasn't. We fall asleep and I feel the most love for him I have in ages, confident in our relationship.

I wake up in the middle of the night and I just have this urge, this absolute need to find out the truth. I get his phone and head out to the kitchen. I open the app up to see more chats than I was prepared for. He didn't say there was this many in the past couple of weeks, didn't say he was the one that mostly shows his pics first and pushed for them, didn't say that he told the people he was talking to that I knew and was fine with it. I feel kind of betrayed, I think of how many there were over the course of our relationship and I feel sick to my stomach. While I was alone at home on my birthday he was talking to a guy. It seems he's on it all the time. I now wonder if he's done it while I'm spooning him, while I'm sitting right next to him and it only makes me feel worse.

I typed this lying next to him in bed and I just don't know what to do. I am almost certain he will figure out this is about him if he sees this, but I'm not sure if I care. How do I confront him? Will he get angry I invaded his privacy? Will he want to stay with me? Because I want to stay with him, but this does hurt quite a lot. Please help. 

Tldr. Bunch of stuff, but basically I found out he's been chatting and sending nude pics to guys for possibly our entire relationship."
2fxtwi,1,2014-09-09,Start fapping? It's getting awkward.,sir-thinks-alot,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2fxtwi/start_fapping_its_getting_awkward/,"Hey,

i guess it's somewhat unusual to ask such a question in a place such as this...

**Background:**

* I lost my GF in Jan this year (basicly I was a retard, not putting in as much effort as I used to when we were still dating) - I guess that was a beginner's mistake considering it was my first serious relationship
* after hitting rock bottom and hiding under my shell I crawled out of it in the end of February
* I swore to work out, develop my character and be a better man in all areas of life and be on ""relationship hold"" for one year until I ""fixed myself""

Well so far that 'oath' has been succesful. I've worked out consequently for 3 days a week now and I got way more social. I've also stopped watching porn (I used to lie 1-2 hours in bed, always browsing for the next fix) and fapping (there was quite alot). 

So, everything looked alright. However, I've now started a short internship at a school now and one girl is giving me the looks. 

WAIT, what? Lol not what you're thinking right now. No student, but another intern. So it's all good.

Anyway, the signs are all there (high-pitched voice, body contact, arrangements to see me) and I'm returning the signals. However, that nofap is really giving me the creeps:

At this point of my challenge I have such a high sexual tension that I fear the moment it'd get serious I couldn't get past foreplay.

Do I have your permission, lol?"
2fxw2p,11,2014-09-09,5 years and counting,Lushkies,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2fxw2p/5_years_and_counting/,"Hello everybody, I am 19 and I smoke weed every day. 

The first time I smoked was the beginning of the 8th grade. I smoked on weekends with my friends. For the sake of time, I'll be quick with this part and just say that I no longer hangout that that group of people. Other drugs came into the picture and there was even this ""fight club"" and people were purposely heating up the lighter then putting it to their skin to make a brand of sorts. They almost burnt me with it once, but somehow I managed to avoid it. 

I spent my last school year at college. I hated it, I was miserable, unhappy, I didn't have many friends. I joined a fraternity and I loved everybody there but it was such a big distraction. I stopped going to class and stopped doing my homework and I failed out of school.

Today, I am at home. I am taking a gap year (i wanted to before I left for school but my mom didn't, now she reconsidered). I was planning on traveling in the spring, and taking calculus over this spring semester, however my heart really is not in it and I have missed classes already, as well as being behind on the homework. 

I always wonder what it would be like had I never smoked weed that day in the 8th grade. I try not to think too hard, because I've done what I've done and I can't change that now.

I'm not sure where to go from here in my life. I have an internship, 3 days a week, I work with computers and was planning on being a computer engineer, but the workload was too much for me and I feel like I just shut down and stopped being a human.

I don't even feel like im living. I feel like im here, in this world, with all of you, but im just floating by and not adding anything to society. You feel like you had all these dreams as a kid and nothing ever seems to work out like you want. 

I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't even know what I want from life anymore.

I've been stoned for so long. I've taken 1 or 2 month breaks on rare occasions, sometimes a couple days or even a week, but I'm always high. I feel like this is why my life is going downhill. I just don't know what to do with myself.

Has anyone had experiences like this? How did you get through it? 

I apologize in advance for any spelling or grammar errors :)"
2fythh,0,2014-09-09,Determinism: Why should I help friends in need?,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2fythh/determinism_why_should_i_help_friends_in_need/,"Here is a little background to the situation I've found myself in: I've studied areas of philosophy for a years because of genuine interest in it, specifically metaphysics and determinism. I would say that the majority of my friends are ""lost"" from a Christian perspective. They are typical college individuals. Some of them, the closest ones, frequently use psychedelics for a variety of reasons like depression and the pursuit of spiritual answers. My faith has been growing stronger within the past few years and I've also attained a brotherly love for these friends: I genuinely care about them. Instead of abruptly telling them that the way they live their life is wrong, I've tried to be an example of a truly happy life. I live in the South, so accordingly many people think that a lot of churches are very judgmental and all political, and they really are. That's why I choose not to shove it in their face that what they do is wrong. One of my friends uses more drugs than anyone I've ever witnessed, I believe it's because he thought that our true friends weren't there for him. Consequently he made two new friends, now my acquaintances, who have heavily influenced him into what he is now. As a result of the three of them frequently tripping, I've come to the position of a mentor to them in a way because the drugs they use makes them question the nature of reality, metaphysics, which is an area of my knowledge.

This is where the problem comes in. I was happy to offer them advice and share my knowledge with them in hopes of one day being able to mentor them spiritually and introduce Jesus into their lives(which is likely bound to happen any day now due to them seeking me out whenever they are on psychedelics). They would be easily influenced, the rest of my friends and I have diagnosed why they are the way they are. My friend is depressed for a variety of reasons and uses acid, shrooms, ecstasy, and heavy amounts of dmt to compensate for it. Acquaintance number one just loves getting high, really simple as that. Acquaintance number two is in search of spiritual answers, he wont find them in the manner that he is searching.  They have become a problem in our group of friends because the amount of drug use heavily impacts their personalities. Helping them is of major importance to me.

As of late, I began to think why should I help them. Am I in any position too? Some would say yes... but what experiences were completely out of their control to make them have the desires that they do today? What if they grew up in a bad household as a kid? There is a myriad of situations that could of happened to them in their lives that were out of their control that shaped them to be the way they are. For example, I had awkward situations happen to me as a kid that were out of my control and intern made me a socially awkward and shy kid. This influenced me to not have friends for a while. As a result of being completely alone, I began to study philosophy and religions to make me happier. That is why I am the way I am today.

The reason why I almost feel like it isn't my place to help is because I simply believe they were determined to be this way. Is God not in any way responsible for the way they are, or for the way any of us really are? If He is omnipotent, wouldn't he know before they were born how they would turn out? I don't see how any of us could have free will is their is a script to our lives that God is aware of.

Perhaps these situations are just way to far beyond our understanding. I sometimes believe that fundamental aspects of reality and omnipotence is so far beyond are comprehension. I sometimes think that when we try to find answers to such questions, we're no better than a dog trying to find the answer to a calculus problem.

Thank you for reading this and any insight you have to offer.

2fz1gf,5,2014-09-09,My quarter life crisis. Or how I came to be happily married to a successful businessman who doesn't like sex and sleeping with a 19 year old at 28.,chillitsreal,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2fz1gf/my_quarter_life_crisis_or_how_i_came_to_be/,"I've learned a lot from TwoX and I felt inspired to share my story. It's long, but it's mine.

I met Casey in college. He was tall, funny, and a musician. I fell hard. It was the first serious relationship for both of us and we promised to take it slow. Four months later, I took his virginity. I still remember the blank look on his face when I excitedly said “let's do that again later” right after our first time. Looking back, that should have been my first clue something was wrong. Instead, my inexperienced, self conscious 18 year old self was convinced that if he didn't like the sex, it was because I was doing something wrong. Everyone knows teenage boys are always horny and only in it for one thing, right?

I've never really been a girly girl. Minimal make up, jeans, and ponytails have always been more my style. I started making more of an effort to look sexy with my make up. I bought new clothes. I bought lingerie. We had sex once every 7-10 days in the beginning, despite seeing each other everyday. I tried to initiate sex everyday. He turned me down everyday. I finally reached the conclusion that if he wasn't getting it from me, he must be getting it somewhere else. I knew he watched porn and it never bothered me before, but I thought if he cut down on the porn, he would have more energy for his real life girlfriend. So I did what any reasonable, sex starved, teenage girl would do. I went through his computer one night while he was at class. Turned out he didn't watch porn nearly as much as I thought. I waged a war on it anyhow. It didn't help.

By the time our relationship was a year old, we were having sex once a month and I had almost entirely stopped trying to initiate. Our relationship was great in every other way. We loved spending time together and he was otherwise very affectionate. PDA was his specialty. My friends often told me how jealous they were after watching him hold me from behind and whisper in my ear while waiting in line for lunch. I loved it, but that was about as hot and heavy as it ever got. I brought it up in conversation sometimes, but he always claimed he just “wasn't that into sex.” I never really believed him.

After college, he moved away to take a good paying job in pharmaceuticals. I was still in school for another year. We had sex every time we saw each other...once a month. I graduated and we got engaged while living 300 miles apart. Eventually the timing was right for us to move in together and get married. It took me 5 days to convince him to have sex with me after the wedding. I was upset, but not surprised. After all, I knew long before I married him that he didn't like sex. At the time, my birth control basically killed my sex drive anyhow. Between that and a new house, new bills, and 2 very demanding jobs, I barely complained about the lack of sex.

Eventually I decided that if we weren't going to be having sex anyhow, I was going to quit taking birth control. The idea of all those hormones for such a long period of time was freaking me out and the side effects just weren't worth it for sex once every 2-3 months. The thing I failed to take into account was that without birth control, my sex drive would return in full force. Within 2 month, I was back to wanting...needing sex twice a day. I brought it up with Casey for the 200th time. By this time in our relationship we'd talked about it so many times we were both completely tired of the subject. One of the strongest parts of our relationship is our ability to communicate calmly, clearly, and honestly with each other about any topic. But it didn't seem to matter how many times we had the “sex talk,” we could never reach a resolution. Mostly because there's not much middle ground between sex twice a day and sex once every 3 months.

After 6 months of no birth control and sex only twice during that time, I could barely concentrate at all at work. I honestly had no idea lack of sex could have such a real effect on my life, but it truly did. All I could think about was sex. Sex with Casey (rough sex, to punish him for all these months without), sex with my boss (think I could convince him to do me on his desk?), sex with the guy in front of me in line at the coffee shop (wonder if his chest is as hairy as his arms? What about his happy trail?), sex with the guy in front of me in traffic (are guys in trucks always compensating? Maybe I should go for the guy in the Civic instead?). After spending the better part of a decade with a man who wasn't interested in sex, I had no shortage of sex toys and I didn't hesitate to use them but somehow I couldn't seem to satisfy the very primal urge to have a dick in me. Once again, in tears, I told Casey everything, even the part about how I was constantly imagining what it was like to have sex with other men. He felt bad. He promised to try harder. Nothing changed. A month later I finally convinced him to get checked out by a doctor. Everything was a-okay physically.

I've come a long way and I'm no longer a naive 18 year old who thinks she's just not sexy enough. I understand that everyone has a different sex drive and that's okay. I know Casey hasn't done anything wrong, this is just who he is and I knew that when I married him. He hasn't changed. He still wants just as much as sex now as he did before. I'm the one who has changed. I can no longer live with sex four times a year. I told him all of this. I also told him that I love him and am otherwise happy with our relationship. He feels the same way. We decided we don't want to split up over this. After a few weeks of serious conversation and careful consideration, we decided I needed a fuck buddy. Sex only. I couldn't believe it was happening, but I was excited.

Enter Brody. He was a 19 year old intern at work in my department. His internship would be ending in 2 weeks when college stated again. As a commuter, he'd drive right by my house everyday on his way to school, and as a student, his schedule would allow him the flexibility to come over during the day when my husband was at work. He thought I was joking when I first brought it up over text message. But he showed up at my house the next day at 11 am exactly as planned. The sex was slightly awkward, as the first time often is, and when he left an hour later without getting off and with his dick covered in blood (a long story for another day), I was sure I'd never see him again. Two days later we were talking about how to make it happen again.

The months following have been pretty amazing. On his last day at work things got a little heated in an empty conference room. The memory easily makes the top three best sexual experiences in my life. Since then, we've had sex in every position and explored kinks neither of us knew we had. I feel fulfilled sexually for the first time in years. I feel completely respected by both the men in my life. My relationship with Casey is better than ever as we've simply eliminated our biggest source of contention. I know this isn't sustainable long term, but for now, this is exactly what I needed."

Instead of going on an engineering internship like I had planned, I stayed home with my dad all summer, organized the funeral, cleaned the house, sorted through my mother's things, etc. I left a couple of her designer purses out because 1) they're decorative in their own right and 2) my own bedroom didn't have any space to store more of my mother's things. Same with heirloom clothes in my mother's closet.

I started my senior year. Difficult, as expected. I dropped down to a light load (but still on time to graduate). My dad mentions he's talking a lot with, and visiting, a woman [38F] who was a family friend of ours since several years back. We (as a family) even went to the wedding for her first husband. 

Because I still had some issues to work through re: my mum, I started seeing a therapist at the school clinic at the beginning of October. After my first appointment, I get a text from my dad saying he was getting married the next day to this woman he'd been seeing. 

I emailed him that I thought it was too fast (only four months) and asked him to reconsider, that I was worried about this woman gold-digging. He basically blew off my concerns and said I didn't know what I was talking about, that he had been lonely, and that this was making him happy.

Fast-forward to winter break. The woman's five-year-old son was sleeping in my bed while I was gone and my stuff had been pushed aside to make way for some of his toys. He slept somewhere else while I'm there but my room is still changed. 

After New Years, I started to resume some of the reorganization of my mother's things; my possessions felt very vulnerable with the sudden move-in and displacement, so I wanted to pack them away and store them elsewhere. This is when I realized that my dad had donated my mum's designer/heirloom purses (&gt;$4k total) and all of her nice dresses (&gt;$10k, possibly more because they came from overseas) without telling me.

I'll admit that I raged at him for throwing away what I thought were my mum's gifts to me (I'm an only child), and he spun the argument right around to talk about how I wasn't thinking of his feelings, or how looking at those belongings made him feel, but never answered the question of why he didn't store them elsewhere, or give them to family friends to hang onto (probably because he had estranged them, too, with the surprise marriage announcement). 

He also added that he didn't need my ""permission"" to do anything in his love life, that all of those purses were bought with his money anyway, that they were just things, and that it was me that was still hurting very badly (with the implication that I was incapable of rational thought because of my grief). Nevermind that, by this time, it wasn't so much my mum's death I was grieving over as much as the fact he had found himself a perfect replacement family in a new wife and young son.

Fast-forward to now, I graduated, I spent a summer abroad at another engineering internship, and I'm about to start a new job elsewhere,  but until I finalize all my moving crap I am staying at his house. I feel like a stranger in what was once my childhood home. My interaction with the wife is something akin to roommates who don't see any use in each other. I can't stay around the kid for long because he's loud, reckless, demanding, and he doesn't know how to treat my old family cat. I feel completely superfluous in this house, like there isn't any niche in the family dynamic for me to fit.

Furthermore, my dad and his wife decided to by a new house and move this month, too, which makes my out-of-state moving adventure completely secondary, and I was counting on some emotional support from my dad since, over the summer, he told me that we would get everything sorted out for my big move. 

I'm thinking about extracting myself entirely from my dad's life so I can just stop being disappointed with him, and/or provide some closure for myself re: my childhood and the parents I knew. I know he wouldn't understand it and would keep insisting I have a home with him (and a guest room), but I just don't feel like I can keep up that particular ruse. I was thinking about being ""conveniently"" busy for the winter holidays, and ending up never visiting, keeping contact to infrequent phone calls at the most. 

Is this wise? Is this too much? If so, then how do I get over the anger I have towards his carelessness, leading to the fact I am unable to trust him not to throw me aside?

--

**tl;dr**: My mother died, my dad remarried after 4 months, I feel like an outsider every time I am with his new family. Should I just stop visiting or is there something else I should do?"

I've always been a really bad worry wart from worrying my house was on fire when I would hear fire engines in elementary school, or checking my pets heartbeats to make sure they're breathing okay, to driving around the block when going somewhere to check and make sure I closed my door. 

Anyway, The last year and a half I've been dealing with Relationship focused OCD realllly bad. Some weeks are better than others but lately it's been real bad again and I really just need someone to give me some advice. It all started when I woke up one day and just decided I didn't love him anymore, I had SEVERE panic attacks over this thought for a good two months, barely able to function, googling and finding things like ""doubt means don't"" and ""break up with him and find someone better for you"". Thankfully, though, eventually I found information on ROCD and I was SO relieved. I felt myself getting better for a long time but lately I have a lot of background stress with finding an internship and of course that stress is manifesting itself into making myself believe I don't like my boyfriend again. I feel irritated with him, unattracted, like he's a stranger. It really breaks my heart. He's very loving and good about it despite not really understanding. He just doesn't know what to do anymore, and I don't really blame him. This is just really driving me nuts and I don't want to lose him. That means I really do love him though, i guess, right? I really really really don't want to lose him, and when I think about the times before this obsession reared it's ugly head all I can remember is the good times. 

I just would like some advice from people who also have dealt with this, it always helps feeling like you're not alone. "

I was (kind of still am..but it fades everyday) deeply in love with a guy for the past 2+ years. Everything started off great. He was nice, caring, and made me laugh. We enjoyed being active together and we were there for each other when we needed it.

We lived in the same town during grad school and it was so much fun. I had been treated like absolute garbage in the relationship I had before him...so everything he did amazed me. (This is important for later). 

Anyway, he had to take an internship about 45 min commute from the town we lived in. 

This is when it all started. He would complain about coming down to see me. He lived w/ his parents and I lived in a one bedroom apartment. (We could have sexy times at my place). BUT, I still had to make it ""even"" as he would say and come see him and sleep in a tiny twin bed w/o him and hangout w/ his religious Mom whom he is kind of obsessed w/ in this really weird way.

ANYWAY, we were still madly in love at this point. We both graduated. Celebrated together. Everything seemed perfect. I got a temporary 8 month job in a state. About a 5 hour drive away. I got a 2 bedroom and begged him to come be with me. It would be so much fun. Living and being w/ each other during the summer in a beautiful place. He lived at home and had no job prospects at the time. There was literally nothing holding him back from being with me. But..he will never change his life for me...this is something I had to learn, though.

I imagined applying to jobs together at night and dreaming of our future. But...he didn't come with. He stayed at home and got a really crappy temporary summer job and actually ended up not getting paid for it all (long story). 

So, as you can imagine, I was very hurt. I let him know too. And eventually, he said he ""should have."" (This is something I got used to).

SOOOOOO, we didn't apply to jobs together. I should have ended it then.

He applied to a couple..a couple. I applied to hundreds and only in the areas where we said we wanted to live (out West). I got one offer in Texas, but didn't take it because he said he didn't like that area. I changed my life for him...the entire outcome of my life. It was a pHd position. (I didn't tell him I didn't take it b/c of him, I didn't want him to feel bad)

He got one in an area where we both agreed ""sucked"". He took it. A 2-3 (Three but i think he lied) year commitment. He took it w/o even asking for a day to think about it and consult me. He just called and told me he took it. I should have ended it then, like any woman who respects herself. But I was blinded by love.

So, I ended up getting a job in an area we both would have loved. And he encouraged me to take it..saying long distance is okay for a little while. He said we would see each other as often as possible.

So, I left. 

He visited me once after I made it clear I wanted him to. I made plans to do things he would like everyday that he was here. 

Then I went to meet him for a wedding. I drove him and his friends around and we had some fun- but nothing really too special. We celebrated my birthday...he gave me a present, not wrapped- just handed it to me. Didn't take me out to dinner..didn't look up anything I would like to do. And then acted like I'm not grateful for anything. I should have ended it then.

ANYWAY, So...I tell him everything a week after that visit. and that I wasn't sure if I could do it b/c I was having doubts he actually loved me.

He claimed he loved me and he would prove it. I told him when I came to visit he would have his chance.

So, I visit.

He plans out NOTHING special to do. Nothing. I paid for our coffees and on the last day, I paid for our dinner. (After spending 600 to get there).

NOW...he says he is too broke to come see me this fall.

I end it again.

I missed him. I called 2 weeks later. He said he ""always loved** me"" but I ""need to move on""

Obviously, when someone tells you they don't love you anymore- it's painful.

I begged for him back. but got nothing. It was embarrassing.

So now, here I am. Two weeks later. That's all it took for me to see all of the obvious signs. And I'm here to tell all of you- YOU'RE WORTH IT AND YOU DESERVE BETTER.

I think of it this way: In this exact situation, what do I deserve? I deserve a guy who would bartend on the weekends just to have enough money to come see me. I deserve a guy who would pick up a couple of side jobs just to send me flowers. I deserve a guy who looks at jobs in my area and talks about how cool they are and how he can't wait to get one. I deserve a guy who is willing to change his life for me so that I can be a part of it. And so do all of you.

If someone is not willing to change their life for you AT ALL, they are not worth dating. If you have doubts of their love for you, THERE IS A REASON.

Don't let them trick you. Don't let them tell you everything you want to hear. ACTIONS speak louder than words.

I will look back on him as a lesson for the rest of my life. I will never continue a relationship when someone hurts me like he did, over and over again.

This has made me so much stronger. So, the next time you're feeling sad and lonely- remember..they don't deserve to be in your thoughts. They wrote you off. They expected you to change for them but wouldn't budge for you.

Don't regret not being with them. Look forward and respect yourself. Stand up for what you deserve.

I have always been too nice and let people walk all over me. I never see it until it's too late. But this time...I was really hurt. Really really really hurt. 

Just remember: It's okay to still love somebody- even if they don't love you back. It means your heart is big and you're a good person. I still love him- I always will. But I deserve to be loved back. And that means, I deserve to KNOW and to SEE how much I am loved- and so do you. You deserve to experience the feeling of being deeply loved. I'm excited to see what that's like! And it's okay to want them to call- but everyday that they don't call- remember how it makes you feel. No one should make you feel like that. It's time to start moving on. There are plenty of awesome people out there that are full of love and kindness. Weed out the selfish ones. They can have each other ;)

Sure, I still have ups and downs... but in the end, I'm glad it happened. Because my next love...is going to be out of this world.

**You're worth it**

**tl;dr**: Don't be upset you're not together anymore- it's for the best."

2g1asm,0,2014-09-10,Cut deficit for off-season training?,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2g1asm/cut_deficit_for_offseason_training/,"I put on about 25 pounds (up to 225lbs) right before off-season rugby training started up. Some muscle, some fat. Prior to putting on said weight I had just hit an all time high for weight lifting (23x225 bench, 8x405 back squat, 6x245 power clean) but then I was out of the country doing a stressful 12-hour/day desk job internship with no access to a weight room. Now I'm back and we're moving into 6x/week practices (3x weight room, 3x field training) and I've got to work on dropping the excess pounds of fat. I went from 18% body fat to 23% body fat over the last 6 months and I'd like to work back down at least to where I was.

I was thinking about doing a protein heavy diet with a roughly 500 calorie deficit. I was hoping that some of you out there had some advice or experience on in-season cuts. I want to drop the pounds quickly but still have enough energy to perform well at practices. 

What do you feel like should be my calorie deficit goal? What kind of macros do you think would best help me avoid fatigue? I can hold myself accountable to a specific diet and I should be working my body into the ground almost daily."
2g1be9,213,2014-09-10,I got the job!,TorchyBacon,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2g1be9/i_got_the_job/,"My dream for years has been to be a professional photographer. I didn't care if it was weddings, birthdays, nature, animals, whatever. I wanted to get paid to do what I truly love and I finally get the chance. During high school, when I really started to get in to photography, I'd ask around and see if anyone wanted senior pictures taken, or just pictures in general. I almost got an internship with a professional wedding photographer but, due to school, I wasn't able to accept. Even though I didn't get a chance to really work with him he still invited me to assist him with a wedding so I could get my foot in the door and see what it was like.

I graduated three years ago and due to work I haven't been able to go out nearly as much as I'd like. On Sunday my friend mentioned to me that I needed to start doing photography again and she told me that one of her coworkers was getting married and needed a photographer so she suggested me.

I met with them yesterday. I got the job.

I can't remember the last time I was this excited about something, they work for the people that own the venue they're using and they said, if things go well, they'd put in a good word for me and get me on the suggested photographers list. This is my dream come true, I don't care if I make a lot of money off of it I just want to get paid to take pretty pictures of people.

I don't really know what info would be helpful to know so I'll give the background just in case. And throwaway because all of my friends know each others accounts. 


**tl;dr**: I asked a friend out I was rejected. Now I'm getting mixed signals (I think?). What do. 


 I met Eren threw my friend Armin (who I was dating at the time). I was instantly attracted to him, so I kept my distance from him but was polite in any interactions I had with him. After 3 months of dating Armin and I broke up (it was mutual, we are still friends). 


 I don't really see much of that friend group (which is my gaming group) for about 8 months, they are off fighting titans and I'm working, doing an internship, and going back to school (yay!). I start going to gaming again when my schedule is becomes lighter and low and behold who joins the gaming group? Eren. I stop awkwardly avoiding him and start to get to know him. Eren and Armin move in together, I'm hanging out with both when ever I have free time. Oh shit, Eren is not only handsome, but awesome (have a bunch in common, funny, blah blah blah you are not here to hear me gush over this dude). 


 I'd like to think I'm good at hiding my feelings, (this becomes apparent later I'm not) I tell myself to absolutely not bring up my feelings to Eren. Armin is one of my best friends, I do not want any hard feelings or cause strife in any friendship not to mention they are roomates! My brain tells me this has bad juju written all over it. My heart says the opposite. 


 What do I do? I start dating other people (he also dated a girl for a month). Other people are a good distraction, I've been on and off of okcupid for a couple years. Nothing serious, I gave up on dating for a couple months. Was hanging out with Armin and he asks me if I'm interested in Eren. I don't really remember the conversation really but I avoided the question, saying something like ""I don't know what gave you that idea."" 


 After a couple days I feel kinda guilty that I wasn't honest with Armin (I mean I technically didn't lie, but he walked away with the assumption that I didn't). And I fess up, but I told him I was never going to make a move on him based on what I mentioned before. Besides during all of this I've never gotten any inkling that Eren wanted to be more then friends with me and I'm not one to go barking up the wrong tree. Armin basically said I was silly and he wanted his friends to be happy! 


 So fast forward to this summer, me and Eren have gotten into this habit on the weekends after the game group have crashed (either drunk or tired) we'd stay up (ungodly hours- 4am, 6am) looking up crap on the internet or video games or watching videos or whatever. It became the running joke with everyone ""how late did ya'll stay up this time?"" Armin finally had enough after 4th of July weekend. He began pestering me to just ask out Eren. 


 Well I mulled it over. I shoot him a message. Basically just asking him on a date, no harm no fowl is the answer is no.  He says he's interested but wants to think about it for a few days. That's cool. He messages me back 

 ""....I did have time to think it over. I'm well aware that you are just asking for one date. But, I don't think it would be the right thing to do now. I've got a hectic schedule with the move (oh yea, part of the gaming group decided to move in together. They shall now be called the Survey Corps) and road trip coming up. You're working on finding a job and whatnot. So maybe later this Fall we can talk about it again but no is my answer presently. I don't intend to sting it along, don't wait for a potential date between us before entertaining other options."" He also has several cross country job interviews going on at this time that he doesn't mention at this time. 


 Fair enough. I translate this to ""thanks but no thanks."" I personally think if there is enough interest you make time for something you really want. So I just write it off as a polite rejection. Bummed out but I hangout with Eren less over July (I forgot to mention I've started going out on dates again during the summer, nothing serious). You'd think this is where the story ends right? RIGHT?! 


 Well old habits die hard and after July ends I go back to hanging out with the Survey Corps regularly. Eren and I start doing our late night thing again. Oh that roadtrip Eren mentioned earlier? That's some of corps going to Gencon (I was suupper jealous!). They left a week early to drive there (we live in a southern state more then a few states away) to do some sightseeing and what not. 


 So something you must know about Eren is he HATES texting. I mean, he also strongly dislikes talking on the phone and emailing, he takes forever to get back to someone. Well he messaged me almost every single day. Sending me pictures, telling me about the con, and asking how things were at home. I'm wondering if hes a pod person at this point. Or a robot. Or an alien robot. 


 The Corps get home and Eren has to leave the next day for the interviews I mentioned. I've been to the place before and gave him ideas of stuff to do during his down time. Again pretty consistent messages, seriously wondering if his evil clone has replaced him.


 This is were I really am caught off guard. Game night is the night he comes back in. I'm pretty tipsy by the time Eren gets in (and so are some of the other guys) and we stay up late watching stuff, the other guys pass out. I'm surprised Eren wants to stay up after the flight but whatever. I'm pretty silly when tipsy, I was teasing him and doing stuff like pretending to attack him with my hair clip. I can't remember exactly what happened, but I remember he ended up playing with my hands and stroking my fingers (so close to hand holding but so far!).


 I think we went to sleep around 3 am, and the next day we grabbed breakfast together. Before I left he was showing me what he got at the con and more pictures. And he bought me a present. A custom dice bag. I was pretty surprised, I know he didn't get anybody else anything. Armin was shocked too, he didn't know that Eren had gotten me anything either. 


 Well that's it basically. I'm at the point were I'm confused. I figured the ball is in his court if he wants to pursue something more then friends. But hes driving me crazy! I feel like a crazy person. I can't stop thinking about him I don't want to seem like a stalker hounding him to go out with me. Also yes you read that right I'm 27 not 17. Sigh. Any insight, help, or opinions are welcome. Thanks for reading the wall of text, I wish I could give you that time back. 


Tldr: Eren is to busy slaying titans to get revenge for his mother, oblivious to Mikasa's feelings.

2g1lfg,3,2014-09-10,I (28/m) feel like I'm stuck with my girlfriend (24/f) of 6 years,trlintoyou,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2g1lfg/i_28m_feel_like_im_stuck_with_my_girlfriend_24f/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for over 6 years.  We've lived together for about 4 of those years.  Here's a brief history of our relationship just for some background:

* We both lived with our parents when we met.  I was in college, and she was just finishing high school.  Her parents were divorced and each remarried.  They sort of made her feel like it was the other parent's responsibility to care of her, and she felt guilty asking for anything from either of them.
* After a couple years of dating, we got an apartment together.  I was still in college, and she was working 2 part time jobs.  Things started great, but she had trouble keeping up with her half of the bills and housework.
* I graduated and things got easier financially as I got a job and started working.  She was still working part time.
* I encouraged her to go back to school.  She applied and got in, and really felt a sense of accomplishment.
* Going back to school was tough for her, as she wasn't a great student in high school.
* I told her to focus on school, and I would support us financially.  I was also left doing most of the household chores because she was too busy with school.
* We saved up enough money for a down payment, and bought a house.  All the financials are in my name, and I still pay all the bills except her car payment.
* She works part time, but still struggles to make her car payments on time.

I am a pretty independent person, and I feel like she has become more and more dependent on me over the years.  I had the hope that she will graduate and get a good paying job, and things will get better.  She is passing all of her classes, but hasn't looked for any internships and doesn't have a clear idea of what she wants to do after graduation.  She says she wants to work in an office.

I think I've let things go, and made excuses for her and tried to be strong and help her out for our entire relationship.  But I feel like that has all taken a toll on me over the years and I've sort of lost my own personality and identity.  Now my life constantly revolves around her.

She treats me well, and is appreciative of everything that I do for her, so it's not like she is a bad person.  I don't despise or resent her in any way, but at times I feel like I would be better off or happier on my own.  Or I daydream about being with someone who can contribute equally to the relationship, housework, and finances.

On the sexual side of things, the bedroom has been pretty stale.  She no longer initiates sex, and it feels a lot like another chore we have to do.  I've told her that the lack of sex makes me feel undesirable.  She says that it doesn't have anything to do with me.  She is so busy that sex is the last thing on her mind, or she doesn't feel sexy/confident in herself which makes it hard.  I feel like I have to beg for sex, and it makes me feel pathetic.  Again, I daydream about having a partner that wants me as much as I want them.

There are a lot of times when I feel like ending the relationship but I'm always left second guessing myself.  I try to convince myself that things will get better after she graduates.  I also feel guilty if I think about breaking up or asking her to move out.  I did say that I would aupport us so she could concentrate on school.  But when I look back, I was the one supporting us back when I was in school.  I just don't feel like things are fair in our relationship.

I haven't really talked to her much about these feelings.  I don't really know how to bring it up.  So I just bury the feeling and go on with my day, but it is starting to take a toll on me.  I don't know if I should just end things and not worry about what she has to do or where she end up, or if we can make things better, or if I should suggest we go to counseling.  Like I said, I just feel trapped.

**tl;dr**: My gf of 6 years is totally dependent on me, and I don't know what to do, and would feel guilty dumping her."
2g1wvb,5,2014-09-10,"(22F) Felt in love while working abroad and never told him (25M), I will probably never see him again",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2g1wvb/22f_felt_in_love_while_working_abroad_and_never/,"Hi Reddit,

This will be long, but I have to get it off  my chest.

Here’s my story: I (22F) went on an internship to a foreign country for a few months. In the building where I lived, my next door neighbor was this guy (25M). We lived in different rooms but were required to share the same bathroom. Initially, for the first month and half, I was really focused on other things and stressed out because of my job, all the bureaucracy that I had to go through to get my papers in order and trying to learn the local language a bit, so I didn’t really notice him. As far as I was concerned, he was just my (physically attractive) male neighbor, though I didn’t feel any particular attraction towards him – usually looks don’t make me attracted to someone. So I was acting like I act around most guys:  I would look down every time we would cross paths and try to avoid him as much as possible. I should probably mention that I am a virgin and I tend to be ridiculously nervous and awkward around the opposite sex. 

After about a month a half, I realized that he was introverted, didn’t like going out at night, didn’t ever bring girls to his room – all these being unusual for a guy his age. I all of the sudden I started really liking him. I also started noticing his quiet, calm and kind demeanor and I really started to develop an affection for him, besides of course the ‘’I really want you to fuck me right now” feeling. So I started timing me exiting my room and going to the bathroom with when he would come to his room after smoking….basically trying to bump into him as much as possible hoping for an opportunity to talk to him. I noticed that he was also timing things this way. This quickly became sort of a game. But, besides a hello, none of us would say anything more.  

One morning, as I was leaving to work, he was standing in front of the building smoking. I was out of  my mind nervous but decided to introduce myself anyway. It was a painful attempt as I was not able to look him in the eye for more that 2 seconds at a time. But anyway, I asked him for his name, what brings him to Berlin, where he’s from and he asked the same about me. He seemed to respond in a very kind and open manner to me. Then I abruptly ended the conversation saying that I have to go because otherwise I’ll be late for work – I can’t understand why I said that, it just flew out of my mouth, I guess it might be because I felt so awkward and didn’t want to make an even bigger fool of myself. We briefly spoke two more times after that, the last time being to say goodbye when I left Berlin. And it went something like this:
Him: Are you leaving?
Me: Yup.
*Slight pause, as if he didn’t know what to say* 
Him: Have a safe trip home.
Me: Thanks. 
*He hesitates a few more seconds in front of the building door and then enters*

On the train ride to the airport, I could barely hold back my tears. I had so many regrets: why didn’t I try harder to speak to him, why didn’t try to smile more, why wasn’t I straightforward with him, fuck why!?! Now I will never see him and be able to connect with him ever again. And then, as I was waiting for my connection flight, I had a thought: Why don’t I try to see if he’s on facebook (I usually don’t use fb at all, so this had not crossed my mind before)? I knew his first name because he told me, and I knew his last name because I had seen it written on his mailbox. So I end up finding him. Then I write him a message explaining how I know his name and how I was able to find him, apologizing for seeming like a stalker and a creep, and telling him that there were a few things left in my room because they could not fit in my luggage, and if he thinks he might be able to use any of them he could just walk in and take them.  This was my attempt to establish some sort of connection with him. He replied about 10 days later (because we weren’t fb friends, the message went in his ‘’Other’’ folder and he wasn’t notified about it, so that’s how I explain the delay).  His reply was very kind, thanking me for thinking of him and leaving those things for him, asking me if I  arrived safely and wishing me well. To this I replied that  everything’s good but I miss Berlin and German beer, and that I wish him well too. 

So now, I know he read my message, but he hasn’t replied. I am thinking that if he wanted to maintain a connection with me, he would have perhaps added me as a friend, or replied asking me questions to keep the conversation going.  

So does this mean that it was all in my head, that he was never attracted to me and that he was just being nice? Is he creeped out by the fact that I found him on facebook? Does he think I’m a stalker? What would you do if a girl did this to you? 

Not having a definite answer is kind of eating me alive. Help!

2g1znr,2,2014-09-10,wish I would have had the awareness to stay [Remorse],throwaway694034,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2g1znr/wish_i_would_have_had_the_awareness_to_stay/,"[Remorse]

I (24M) was dating a wonderful girl, lets call her Sara, (22F) who was absolutely head over heels for me. Not perfect but damn good. Gorgeous, in great shape, and crazy about me. She was positive she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. I could always see a future (house, vacations, growing old together, kids if we so chose etc.) with her but I wasn't ready yet for marriage, and I doubted our relationship because of that. I always thought when I met ""the One"" I'd know it, and never have a second thought.

Our relationship wasn't perfect but it was wonderful. My ex before her, lets call her Daphne, hurt me really badly and I've had a chip on my shoulder ever since. I think that left me with a deep fear of falling for anyone else so deeply again, and getting hurt like that again. Also, my respect for women decreased after all the hurt I went through with Daphne. ""I'll be sure to dump the next girl I date,"" I'd say to myself. Although I cared deeply about Sara and I loved her, I kept my distance to protect myself. Not just that but there were things that I did for Daphne that I never did for Sara. Not that she wasn't deserving, I just had this part of me still holding on to Daphne. And I don't know why, there was no chance of ever getting back together with Daphne. Maybe I hadn't accepted that in my heart yet. Sara was a phenomenal girl and amazing gf. I have never had anyone be so supporting, loving, generous, caring, and unconditional to me before. Looking back now I worry I fell for Sara for selfish reasons, because of all that she did for me and not for who she was. But don't get me wrong it wasn't like I couldn't stand her, I had the time of my life with Sara. I loved going and doing things with her, and I loved spending as much time with her as I could. We had all kinds of little cutesy things that we would do to each other, you know the stuff that makes strangers nauseous. She was my best friend, we could talk forever about anything under the sun. Our happiest of times were in each other's arms. I used to rub her feet, sometimes as a surprise and sometimes because she asked. She always loved that. It kills me that I ever had doubts about her.

Anyway, being the shit that I am I stop putting in effort into our relationship and get complacent. Our sex life was incredible but instead of making love to my gf I'd sneak off to masturbate. I couldn't tell you why, I wonder to this day. More than that I was going through the motions big time. Sara was always adamant about not letting that happen and for her it was always like we had just began dating yesterday. I was that way for a long time but it faded for me. So I'm bullshitting through this routine, and I'm not miserable but I'm not happy either. ""I don't know if this relationship is working for me anymore"" I'd tell myself. I'd express my doubts about our relationship to my coworkers (a very biased view I'm sure) who would fill my head with more doubt. I wasn't shit talking Sara or anything, I'd just talk about fights we'd have as a way to vent. A coworker told me once out of nowhere and unprovoked that we wouldn't be together forever, and that she could just tell. She said I could do better. No one had said that before, everyone else had thought we were meant to be. Then I find out other coworkers think she's too controlling and that they don't like her. Its true she could be controlling, but it wasn't that bad, or was it? More doubts. 

Now it gets tragic. We get a new intern at work. Smart, funny, and beautiful girl. I develop a huge crush on this new girl at work. I tell my coworker I have a crush on her, she asks the intern if she thinks I'm cute. The intern thinks so. The intern likes me. I'm upfront from the beginning that I have a gf with the intern, I'm no cheater. The intern doesn't do anything to undermine my gf or my relationship, but there's no denying we clicked and got on very well. My coworkers tell me I glow with this new girl, I don't act this way when I'm with my gf. They tell me I'm truly being my real self with her, and not my gf. (They'd seen me and my gf together on 2 occasions) They tell me the intern has the key to my heart and is my soulmate. I buy what their selling. 

Meanwhile things at home are falling apart. There's no fighting, no arguing, but all I can think about is the intern. I want to be with her, want to kiss her, want to blah blah. Naturally my relationship with Sara suffers, and Sara knows me better than anyone. She can see it. ""Nothings wrong I'm just tired"" I tell her. I tell her that for 2, 3, 4 days. She knows somethings up and eventually finds out I have a crush on this new girl. She's devastated, crushed, heartbroken. But she loves me, and wouldn't ever give up on me. Wouldn't ever throw us away. So she's determined to work through it. I have different plans. My mind is already made up but I lie and say I'll work on it. I look for reasons to leave Sara to be with the intern. I tell Sara my reasons for breaking up, meanwhile all I can think about is if I don't break up with her and stick to it I'll never get to be with the intern. In short, I left Sara for the intern. I had reasons sure, but they weren't enough. You could argue most of them were my fault anyhow. Nobody has ever hurt Sara that badly, no one probably ever will again. 

So I start dating the intern. Life is good. I'm happy, I'm confident in my decision, I finally feel free. I wanted this. How long does that last? 2 weeks. Then the strangest thing happens, I start missing Sara. Weird I think, but hey I cared about her and this type of thing is normal after a break up. ""This is normal after a break up"" my parents tell me. I'm not so sure but I soldier on. I've been dating this new girl a few months and she's great she really is but dammit I miss my ex, and that feeling isn't fading. It's getting stronger.

If I'm honest I never would have had it in me to fix everything that I now see I was doing wrong as long as I was with Sara. We would've failed eventually and it's all my fault. I took her for granted, I didn't value her. I wish like hell I knew then what I know now, I wish like hell I would've fought to make things with Sara work. Day in and day out I hope I can have a second chance with her someday, after all this hurt has faded away. Until then I try to make peace with the biggest mistake of my life. No matter what I hope you can forgive me one day Sara and I hope you find happiness, I'm so sorry babe. You deserve so much better."

2g29ay,7,2014-09-10,You left me,[deleted],TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/2g29ay/you_left_me/,"I met you here on reddit a year ago. You were a very sad girl that lost all hope in the world and came here as a last resort to find someone she could relate to. I was a lonely boy that wanted someone to fill the void in his life.

From the start we hit it off so well and it didn't take long before we considered eachother boyfriend and girlfriend. Despite the big distance, we loved eachother. I stayed up until 10AM so you wouldn't be bored at parties. I woke up at 5 AM so we could talk before you went to bed. I stood by you whenever life seemed to get you down and I was there to try to cheer you up.

But in the end, you couldn't handle the distance. You started to remove yourself from me up until 2 weeks ago when you told me that we can't be a couple anymore. I really struggled with it but after some time I became accustomed to it. Mostly because I didn't believe this would be the end of us and given time, we would end up together.

Until you told me 2 days ago that you met someone else. That you love him. That you love him more than me. He's taller, older and more mature than me, apparantly. You told me you meshed so well with him that you can finish eachother's sentences already.

I don't know how I feel about it. A part of me wants to be happy for you because you deserve some goodness in your life, but another part is destroying me from within because this means that we will never get to be the couple we imagined to be. Per your own words: ""Even if it ends with him, I will never be able to be with you because I tasted real love"". The love was always real from my part and I would have done everything to make you happy.

But it's true: I have led a very cushy life which puts me in a very bad position in a relationship where you want me to take care of you. Where you can look up to me.

You don't hear it every day but I wish my life would've been harder. That there was some way that I could more easily relate to the problems you face daily and that I could be of actual help to you.

But now all of that is obsolete. You found someone else and we will forever be friends at best. I have internship interviews lined up in your country closeby you but I don't think I will have the strength to work there knowing you're so closeby but not mine.

I loved and still am loving you incredibly much. I was serious when I said I considered you my soulmate. We had our hopes for the future until you became fed up with the distance and started telling yourself that you have to live in the present. And here we are: you're off with some guy you met a month ago and whom you already love more than me while I'm still sitting here, thinking about how much I will miss you.

All the things we would have done. All the kinky games we would have played. You will now do them with a guy 4 years older than you because you didn't want to wait for me to move there.

I wish I could let it go more easily. If only you weren't so stunningly beautiful and incredibly sweet. Without me doing the internship there's little chance I could move to your country within the next few years. But even if I did, I doubt there'd be a future for us.

I don't know how I will be able to cope with this. I miss you so much already and the thoughts of you with another guy just keep popping up in my head. You hurt me incredibly much by leaving me. Hurt I've never felt before.

And the worst part? We haven't even met yet."

Through our interactions we often arrive at very conflicting views on certain subjects but usually....

It seems that unless I am talking to a mainlander, I can't steer the subject of the conversation away from them talking about how mainlander tourists suck, and what a horrible place mainland is. Which kind of bothers me. I mean I used to be a mainlander.

The other thing is interaction with mainlanders, conversations that I had either lead to the topic of how much they hate Japan and how much I don't care about their hate and rather talk about something else, and result in them calling me a. traitor for a serving another country, b. Siding myself with ""the enemy""

I really wonder if there is a way to better interact with my fellow Chinese folks. What are your experiences when these more sensitive topics come up?"

Now I will never see him and be able to connect with him ever again. And then, as I was waiting for my connection flight, I had a thought: Why don’t I try to see if he’s on facebook (I usually don’t use fb at all, so this had not crossed my mind before)? I knew his first name because he told me, and I knew his last name because I had seen it written on his mailbox. So I end up finding him. Then I write him a message explaining how I know his name and how I was able to find him, apologizing for seeming like a stalker and a creep, and telling him that there were a few things left in my room because they could not fit in my luggage, and if he thinks he might be able to use any of them he could just walk in and take them.  This was my attempt to establish some sort of connection with him. He replied about 10 days later (because we weren’t fb friends, the message went in his ‘’Other’’ folder and he wasn’t notified about it, so that’s how I explain the delay).  His reply was very kind, thanking me for thinking of him and leaving those things for him, asking me if I  arrived safely and wishing me well. To this I replied that  everything’s good but I miss Berlin and German beer, and that I wish him well too. 

So now, I know he read my message, but he hasn’t replied. I am thinking that if he wanted to maintain a connection with me, he would have perhaps added me as a friend, or replied asking me questions to keep the conversation going.  

So does this mean that it was all in my head, that he was never attracted to me and that he was just being nice? Is he creeped out by the fact that I found him on facebook? Does he think I’m a stalker? What would you do if a girl did this to you?

**tl;dr**: Met a guy while working abroad, got to really like him (which happens very rarely to me; in fact this is the forth time in my life that I felt this much affection for a guy). And now I have so many regrets and am so worried about what he thinks of me...."
2g2u9c,24,2014-09-11,Sleeping in a museum is hard.,a_p3rson,TalesFromTheMuseum,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheMuseum/comments/2g2u9c/sleeping_in_a_museum_is_hard/,"A program at the museum that I work at involves the training of the new youth volunteers. This program spans about half of a summer, and usually has 30-odd members, plus about 10 older youths who have previously completed the program, an intern, and a program manager. It's a great program, really - I did it, and it teaches a lot.  
I was one of the aforementioned older youth at the time; however, because this was my third time through the program, I was generally regarded as the other intern, because of my experience (especially to the new program manager).

One of the first activities in the program is an orientation day. The students come to the museum, learn about being a volunteer, and end the day with a sleepover in the young child area of the museum! It's actually pretty awesome, and one of the more memorable parts of the program.

This sleepover is well-worked out before hand. Granted, the new program manager was a tad bit confused, but did a good job getting it all worked out - kudos to her! The night went well, and we feasted on the lambs, and sloths, and carp ^(pun), and eventually it was time for bed. 

We meander in to the young child area, and Program Manager gives the instructions for the students to separate by gender to each side of the room (that rule got broken one year - different story, though). Intern and the rest of the Older Youths oversee the process of the getting the students in their sleeping bags, and off to bed. 

As with many parts of the museum, the lights in this room are automated by time. In addition to the lights, the water pumps for the splash zone, and ancillary electrical outlets for exhibits are also controlled by a timer. We remind the kids that, come 11:00, the lights (and sounds and pumps and such) would be shutting off, and they would be in the dark.

11:00 draws near, and students start heading to their bunks. It's customary for the the staff (OYs, I, and PM) to stay up an additional while, ~~playing cards near the window~~ making sure students go to bed. This happens as per the usual.

11:30 comes around. The OYs and myself, along with I and PM head to our sleeping bags situated down the middle of the room (to prevent any mingling). We're just about to get into bed, when...

Lights. Literally, all the lights. Not just in the room, either, but in the building. From past experience, this usually is precursory to an emergency alarm (fire/evac). No alarm sounded though - unless you count the godforsaken woodpecker noise that came from one of the exhibits in the young child room.

After putting down all of my things I had grabbed (thinking an alarm was imminent), I look over at I and PM, near the doors to the room. Both of them have this blank ""wat"" expression. 

&gt;PM: This wasn't in the manual.  
&gt;I: Nope, it isn't. First time I've ever seen it happen.

After a little bit of bumbling, thinking, and general confusion, we refer to the list of contacts that we had for the evening. Besides us, only one other person was on the grounds right now, the Night Guard. We raise him on the radio.

&gt;PM: NG, did you turn on the lights by any chance?  
&gt;NG (sleepily): What lights?  
&gt;PM: The lights. In the whole building.  
&gt;NG: The lights aren...- in fact, on. I'll come up there real fast.

NG joins us up in the young child area. He's just as clueless as all of us. The students have now taken our spot by the window, as well as our cards.

Fortunately, NG has a much more expansive contact list. PM, I and myself try calling some of the numbers on the sheet that PM was given, of which, none of them worked. The fact that the sheet was sand-brown and appeared to be older than the dirt beneath us may have been relevant.

NG goes to his own contact list, and starts calling people. First up is his boss, who, apparently, doesn't like being woken up at midnight ^(how do you think we feel, bud). He tells us to call the Maintenance Manager, who lives close by. We call MM, and get his voicemail - he's in Hawaii for the week. Fortunately, he calls us back.

&gt;A: Hey MM, this is a_p3rson. All the lights just came on in the building, and NG nor anyone else here knows why.
&gt;MM: Wasn't me.
&gt;A: Do you know who it was?
&gt;MM: Nope.
&gt;A: Can you fix it?
&gt;MM: Call Assistance Maintenance Manager, he can do it, I'm busy.

NG calls AMM, and he doesn't know. He ends up conferencing in MM, PM, and I, so that we can all talk. Over the phone, MM gives NG step-by-step instructions of how to manually override the system so that we can sleep. Lights shut off, cheering is heard from the students, and all is well. We head back to bed, the time now being around 12:20.

12:30 hits. The water pumps, and that jackhammering woodpecker kick back on. The lights stay off. Some kids sleep through it, others wake up and moan in despair. NG runs down to the power panel to examine if there is a different issue, on the phone with MM. I along with one of my fellow OY's, examine the splash pad to see if we can turn it off from here (the other exhibits were a matter of just unplugging them). We manage to open the service panel for the splash pad, and find the proverbial big red valve. We forgo the option of the valve after reading the notice about not using it with the power on and the pumps activated. Bother.

Doesn't matter really, because they turn off after a few more minutes, and we all head to bed, figuring that we'll deal with it in the morning.

8:00AM hits, and lights/pumps/things begin turning back on, just like expected. We pack the students up, and send them down for breakfast, while we tidy up the young child area. NG comes up to check on us as we are leaving. Apparently, the only way to keep everything off was to push a few buttons every hour, on the hour, *through the night*. The lack of sleep in his eyes was evident.

We wrote a thank-you card to NG. He got back to us, and told us that he had learned that the power system's control software was updated the day of the orientation, and had not previously been tested. Why this was done was beyond anyone's guess.

**TL;DR:** title."
2g2wkh,3,2014-09-11,I'm looking to help with development for the OpenPilot Revo - Would the Blackout Mini H be a decent platform for this FC?,PrometheanVR,Multicopter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Multicopter/comments/2g2wkh/im_looking_to_help_with_development_for_the/,"I'm currently studying computer science, and I've been looking for a good project to get some development experience with. I've been flying smaller quads like the Hubsan and Nano QX for a while now, so when I stumbled across the OP Revolution FC, it seemed like a perfect deal. My thought process is that developing for the Revo will help strengthen my resume for internships this summer, as I'm applying for software positions at mostly aerospace companies. It will also allow me to work with UAV systems a lot more, so it seems like a win win situation.

So, I would like to build a quad that is fun to fly, but also one that will be compatible with the Revo for testing purposes. I've been thinking about the Blackout Mini H, but I'm not sure if the board will be compatible with the frame in terms of size requirements. I know the Revo will require a lot more components like GPS antennas and such that aren't normally mounted on the Mini H's. Anyone here have any advice or experience with this?"
2g2zbv,0,2014-09-11,To those saying birth control is the solution to the poverty epidemic.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2g2zbv/to_those_saying_birth_control_is_the_solution_to/,"&gt;This post was to be a comment to one of the comments on [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2fzmx3/male_birth_control_without_condoms_will_be_here/) thread. I decided against posting it there after typing it all out, then decided to post it here to get it off my chest. This is my first post on this subreddit so please apologize any mistakes. I wrote this in a blaze of emotion after reading all those comments saying that poverty is solved by birth control

I...I am the oldest son of a low income family with 5 fucking kids. I am about to graduate with a bachelor's in science. Moved out at 19, by 20 I was completely independent on my parents (they had little money to support me anyways so from age 16 it was as if I was independent.) I still have a lot of trouble keeping a job due to language challenges, motivation, (For some reason I always believe I don't deserve to succeed) the fact that the only jobs that would hire me are construction and other labor intensive positions,  and other factors such as job availability. I have never been the smartest, and most aspects of my education have been a struggle. I can't even take a fucking internship since I can't afford a job that does not pay (sadly most if not all paid internships are cities away). Even the prospect of having an actual career scares me shitless. I know I can do it, but I still stay up late unable to sleep, thinking ""do I deserve any of this?"" Shit like this is the real reason people in low income families stay that way. 

My brother just got into community college (can't really afford to go even into a state school) to learn architecture. As me he is very afraid of even trying to work for a better life. He is smart but we have been raised to feel inferior to others. Our parents always tried to guide us to a better life, but life has this way of beating aspirations out of you when you are below the poverty line. He was raised among people that have countless opportunities to thrive, but was never even offered one. He as me grew up thinking his future was menial labor until he dies. He saw how his friends and families descended into a pit of despair that only went down. How do you expect someone like him to simply ""succeed""

On the other hand, my youngest brother (the smartest of the 5), keeps getting bumped into advanced classes that I never had the opportunity of taking. I believe that if he has the same opportunities kids such as you and other ""non-low income families"" he will go to do great things. Thankfully he understands that if he doesn't apply himself he will face the same struggles his older brothers did. He is the truest statement that birth control is not the solution to poverty. Had my parent's been forced to take birth control to receive aid (that they desperately needed), my little brother would have never been able to take advantage of these opportunities, hell he wouldn't have even existed. My parent's suffering would be for nothing, and it would only keep perpetuating the vicious cycle. 

Don't you dare say that me and my brothers should not have existed just because my parents had to work harder to give us the same opportunities you were gifted. Yes some of us might appear lazy, have trouble with jobs, or even have difficulty handling 5 kids and 2 jobs, but haven't you stopped to think that the reason for this is that it is all we have? We grew up poor but damn it we were happy. Our parents never spoiled us, taught us the value of hard work, and at the same time showed us that this life won't be easy for people like us. My parents worked as hard as anybody else's, my brothers did too. The only difference is that we don't have it as easy as some. We have to face financial, social, personal, and even emotional challenges that many people have never even experienced. Even on the face of this, we never give up, and we never will. 

You might be right that unplanned pregnancies are a negative variable to people like us, but I can't help to think that if it were up to you, I would have never met my 4 brothers, and that to me is just unacceptable. Every single one of them has the right to exist, and if it wasn't for all the challenges they have to go through, they would have as good as life as anybody else. If anything, we should focus on removing those challenges rather than removing the individuals. 

tl;dr birth control won't fix poverty. Only by alleviating the challenges poverty imposes would the cycle be broken."
2g31gu,1,2014-09-11,"Me [23F] with my SO [26M] have been together for 3 years. I feel like I am ruining my relationship because I am mental, HELP.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2g31gu/me_23f_with_my_so_26m_have_been_together_for_3/,"Okay so I'll start with a little history of me and my SO ('Bairy') and events important to issues within our relationship.  I met him when I was 16.  At the time he was dating someone ('Psycho') and I began dating someone later too but I still really liked him and I knew he felt the same way.  We were both young and stupid (and I had some serious self-esteem issues) and so we became friends-with-benefits.  Even though we never dated back then I had always felt like there could've been something great between us, as cheesy as it sounds he felt like my soulmate.  


One night we were hanging out and Bairy's friends called asking if he could drop them off somewhere.  He agreed so we went together to go pick them up.  It turns out they were going to this 60+ year old guy's ('Creep') house because I guess he was known to supply kids with alcohol and let them party there.  Well Bairy's friends asked him to come in real quick and Bairy had only met the guy once before but he asked me if that was okay and I agreed so we went in.  Well as far as my 16-years of middle-class life had showed me adults were all very smart, nice people who you should always feel safe around. As I came to find out that night, I was very wrong.  When we first went in Creep went behind his bar and poured us all some shots.  I had never been around anyone outside of my dad's family who had even drank in front of me so that was a little weird for me but I had heard of other people's parents being cool with them drinking so I dismissed it.  Anywho, I ended up getting pretty drunk and then realized I had to be home in an hour.  Well Bairy asked Creep if he could show me a place where I could lay down to sober up until it was time for me to go home.  Bairy had also been drinking and after he said that he and his friends went outside to smoke some cigarettes.  It's all a bit blurry in detail but basically I remember him showing me a bed and I just kinda flopped down on it because I was so drunk I could barely control my walking.  I started to pass out almost right away and then I heard a 'click' and all of a sudden it registered with me that it was the sound of the bedroom door locking.  It is really hard for me to go into anymore detail but basically the Creep held me down and forced his way inside me.  All of a sudden I heard banging on the door and it was Bairy and his friend that had realized something was up.  Well Creep got up and walked out of the room super fast and Bairy ran in and asked me what happened and I told him and we high-tailed it out of there.  The police ended up being called and it turned out the guy had done that before to other minors that went there to party.  About 5 years after the initial arrest the guy was put in prison so I can only hope that he is now getting anally probed on the daily by fellow prisoners.  


Anywho, so I guess Bairy did and still feels really responsible for me being raped that night because he was the one that brought me there.  I however don't hold him responsible at all.  It would be one thing if he knowingly brought me somewhere unsafe but he didn't know any better, anyone could've done the same thing.  So after this, I sort of spiraled down for a bit but that isn't as relevant to me and my SO.


Fast forward a bit and life sort of got in the way and we lost contact.  Bairy ended up having a child with Psycho because she secretly stopped taking birth control without telling him because she wanted a child.  I should mention that Psycho is clinically diagnosed as being bipolar and also I think something else, but she is basically bat-shit crazy.  He is now no longer in contact with his daughter because Psycho won't let him see her.  


 During this time Bairy has his kid, I ended up meeting a guy 'Loser' shortly after I had turned 18.  I was still very much at a point in my life in which I had an extremely low self-esteem and pretty much grabbed at anyone who wanted to make friends.  That being said, Loser was appealing to me because he was older, lived on his own, always had alcohol/weed, and he also made me feel special because he would always mention how he generally didn't hang out with younger people but I was so mature/cool/etc.  Anywho, dumb 18-year-old me ate that shit up.  So to make a really long story short, basically 2 months into dating this guy we do shrooms and while we are tripping we come to the realization that we are like destined to be together or whatever.  Hours later we got married at the courthouse.  Just a week after our marriage the abuse began.  We were arguing about something while sitting in his car in a parking lot and I don't remember what he said but I just remember I didn't like it because I said I was leaving and I went to get out of the car and that's when he grabbed me by the hair as I was opening the door to yank me back in.  I instinctively swatted at his arm and when that happened he punched me in the side of the head.  I had never experienced anything even remotely like that in my life and was really just stunned by the incident so when he started to act all sad and upset and tell me that he had never done anything like that before and that he was so so sorry I guess I just believed him.  


As you can imagine it did not stop there but in fact got much much worse.  I was choked, punched, kicked, whipped, scratched, slapped, thrown, beaten with a stick, had objects thrown at me, threatened with a knife, my personal belongings destroyed, sexually assaulted, the list goes on.  I was also isolated from my friends and family.  He wouldn't allow me to say certain things or wear certain things if he didn't like them.  I could only go places when he was coming or when he gave me permission to use his vehicle since I didn't have my own at the time.  During this time, I was also not taking any birth control because he didn't want me to and I was dumb enough to go along with that.  So I ended up getting pregnant and then I was almost excited because I thought that certainly the abuse would stop if I was pregnant.  Well it didn't.  I can remember him pinning me down on the ground and shoving his knee into my stomach and me yelling to stop because he was going to hurt the baby and his response to that was to take his knee off my stomach and proceed to try to rip out my earrings all while screaming ""Well this isn't hurting the baby, is it?!"" over and over again.  I knew then that I had to leave. 


I don't remember how much longer it was after that but shortly after that my insurance was approved and I was able to go for my first prenatal visit at about 13 weeks gestation.  Basically found out that I was actually about to have a miscarriage if I didn't get an emergency surgery to sort of sew up my cervix.  After the surgery I would have to remain on bedrest for the duration of my pregnancy except to shower or use the bathroom.  So long story short, I realized this was the out I was searching for and ended up telling a hospital social worker about the abuse and when Loser left to go to sleep that night (my mom was staying with me at the hospital) I called him later and told him I wasn't coming home with him.  That was the end of that minus divorce/custody issues that ended with me having full custody of my son because of all the evidence amassed against him.  We have an active protective order against him as well but I still live in fear of him finding out where I live or where I frequent and trying to hurt my son or me.


Okay so when my son was about 3 months old (I was almost 21)  I was in touch with the prosecutor dealing with the rape case against Creep.  The prosecutor was having a hard time reaching Bairy for witness-related stuff and I volunteered to contact him via facebook.  I had no idea at the time if Bairy was with Psycho or anything because we hadn't talked in so long.  Well it ended up that they weren't together and we caught up on life and everything and then agreed to hang out.  I was so happy because as I said earlier, I had always felt like he was my soulmate.  


He was just as I had remembered.  So goofy, silly, intelligent, and quite honestly an ornery little prick (but in an endearing way if that makes any sense- ha!).  I felt like he was basically a guy version of me in so many ways and I couldn't have been happier to have rekindled our relationship.  From there it just grew and grew to where we are today.  In addition to that, he pretty much took on a fatherly role with my son from the beginning.   He has now completely taken over that role.  He is my son's 'Daddy' and he fills that role quite well. 


So our relationship...


I don't know where to begin.  I have been diagnosed with both PTSD and GAD (general anxiety disorder) and although disorders like anxiety and depression run in my family, I certainly feel like past experiences (in addition to always worrying about the safety and well being of my son) have turned me into a constantly anxious and stressed out person moreso than anything genetically speaking.  Even as I am writing this I stop every once and a while to bit at the skin at my fingers which are now all gross and raw from this nervous habit.  I was prescribed zoloft and also xanax for panic attacks but I stopped using either because zoloft took away all my feelings, even the semi-good ones to the point that I just felt nothing.  But now I just feel like I can never relax and truly live in the moment and just enjoy it.  I HATE it.  My SO is extremely goofy and basically not serious ever (which sometimes has caused issues because sometimes you NEED to be serious but whatever, not the issue here) and I hate that I can never just relax with him.  I feel like I rarely fully enjoy any moment with my SO or my son because there are about 20 other compartments in my head thinking and worrying about upcoming exams, papers/homework due, bills due, my son's wellbeing, Loser... I even worry about the fact that I am worrying and not relaxing.   This is especially apparent during any sexual encounter with my SO which I will get into now.  


My sexual experiences have been fucked since the beginning and I think that really just ruined sexual things for me.  My older sister (13/14 at the time) used to diddle me (8/9 at the time) when I was younger and would make me feel ashamed for it and use it as a weapon to threaten to tell our parents if I didn't do certain things like clean her room, etc.  I eventually was filled up with guilt and ended up telling my mom and of course she got in trouble and after that night I told my mom I think everyone just pretended like it never happened.  At the time I didn't feel like it had messed me up sexually but I wonder know if it has something to do with why sex is so uncomfortable for me now. 


In addition to that, since I first became sexually active I was very promiscuous.  I think I just craved that attention and it made me feel special or cared about or whatever when it was really just guys wanting to bust a nut.  I have also not been single for more than 6 months since I first started dating when I was like 15.  I continued my promiscuity up until I started dating the guy I dated before Loser.  I guess I kinda just realized how dumb it was and how not worth it it was if I ever wanted something actually truly long term.  


So anyway, during all of these sexual encounters I don't think I have ever really enjoyed myself.  I don't know how to explain it.  Like I would be horny and want to like makeout or something at first but then once everything started the feelings just stopped.  I didn't really enjoy it and it just became me doing what I know was expected of a girl to do when intimate with someone.  I would say 100% of the time excluding my SO, sex has never felt good.  It felt just like any other body part rubbing up against someone else's body part.  I would be sexual often with my partners even though I didn't feel like it because I knew that is what they would want.


Now with my SO is a bit different of a story.  He is the one and only person who has ever made me orgasm.  I really think it is because  I love him so much and he tries very hard to make me feel relaxed and not rushed and so I can actually orgasm pretty damn hard and multiple times when he stimulates my clitoris.  He can also make me have these sort of mini-orgasms (sorry IDK how to explain it) when we are actually having sex but the most pleasurable feelings are definintely when he is stimulating my clit.  


Anywho, that being said sex and sexual encounters with him are still... work for me.  Like it is stressful to me to have to think about how ""I need to clear my mind or I am not going to be able to cum and holy shit its going to take me like 45 minutes to cum and then he is going to have to cum which is going to take another 45 minutes and he won't until I do and shit I have homework to do or shit I have no homework I really just want to sleep""... I think you get the picture.  Every time we do anything, it takes me so long to just relax enough to orgasm and sometimes I can't even do that.  I hate that.  I don't know if it is my past sexual or relationship experiences or what that have made me like that but I really wish I could be more what I know he wants from me sexual.  He has an extremely high libido, higher than anyone I have ever met actually and I am at the opposite end of the spectrum naturally.  My libido is so low that I really could care less if I was sexual with him more than maybe like a couple times a year or something, as long as we could still be romantic and cuddle and whatnot.  I just don't feel like doing it.  I feel like I can't turn off my analytical side that is thinking about how long it is going to take, how messy it is going to get, how I could get off faster just masterbating, etc.  I want to be what he wants me to be sexually so please any suggestions on that would be great.  I have been working so hard on trying to shut down my mind and to be more open and relaxed but it is so hard.


Things are also kind of weird right now outside of our sexual relationship.  So for example, I made a girl friend in a class a couple years ago and have become sort-of friends with many of her friends.  When my SO first started attending school with me spring of last year, when I would run into these people and say hi or make some quick small talk, I guess they didn't acknowledge him at first.  I guess this not only hurt his feelings but also made him feel very suspicious of me because he said he thought they were doing that because they knew something he didn't or something like that.  Now to be honest I didn't even notice their lack of acknowledging my SO and I didn't realize that was an issue if you were stopping and talking to someone for like 15 seconds or something.  If I was staying to talk to someone longer I would introduce him.  I am introverted so I guess the times I have been in his situation and have not been acknowledged it hasn't bothered me.  After a while though these people know who he is and now when they see him they say hi to both of us.  But because of them not saying hi initially he doesn't feel comfortable around them.


Also, over the summer I did an internship sort of thing on my campus while my SO took summer classes.  Basically from the beginning I could tell my SO had some weird thing about a guy that was working at the intership with me.  To be honest I think he felt threatened because the guy is majoring in the same thing as me, has similar career/life goals, is not obese, and is actually half-way intelligent and not a complete dumbass like everyone else in my group and I actually ended up befriending him the most out of everyone in our group.  Any time I bring this guy up (we are still finishing up the summer project so we still have to communicate every so often) my SO acts just weird and does things like insults the guy or whatever.  I mean really I am an asshole and I make fun of the guy too because there are definitely some quirky things going on with this guy but still... it is like my SO does it in a mean way or doesn't want to talk about him so I feel like I can't ever talk about how my project is going or anything because of it.


Also on a side note... while this guy may be half-way intelligent and I guess okay looking, he is so incredibly.... BORING.  I don't know how to explain it but honestly he has got nothing on my SO and so it is honestly frustrating that my SO acts like he does about it.  Even if the guy had a more attractive personality or was physically more appealing, it is not a thought that would cross my mind to do anything to hurt my relationship with my SO or to hurt my own self-esteem that I have worked so hard over these years to build up.   


So to make all this trust stuff with my SO even worse, my SO snooped through my facebook which I had left up on my computer.  He saw 2 conversations on there that apparently upset him and at first I was completely blindsided by him being upset but now I have come to see where he is coming from.  


One of the conversations was from a guy I had almost but never ended up dating.  He is just this really nice guy that was always worried about me when I was with Loser and every so often would check in with my sister to see how I was doing with life and such.  Great guy but TOTALLY not someone I would be into now that I am not 17.  Anywho, the guy messaged me a while ago back when my SO and I took a bit of a break.  We messaged back and forth a bit just catching up but then I ended up getting back together with my SO and even though it was just friendly talking, I stopped because I figured my SO wouldn't want me to talk to someone I had previously had sexual relations with.  


The other message was from an old friend from elementary school.  Honestly a guy I have seen since I was like in 6th or 7th grade that randomly found my facebook and contacted me.  His parents used to be friends with mine and I used to be good friends with him.  If dating in 4th grade counts I think we 'dated' for a couple weeks but really... that doesn't count haha.  Anywho, again great guy but NOT someone I am slightly interested in at all.  Well the guy is asking me all sorts of questions about how my life is going and I had mentioned something about my future plans for graduate school and being nervous about getting in.  Back when I was in elementary school with him, I went to a fairly small school and I was considered like some genius child because I was a few grades ahead in math and fairly ahead in english classes.  So he made some comment about how 'well if you are the RakinsGotRadies I know, you'll definitely get in :)'  This comment in particular seemed to suggest to my SO that he was flirting with me or something I guess and he got very upset about that too.  Overall with the facebook messages, SO said he was most upset that I never told him about the messages.  The issue with all of this was that I never looked at this messages as threats to him and so I just didn't even see them as anything important to tell him I guess.  I wasn't trying to hide them, I just didn't mention them.  Once he said that I realized how it might be upsetting that I had talked to the first guy mentioned.  


I feel really bad because with all of this stuff lately I guess he feels like he is losing trust in me.  I don't know what to do to remedy the situation.  I am horrible at expressing how I feel with him.  When he is upset it is hard for me to not just shut down and get scared and clam up.  Even though I know he would never hurt me physically or anything it is still just like my brain reacts like it always did with Loser and I can't figure out how to rewire it to not do that.  I am not very good at expressing myself in a normal state of mind let alone when I am  stressed/upset that SO is upset about something.  I don't know how to make the situation better.  He told me he doesn't want me to tell him what I am going to do to make anything better and that he just wants me to do it.  I just don't know what else I can do except obviously be more open about talking to guys to him.  I also deleted my facebook because I just don't want to potentially have any more situations like that.  I only had it so family members could see pictures of my son anyway so really it isn't heartbreaking for me to delete my account.  It is hard for me to open up to him about things just in general if I know it is something that might stress him out or irritate him or something and I hate that I feel like that.  I feel like I have become this pathetic ball of anxiety and its really messing with everything.  


WOW that was so much and I rambled a lot.  I didn't realize how good that would feel to get so much of that out though. WHEW!  Thanks for letting me vent Reddit and PLEASE if you have any tips, ideas, suggestions, etc let me know because I really want this relationship to work.  My SO is a funny, intelligent, committed, caring guy and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize our relationship by just being a mental fucktard.


tl;dr I have weird sexual issues and anxiety issues and my SO has trust issues with me and I want to help our relationship before it gets beyond repair.

2g380b,9,2014-09-11,me [25f] with my boyfriend of 5 and a half years...wanna get married but my mom is not happy?! She's been causing me a lot of stress...,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2g380b/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_of_5_and_a_half/,"So I'm in my senior year of college. I've been in school for a while, and I actually met my boyfriend at community college (we were a part of the college newspaper and were involved in our high school newspapers senior year) but I've been in my university for a while. I have lupus, so my health issues definitely delayed in my studies along with my dad getting cancer and dying last year. Plus, I wanted to major in graphic design and the program at my university is extremely competitive. So I finally was able to get accepted in the program last year, and I am graduating next year.

My boyfriend graduated in 2012 (even though we are about the same age) but we have been together for 5 and a half years and we really do want to get married. My sister (who is 38) is totally encouraging me to do so. In fact, she has kinda been making subtle hints to my mom about bf and I, like when we ate at Cheesecake Factory last week. Last night, my mom confronted me asking if he and I are planning to get married and I kept denying it and she went off to this long tangent about how I shouldn't get married right away and rush because he is not making a lot of money (he is working full time as an online producer for a local news station), that I'm gonna make my life harder because we're not financially ready and I need to focus on career first...and she ALWAYS says that ""oh you think he will be sweet to you now, wait until you're married and he will show you a different side you've never seen before!"" But we've been together for 5 and a half years, whereas my parents married when they were 18 and 20 and had my sister but they separated for 5 years before remarrying. It just hurts me a lot the way she says stuff like that. She has a very dominant, demanding personality whereas I'm more timid. She does get jealous that I spend time with bf, especially now more than ever because my dad is gone. I also have a younger sister (22) living at home with us but she has autism so she's always gonna be my mom's baby. Idk...the way she said it made me bawling...and she's accusing bf of being insecure so that's why he's pushing it on me and that's totally not the case. I got extremely depressed and felt shitty all day in school.

I got home during the evening and she and my sister were about to leave for her music lessons, and she gives me this look and says ""You don't want to come to this home huh? You just want to get away from me huh?"" so I got really upset and texted my boyfriend and sister again about what happened. And I was on the phone with my friend for about an hour about it (also we were just mostly talking about our dogs, which made me feel better). My mom and sister came back and I walked our 2 year old dog while she took our 4 month old puppy to the backyard and things seemed normal. We dropped off the dogs at my older sister's house and ate at Macaroni Grill because she didn't feel like cooking.


Our conversation started going well so far, she told me that when I graduate I don't need to limit myself to graphic design jobs, that maybe I could work in a store as a merchandiser and I told her I was thinking of doing that. Then it turned sour because she did this long sermon and advice about how she does not want me to get married. That I'm so clingy to bf, how I always run to him everytime we argue, etc. and that men don't like how women advance in their career and how they will get jealous and controlling. But the bf is totally not like that, he always supports my goals and dreams and he's a total feminist and believes that both genders should pull their own weight. But my mom would fire back with ""oh you think he's this or that...wait till you get married"". She tries to give me advice and wisdom but I wish she realized that I am my own person too. And whenever she would say it's up to me in the end, it kinda feels like it's in a passive aggressive tone. But she said that she would totally lose her respect for him if he proposed to me because she feels we're not ready. Then there was a misunderstanding because she thought we were gonna get married right after I graduate. She said she wanted us to wait a couple of years (or so) and while she said all this advice was for my own good and not for her, she felt selfish because she wants to spend time with me as much as I can while I'm not married after I graduate so we can travel together and stuff. She says I need to focus on my single blessedness. But I thought people could focus on their career and relationship. I thought you could build your career as long as you have the one you love beside you.


She asks me to promise her to not get married a year or earlier after I graduate. We wanted to marry in 2016 but I guess it'll have to be in the winter or in 2017. But he and I never ever planned to get married next year (just maybe engaged) but that's why she was freaking out.


I love my mom don't get me wrong, but she has a really strong, dominating personality. She fights with me, my sister, and even my dad when he was still alive because she always needs to be right. And the way she talks, it's like she's sermonizing you for 3 hours, I'm not joking. I know she loves me, she has always been there for me. She busts her ass so we can have a decent life. I feel horrible for even feeling this way especially after she got us the dogs because we are absolutely in love with them (this is my first time having dogs) and I am forever grateful. I know she feels that she's trying to pass on good wisdom and advice and I know some of her advice has merit.


But sometimes I feel like it's to the point where I feel emotionally abused. I've always had very low self esteem (also because I've been bullied and never felt like I was beautiful or smart enough) I sometimes have suicidal thoughts, now more so because I've been depressed about what the lupus has done to me...I have to take prednisone which made me gain 30 pounds and my doctors have not been wanting me to taper because I have high protein in the kidney...I saw my nephrologist today and she is increasing my blood pressure medication (losartan) because my blood pressure was pretty high, and I told her how stressed out I am (also my love for salty junk food and caffeine doesn't help). Also, I've been getting seizures which keep me out of driving for 6 months and I feel so helpless and dependent on others to take me around, especially because my university is half an hour away and I feel horrible that all my design peers are getting internships and jobs and I'm not. Thankfully I have an appointment with my neurologist in December so hopefully she will let me drive once and for all (I had a seizure in January and June).


I know a big part of it is because she is lonely especially without my dad. And she says out of all of us daughters I am the one closest to her.

My sister says we should just marry because life is short, and in the end it's up to me. I already know with our chosen professions (news/journalism and design) we aren't gonna make a shitload of money anyway. We really love each other to death. I know I have to use my head as well as my heart which I have been. But sometimes I feel that she doesn't believe me because I am defensive. I have to be though if she's throwing all of this at me.


I am just at the end of my rope...sorry if this is too long...thanks for reading if you made it this far...

**TL;DR;** : My boyfriend and I want to get married about a year or so after I graduate college and my mom is not happy and has been going on and on about how I should wait. And we've just been clashing a lot lately."
2g3yce,10,2014-09-11,"We've been dating for 5 years, is this the end?",throwaway23409283049,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2g3yce/weve_been_dating_for_5_years_is_this_the_end/,"I chased you relentlessly 5 years ago. I got rejected numerous times before you finally told me ""I guess I've got nothing to learn"". I guess this should have been my first red flag. We've had our fights, but we always make up. I firmly believe that every relationship has these, whether people want to admit it or not. Some have been bigger than others, but we've always worked it out.

I'm your first boyfriend, I know this. I've been patient with you with everything. You had barely even kissed a guy before you met me. I was patient, we laughed with all the blunders we had in the bedroom, it was awesome. I'm your typical guy. I like sex, I like intimacy, I like all of that fun stuff. You don't. It's okay, I've moved on from that. I've accepted that while I'm with you, our sex life is going to be awful and when it does happen it will be the same as it always is, every single time. But that's okay, cause you're more than that to me.

I supported you when you were working part-time through school and had less than $40 to live off of each week. I've put gas in your car, bought your dinners, never asked for a dime for any of it because I love you. I was there when you decided to drop out of University cause it wasn't what you wanted. I was there when you got accepted to College, and I was there when you graduated from College and walked into a full time job (thanks to me).


You came from a not-so-good up bringing with your parents splitting up when you were younger. Your mom is an alcoholic and an attention lover who is never satisfied. I think she's brought home probably 40 guys in the 5 years we've been together. I do my best to accommodate her, I don't always approve, but that's not important. Your dad is a great guy, again, an alcoholic, but he just drinks a lot. He doesn't drown his sorrows away. Through all this you've got a fantastic head on your shoulders and have become a fantastic woman. I'm not sure how you did it, but you did. You were forced to grow up much faster than anyone else I've ever met.


My brother and you have always had a great relationship, and then his girlfriend of 1 year showed up. You've hated her since she walked through the door, but you can't come up with a reason why. She's been nothing but nice to you, I've seen her interact (or try) with you, I've seen her texts to you and her Facebook messages. Nothing has ever gone astray with her towards you. It's just you. The amount of stress you've caused my family is enormous, to the point where they often question if it's a good idea to bring you and her together along places, because you just stare her down. But again, I've stood up for you because I love you, and I don't want to lose you to this stupid reason.


The other night you were at it again, glaring her down and made a bullshit comment towards her that my brother fired back at you, and intern you pissed me off and I lost my cool on you. Because my dad overheard this and just wants everyone to get along, he decided to play Dr. Phil and asked that you and my brother hash it out and try to figure out what is going on with some explanations, like adults. I stayed out of this as did my Mom, because it is your problems to solve and I just can't wrap my head around it. I've been told women just hate other women for not valid reason, but from a guys point of view that's just bullshit.

This little chat happened on Sunday night. I asked if you were coming over Monday after you had left and you said you weren't sure that you were ready to yet. I said okay, no problem, don't worry about it take your time. No one is rushing you if you need space. You replied with ""Well that just made up my mind for me"", and that was the last I've heard from you. 

This is Day #4 of the silent treatment... two adults in a 5 year relationship, and I get a silent treatment. 


Apparently you've got a letter for me to read today, so we'll see where this ends up. Hopefully not the way my mind is telling me it is going to."

2g4edi,5,2014-09-11,"Me [25/F] with my ""boyfriend"" [42/M] 1 year, our worlds are vastly different.",firstworldthrowaway7,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2g4edi/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_42m_1_year_our_worlds/,"I met him at a cocktail party I went to for a Leadership Conference through my internship about one year ago. I was probably inappropriate in the way I chased him but he was this very sexy older man and I was 3 manhattans in.  

Nothing came of it and the next day I was mortified to find out who he was.  Turns out he was the underwriter of the whole program (anonymously) and that he was a very revered though private businessman.  I was embarrassed to find who I threw myself at the night before.

Two months later I literally run in to him turning the corner in a wine shop, knocking a cheap bottle of red out of my hands.  I am a bumbling mess, embarrassed and apologizing while trying to kick glass from the middle of the floor.  I die a little bit inside when he calls me by my first name knowing he remembers our last encounter.

He is very charming and handsome and the next thing I know i'm having the most amazing sex of my life in the suite at the Ritz-Carlton.  We wound up spending the whole night and the next day there.

This has evolved in to a sort of relationship.  Meaning the relationship seems to be strictly on his terms.

I should explain his situation.  He is 42 years old, divorced two years with two children 10 and 8 who are his world.  Last year he was faced with the option of turning his company public to help it go further than he felt he could take it or sell it outright . He chose the later so he can spend more time with his children.

He said he went through a huge depression after selling right before we met.  He says he is happy now partly because of me but I know it is because he is still very busy managing his interests. He only spends about 20 hours a week at his offices but he always seems to be working no matter what is is he is doing. Except for when he is spending time with his kids the he is no contact.

He has never gone in to why he and his ex-wife got divorced but they are still very close and actively raise their two children together.  They are amazing parents who both devote a great deal of time to their children. This is what I have gleaned from his friends because I have never met them.  The kids that is. I did meet the ex-wife one time by chance and she was very polite yet she scared the hell out of me.

Our relationship to date has consisted of seeing each other maybe three times a week in the evenings plus some weekends.  He has also taken me on two amazing vacations.

I know this sounds like a total sugar daddy situation but it is not.  I am genuinely infatuated with this man. He is smart, caring, genuine person and as I said he is devilishly good looking.  Every moment i am with I'm makes me feel like a better person.  I have grown in my job quickly due to his advice and my newfound confidence and I am just a nicer person to be around.  

My problem is this. This is how it will be for a long time. he has told me from the very beginning that he will never get married again.  He still has depression over his failed marriage. He has also told me from the beginning that he still loves his ex-wife and that she will always be in his life.  The last part I am totally fine with and understand.  The first part is just starting to sink in.

I should also mention that children are out of the picture. He has had a vasectomy and doesn't want any more kids.

Right now this relationship is exactly what I need in my life as I start my career out. I can devote all the time I need to my job and in my free time have a stress free time enjoying his company.  My fear is that when the marry/kids desire kicks up I will have wasted this time knowing it wasn't going anywhere.

I am also self conscience because I know I look like the biggest gold digger.  He is a very generous man and it has been the only thing we have really argued about.  I told him when he buys me these gifts it makes me look like a sugar baby and I need to know he doesn't think of it this way.  He has assured me he doesn't and has cooled it with the gifts though I still get lots of flowers.

He has told me the furthest he will go in our relationship is one of commitment but not marriage. He says that if we are ready for that step he will integrate me in to his life (meeting the ex wife, kids) and we will work on us as an actual couple.

Am I giving up a life I might never have to be with this man?  If we become a couple can I ever shake the impression of a gold digging second wife?  Am I blinded right now by his luxurious lifestyle of chauffeured cars and private jets?  




tl;dr  Young girlfriend of a very wealthy man.  Where do I go from here?"

From what I have read on this sub, Network+ covers the basics (with some useless info?) and CCNA is more comprehensive. I want to be as valuable to the company as possible. I plan on working for at least a few years in this industry until I can work in the VFX industry (I am currently in school for this but do not have the skill to intern or be hired). 

Should I focus on gaining my CCNA or my Network+ cert? Which will give me a higher quality of education, and value to my future company, given the amount of time I have? 

Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions! I'll read up on both study paths (focusing on N+ first) and move on to CCENT when I've developed a strong foundation. "

We are the some of the interns who created the Connected wheelchair project and we are here to answer questions. We hope we aren't too late to the party here, we just got clearance from Intel Media to answer some questions.

To expand a bit more on our project. We were hired through the Intel Collaborators Program to simply connect a Wheelchair to the Internet of Things. After talking for a few weeks with Wheelchair users and doing research we found that wheelchair users have three main problems:

1) Getting a wheelchair is a pain. Millions of dollars a year are wasted on Medicare fraud. (http://lmgtfy.com/?q=medicare+wheelchair+fraud) We wanted to create a device that validated those users who were using their chairs while exposing those who do not.

2) Wheelchair users live lives which are inherently dependent on others. When ""bad things"" (ie, falling out of a wheelchair, falling over their knees, ect..) they are reliant on others to help or face injury or death. We sought to use data from the Wheelchair users' lives to detect and notify caretakers and doctors of these instances.

3) Navigation for wheelchair users is inherently difficult. Even with ADA (http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/disability/ada.htm) regulations navigating for assisted mobility patients patients is drastically different than for pedestrians. Thus, we created an application which tracks user location in conjunction with accelerometer information to map geographical locations with positioning of the wheelchair. Moreover, the app gives users the opportunity to give feedback to the city/their environment by submitting ""good/bad accessibility"" way points (such as ratings on curb-cuts, elevators and so on). This feedback is shared with other assisted mobility patients to aid them in future navigation. End goal, we think it would be sweet to see this turned into a Google Maps layer. Imagine getting routed for wheelchair directions in conjunction with driving directions.

Let us know if you want more. And if you are in SF today, stop by the Moscone Center and check out our booth in the Internet of Things section of the Intel Developer Forum (IDF). Also we will be around for the next few days to answer questions.

Also check out Tim's charity Freedom Chairs (http://freedomchairs.org/). His work is the inspiration for this project. He has refurbished and given away over 80 wheelchairs for free.

Also check out our video which was in the BK (the Intel CEO's Keynote for IDF) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ1LO_O6r4k

We both interned over the summers.  We both eventually got jobs with the type of work that did in our internships.  Although it started as the same industry, we branched off into our respective jobs which are now very different.

Part of my own resentment started when I could literally never catch up to his salary (last year I got an industry standard 2.5% raise and he got a very large raise, like he usually does).  Even though we went to the same school, made the same grades and graduated at the same time.  This isn't a woman versus man thing, in my mind, so I'm not trying to argue that.  I'm just saying it hurts to work so hard and be relatively equal with someone and just watch them soar because they picked a better job track than you did (he really picked a great one and he is very good at it). 

His industry has a ton of money and they throw it around like crazy.  They have team building at golf courses, they have ice cream parties, they go to dinners, they meet up all over the world to have meetings and group projects.  My industry has no money and lots of work.

Right now he is on the team building type thing in the country he grew up in, but one I've been longing to go to my whole life.  Ordinarily, I would take a few days off work and meet him in whatever country he is in and we would have a mini vacation (if time/money allowed - this hasn't always worked out).  Not only am I 35 weeks pregnant and not allowed to fly, I have a TON of work to do before I go on maternity leave, so there was literally no way I could go.

He hasn't called or texted me a lot on this trip, just enough to know we can contact each other if I go into labor (or something else equally serious happens).  But when he does text or call, its just to tell me all the awesome things he is doing.  

On the other hand...I'm huge and hot.  I have done so much work this week at my job, and then go home and take care of the dog and the house and prepare for the baby and do all the shopping.  All while have a lot of cervical pressure and battling mosquitoes.  I sleep and then rinse repeat.  Its been such a busy time for me.  I even have to work this weekend after I pick him up from the airport because I have a huge project on Monday and Tuesday.  I am also expected to do as much work as I can for the 3 months I will be out (even though I have regular daily work to do!) and my boss won't pin down a temp worker for me, so its incredibly stressful.

Well he just called to tell me about going to beach and doing fun stuff and how he is about to go to a party (there is a 6 hour time difference).  And I am sitting at work, working my ass off, only to have to go home and work more.  I don't get trips and ice cream and golf and team building and parties.  My work gets rewarded with more work.  And I'm big and far enough along that its taking a big toll on me.

I don't expect him to not have fun or not enjoy his job or his life.  I am very happy for him.  But he just called and I was sort of quiet and short with him because its not really fun to be drowning in work while he tells me about a party he is going to in another country.  And he sensed I was being short with him and I could tell by the tone of his voice that he became indignant about it and we didn't end the phone call on good terms.  

I'm just so stressed and jealous.  I just had to get up and shut my office door because I'm full on crying right now.  I don't want to be bitter and jealous.  I want to be happy for him.  I just feel like a fat babymaker with a shitty job while he has all these prospects.  Next year, for the same team building program, he gets to go to Sweden and London.  Fuck.  

I don't know what I need.  I am just lonely and resentful.  I am big and tired and hot.  I am so busy that I feel like I'll never get all this work done.  

I sound ridiculous don't I?  Ugh.  I'm sorry.  Thank you for reading this."

2g56o0,2,2014-09-11,Planning Wayyy Ahead,Sn0wb4ll,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2g56o0/planning_wayyy_ahead/,"Hi PF,

My Background: I am currently a senior at a university in the states. I just accepted a full time offer following my summer internship with a financial services company. Even though I know some math and excel, I really have no real world experience with estimating what it evens costs me to eat or how much something like utilities will be. I'm hoping to get some feedback that will really help me understand how far my first salary will get me. 

The offer: $64,000 base salary, $5,000 sign-on bonus, target year-end bonus of $5,000. I'm not too familiar with the dental/health/etc benefits but 401k matching is 6% of total compensation.

The Dilemma: My university is veryyyy expensive (&gt;$50k per year) but I attend on a full ride scholarship. Consequently, a lot of the people I was considering living with next year from school seem to be eyeing places that are really not within reach of a student right out of college, even with these great figures and no student debt. Their parents will be subsidizing (if not flat out covering) rent and utilities costs. And I guess when you come from old money, an emergency fund or savings in general also just aren't really a priority yet.

It would be awesome if I were able to live with them, but I think it may be too big of a stretch. The apartment complex within two blocks of work in the financial district they have been eyeing is $1400 per month with a roommate not including any utilities. The city is relatively cheap to live in, and 6 blocks further, I have seen some apartments for as low as $750 month with a roommate. Obviously, it is a bit further away and the amenities are a much lower finish (non granite countertops, no floor-to-ceiling windows with skyline view, etc), but it would more than meet my needs.

The Question: My question is how you would recommend I budget my first year salary while still maxing out my 401k match, establishing an emergency fund, properly furnishing a place, and enjoying life when I'm not at the office. Using $700 - $1,400 as a range for monthly rent, what do you think is the sweetspot?

Additional Note: I also need to budget for purchasing a car as well as insurance, gas, etc. The whole point of living right next to work is to avoid commuting so I would only use it on weekends anyway. What's a monthly payment I should aim for that takes into account your suggested rent and estimated living expenses?

I appreciate the input!"
2g5dkm,2,2014-09-11,"Recently graduated college, got my first job, now what?",CollegeGradThrowaway,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2g5dkm/recently_graduated_college_got_my_first_job_now/,"As stated, I've recently graduated college without the need for student loans. This was made possible from a settlement agreement from being hit by a car when I was young. In addition to that, I have a sum of money in a government trust which will increase with interest until it can be accessed when I turn 30 (I am 23 now). The total sum is roughly 90k. 

My current job pays 67k with a 10% bonus at the end of the year, making my biweekly paycheck about 1.9k after taxes. In addition to that, the company I work for provides 401k matching dollar for dollar for the first 3% and .50 cent to the dollar for the next 2%. I do plan on taking advantage of this.

My living situation is a little fortunate, I have a special agreement for my rent in that my roommates parents own the property and they plan to flip the house once he is done with college. It comes to be $550, utilities and internet included in that price. However, the commute to my workplace from here can range anywhere from 30 mins to an hour and 15 mins depending on traffic, one way.

I am also in a long term relationship with my girlfriend, and we have been considering moving in together. We both work in the same city, and moving closer to there can be a bit pricey (1bdrm at 650sqft is about $1250 and 850+ is about $1450+). While this would be affordable  if we split the price, I also want to be stable if she loses employment since her contract expires in December. Is it too frugal to think these prices are steep given my income?

Personal goals I have are to travel while I'm still young and in my 20's, so I do want to invest enough money to enjoy these vacations. I have 4 weeks of PTO at my job, which gives me about 3 vacations a year and a week in case I get sick. To be completely honest, I grew up with a large family on a lower-middle class income, so I have never really left the state for vacations. I don't know what to expect when it comes to budgeting for them.

As for other expenses, I do not have any car payments, I have about 5k saved up during my internship in summer, and I do want pretty fast internet, as that will be critical in my quality of life. I plan on getting a gym membership, which my work will match 50% of gym costs. I also plan on putting roughly 5% of my income into an emergency fund as well.

So that's where I am currently. I think I am on track for my wants and needs, but like I said, I really have no experience in budgeting, aside from budgeting a sum of money to pay for college. I understand my situation is a lot more fortunate than others at my age, but I really do need advice on how to manage myself, so I can fully utilize my advantages. Is there anything else I should consider? "

I thought that by just having that class for this semester, I could manage doing other things and keep myself busy somehow.

Being 24 and just barely understanding what I want to do with my life, it's complicated and frustrating. I'm not special though, I'm sure others have it just as bad if not worse. And for the longest time I think I've had depression ever since I was a kid, I was bullied a lot all the way through 8th grade, and it's made me timid and very reserved around people. My escapism each day was coming home to watching Toonami and playing on my Playstation. Even now that's really what I catch myself doing on my days off from class, if not that I just curl up in bed and sleep/lay in bed and stare at my ceiling. Even they very major I worked so hard at, Studio Art hasn't really amounted to much, even then painting and drawing were my greatest joy and now I find myself procrastinating/finding things to keep my away from it. And I'm supposed to be applying myself to getting at least an AA in it for this Spring. 

All the while I feel stuck, I feel like everyone is moving on with their lives and I haven't gone forward because I was desperately hoping to find internships for what I wanted to do, or do digital paintings for money on say deviantart or something like that. I buried myself in art to hopefully be able to eat from it, but it's amounted to nothing either. I regret my first year in university, because I listened to my parents and I thought that by taking psychology they would be happy with me. I'm glad though that my art instructor at the time pulled me aside and asked ""why are you taking psych as your major? Look at what you've just done in this past month. I can see how happy this class makes you. If you change your major, I'll see what I can do about making a private study for that Illustration major."" I'm glad though, it made me so happy that I cried a bit. But I never did follow through with it, in just a semester I was already 20K in debt that I dropped out of that university and just bummed around at the local community college taking as many studio art classes as I could.

And for a while things were okay, but it became harder to be motivated in classes and what I wanted to learn wasn't available to me on campus so I found myself learning more at home, and all together I just stopped going to classes and got kicked out. I was looking for jobs but who wanted to hire a 20 year old with no prior work experience?

I made an appeal and went back in about I think maybe a year ago or so, this time taking a Figure drawing class and retaking my German I class again. I passed both classes and amazed myself. But I noticed that the only reason I passed both classes was because of the friends. One friend made sure I got to class on time, the other would give me rides home. That worked a lot actually, but I knew I couldn't have people pushing me all the time to go to class.

Eventually a lot of family problems were happening to the point where I was being emotionally abused by my mom, for not working and wasting time, not being feminine enough, being too scared to work and drive, possibly having some kind of mental illness. I didn't feel safe going back home to visit and it made me paranoid whenever my mom and dad spoke to each other in hushed whispers.

Just recently, about 2 weeks ago or so while taking out the garbage I thought to myself ""I'd be okay if I got hit by a car, or you know just disappeared. I'd finally put an end to a lot of things and just be at peace"". I remember feeling a bit sick to my stomach after that thought.


I still get depressed, and living with a grandmother who suffers from it doesn't help. I've isolated myself from people because of where I live now and lack of ability to drive. All I feel like all I have right now in the present is the room I sleep in with all my things, but I feel like it's also my prison.

I hate myself for everything and I wish I could disappear."

I have three ideas in mind (links included),cheanerman,Watches,https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/2g5vhb/recommendation_request_looking_to_buy_myself_a/,"Just finished up my summer internship and would like to get myself a small gift to remember it by as I go start my senior year of college. I've used my Casio f108wh (awesome watch..) for years now and would like something nicer. I want something relatively casual I can wear around campus but can be pulled off when dressed business casual. (Very casual type of  business casual - no tie/no top button/occasionally polos). 


Something things I'm looking for: Brown strap/Silver or Black casing/White or Black dial

A few I like so far from a glance:

1. Timex Intelligent Quartz Fly-Back Chronograph Watch - I like how simple this watch looks. I like the brown strap with silver case and either white or black dial. [Link 1](http://www.amazon.com/Timex-Intelligent-Quartz-Fly-Back-Chronograph/dp/B008P9V160/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410482483&amp;sr=8-15&amp;keywords=timex+fly+back) | [Link 2](http://www.amazon.com/Timex-Intelligent-QuartzTM-Fly-back-Chronograph/dp/B008HY8YNQ/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410482483&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=timex+fly+back)
2. Bulova Men's 96B128 Precisionist Claremont - I think this watch is really beautiful compared to other watches in my price range. The only part that discourages me from buying this one is visually it's a little dated for a 21 year old and would be difficult to wear in super casual situations.

3. Seiko Men's SNZH71 Seiko 5 Automatic - Everyone here seems to love the Seiko 5 and this one I like. I would prefer the dial not to be brown. Not a huge fan of the strap on this one as well (says its rubber?) A color way similar to the Timex's (brown leather strap/silver or black case/white or black dial) I would really like.

Anyways!

That's my pitch and I'm looking for other suggestions similar to these. Sub $200 would be great and links (prefer Amazon) would be perfect.

Thanks r/watches!

2g6dbf,1,2014-09-12,It's becoming a problem.,that_douche_bag,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2g6dbf/its_becoming_a_problem/,"I've had an on and off girlfriend for over 6 years now, every time we break up it's always sad and it always takes awhile to get over but this time feels so much more intense. This girl i'm talking about unfortunately suffers from bipolar disorder and even more unfortunate she was given a heavy dosage of anti depressants even though all it did was make her into a mindless drone. Eventually she stopped taking it, and it was great for awhile. She'd have her depressive bouts but she always got over it and I always liked to think that I was able to help her through it by sitting and watching t.v. with her.

A little tangent that's important to the story is that this girl never was one for titles, I really don't mind it doesn't bother me. However about four months into our relationship I had asked her to date me which she responded with crying and saying how this will ruin everything. Now me not wanting to see her sad and not wanting to lose her said it was fine, I didn't mind keeping status quo.

Fast forward four more months and she is having one of the worst depressive bouts I've ever seen. This was a girl who i'd end up sleeping with four or five days of the week, we'd see each other very often and I loved her deeply. Which is why it hurt me so much when she started to ask me to leave so she can be alone, I didn't understand all I wanted to do was help and she was pushing me away. Finally after about two and a half weeks of this I give her a text telling her I don't understand, that I loved her (we had not confessed our love to each other yet in this relationship) and all I want to do is help. She responded with, and this is summed up because I deleted the text in anger ""I'm sorry you're confused and I really do care about you, but I don't want you to take any of this personally."" Obviously I took it very personally and didn't respond to the text. 

After getting denied that first time I had always had that little voice in the back of my head telling me that I liked her much more then she liked me. That she is only staying with me out of some sort of duty or pity and that made me feel miserable. I didn't respond to that text and she didn't reach out to me after that, so I did what I always do when i'm hurt, I smoked a lot of weed and repressed my feelings completely.

Fast forward another four months we both go to the same college I see her passing by and I get a panic attack, this happens another time before I finally decide to tackle my problem head on so I setup a meeting. I ask her what happened and she explained to me that she wasn't in the right state of mind to tell me she loves me, she was upset at how personally I was taking everything and she was hurt that I never texted her back. She tells me if she was in the right state of mind she would have said it back, says all I had to do to keep the relationship going is give her that text back.

And she already has another boyfriend, i'm too late, all I needed to do was text her back, to get the girl that I love, and I fucked up beyond repair.

This kills me.

It's always been a joke that i'm a bit of an asshole, I laugh along with my friends when they say it but I never realized how much of one I was. I'm an asshole to everyone including myself and now I can't smoke anymore I feel too guilty when I smoke, I've been sober for over a week which is more sober then I've been for years. When I stopped smoking I lost my appetite and I started losing a lot of weight to the point where my friend got worried that i'm becoming anemic. I have a full time overnight shift at work and I've always had a messed up sleep schedule but now I straight up can't have a solid 6 hours of sleep. Right now i'm writing this after only sleeping for two hours and I have to be up at 10am so I can try and get an internship that's applicable to my major and I don't even know how i'm going to be able to function.

Please just tell me everything will be okay."

I would be commuting to all schools. Now I've heard SBU has one of the best CS programs in NY, as well as great recruitment. I don't have much experience programming, ~6 months self taught, so I want the most I can get out of a school, (learning + job opportunities). 

Travelling to SBU with LIRR (2hrs +) or by car is still an inconvenience and more costly (80 miles round trip per day).

With City College, I heard it has the best CS program out of CUNY, with some recruitment. Travel time sucks (1hr 30) but metrocard cost is negligible.

Queens College is the closest, ~15-20 minute bus ride. No recruitment and few internship opportunities.

With both CUNY's I would probable graduate sooner, since I have credits from a CUNY community college and if I wanted to, I probably wouldn't need to work at all with financial aid as well.

For those who are in the CS program at SBU, if you were in my position, what would you do? Are the opportunities at SBU worth it for me to go?"

I call it ""Drunk in Mackinac""",JerrysaurusRex,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/2g6k7a/nf_i_wrote_this_the_other_day_while_slightly/,"This is a post-break up story. Dated a girl in Berkeley for a while, was devastated for a while, and ended up in Michigan for an internships. Anyways, hope you enjoy it:

I’d just come out the other side of a relationship that abruptly ended
I was depressed, and disillusioned, and ultimately self-destructive.
I’d lost everything I believed in and loved. 
I was as utterly, completely alone as I’ve ever been.
So I began losing myself in alcohol and work.

I started working late at night around the Berkeley campus—school, RAZA, anything to keep me busy and going home to be alone. I’d start walking back home late every evening, and come back close to 2 AM, sometimes later. Walking and thinking and chewing over what had gone wrong with my life.
One night around 3AM, on Dana and Channing, I got lightheaded and collapsed. Maybe due to the lack of sleep, constant drinking and horrible eating patterns. I woke up around 6AM completely confused about what had happened. I went on several days having health problems, but I’d simply ignore them and drink myself to fall asleep at night at times. I was content with whatever was going to happen, live or die.
It took a couple months to get over the daily self-destruction that resulted after the late August break up. 
But two things came out of this incident.
First: I would no longer give her the power to have such control over me. None whatsoever. She had a tendency to send ambiguous texts at times that would just make me relapse and fall back into memories of her and ultimately further into my depression. Her voice was my favorite song to sing along to, but it only brought heartache now. 
Second: I was determined to get well and start enjoying life again.
No longer would I be a social recluse and push people away I told myself. Maybe then I wouldn’t have to fake a smile anymore and genuinely be happy.
But my idea of moving on was severely and unfortunately misguided and stupid. I would eventually fall into the pits of so many young Latino males before me. Something I always promised myself I’d never turn to. One night stands, using cheap meaningless sex to attempt to forget that intimacy of summer’s past. Women lied to and used. My new attempts to move on only made me miss her that much more and make me feel even worse about myself.
 At this point I just wanted Fall Semester to be over. I wanted spring to come to turn a new leaf. I wanted to go home and be with people I knew loved me. I no longer wanted to put up a front, no longer wanted to pretend to be that funny happy guy people have come to know and expect, I just wanted to be void of all responsibilities so I can just finally have the time I needed to get over it. But for now I just continued with the façade of my routine.
 Winter came and was just what I needed. Hibernating in the harbored emotions and thoughts without any distractions. And finally I realized that our relationship was doomed from the start. We thrust ourselves into that relationship on quick initial impressions. Met her April 22, and a week later was officially my girlfriend. No time to really get to know each other, but over the course of the summer became one of my closest friends. But that’s all she should have been. Girls like her; they are like those beautiful songbirds of the Midwest. Meant to be free, their songs not as beautiful when resonating in a steel cage.
I would have appreciated a warning label…you dream about what it’s like to kiss a girl like that in the most beautiful places, but when you do and its all gone and return to those places you can’t help but feel their lips pressed up against yours all over again.
Its true that I could have shown her more appreciation, but isn’t that the way it always goes? You never realize what you have or how you’ve taken things for granted until its all gone. And by then its always too late to go back, too late to make up for the mistakes, too late to apologize for the wrongdoing.
 But at that point I stopped thinking about what I did wrong, and started thinking about what I learned. I don’t hold any hatred or grudges against her. She gave me hope. She showed me a side of love I’ve never experienced and doubt would ever duplicate. And love really is a wonderful thing. Its something that needs to be cherished and continuously worked on. Just because it was there before, that does not ensure it will always be. Love is the flower in the garden, it needs constant attention to ensure it will grow and not wither away.
 Spring semester came and went. No longer was I anchored by depression and angst. I was happy again. Able to meet new people, enjoy myself and be able to look her in the face without feeling a rushing sense of fear and pain shoot through the very core of my being. Spring semester showed me that time will really heal all wounds. And even with the wounds stitched up tightly, scars will remain. But it is no longer a painful reminder of love lost, but a badge commemorating a once marvelous time.
 And it’s amazing what a difference a year makes. Someone who meant so much at one time reduced to a stranger…and that’s really what we’ve become, strangers with memories.
But it’s also amazing what a change in scenery can do. Wandering into the unknown. Taking risks. That’s what life’s about. My journeys have taken me to the green lands of the pacific-northwest, the arid landscapes of the south, and even here…to the lost woods of the tip of the mit Michigan. Her once tormenting voice fades into depths of my head, like thunder off into the cold, dark distance. The memories begin to fade like the sunlight into the depths of these royal blue lakes. 
And on this quest to lose myself, I have found what I was looking for, without ever being quite sure what it was. 
I have found a new song, a new song to sing along."

""Ah, that man. He's a good Indian, he is. His generals are terrible war-mongers but he has found time to stay neutral. Let me read this."" Ravi Shankar said to himself and began reading. After the completion of the letter, he thought it wise to reply.

**From the desk of Ravi Shankar in an undisclosed location to prevent fan mail**

Dear Mr Prime Minister of the Republic of India,

Thank you for your letter. For months now, India and the SAR have been at loggerheads over India's annexation by the former Republic Singapore. In this letter we would like to clear up a few things and offer you a deal. 

Firstly, we would like to remind Mr Deshpande and his government that the annexation of India and many other regrettable decisions that the government of Singapore made were made by the now-hated Imperial Ruler Lee. At the time of the Indian annexation, Hooge Wang was merely a deputy who had no say, Aato Mad was a Minister of Parliament, and I wasn't even in politics! We sincerely apologise on behalf of Mr Lee, but we reiterate that we should not be blamed for something a former PM did.

We will now like to offer a deal. We will pay a total of $25 billion over 5 years (from our foreign aid budget). We will return you all the thorium we have (estimated around 82.84% of the thorium we took- the rest has been used in energy programs and programs around the world). However, we need a fair deal from your side too.

It is obvious, frankly obvious, that India wants money to build more ships to attack us- a catastrophic mistake that the US made with the Mujaheddin. Because of this, before we send any money, we will require the nations of the New World Initiative, with a 1 year cancel time and a $20 billion fine to be paid to the other party if there is cancellation. This will prevent either nation from taking issue with each other and will considerably tone down tensions.

Now this next part of this letter is going to be considerably more personal. I am an Indian, born in India in 1984 but I moved to Singapore in 2006, at the age of 22. As such I am sufficiently qualified to request India to do the following. Firstly, I would like to request that Mr Deshpande spend time and effort into finding the corrupt. You may think you have rooted them out, but they are leeches- they hang on well. I would also wish India, as my mother nation, to succeed by launching an anti-crime drive and a drive to clean up the nation. One of the main reasons of Singapore's success was it bothering to keep the country clean, and we recommend India try it too.

The SAR are not warmongers, Mr Deshpande. We have apologised about India some time ago. We are forbidden from making a first strike, and we are only allowed (by our own constitution) to defend ourselves or an ally. We will keep to that. However, due to the violation of prior conventions that allowed the Suez Canal to stay open to all even during war, the SAR regrets to inform India that any of its ships will not be welcome in the Malacca Straits and will be halted and turned back. [This diagram](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/images/2013.04.04/mapcrude.png) shows exactly how important we are to India. All land routes will be closed for our own safety. We maintain that if the NAP we have proposed is signed, we will pay $25 billion and we will open all ports to India. We have sincerely apologized multiple times, but we do not approve of warmongering. 

Yours sincerely,

Ravi Shankar, Co-Ruler of the South Asian Republic"

2g7dwf,1,2014-09-12,I was looking through old files and found a fanfic I wrote of Theodore Boone,phexion,FanFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/2g7dwf/i_was_looking_through_old_files_and_found_a/,"Theodore Boone is a kid's legal thriller, really good book.


While said crowd was swarming around Theo, Hardie, Woody and April managed to walk to him and Hardie said, “You saved my farm! I wouldn't know what to do without you!”, April then said, “You did it!”, and went up to Theo and (in the frenzy of the moment) reluctantly kissed him. This, mind you, happened in front of the students of his school and the said students denied Theo's friend vs. girlfriend explanation. The crowd cheered even more than the screams of victory after the decision. 

“Oh god. What have I done.”

They both ran to the door and very awkwardly, they used the same exit. This was the only time Theo didn't want to go to school.

Begin the next day. Mrs. Boone got a call that the school was giving a day off since the meeting yesterday went until midnight. Theo took and enjoyed this grace period and had decided to go the office. When he opened the door to his cleaning-closet-turned-office, the first thing he noticed was the book for his book report. How ironical, and why? The name of the book was Stolen Kisses.  His lips was still tingling and wondered if April really liked him or was it just over-excitement? He grabbed his cell phone and called her.

“Hey April.” His heart was thumping.

“H-hey. Look that kiss was not me. I just did without thinking.” Then his heart almost grind to a halt. What a relief!

“That's all I needed to know. Thank you.”

Someone knocked on his door. It opened and turned out to be the new intern, John.

“Hey, can you hand these into the Family Court?”

“Sure.”

“Thanks, and Congratulations on the new girlfriend.”

Twitch. The 5 words that made him twitch and never want to hear again, but inevitably will. Theo suspected he was there when she kissed.

He rode his bike again to Stratten County Courthouse trying to forget everything that happened again.

As usual, he went to the 3rd floor and met Jenny.

“Well, hello, Theo.” He wasn't blushing. Weird.

“Here are the files.”

“Thanks, Congrats on the new girlfriend.”

Twitch. Again the 5 words. Not exactly the same, but it was close enough to make him twitch.

“Thank you.”, he said quickly, dashed to the stairs and biked furiously away from the courthouse.
Tomorrow was going to be one heck of a day.
Theo had a plan. In his school, there was an unused (probably abandoned), unlocked gym. There was barely any traffic on the way there and it was close to his class. Perfect.

He opened the door and found April, sketching on her notebook.

“Hello?”

“Oh. Hey.” At this point Theo was blushing the same way when Jenny would greet her.(Well, at least before.)

“What're you doing here?”

“I'm drawing, it's the perfect place here. Peace, quiet and good lighting. I thought everybody knew that.”

“Wait. Everybody knows that? So that means...”

They both braced for the embarrassment and escape when the door opened to a swarm of students (possibly the whole 8th and 7th grade group) that sang,

“April 'n' Theo sitting in a tree~ K-I-S-S...”

They wouldn't dare hear the entire song and rushed to their classes.

5 minutes later the teacher came in and said,

“Class, we are changing seats, so pick the seat that you like, and..”

Interruptingly, everybody sat at a seat so that none would be filled except for the two in the middle of the front row. Brilliant.

Theo and April had no choice and couldn't find an alternative, so they had to sit next to each other.

Throughout the class, some would giggle at every rubber, pencil and whispers shared. All classes changed their seats meaning that the same thing happened. When it was home time, the pair said nothing while they walked to the exit, except when Theo said,

“You might need a new sketching place.”

2g7iij,12,2014-09-12,I just found out I'm being audited. The state where I lived for a few months 5 years ago wants to charge me taxes against money I made months after moving. Does that seem right?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2g7iij/i_just_found_out_im_being_audited_the_state_where/,"I looked for tax subs and couldn't find anything with more than 2 or 3 people logged in. Please feel free to redirect and/or flame if this isn't the right spot, but I see a lot of tax questions come up on here, and you guys all seem really smart on this stuff.

So, I lived in State A for 4 months in 2009 on a temporary basis (internship) and only earned $1k while there. I moved back home to State B, waited 6 months for my job to start in State C, then moved and started earning decent money.

When I filed my state return (filed as non-resident/part year resident), it kept showing I owed taxes against the State C earnings. I spent hours and hours researching the tax laws of the state and even contacted the office. Everything suggested that I should not have to pay taxes on income earned after moving. Still, I couldn't get the tax form to agree.

The calculations went like this: Federal AGI * State A tax rate * (State A income / State C income) = tax liability.

It sounds fair, but it still means that I'm being taxed more than if I hadn't earned in State C. Example: AGI of $100k * state rate of 10% * ($1k state A / $99k state C) = $100. However, if I fill out the State A form with only my $1k State A income, I come out with a nice refund.

Finally, I found a line on the form called something like ""fair adjustment."" I looked up the statutes on this item, and it said it was to prevent anyone from being taxed twice on the same income. I thought ""well, State A and State C are both taxing me on this, this must be the answer."" I entered the amount I was being taxed, and it canceled out to equal zero. No refund, as it would if I had filed with only my State A income listed, but better than paying something.

Well, now I get a letter saying I'm being audited because the fair adjustment line can't be used for this. I contacted the auditor, and they said ""even though State C income is increasing your State A taxes, you're still not being taxed against State C income. You owe us money.""

Does this make sense? "

I hope this isn't against any rules, but I'm desperate for advice. I am a college student who has most of his tuition and rent/housing paid for. However, for awhile, I was an overspender.

CC2-$1,154.99 Limit: $1,750 at 19.80% APR

My question is, that when my internship ends in December, what do I do? How can I pay these cards down? When I graduate school in May, I no longer have my parents' financial support in paying for rent, school, etc. However, I cannot get them to file the FAFSA for some ridiculous reasons.

I have an animation project to do, have to do a billion readings which I will one day be given a pop quiz on (and, by the way, I HATE POP QUIZZES because they make me REALLY REALLY anxious... I absolutely hate being surprised with tests and I feel panicky whenever I get them), and I am currently working on a Database Modelling homework that is giving me anxiety because I cannot, for the life of me, understand the notes.

I think I should also mention that I am a high achiever, especially when it comes to my media/computer science classes. I want to be the best in my class and constantly strive for A's. I never procrastinate, which is why I am working on my final animation project that is due at the end of the semester, today... But I feel like I haven't had a break in a long time (as soon as I came back from a study abroad trip last semester, I immediately started an internship) and I am constantly being given on-the-side projects to do, and it's all doing my head in. On top of that, I have a dog that constantly begs for attention, drives me nuts with constant whining, and as a result I feel extremely stressed and overwhelmed and I feel I cannot just relax at this point in my life right now.

My current problem is dealing with my Database homework. It's due next week but I want to get it over with and I'm having an extremely hard time concentrating. I cannot understand the notes given to me. I'm constantly trying to search for distractions because I do not want to think about it, but it's always in the back of my mind. My mind feels extremely scrambled."
2g85qx,4,2014-09-12,"I think I'm being stupid about a Tinder girl, of all people. Tell me I'm being stupid so I can quit being so stupid. (Warning: this is kind of long, but I broke it up into paragraphs.)",doublementh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2g85qx/i_think_im_being_stupid_about_a_tinder_girl_of/,"I'm listening to wistful music right now so I can properly condition myself to describe off-chesting exactly the way I want. There's always two or more sides to every single story, and this is mine, and I'm afraid that whatever comes out of my mouth or out of my keyboard or whatever will only serve to prove that I'm a crazy person, or at the very least, just creepy and obsessive and weird and egotistically obese.

On my birthday, my (now ex) girlfriend and I were having sex. Normally, she would always be pretty into it, and she expressed doubts about continuing this whole fling when we reconvened for the summer, but it always ended up in make outs and wandering hands anyway. She was very reserved, and we stopped. I asked her if everything was okay, and she said, ""It's just... I've gotten with a lot of attractive guys this year."" I wasn't sure how to take that, and I reacted poorly. The night ended with a pity handjob, and she told me not to hate her. I invited her over the next night along with some other friends to see if I could smooth things over, but she was texting some guy she'd apparently already been seeing, and, well, you know the rest. We later got into a massive argument, blah blah blah, whatever, we're done. I'm not going to tell you that I am a saint in this situation, because I have no idea how to handle any romantic relationships in my life. I had a few very bad experiences rather early on (think like eighth grade) that set a really lousy foundation for this sort of thing, and I'm only realizing it now that I have issues. In short, I am a bad person, and I need to fix it. I'm trying, I think.

About a month later, in between the days of my dead-end, unpaid, exploitative internship, I swiped right on a girl on Tinder, and we matched. Her name was and still is, Alex, even though it never was and never will be because that isn't her real name. I said hey, and somehow we immediately got onto our favorite books and poets and we were hitting it off as well as you could over text. We exchanged phone numbers, and for a week, we texted constantly. Nonstop. There was hardly a moment when we weren't texting or ripping on each other nor was there a moment she didn't make me smile or shake a little or anything like that, and she made it pretty clear she was into me. She's fucking smarter than me. Nineteen. Gonna graduate from college this year and go to law school, and I know that if I could be half as smart as her, well, I could just cruise through anything I wanted in my life, from now till I keel over and die. We finally met, adn we went to a bookstore, hung out flirted, and god damn, she was gorgeous. An odd choice of white blouse and white skinny jeans, with a septum piercing and glasses. Her perfume felt a bit strong on the nostrils, but it smelled nice, and I didn't really give a damn, because she'd been right there in front of me. We left, and she said she couldn't stay out for too long because she had prior obligations, and that was fine. Asked if she wanted to go back to my place, and we started making out for a bit. One thing I remember is that her eyes opened when mine did, which I thought was kind of strange, since most people I know keep their eyes closed. Never understood why, wouldn't you wanna see the person you're kissing?

She had to go, eventually. When I dropped her off, I asked her if a goodbye kiss was out of the question, and she said it wasn't. That was nice, and then I never saw her again. She was in Canada, we made plans to hang out again, and she said she got bronchitis, then a staph infection. I kept texting her, but she never initiated, and then I had the thought that it was because I was being creep and that I needed to leave her the fuck alone. I thought about her every day, and I text her after just under a month of silence between us, asking her if she wanted to hang out. She gave me the same response as before: that if she wasn't busy, she'd hit me up. It never happened. I recounted this story to a friend at school, who said, ""Text her right now."" I did. No response.

This is going to sound incredibly stupid, stars-in-the-eyes, a little nuts a little weird a little psycho, but I would seriously have considered, like, *dating* Alex. And now I can't, because I think it would just be creepy for me to keep texting her anytime soon, or at all, even on breaks, since she lives one town over from me when I'm at home. I can't stop thinking about her. Few people have impressed me as much as she had, and I'm putting too much into this.

I'm sorry for the lousy, self-indulgent writing. I may very well be the worst English major ever, but I feel suddenly like I don't have time to write, only time to barf. 

thanks for listening, see you soon"

I had a 401k with the bank putting 15% of my little paycheck of 10 hours a week and it grew little by little over the past year and a half.

401k account - $2300 (US dollars) (Since the balance was above $1000 and below $5000, I had to roll it over, and I am not withdrawing)

As of now, I am allowing the bank to roll my 401k over into a CD IRA (this will be for a short time - only 2-3 weeks to avoid high fees with transferring it due to their stock fees, etc.) I would like to put the funds into a Roth IRA so I can make deposits, etc. I was recommended E-Trade and have looked over their information and am ok with it.

2g8g0u,1,2014-09-12,"School is literally killing me, and I can't take it anymore. I'm trapped.",emberyfox,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2g8g0u/school_is_literally_killing_me_and_i_cant_take_it/,"

I've been at my university for four years, and I have almost nothing to show for it. My transcript looks like it took a shotgun to the face, and I, a former honor student, feel like an academic abortion. 

I'm a Computer Science major, and I just can't take it anymore. I've taken the same pivotal CS class four fucking times now, and I can't even stand to look at the material anymore. Even thinking about assembly, the LC3 processor, or radix makes me want to jump off the nearest building. Fuck floating point math and numerical representation. Going to that class fills me with an overwhelming sense of regret, shame, and sadness. Passing the assignments and failing the tests is almost a given anymore. Fuck Computer Organization... I still cannot believe I've taken it four times.

If I were to start again, I'd become an English major. I've got an affinity for writing, and a love for storycraft. Knowledge as a whole appeals to me, from psychology to theoretical physics. But that appeal has since soured.

School is literally killing me. I'm clinically depressed, and these past four years have sent me hurtling towards rock bottom. My depression ravaged my academics, ruined my love for CS, and destroyed my creative muse. I'm a burnt out shell of what I once was. I've lost my edge in both CS and English, and I'm struggling to keep up with my peers.

My student loans (private, and unforgivable of course) now total over 100k due to the costs of out-of-state tuition; a poor choice based on arrogance and a burning need to get the hell away from my hometown. Because of this, I cannot drop out and try again later. I cannot take an extended leave of absence, and I cannot become a part time student. My family is bankrupt and unable to help me financially. I'm on my own.

The one good thing that has come out of my time at school is an amazing paid internship, where I develop software and work on QA for a major enterprise software company. However, my position here is closely tied with my getting a CS degree. My team has already expressed an interest in hiring me on as a salaried employee, but that can only happen if I graduate with that degree. It doesn't seem to matter in this day and age that I've learned more within a month of working here than the entirety of my time in the CS curriculum. I'm stuck with it.

I've been told time and time again that STEM degrees are the only ones worth anything, that liberal arts degrees are worthless and would ruin my life at this point. That it would leave me jobless, unsuccessful, and forever haunted by the specter of unforgivable debt. Because of this fucking notion that our society seems to be deluded with, I've been forcing myself to continue pursuing a Computer Science degree even though it's ruining my health and making me loathe everything to do with school.

I've considered suicide many times. I feel trapped and utterly helpless, like a deer frozen in the headlights. I've been in and out of therapy for years, tried tons of different prescriptions, and I'm currently taking so many pills I feel like a drug addict. Nothing seems to truly stick. I'm on a medication that seems to help me through the worst of it (I can actually feel happiness sometimes), but the depression is still there. Lurking, waiting for the right moment to strike and send me spiraling into another episode.

___

Just a little while ago, I decided that I've had enough. I withdrew from that CS class. I'm pursuing an English degree, and I've essentially dropped CS. But instead of being relieved, feeling like I'm turning over a new leaf and starting anew, I now feel like a total failure. A loser. I'm even more anxious and depressed than I was before. I promised myself that this semester would be different, that I'd have a better experience and finally pass that fucking CS class... But, predictably, I've let myself down yet again. 

I want to write novels; to make video games and interactive experiences that others can enjoy and cherish. Whenever I create a successful program at work, I feel an overwhelming sense of pride and satisfaction. When I pick apart the themes in a movie and discover the hidden meanings... Making those connections and solving the mystery... These all make me feel amazing.

I don't want to give CS up. I don't want to admit defeat. But if I keep going down this path, I will surely die.

___

Tl;dr: I'm academically fucked, and I may have no future. I'm forcing myself to pursue Computer Science and fail the same class over and over again. I dropped it for English, and now I'm feeling even worse."

Being the tech guy in the office, I generally devise workarounds to try to reduce our costs and allow us to be more efficient.

Currently, we offer paid membership to people in our field, and we sell membership via Eventbrite. We used to use ACT! as our CRM but we upgraded our old computers recently and can't afford a new version.

At the moment, I spend a lot of time maintain Excel files with contacts. is it possible to link an Outlook group to an Excel spreadsheet, such that I can create an address book group in Outlook, point it to a file such as Paid_members.xls, and then have that Outlook group auto-update every time I add a new member to the Excel spreadsheet?

I know this is a pretty awkward workaround (if it's at all possible), but I need master lists in order to prevent coworkers from accidentally working with an outdated file, which happens a lot when keeping multiple copies of a file or having to maintain the same list across multiple files or programs. Similarly, it needs to be something basic enough that interns and my boss can edit alike without much instruction.

Thanks for any suggestions!"

There's also a [CTF](http://blog.trailofbits.com/2014/05/20/trail-of-bits-releases-the-capture-the-flag-field-guide/) team called [OpenToAll](http://www.reddit.com/r/OpenToAllCTFteam/) I started that's way more successful than the club is.

As far as the industry goes the demand is pretty high and the supply is short so the pay isn't bad either. The work is really enjoyable IMO but you can see if you like it by going to the club. It's true that it's a lot of self teaching so going to the meetings each week and having that be your only hour a week of doing security stuff isn't going to do shit for you as far as professional success. There's also no one but me at SBU to help you but if you put in like 40 hours into getting an internship you'll get a good one (as long as you don't ask me where you should apply and what to do in February), I can't say the same thing about software engineering.

Edit: Bring a laptop"

2g997n,1,2014-09-12,test,[deleted],test,https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/2g997n/test/,"Some really weird and fucked shit happened to me after work today. I work at a law firm as a junior lawyer. I'm not going to say the name or the city because that would put me in all kinds of legal trouble. I shouldn't even be posting this but I've read a lot of the posts on here and it seems like the only logical place to write about what I saw.  
Quick intro. My name is Paul. The firm I work at is a big one that has several different departments (ie. Criminal, civil, land dispute, etc). I work in what's called the heritage department. It's a fancy way of saying last wills and testaments. I work under a full time partner named Matt, who had a promising career in the criminal defense area but since he says “fuck” like a comma, it didn't last. He doesn't mind the change though. (His words not mine) “The dead don't mind if you call them fuck-tards”. Also, there is a lot of money to be had if you know what   you're doing. You'd be amazed at the coin the one percent will drop in order to keep their millions out of the hands of botoxed ex-wives or drug addict kids (I know I sound cynical but that's because I am. Really hard to stay in the law field and not be).   
     Everyone wanted to work with Matt. He didn't bullshit, he didn't cheat, and had no problem telling a client to fuck off. When I was an intern I drank too much at a Christmas party and told off one of my co-workers. I don't remember what I said but I do remember Matt, standing on a chair and screaming, “Whose dick I gotta suck to get that guy on my team?”. A week later I was made a junior partner. His secretary Claire, is almost as bad as him. She has a sweet side and can make anyone laugh but a really short fuse. She's beautiful like a 1920's   madame and also a lipstick lesbian. You want to keep your money away from assholes, we're the three people you talk to.  
We had one client about two days ago. An old guy with a really thick accent and a USB drive. One of the services we offer is the confidential video will. You sign a paper saying the video is official and as long as it's legal, whatever's on it is considered your final wishes (No “I want that son of a bitch John dead”). It's especially useful for immigrants since there's usually family outside the US that want a piece of the pie and have no problems getting their own lawyers. Since a video will is practically the word of god in a courtroom, it's a great way for foreigners to make sure their resources go were they want.   
Anyway, that guy didn't standout that much apart from his accent. We did some quick paperwork, notarized it, and by the end of the day we had a new paycheck coming. What was weird is what happened this morning. Mr. Bowler, as he was known, was found dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.   
So after work we set up in the conference room to watch his video will and see what we could and could not do for him. It's a pretty stereotypical room with a long table, a mini bar, and a flat screen TV. Claire was sitting on one side taking notes. I was across from her as a witness. And Matt sat in front as the lead. He put the USB into the side of the television and the menu came up. There were a lot of random documents on the USB but we were only interested in the video marked, “Last Will and Testament”.  
The video began and Mr. Bowler walked in and sat behind a desk. He began to speak a language I did not understand. Claire groaned and Matt said sarcastically, “The German...Speaks German”. Mr. Bowler went on and finally said in English, “My name is Colonel Philip Bauer, and this is my confession”.  
The video switched to that grey color that passed as black in old black and white films. The word “Vertraulich” popped up on the screen in white letters above an eagle with spread wings. The screen went away and there on the television...I really can't believe I'm typing this. This is so fucked....There was Mr. Bowler, a young version of him, in a grey Nazi uniform. He began to speak German as I heard the clatter of Claire's pen dropping on the table. Matt just leaned forward and said, “Ladies and Gentleman. We have a game changer”. The screen switched to a bunch of people in white coats walking around a lab (The entire video had a voice over by Mr. Bowler but I didn't know what he was saying. I'm only typing out what I saw). There were some other filler video of labs and mice before it got to the disturbing part. The video showed two different groups of people wearing striped clothing. One group had the subtitle “Juden” and the other said “Keine Juden”. This is where the video gets fucked.   
The video showed half of the groups getting an injection followed by each of them going into a concrete cell with one of the others who hadn't been injected. It was a time lapse that showed each subject but there were two the video focused on. Keine Judens. A pretty dark haired woman and a dark haired man of maybe 30. The movie showed the two of them walking into a cell before the camera angle switched so it was above them like it was being shot from a walkway.      
The film jumped forward in time to a scene of the two sitting in the cell. Below the picture were the words, “5 Stunden”. The woman began to cough. A little at first. At “6 Stunden”, it turned into a full blown fit. At “9 Studen”, the woman was lying in bed rolling slightly back and forth while her cell mate tried to comfort her. Then it happened. The woman shot up like a jack-in-the-box. Dark tears came from her eyes. She had a violent coughing fit and blood/snot shot out of her nose onto her striped shirt. She fell onto the bed and arched her   back. I thank God the video didn't have sound. Her mouth opened in a silent scream before blood fountained out. The man ran terrified to the other side of the cell and began frantically clawing at the walls.   
The woman laid flat on the bed and it was over as fast as it started. The video continued. The woman lying flat. The man was sobbing. Then he stopped. And he started to cough. The next time it showed the man it was with the caption “15 Studen”. Blood covered his shirt. Dark and clear mixed out of the streams coming from his nose and mouth. Gory tears covered his cheeks. The woman still laid dead with a few flies gathering on her. Unlike her, the man stood, staring at the back wall. He stood still. Completely..still... Then he began to walk. He walked slowly towards the back wall until he went into it. He kept moving with his hands by his sides like he expected to just go straight through. Then he stopped. He turned around and paced to the other side of the cell until he hit the metal door. This went on for another few minutes.   
The video then showed several of the other inmates. A Juden sprawled out on the concrete while another man rocked back and forth. A Keine Juden spinning in a circle while his partner laid in a puddle of blood and vomit. A dead Keine Juden woman tearing her face to ribbons while her Juden partner continuously lifted and put down his right leg.   
Then the video switched. It showed a pretty blonde woman with a man with light hair. During the 24 “Studens”, The two talked, laughed, and hugged. Eventually their cell door was opened and the final frames of the film was filled with that fucker Mr. Bowler's voice and triumphant music. Along with shots of the pair sitting inside a cafe drinking coffee, kissing in a field and holding a baby. The caption below them said, “1943 Heiratete”.  
The movie showed thee others who had lived. One was also “1943 Heiratete” with a smiling brunette woman. Another was a man working on a farm, also smiling ear to ear for the camera. As the music swelled up it showed one more survivor. A Juden. Marching in Berlin shoulder to shoulder with other men in Nazi uniforms. The screen faded to grey as the eagle appeared again.   
The film ended and we sat in stunned silence. Matt stood up and took the USB drive out. He knew a private detective he used when he interned at the divorce department who spoke several different languages. He told us not to say a word to anyone until he showed it to him and knew what it  exactly was we had just watched. We agreed and left with his promise he'd call us. I got home and typed this because I had to tell someone and I feel like this is the only place that might believe me. My girlfriend is in the other room painting. As soon as I post this I'm going to go kiss her and tell her I love her. If you were kind enough to read my story, I suggest you call your loved ones and do the same. God knows what the fuck I just watched.

2g9d3n,7,2014-09-12,My experience as a 24yrold commuting transfer student (thus far),HP48gxusr,MTU,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTU/comments/2g9d3n/my_experience_as_a_24yrold_commuting_transfer/,"Hello. To whom it may concern I want to inform those if my experience at this university thus far. 

I am a transfer student from downstate and I live off campus. I drive to a lot on top of a hill from my rather nice, yet cheap apartment where I cook yummy steaks, brats, and chicken that I bought from the 24hr econofoods. 

I often stay in the library, watching the younger people frollock, often the young men will strategically take the computer next to a pretty girl in awkward wanting of her to strike up a conversation (oh wait thats me lol)

The girls here are quality over quantity. Some have had internships at Nasa, do high intensity research, ect. These girls are definately wife-able and at this stage of my life I am definately looking towards the future. In my classes there are jims and johns that tell these fine creatures, heyyy want to come to my dorm with x y and z? Or blah blah blah, lets be loud in class so me in front of you can be distracted bc your hormones are going wacko for the cute heartthrob you get to class early to sit by. 

The education is superb, I think this is the best education anyone can have. You are forced to digitize, to use canvas and google calendar to stay afloat which teaches you to utilize systems of time management that are unsurpassed in efficiency. Research is amazing, having joined a team. So professional. 

Lots of nerds, hot smart kind girls, smart helpful staff, some douchers to compete for the hand of the ladies (me), and teachers that love what they do. Im glad i came here instead of UofM, yah i know winter hasnt hit, I already bought a one peice water proof suit designed for motorcycle riding that will keep me warm. No fear

Thanks"
2g9dbh,26,2014-09-12,[SV][Pics] 50 lbs down on keto!,hyperbo_lee,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/2g9dbh/svpics_50_lbs_down_on_keto/,"I started keto in March of this year with the goal of losing maybe 20 lbs (the most I've lost on any diet I've ever tried) after a friend recommended it to me. I started at around 320 lbs and to my amazement that first 20 lbs melted off in 2 months! That got me really motivated to keep going, and around 6 months after starting I was down 50 lbs! This is the lightest I have been in my entire adult life (just turned 25)!

[http://i.imgur.com/5M9zDsN.png](http://i.imgur.com/5M9zDsN.png)

On the left I'm finishing my summer internship at Oak Ridge weighing in at 320+ wearing an XXXL shirt. It's 3 years old, but I didn't change much between then and 6 months ago and it's the best ""before"" picture I have. On the right is me down 50 lbs wearing an XL (never thought that would happen again). To make things even better I had blood work done a few weeks ago and all my numbers (blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose) are good to perfect for someone my age, which is amazing considering the health problems in my family.

Thanks to everyone on this subreddit and everyone over and [/r/ketorecipes](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes) for providing motivation and amazing recipe ideas to help me stay on track. My next goal is to get over my self-consciousness and start going to the gym.

**TL;DR** Started keto 6 months ago; down 50 lbs so far! And I can wear XL shirts again!"

I am a junior Computer Science and Mathematics double major and was wondering if Oculus had any internship opportunities for university students. I asked support and they just pointed me to the [careers](http://www.oculusvr.com/company/careers/) page which doesn't show any.

2g9oza,2,2014-09-13,Where to go from here?(a partial biography),Yourponydied,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2g9oza/where_to_go_from_herea_partial_biography/,"I live an ok life. Been employed 8 years straight now and pay is decent. Not livin paycheck to paycheck. Typical story, typical life a female ruins it. Mostly my fault because I can't move on.

Been into said girl since I was 16(31 now). Hard for me to develop friendships and relationships but she was the first female I opened up to fully, about everything that was me. I valued her friendship beyond degrees and would hide my sadness when she would go out and date guys while I watches or she told me about it. We went to prom, probably out of pity or maybe cuz she was being a real friend, not sure but was fun. 

Made mistake months later of asking her out. She let me down saying she just out of a relationship and wasn't ready. 2 weeks later her friend is talking about them double dating. I snap and end up breaking my knuckles and putting holes in the walls. Things degraded more and come my freshman year of college we had an argument and we didn't talk to 5 years. 

I hated her, beyond belief. I wanted revenge and I wanted her life to be miserable. Then one day I wake up and think about her and realize I don't hate her. Reopen communication and we start back off where we left off. Slowly at first but then back to normal. She'd always be with a bfs but in the times she didn't have one shed presumably come to me as a safety net or just to make me feel better about myself. This goes on for about 8 years. She goes away for an internship and I don't see her for 6 months but we talk every day. She comes back and we hang out and she mentions she's ""kinda"" seeing her old boyfriend. This was the last time we ever saw each other due to schedules or I don't know

One day I txt her and she asks if I wanted to hang out, she was havin a party. I told her sorry, I was tired and wasn't up for it. I am glad I didn't, that night I see a update on facebook ""insert name here is now engaged""
It felt like a bomb destroyed my insides and I didn't know what to do. Anger, sadness, hopelessness. What if I went to that party? Did she know the engagement was coming or was it a reveal party? How would I react? Why can't I be happy for her?

That was 2 years ago, the only real communication we've had since was txt msgs for birthdays and Christmas. I hand wrote her a letter expressing my feelings, not telling her to call it off or anything, just needing to say my peace. I fucked up and sent the letter a year early because I thought her wedding was scheduled for last year due to bad information. I wrote on it not to read after her honeymoon. I don't want her wedding to be possibly ruined by my emotional garbage

The despair comes from my hardness to develop a rapport with people, especially since this is someone I've know for 15 years and in my mind we are perfect for each other, but I apparently don't offer what her soon to be husband is offering. The concept of that the fantasy of her and I being officially dead is horrifying reality for me, that it could take another 5 plus years to find someone like her to fill the void or if it's possible. She gave me everything I could want or ask for, except for the ultimate I wanted.

Her wedding is in about 12 hrs today, am I a bad person? Btw, I am not suicidal. Unless you consider drinking as slow suicide.

Edit: some spelling"
2g9pn8,1,2014-09-13,[M4F] - Seeking Dominant Females for a Dark Scenario,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/2g9pn8/m4f_seeking_dominant_females_for_a_dark_scenario/,"If you've opened the post, it means you're looking to do some very shady domineering, and I hope you won't leave disappointed. This particular scenario in mind focuses around a strong dominant woman taking a younger man, and feminizing him against his will, or with dubious consent. Essentially, you're going to force him into becoming a transsexual. Still interested? I hope you are, because I have some lovely little scenarios planned.

* You are a mother who has always wanted a daughter, but thanks to your college boyfriend who left you knocked up and a single parent, all you have is a son. It's just you and him living in the house. Perhaps it's time you took matters into your own hands and make yourself a daughter.

* You are a strong business professional in higher management at a reputable company, who's name and specialty is of no consequence. You've had your share of interns coming and going, and living alone has made you depraved from pent-up urges. And then you notice one of the new guys, and can't help but think how cute he could be if you made him yours.

* You've been a bit of an odd case your whole life. You're technically bisexual, but you can't help but find men so much more pleasing in bed that women aren't worth the bother, but you've always been more physically attracted to a female appearance than a male. But what to do about it? Not like you could just make your own dickgirl. Or could you? That guy you've been dating seems like the kind that could be... persuaded.

---

Obviously those are just three of the possible scenarios. I'm happy to hear anything anyone else comes up with that's around the same basic setup as that. Strong woman, weak man. Some stuff I will say right away. If you're into age play (such as the first prompt) I always prefer to play the younger. Much of the methods in which you coerce and/or force the transformation are unimportant.


Things that **will** be included: Feminization obviously, body mod is a big one as long as it's always relating to the theme, humiliation, forced cross-dressing, non-con/dub-con, likely some bimbofication, but that goes with feminization.

Things that will likely be included: BDSM, pegging, exhibitionism, anallingus, light violence, sexual torture (but not excessive pain/blood).

Things that will **not** be included: Scat, bloodplay (sorry, no vampires), excessive pain.

Any other kinks you want to include can be discussed beforehand. I will do my best to reply to any and all messages, and I hope to be playing with you ladies soon ;)"
2g9yjq,1,2014-09-13,7 days NoFap (Let's make some numbers),foxtrot_ba,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2g9yjq/7_days_nofap_lets_make_some_numbers/,"Hello everyone! This has been my first week in hard mode after many relapses. I feel fine. I have installed K9 protection, I installed it previously, with the password ""wanker"" wich used to turn me down and led me to relapse. Now my password is ""Iamstrong"", so every time I have to type it, it reminds me what I am doing.

My history is like many others I have read. I have lost soooo many time  fapping to internet porn, even weeeird porn, the one that raises eyebrows and make people say ""Man, you need help."" One day I discovered BoldAndDetermined.com and at first seemed the website was another landfill of internet... but the guy who writes there knows what he's doing and he had [an article about giving up porn](http://boldanddetermined.com/2011/10/20/10-reasons-to-stop-using-internet-porn/)


Then I discovered NoFap, but I didn't made any commitment. Now my situation has changed a lot: I'm in another country, doing an internship and looking for a job, so I thought it was the perfect time to ditch the habit. And I have tried for the whole summer, but I never managed more than 5 days without touching my dick :/

Last week I made a commitment with myself: I am involved in many things right now and the only way to carry on is leaving internet porn. I am not saying i will never masturbate again, but for now I think I will not.

So, how much time have I spent polishing the rod? Let's say that usually I don't fap everyday, so 5 days/week, 40 min/fapping session. That's 200 min/week, more than 3 hours. And of course, from time to time your scumbag brain thinks he deserves some ""me-time"" so he convinces you to do a longer session, 60 minutes, 2 times/month. That's 320 minutes per month. In a year it is 3840 minutes, 64 hours/year.

But wait, some times you are on holidays. When i was on holidays usually i fapped twice per day, so let's add another 200 min/week multiplied by 4 weeks of holidays/year. 800 minutes more. 

And the usual ""I-am-so-stressed-so-i-will-fap"" binge from time to time, twice a month, 30 minutes each time. 60 minutes more per month... so:

- regular fapping: 3840 min/year
- holidays fapping: 800 min/year
- stress fapping: 720 min/year
- TOTAL: [5360 minutes](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5360+minutes) = 3 days 17 hours 20 minutes 

So If i have followed, approximately this pattern for , 7? years of my life it makes [37520 minutes](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5360+minutes+x+7) = 26 days 1 hour 20 minutes

It's not like I could have another university degree with the time spent, but, I could have gone out, take some german lessons, learned to code, stay more time with my family...

If you find my figures are misleading or incorrect, please, discuss with me. Stay strong and have a nice weekend!"

####The Best Features From The Writers of /r/SubRedditOfTheDay

...or TBFFTWOSROTD for short. Eat your heart out Patton Oswalt.

This article is a very special one. For the past few months every one of our writers have been counting down to the big 100,000 milestone. For us this is a really big deal. From day one, our mission was to help promote subreddits. /r/SubRedditOfTheDay was a simple idea that started more than 3 years ago and since then it has truly blossomed into something magnificent. Rome wasn't built in one day nor was it built by one person. Many great writers came before us and many will no doubt come after us. Some are still with us, and some we have yet to meet. Each one of these precious snowflakes has a lovely story to tell and a unique way in telling it. I can not recommend enough reading all their features.

Originally though, the purpose of SROTD was to feature fantastic subreddits to those who didn't know about them. Over time, that became an excuse for creative writing exercises and finding out fun ways to advertise the subreddit without all the boring explaining parts. Trust me while this can be a lot of fun at times, it can also be painfully agonizing, but we did it. I'm very proud to state that we've been doing it for more than 3 years without a slip up. Thats the kind of record I like.

To be fair and honest, due to time restraints, lack of writers, lack of interns, lack of motivation, lack of interest, or just lack of will power some features are not as great as others. I know thats a fact because ~~its all right there in the pudding~~ most of the worst features were done by me. I don't deny it. I wish I could change that, but at the same time, its shows how resilient ~~I was~~ we were, and no matter what happens, the show must go on. Broken leg, arm, heart, mind, penis?!?! ...it doesn't matter THE SHOW WILL GO ON!

There is a flip side to this brutal truth. That is some times, just some times, when the stars align, we find that diamond in the rough subreddit. We polish it with the finest of words and lamest of puns. We double check it with the best gifs &amp; gfycats. We dress it up with the cheesiest music videos from the 80's and 90's and classic Sponge Bob Square Pants clips if we're feeling really generous. We finish it off with the perfect title, just like the Dude's carpet from the Big Lebowski, it really ties the room together. The end resulting product is priceless. When done right you'll almost forget that the feature is actually about a subreddit completely. Those are the articles were featuring today. Those are the features we the writers of /r/SubRedditOfTheDay are most proud of. 

Finally and most importantly, we wanted to mention a special thank you to all our loyal readers. Without the subscribers and fellow promoters, we could not have gotten where we are without you. We thrive on feedback. If you ever want to tell us anything, never be shy, come forward, we always want to fix our mistakes, correct our spelling errors and improve our craft overall. You guys have done so much for us already. You continuously recommend subreddits for us to feature. You endlessly participate in helping a new subreddit grow. You constantly give us ideas, support, inspiration, and the list goes on and on. You are the reason we do this. Thank you very much for sticking with us. I am greatly humbled by your audience. My fellow staff members are jumping with joy at everything we've achieved so far. Can you blame them? With this present staff, we have a really bright future ahead of us. So sit back, grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy the main event.

In celebration for our 100,000 subscribers we made a list in chronological order with the best features from the writers of /r/SubRedditOfTheDay!

&gt;#[January 25, 2013 /r/80smusic: Hit me with your best shot!](http://redd.it/178n13)

&gt;&gt; **/u/soupyhands** 80s music is Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down...

&gt;#[March 1st, 2013 /r/bearsdoinghumanthings. After this you might want to rethink the human evolution.](http://redd.it/19gftr)

&gt;&gt; **/u/qweiopasd** I had a great time writing /r/bearsdoinghumanthings because I made up a few really lame bear puns and wrote my write up around it. And because [bears are awesome](http://i.imgur.com/3pX9CPd.jpg) of course. 

&gt;#[April 1st, 2013 - /r/Atheism, Because religious people are literally the worst thing ever.](http://redd.it/1begux)

&gt;&gt; **/u/XavierMendel** While the post was accidentally deleted in a mass purge (nobody is more sorry than I am), it's easy to tell its mine and my mark is given at the bottom of the post. I believe it's my best feature of 2013 not because of the featured subreddit but because of the writing put into it. I spent a lot of time writing as an entirely different person, cramming in as much as I could into a short satire that I can't help but be proud of it. The feature may not be for the best reasons or even be my favorite, but it's the best post I've written for /r/SubRedditOfTheDay.

&gt;#[April 8, 2013 - /r/ChangeMyView - It gets lonely being right all the time](http://redd.it/1bwf1n)

&gt;&gt; **/u/rya11111** Why ? Thats because i am a BIG Anime Fan. I follow current seasons, take part in the discussions and most of everything love to watch anime! I even made my [mal account](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/rya11111) and am totally in love with it. I took special care in writing it and This is my proudest feature for this year.

&gt;&gt; **/u/jaxspider** As the adminstrator of SROTD, I try my hardest to avoid actually writing since I lack all the skills  needed for being a great writer. But this time, the subject matter was close to my heart and I was well rested. So this is what I consider the best feature I had written all year. The next best thing was my [CampCult](http://redd.it/1rn5e3) post. But that was because I found tons of movies to fit in with my feature.

&gt;&gt; **/u/NeonGreenTiger** This post was where it all started to come together for me. I enjoyed writing it as much as interjecting my own experiences.

&gt;&gt; **/u/BipolarBear0** That feature stands out in a few ways. It's formatted differently from the vast majority of SROTD posts, especially by doing two separate subreddits, which distinguishes it in an organizational aspect - but it also commemorates an event which is watched by millions of people around the world and which it provides a unique flavour to by showcasing reddit's role in those communities.

&gt;&gt;**/u/SEXUAL_ACT_IN_CAPS** Hate to say it, but I do think my first was my best so far. It was short, but I really like it even now. I am really proud of the quote to start and the humor I included. It was a fun feature for one of my favorite subs on the same day as their fist feature too. Everything was right about it.

There's a reason my flair is ""Your Indie Guy""-- A small subreddit with a nice community is next to impossible to beat, and I think that's exactly what my article showed.

&gt;&gt; **/u/Lurlur** Writing my first feature for /r/Dinosaurs was a brilliant introduction to /r/subredditoftheday for me and gave me a chance to relive my past as a paleontologist. I have a fondness for my first feature, others since have perhaps been better written or more well received but this was the one that got me hooked on being a writer here.

&gt;&gt;**/u/Respectfullyyours:** This was my first feature that I felt really drew in a significant number of new subscribers (it became a trending subreddit not long after the feature, and the next day [buzzfeed made an article about stock photos using a lot of the images I chose](http://www.buzzfeed.com/daves4/unexplainable-stock-photos) which a friend posted on facebook so I found that flattering!), and it's one that I'm very happy to see grow. I also really enjoyed writing it because I felt like I had discovered the holy grail when I found the stock photos of the old naked man expressing strong emotions, and really needed an outlet to share him with the world.

2ga3ex,9,2014-09-13,"Me [24 M] with my GF [22 F] 6.5 years, got new friends, changed major, and left me.",throwaway267312,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ga3ex/me_24_m_with_my_gf_22_f_65_years_got_new_friends/,"Background, we met in high school, had our problems, but always managed to work them out. We both went to college, stayed together, and recently I graduated, got a new job that pays pretty well. She moved in with her friends to finish up college. Her friends were also my friends, another long term couple (7 years) and I golf with the boyfriend a lot. I was also friends with the girlfriend as well. She did not live too far away so I drove up on weekends and stayed with her.

In the beginning of August, we had a huge fight, alcohol was involved. Unfortunately the room mates were present for it. It lead to her storming out and would not come in until I left. When I woke up on the couch, I realized how stupid it was. I felt like i was 17 again and letting alcohol and emotions get a hold of me so I went in to her room to apologize. She kept on telling me its fine, we were both drunk. I tried to explain to her why it upset me, but she did not want to talk about it. So I let it go.

The rest of the month went as normal. We were happy, we went out together, we did this and we did that. Then one day she randomly says she is changing her major to liberal arts because she does not like what she is doing. The kicker here is that her room mate is also a liberal arts major. I was obviously a bit upset that she would choose a major with such a high unemployment rate. That sparked another argument. She then told me she built up resentment towards me because I influenced her to go towards a safer career path, and not what she wanted. She also said that is the reason she failed so many classes. We had planned to get married, she knew of my commitment, and she knew I worked very hard throughout college (3 internships) to be able to support our family together. She wanted to be a teacher. I told her that she can work in other areas, gain experience, and then become a college professor, or teach that subject in high schools, etc. This was the plan that we had set into motion when she first started college, and she seemed okay with it. 

Now after this argument, she says she wants a break. I made the mistake of begging and pleading. Tears and anger blah blah. We weren't a perfect couple, we had our problems, but we always worked them out. I then find out she met someone, and she told me she was ""casually talking"" to him DURING our relationship. This obviously pissed me off, and thats when I left her apartment, and we did not talk for another several days. We then saw each other a week after that, and when I pulled into my parking lot, she was on her phone. We go to my room, we talked about it, tears were shed by both parties. Somehow, our clothes were off and we were doing the horizontal mamba, but her phone vibrated during sex. After sex, she ignored her phone which is way out of character for her. On the way out, I saw her check her phone and it was the mother fucker with a text saying, ""Having fun?"" She told me she has not talked to him in 2 weeks, and that she was downloading music on her phone in the car. There was no other texts before that. She is a terrible liar -.-

I decided to give her space for a month and maintained no contact. We were supposed to meet on the 19th of this month, but she decided it was more important to take a trip to Atlantic City with just her girlfriends. When she texted this to me, I was obviously a bit hurt. So I called her and I just told her to say it. I knew what she was going to say, and she told me she wasn't coming back. She wanted to meet up so she can explain herself but I cancelled on her and told her I was not ready. I wanted to give this break we have another month or two to explore myself, fix my problems, and just grow up as a person. I also hoped that the jazz of being single and partying for her would wear off. 

I feel like her room mate says otherwise. Her room mate is a huge partier, and from what I saw does not really know what she wants in life either. Her room mate is a great girl, very nice, but just lacks the drive. My worry is that her room mate is influencing her. They have been having A LOT of ""girl nights"" these past few weeks and she has been partying way too much when she should be focusing on her school work and career. This is her 4th year in college and she is not close to graduating. 

I want her back terribly. I realized mistakes I made and I made plans on how to fix them. It seems though that she really does not care anymore, and I have a disgusting feeling her room mate has a lot of influence on her. She parties, way too much with her room mate, and does not really study. I wish she gave the same effort I did into our future. I have been trying to pick up the pieces, but a lot of nights I end up turning to the bottle. I sleep on average 3 hours a night and cant seem to work up an appetite. I have never felt this hurt. I have never seen her care this little for me. I know I should try to move on and I am trying very hard, but I thought the pain would get better after a few weeks. It is not.

TL;DR I get good job, GF moves out with new friends, life changes and she leaves randomly. Im hurting, I have too much pride to talk to my friends, I feel lonely and pretty hopeless. "
2ga4aa,25,2014-09-13,"Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [21F] year and a half, long distance, she dreams, daydreams about marriage constantly, I'm restless but committed to relationship but not having fun. She can't stand me around other girls and is very negative about herself.",Throwawayguy8925,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2ga4aa/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_21f_year_and_a_half/,"Sorry this is so long but it's got a lot of involved parts

I've been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and a half. I was a late bloomer so she is my first real relationship. I have long been overweight so my track record with self esteem and dating were not great coming into it but she liked me and she was nice and physically we were kind of a match. Unfortunately, we were under a time constraint as I was already on track to graduate and move on to work about 3 hours away from school and even further from her summer home with her parents. 

We hit it off and for someone in my position it got physical very quickly, which was exciting. I have my own place and don't really know anyone in my new town, so despite the distance, we quickly fell into a pattern of visiting each other almost every weekend. About the time we met I had been expanding my horizons and building confidence going on dates as well as aggressively working on my weight. I fell off this track mostly due to the shift to a new town but the increased self esteem has definitely been a growth area for me even if I'm not as fit as I would like to be. 

She's working her way through school and while she is definitely smart she has made some foolish decisions and put herself in positions where she could not cover her costs for school and rent. Family have failed her for help and it has repeatedly put me in the position of being between her and leaving school usually via eviction. I've helped each time to the tune of over $3500 dollars and while I've tried to maintain that it shouldn't matter in love it's really starting to sting in the pocket book and in the sense of her being sensitive to my own financial responsibility. 

Also I worry about her ambition, she sees graduation as a finish line, is worried she won't find a job because she doesn't believe her rather robust educational record  will be worth anything due to her low self esteem and a few set backs with internships and her vision of the future seem to hinge on fantasies of marriage, she pours over zodiac and other fate type stuff that points to a happy ending marriage. I am no commitment-phobe but it seems a bit pipe-dream-esque and makes me a little uncomfortable that it is the focus of so much of her daydreams. 

To complicate things we had a condom fail about a year into our relationship and she ended up having a painful and tragic miscarriage about 8 weeks in. Our world's both collapsed for awhile, I did everything to try and support her but the distance did not help. I feel like I had to shelter her and she felt like she couldn't tell anyone else about it. We still have money moments thinking about what that means. It also had the effect of draining what little sexual momentum we had. 

On that subject, she has abuse in her past but has never sought treatment. The end effect is she will only be naked with the lights off, won't let me look or touch her down there with my fingers or mouth. It also can take a very long time for her to relax enough for sex to work otherwise it's very difficult for her to relax and can be very painful for her.  Despite neither of us being models of anatomy I am attracted to her but with so many limitations on sexual exploration are frustrating but I cannot express this in anyway or it ends in tears and her insistence that I'm ""mad"" which scares her. 

Her body image is extremely negative, when I compliment I am instantly met with negation. ""you're pretty"" ; ""No I'm not"" this combined with her stressful work and school schedule have definitely led to her not taking care of her appearance and dismissal of my attempts to improve my own health. It is something I care about her enough to ignore but it is a hindrance in the bedroom on both our parts and while it seems shallow it is always nice to be attracted to your partner. 

This is coming to a head this week as I had been planning a 2 week trip abroad to visit family roots in Europe even before we met. I worked very hard to save and despite the expense/debt I took on for her I was able to go. I'm there now, she was very passive aggressive the entire time and once I  got her, our jet lagged correspondence has been one of jealousy and fear I would be cheating with every hostel goer or trip companion I friended on Facebook. Other than a discovery of a porn search history that included girls from this country,  I've never given her a reason to think I would. I finally had had enough and told her she was wrong to talk to me like that, to imply I am a bad person for spending time with girls (and guys a detail she glosses over) who are not her abroad. The truth is if I didn't have to take on so much of her expenses I would have tried to bring her with me as a surprise but it became impossible after that and I thought better than to mention it as it would seem a disappointment or guilt trip.  Honestly, many girls are beautiful and friendly here but I'm no prize and even if someone were into me I wouldn't think of doing anything. If anything this behavior is the first thing to make me think how nice a relationship with someone more upbeat and independent would be. 

I just don't know. Sometimes I feel like I'm a shallow asshole trying to justify being attracted/fantasizing about beautiful women. Having been only with her it does cross my mind occasionally on a ""wonder what that would be like""  sense but I've never acted on them and even the thoughts leave me feel guilty. These guilty feelings are reinforced by my befriending girls being compared to her cheating/abusive /pedophile father. That finally led me to push back for the first time and tell her she is wrong to talk to me like that and that she draws my imagined transgressions by way of her inability to be happy with herself and therefore unable to believe I'm (or was at least)  happy with her. 

On the other hand, my financial responsibility for her and need to constantly try to help build her ego have me feeling less like a partner and more like a caretaker and that eats away at my satisfaction with the relationship too. 

Am I just being unrealistic that all relationships have issues like this and I need to suck it up and work through it or am I maybe at a point where I need to consider my future independent of hers. 
---

**edit** due to one poster making me realize I'm only airing grievances, she is very kind, she loves me a lot and says it often, she is very giving in some ways sexually when mutual things are not an option. I guess, the biggest thing, she is the first girl to care for me, to want me sexually, to love me, which I think she does deeply. She makes me gifts when she can't afford ones, she is interested in me though we don't share many interests, and laugh together, 1 on 1 she is very caring, it's operating in the larger world where things seem to run into static 

**tl;dr**: girlfriend has asked for a lot, has a lot of issues, I feel like I'm drowning in them and she gets very unhappy and jealous when I am friends with girls particularly people I've met on my solo trip in Europe.  First real relationship and I don't know if I'm wrong or selfish or what. "
2gadmx,23,2014-09-13,Who is KCP?,the8igern,DetroitPistons,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/2gadmx/who_is_kcp/,"The final first round pick of Joe Dumars’ tenure was KCP, selecting him with the eighth overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft.  I will always defend Dumars’ ability to find talent and feel he did a very good job drafting during his time as the GM, Darko being the one glaring exception.  It’s tough to blame him for the Darko pick, EVERYONE liked the pick at the time.  Even Chad Ford has since said, “It was literally the best workout I've ever seen,” speaking of Darko’s workout the day before the draft.  End of short rant defending Joey-D.


Kentavious was not a popular pick at the time.  Everyone had just seen Trey Burke finish an incredible season in which he led Michigan to the NCAA finals.  I was attending Michigan at the time and nobody was more disappointed than I was on draft night.  Dumars made a bold pick passing on the local hero to select an unknown, and it was the right pick.

KCP has all the tools to be a very good SG in the NBA.  He is a long 6’5” with incredibly quick feet, making him a very good on the ball defender.  He also possesses a beautiful jump shot.  With great elevation the ball gracefully rolls off his fingers towards the basket, the only problem was that it didn’t go in very often.

Looking timid almost every time he stepped on the court during his rookie campaign, he shot 40% from the floor, and only 32% from distance.  The worst part about those numbers was that he was rarely asked to create, only shooting when he was wide open.  He also struggled to finish at the rim.  An inside source (a friend of mine who was an intern with the Pistons) told me that following a blown layup in practice Mo Cheeks yelled to KCP, “You’ve blown more layups in two months than I did my whole career!”  Mo was a bad coach and his negativity towards KCP sunk the rookie even further into questioning himself.  Fearfully he would hoist shots every game, and not surprisingly he missed a lot of them.

It may have taken him 81 games but it all turned around when the Pistons headed to OKC to finish their miserable season.  First he hit one three, then another jumper, his confidence growing each time he saw the ball go through the hoop.  Next thing you know he’s spinning to the basket, finishing with a dunk and slapping the backboard with authority on his way to a thirty point explosion!  He carried that momentum through the off-season and looked like a whole new player in the summer league.  Carrying himself with a confidence and competitive fire he had never shown before, he dominated, averaging 24, 7 and 2.  Similar to how Andre dominated the summer competition before his sophomore season.  KCP must be destined for greatness!  Before I get too caught up in any summer circuit performance I have to remind myself that Josh Selby averaged 24, Adam Morrison averaged 20 and 5, and Anthony Randolph averaged an astounding 27 points to go along with 8 boards, 3 blocks, and 2 steals in past summer league play.

So who is KCP?  A great SG who appears to be turning the corner or somebody with all the skills who can never quite put it together?  I’m not going to project KCP’s ceiling, but I think I know his basement.  At worst he is a D and three guy.  His lateral quickness and willingness to compete on the defensive end cannot be taught.  He’s a good defender now, and will only improve.  He’s also a better three point shooter than 32%.  Once he convinces himself he belongs in the NBA his pretty jumper will start to splash through the net, and he will get out of his own head enough to simply finish layups.  His ability to handle the ball is questionable and I’m not sure he’ll ever be able to create offensively, but he has shown exciting flashes.  If all he turns out to be is a good shooter, and even better defender, than he will have been a good pick and valuable part of the team moving forward.  It’s his potential, those moments when he has shown sparks of something more, that make him so exciting.

Please help!",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2garnd/me_22f_with_my_bf_24_m_9months_hes_depressed_and/,"Okay so my boyfriend and I have been dating a little bit over 9 months. Everything was going well. We've hit bumps in the past but were able talk them through. This time it's different and I have no idea what to do.

(Little background info)
We live in IL but he is native to CA. The only reason he lives here was for some army training he had to do and after that was done he kind of just stayed here. Then last December we meet on reddit actually. I met it family in June at his sister's wedding and everyone was so nice. He's met my family and everyone likes him too. I am in my last year of college and currently looking for an internship because my degree requires me to do one before I graduate. He's just working full time and has recently been promoted to manager at his job. He hasn't finished at his community college but plans to next spring he has two classes left.


(Problem)
Recently we discussed what he wanted to do with his future. He was and probably still is confused on what he wants to do. I on the other hand have a set plan on what I want to do and am trying to achieve that goal. I tried helping him figure it out and I know it's not going to take a day to figure it out but it's like he's not motivated. He's more focused on how much he misses his family. He really wants to move back. He said he's going to start saving up and it's going to take a while. I asked what was going to happen when he moved and he just said I don't like long distance relationships. Then I asked if that meant we were over and he said no because he loves me and doesn't want to lose me. He also said he is staying here for me and it's the only reason. I don't want him to choose between me and his family. I know how important family is and if he wants to be with them that's okay. Even if he breaks up with me I'd be okay (after some time) because he'd be leaving me to be happy and not with another girl or some mean reason but for his own good. I told him that and he just says no he's going to stay here and not hurt me by breaking up with me.

(Week later)
He's super sad and depressed. Last night he cried because he missed his family so much. He's texting me while he is at work about how sad and depressed he is and he doesn't know what to do. I tried talking it through with him but I don't think I can help because I'm apart of the problem. I told him he needs someone else who is objective and can help him think things through. No he won't respond and I know he is reading the messages becasue we're on kik (instant messenger app) and it tells you when someone reads the message. I really don't know how to help him.

- BF wants to move back home

2gb0if,2,2014-09-13,My[23F] issues are driving my BF[25M] away. 1 yr relationship.,kiwimango1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gb0if/my23f_issues_are_driving_my_bf25m_away_1_yr/,"I will try my best to keep this brief.

We met at an internship in college. We were friends for a month. Then, I asked him out. We've been dating for a year now.

About my past (bcoz this is important) - I grew up in an abusive household. My father berated and beat my mother and I was subjected to verbal abuse. He died when I was 15 and I was not sad.

I have had 3 boyfriends till now. 2 were lazy fucks who simply wanted sex. The third one cheated on me. So, naturally my history with men is not the best one and I find it difficult to trust them in relationships. I haven't dated anyone in 2 years.

My current boyfriend was a breath of fresh air. He was polite, graceful, sweet and to top it all off, ridiculously good looking.

I'm in college and he has a job. I'm in my last year so its pretty hectic. We'd decided that after I'm done with college, I'd be moving in with him.

Now, I have severe anxiety issues. I was always uncomfortable going out with him to parties/pubs etc. because despite the fact that I was there right next to him, girls would drool all over him. When I was not with him, I was always thinking about what he was doing. I called him up and texted him constantly.

Then one day he sat down and told me he had a problem with this. He said that he was feeling suffocated and that I should trust him more.

I was honestly scared of being dumped. So, I took the logical way. I started investing more time into myself. I got some hobbies, went out more frequently with friends, spent more time with family, etc. But it didn't help me at all. I was still always thinking of him and whether he was with another girl or not.

Now, I'm about to be done with school. So, to ease our moving in process, I began spending more and more time at his place, familiarizing myself with it.

But as we kind of 'lived together' - my clinginess became more and more intense. I wanted sex more and more. I wanted him to spend more time with me cuddling, or watching a movie or whatever. I'd get sad when he was out too late.

In the morning today, I woke up and he was sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. I asked him if anything was wrong. He told me that he thought that we need to slow down. He told me that I was suffocating him and that he needed to spend a little more time alone and with friends (most of whom are girls btw which sucks), and that we should find an apartment for me after graduation instead of moving in with him.

I immediately broke down. He tried comforting me but he had to leave for work.

Now, I'm getting the feeling that he's about to dump me soon. He's been at work and I have spent the majority of the day crying. I know I need to give him space but I just don't know how to do it. Its never been like this in any other relationship, and I do love him a lot.

Unsalvageable situation or not ?

5 years ago I started college in Carlow, studying software dev. I was near the top of my class, jobless, living with the parents and trying to plan a way to come out and transition. 

Year 2: got a job in a decent size retail store, continued with college but dealing with depression and anxiety, spent a lot of time out of class as I went to Dublin a lot. There were no LGBT resources whatsoever in Carlow and I worked weekends. Came out to the parents, said they'd help me, quit the job to focus on college and transition.

As soon as my income dried up, I was dragged from doctor to doctor with an aim to diagnosing me with anything but gender dysphoria. My dad became obsessed with the idea that I was psychotic and threatened to leave me homeless and unable to pay college if I didn't go along with it. Predictably, failed the year.

Repeated and passed second year, barely. Got to third (4 years in) and was at many points suicidal. Finally got to see a doctor in Cork about diagnosis, but my dad demanded to accompany me to every session and would have sat in the damn room glaring if he could. Was still scared of being left homeless and couldn't go job hunting as I was worried sick I'd be fired the moment I began transition. Failed third year. 

Got out of the house, got a job in Dublin, living with grandmother a year on from that. Still not moving forward with transition, making minimum wage working retail. I have a higher cert in software dev but I'm scared to upset the cart now I have a tiny bit of stability.

Recently started anti depressants. Seems to have given me a small motivation boost. Looking to move out on my own, repeat third year for the full degree as an external student. Don't think I can do it on minimum wage, especially in Dublin while paying €144 monthly on meds.

Need to find work either back in Carlow or anywhere the rent is cheap and public transport exists (no car).

I'm sick of worrying about how people will react when I can eventually afford to transition. I'm sick of being looked at like a waster because no one knows the shit I've been through over the last few years and the lack of a portfolio of work due to that.

I intend to get back on my feet and I could use some advice on how to do it. 

I intend to finish my degree, but I can't risk giving anyone the ability to derail my life like my parents did, so I need a stable job with enough pay to rent local to it. I'm also worried about how flatmates might react to me transitioning. Another complication I haven't found a solution to as of yet.

So what am I asking for here? Advice. Leads on work or housing. Internships / entry level jobs in IT? Help? I don't know anymore. 

The job I have is stable, but my grandmother doesn't know I'm trans and my uncle (nearly 40, lives with her, emotional problems) is openly homophobic so I can't stay there, and the local area is simply too expensive to rent while on minimum wage."

Wondering what the hell is going to happen.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2gb9rd/graduating_next_spring_wondering_what_the_hell_is/,"I'm an Electrical engineering major graduating next spring, and I currently have no idea what I'm going to do with myself when I get there. I never landed an internship in the past three summers, and I have anxiety problems especially when it comes to looking for jobs. 

What if I don't find a job before I graduate? What if I don't for a month, two months, or longer?

What if when I do find a job, I absolutely hate it and grow increasingly tired of going everyday and become more depressed? (An issue I have every now and then...) The last time I felt like this was when I had to pick a college to go to, but this is so much scarier.

I know myself too well. I don't deal well with anxiety and stress like this. Pretty much the only consolation in all of this is that I *should* get a job. Its a good area to be in for finding jobs.

And then there's the fact that I don't even really know how much I like certain aspects of my major. I like digital stuff more than analog, and I feel like I should have chosen Computer Engineering but its too late now.

This is another hurdle in my life that I need to make it over, and its the biggest one I've ever had to face."

So... heres my story.",ChalupaBatman_710,DysfunctionalFamily,https://www.reddit.com/r/DysfunctionalFamily/comments/2gbcae/found_somewhere_to_vent_and_i_found_it_so_heres/,"(This might take me awhile so I'll keep editing as I get a chance. I dont really care if anyone reads this, but I just need to get this off my chest.)

*Disclosure*

My sister and I arent perfect angels, and i realize this. Weve each had 1 major fuck up in life. 
however, i do feel like we are incredibly unappreciated and ignored in this household.
I was in legal trouble with the police for marijuana possession, it was almost a felony charge because it was hash (this happened 3 years ago this october), and she left UCSC because she couldnt handle college life that young, about... 5 years ago.

**Background**

I have one older sister(24), im 21, a younger sister (9), and a younger brother(7). Well name them in order, 1/3/4 lol


3&amp;4 are my half siblings. My mother divorced my dad when i was like 3, and he was a part of our lives for awhile, that is until i got into high school his appearances started wearing thin. My mom was a single mom, being an RN and taking care of 1 and I while she worked ridiculous hours. then she met a doctor at the hospital She works out. We'll call him SD for stepdad. Well, he is incredibly old fashioned. He grew up in the slums of mexico, raised by old mexican parents, worked his ass off to get perfect grades, got his way into UCSC on scholarships, then eventually into Standford to get his Doctorate, all on his own. Hell of an accomplishment. Hes doing incredibly well, obviously. Privately employed, taking care of his parents, this big ass family, the usual success story.

 My mom has been a stay at home mom for 10 years, living lavishly like the rest of us. Seems like everything would be swell right? yeah. thats what i thought too. 3&amp;4 are his kids. I cant even find a place to start with this.. 
I take care of them like theyre my own, 1 does as well. On top of taking care of them really often (I mean like 5/7 days) im going to school full time (community college, one of the best in the state, transferring in one semester) and I work full time at a hotel as well. 1 has 2 jobs, is finishing up school for her BA, and is doing a full time internship at some accounting firm working for her dream job. 

Apparently, this isnt enough for them. 1 &amp; I are constantly being scolded and belittled for ""being lazy"" or ""not focusing on school"" or ""not doing our chores around the house"" (just a sample of ex.). Let me elaborate a bit..

We're lazy - If we get up any later than 8am, whether its a weekend or not, were lazy. we worked 12 hours since being up at 5am and want to take a nap? were not allowed because thats being lazy. Watching tv after a long day of school because we just want to relax? Lazy. 

Not focusing on school - Whenever we decide to go out, which is not as often as the usual 21/24 yo, were not focused on our future and get reamed for it. We are terrible students in their eyes, terrible babysitters, spoiled rotten brats, and selfish ungrateful little shits. (their words)
We have a curfew of 1am(if we get lucky) but usually its midnight. again, were 21 and 24. full time workers/students

btw when i say scolded, reamed, belittled, its a fight. every time. ends up in constant yelling from their side while we just sit there(most of the time, we do get fed up and defend ourselves, but theres no point anymore.

Not doing chores - I live at home, fine, i get i have shit around the house to do in order to help out. But when something isnt done THEIR way, or not on THEIR schedule, i get yelled at. We have 2 dogs, which of course 3&amp;4 wanted, but who has to take care of their big golden retriever asses? we do. I love our dogs to no end. But I dont want to walk them after a 10 hr shift and getting home at midnight. or before i work at 7, meaning i have to wake up at 430 to do it (they make 1 and I walk them for a MIN of 30 minutes. theyll time us, and if its short, we get yelled at.) Meanwhile, they never make an effort to take care of the dogs, EVER. They cant be bothered to ever walk them, its never their responsibility, its ours because ""We need to learn how to be responsible"" or some bullshit like that. I dont really listen anymore, im passed that point.

Theyve recently started getting friends, because of my brothers club soccer team. So they host parties with the team and parents and everyone has a good time. Guess who has the privilege of setting up and cleaning up after these parties? 1 and I. if were not working. 

Lets go to the latest fight that happened. I use my dads 32"" lcd tv in my room for various things. Music production, hw, just plain old watching tv. 

He gets mad that I use it because its his and he wants it back even though it sits in a corner upstairs unused. 
Well he recently went into my room, to take it from me and give to my 7 year old brother because ""its his and he can do whatever the fuck he wants with it"". 
But the reason this is even more ridiculous, is because they always told me I wasnt allowed to have a TV in my room. Never. Even when I had started using it, they had been fighting me constantly on it, trying to take it away and put it back in the corner to continue being unused.
So this started a big fight, and i gave up. I didnt want to fight anymore. Im just gonna buy my own, and thats that.

this is all i can muster up atm, but ill be updating as i get chance through work today.

OH! one last thing before i go. SD is incredibly verbally abusive.
Every day, I hear how lazy I am, how useless I am, and how much of a druggie stoner I am. Ill probably never amount to anything, and hes like Red Foreman in a sense, where im called a dumbass every day. multiple times a day. Except theres no live studio audience to laugh.

He constantly belittles us, and gets mad when we cant do something for them. He even tells my little brother every day, ""dont grow up to like 'El Poopies' "" . Thats my newest nickname. ( of course he likes to think its a joke). That mean The Shit basically. So my brother is growing up in a house where im the perfect example of what NOT to be. And that fucking hurts.... but. i cant really do much about it. 

My mom used to defend us.. but.. not anymore. She agrees with him in almost every aspect. 

So im just writing this to get some weight off my shoulders.. My gf is wonderful and supportive, but.. i dont want to burden her with all my whining and crying. Im fixing to move out of here and in with her.

But i guess what im trying to ask is, does it sound like maybe im unreasonable and i am selfish and i need to start doing more for them? in a recent fight, they told us verbatim that for everything they have given us, we are in debt to them. That we owe them and when we have a career and money, we need to come back to this house and take care of them like SD did with his parents. 

so.. yeah. am i wrong? im not sure.. if you actually read this novel, thank you. youre wonderful, and any insight would be appreciated, so long as you say it nicely.. lol

have a good day reddit. thanks for reading."
2gbiiz,0,2014-09-13,Graduating in a year and I'm concerned about employment!,[deleted],ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/2gbiiz/graduating_in_a_year_and_im_concerned_about/,"I will be graduating from college in a little over a year and I'm getting more and more stressed about finding employment. I was unsuccessful at getting an internship during the past 3 years in college. During the first two summers, I wasn't even sure I wanted to continue engineering so I didn't bother looking but once I got into the ""meat"" of chemical engineering, I realized I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed thermodynamics and safety courses and I think that having professors who were excited to be teaching really made a difference!

Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the career fair my school hosts because I have two exams in my non-chemical engineering courses during that time frame and neither of them will allow me to make them up at a later date. 

Are there any tips for finding an internship or job? I have a 3.08 GPA which is making it a little tougher to get interviews. I've attempted applying online to many companies but I feel like I'm getting lost in the sea of other students looking for internships as well.

Thanks for any input you may have!"
2gbngg,6,2014-09-13,Scared to Apply for Java Co-op?,ThatGuyqwq,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/2gbngg/scared_to_apply_for_java_coop/,"Hi,

I am a third year CIS (Computer Information Systems) student and I want to start applying for a co-op (or as some of you know it as an internship). There is an excellent co-op right now in Canada with a government organization and I'll be developing a java application.

A little about me - I care a lot about my grades and carry a 3.99 GPA (on a 4.33 scale). I work very hard in school because I come from a poor family; I don't like spending money on tuition and seeing my grades flunk. I also like to program. I have received an A+ in every single programming course that I have taken so far. I also help my peers with programming if they need it. I have developed two personal applications on my own time for myself and I consider them complex and well written because they're multi-threaded, have a GUI, following design principles such as MVC, etc.

This will be my first programming job if I decide to apply for it. My problem is I am very worried that I won't fit in, in the sense that my programming skills aren't good, I won't grasp concepts in a timely manner and will fall behind on my work, and the possibility of being fired because they see me as I simply can't program. I'm also worried that they'll look at my code and dislike that I don't follow certain principles. For example, I rarely create and use interfaces and abstract classes for my own projects. One last thing I'm worried about is that I feel like I will struggle on their programming questions during an interview (this is how I feel too on exams but I end up usually doing fine). For example if they ask me to explain what a class and an object is, I'm afraid that the definitions that I learned in school will slip out of my mind and I'll end up giving them broad definitions.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do here? When I'm coding at home for assignments, I usually sit down and think for 10 minutes and come up with a way to solve the problem I am working on. I have been able to solve almost every problem I came across with, and problems that I haven't been able to solve, I received help off of stackexchange and understood what they're saying. Basically what I'm trying to get at is I'm not confident in my skills because I'm leaving my comfort zone of having teachers beside me if I need the aide and going to the real-world where I don't know if my co-workers will be helping me or will discipline me for bad code (if I do write bad code, that I don't know since I usually keep code to myself or within friends).

tl;dr - I want to apply for a co-op but I am worried that they will see me at a bad programmer and will end up firing me. In other words, I am not confident in my programming skills even though I received really good grades.

2gcsxn,3,2014-09-14,Me [22 M] with my housemate [20 M],mindstormer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gcsxn/me_22_m_with_my_housemate_20_m/,"Last spring I signed a lease to live with A (my gf), B (another male student who I had previously been friends with), C (a female student who I'd lived in a dorm with for 3 years), and D (platonic male friend of gf and C).

About 2 weeks after that, B broke into A's room, broke into her computer, and stole computer science homework which he then submitted.  He got away scott free - slap on the wrist.  At this point I lost all trust for him as a person, but still occaisionally spoke/hung out with him and others.
~4 weeks ago, I got messages from housemates that B had been bringing back friends late (3am or later) to the house drunk, and then they would make messes/be loud/etc.  

~3 weeks ago, I was coming home from my internship when I got a phone call from A (my gf) who said that the night before B had come home 3am drunk with another friend, who had passed out on B's bed after they had woken up other roommates and spilled drinks on the living room floor (again).  B then went into my gf's room and got into bed with her.  She eventually got up and went to the living room to sleep on the couch (and found the messes).  I was devastated and immediately began to feel that he should leave the house.  

When I got back, we had a house meeting, where the other house members talked about setting rules about bringing multiple people over - 1) ask every other housemate min 2 days before for permission, 1 veto means you can't do it 2) responsible for cleanups before going to bed.  Afterwords I had a short personal discussion with B where I suggested he should find a subletter, said that it was awful that my gf now locks her door at night so something doesn't happen again.  I was visibly livid.  I wanted to hurt him frankly - fantasized about pushing him down the stairs.  In general he has led a very good life - extremely affluent international student, gives the impression that he's never worked a hard day in his life, always gets off with slaps on the wrist with no real consequences.  I really just wanted him to have some consequences.  

Last week, C asked us to have a party for a student group that she and D are in (last night).  I said I'd have to think about it and that it seemed contradictory to lay down the law on B and then go right ahead and do this.  A few days later, she asked me again and I said reluctantly yes, after she told me that they wouldn't be too late and it wouldn't be very loud.  After I said yes, then she said she would kick everyone out at 3am. I said that 3am is too late, but accepted that I had just said yes, knowing that I would probably regret it.  

People just left from the party, it was extremely loud, I sat in my room trying to do homework and took it until about 2:30 when I messaged C saying that it's extremely loud, and I would really like for it to wind down/people to leave so I could sleep.  C became defensive, at which point I pointed out the hypocrisy of not letting B bring people late to avoid noise and mess.  

Then I walked outside my room and there is B bringing people up the stairs (no one was to be beyond the first floor).  He didn't ask anyone.  I started to get angry.  I asked him if he remembered the conversation we had at the house meeting, and he pretended not to remember.  I sheparded them down from the third floor.  

At 3:10 I went downstairs to ask C to get people to leave.  People were leaving at that point.  Then I saw B in the doorway and got irrationally mad and went after him physically.  I pushed him up against the wall/door and held him there for ~10sec until someone separated us.  C was standing beside him and in the shuffle got pushed into the wall - totally my fault.  She may have bruised her back.

I regretted it immediately and just stood there.  I just blew up - I never really got over him getting into bed with my gf and it just exploded with the stress of the night.  I was still mad, and B and I ended up talking.  I told him that I went after him because of the incident with my GF.  We talked for about 45 min, I hate him, he hates his life/living in a house with me, he tried to get someone else on the lease after he had stolen coursework from my gf, I still want him to move out, I told him that I feel he's never experienced any real consequences for anything, losing the privelege of having people over was supposed to be the consequence but he just flouted it.  He was talking very rationally, saying that he is always willing to talk problems out, he did not defend himself for getting into bed with my gf or flouting the rules we set forth about bringing people over, he said he wants to move out and sublet his room but he's not willing to take a financial loss, I said that he should be willing to take a loss because that's a fair consequence.  The end of the conversation was just an agreement to ignore each other and pretend we don't exist, which from my perspective is just maintaining the status quo - still no real consequence for him.  He said that if it got physical again he would call the police since it's assault (which I realize).  

I'm thinking that I may have to move out of the house.  I called A and she just doesn't understand yet - she was not home tonight.  B and I have a clearer understanding of each other but that doesn't mean the tension is gone.  C may be hurt and I feel absolutely awful about that - I'm frankly a terrible person, not that I try to be, but I am right now - just demonstrated it.  D is neutral but on C's side.  

---   
**tl;dr**: I blew up on a housemate who had been piling straws on the wagon and then tipped it over tonight.  I need to calm down.  I immediately regretted it and I am feeling very ashamed right now.  Should I move out of the house or just try to fade into the wall for the rest of the year?"

2ge7bq,1,2014-09-14,I'm a massive fuck-up [WOT],[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2ge7bq/im_a_massive_fuckup_wot/,"I've had arguments with my (ex)gf just like anyone else in a relationship. Sometimes though you get pushed to your limit and do things you never thought you would do. I'm a bad person. Don't deserve anything. I hate myself.

I guess like a lot of explosive arguments, there's a smaller flash that sets off the bomb. She had missed her bc the night before because we were at a friend's birthday party and she forgot to bring it with her, so she doubled up the next day. I'm not one to blame shit on a girl's period or her hormones, but I'm sure it was a contributing factor. Because she had doubled up, she wasn't feeling that great and wanted to get some sleep before we headed out again. I drank a little (way to go, me) and got annoying. I'll admit I shouldn't have been roughhousing with her while she was trying to get some rest. She told me to fuck off with the rowdiness, so I just got out of bed and went to sit on the couch so she could rest in peace. Apparently I was supposed to cuddle with her, and I got shit for that too. Then she demands that I bring her something from the kitchen. I'm happy to do things for someone if they ask, but treating me like a dog (at least from my perspective. she probably just lost patience because of how she was feeling and it didnt come out right) will get you nowhere.

I guess this is where it got ridiculous. Now she yells at me for not contributing enough in the relationship. She says she puts more into it than I do. I won't deny it. I have a job that consumes my entire weekend, an internship in a lab, and am taking classes full-time. There's never a day that I'm not doing something. Because of this, I'm perpetually tired. She was super kind and offered me her place to sleep, we bought groceries together, she cooked the meals, I washed the dishes, but she would have the time and resources to contribute things to the relationship that I didn't. She doesn't have to work and her parents pay for her apartment. She would pack lunches for me and she even did my laundry once. I was so appreciative of those acts of love and kindness and told her as much, but to her at this point in time, saying thank you wasn't enough. I get upset and try to explain (ie yell over her yelling) that favors and these things shouldn't be used as currency, and if she wanted me to contribute more, than leave it at that and don't bring up what you've done as though you've bought the right to force me to commit more of what I dont have to the relationship. She starts screaming at me and crying at the same time. She doesn't understand what I'm trying to tell her. I try to listen to her side and maintain as objective a stance as I can, but it's no good. She simply can't empathize with me at all and starts this crying, verbal assault on me. She won't let me leave. I snap and start mocking her (super healthy, I know. very grown up, morethanastumble. you're a real man now.) and sarcastically wiping away her tears as a way to ""contribute"" to the relationship. Bring on the hate. I deserve it.

When she gets really upset, she hits me. Claws at me, pulls hair, throws food (and punches), etc. I can take it. Not the first time someone's hit me and won't be the last. I mean, I grew up being hit. I know it's fucked, and I strive to not be like my dad was. This is why I'm pretty upset with myself. Every time she would throw these tantrums in the past, I would just take it. She prevented me from leaving several times before when she would go on these tirades and I just wanted to go. What am I going to do? Lay my hands on her? I've never laid hands on a woman before. I grew up knowing that's extremely fucked and you've got problems if you do. But this time, she digs her nails into my face and stares me down with this intense rage and I just snap. See red. I put my hand up to her neck and squeeze. It lasted for a half-second. I'm so ashamed of myself. I immediately recognize I've made a mistake and apologize. But the damage is done. She tells me to leave and I do. ""We're done."" I go home, get drunk, and now I'm here the next day, alone and missing the relationship I had and feeling awful about myself. Haven't been this low in a long time.

Those of you reading might not understand why I stayed with her. If it weren't for staying with her, I would have to commute to school a lot more. Bare minimum commute time is 45 minutes. That's assuming there's no traffic on 95. The money I saved on gas was amazing and I was able to put that towards groceries and meals with her. I guess it's somewhat telling that's the first example I came up with as to why I stayed with her, but there's more to it. When she's not like this, she's very affectionate, loving, and supportive. She's helped me to really focus on my grades and it's because of her influence that I was able to balance all these things I have going on in my life and get straight A's. She's made me into a better person in some aspects. 

Because I'm always doing something, I have no friends. The last 2 folks I called friends became pill addicts and began to siphon money off me. That's a different story. They were the only people who didn't judge me and were always available and supportive and down to hang out. Under the addiction, they were good people, but it ended up swallowing them and I no longer recognized who it was that I was seeing. I have no one to talk to about this. How do I bring up what I did in conversation in a way that I can feel safe? I'm just alone in this. Hate myself, what I did, and miss a relationship that I probably shouldn't be missing.

What do I do now?"
2ge8iz,21,2014-09-14,"FR: Broke frame, male hamstered then betafied myself. Lessons learned from my most recent meltdown.",[deleted],TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2ge8iz/fr_broke_frame_male_hamstered_then_betafied/,"TL:DR We dated for about 3 months. I developed onitis for her, even though she wasn't worth the LTR. Made BIG mistakes (hamserting myself, thought NAWALT, stopped internalizing TRP principles.) Learned valuable lessons.

So, I have been dating a girl for a good part of the summer. Her SMV was higher than my own. She is one of the top fencers in the country and attends a very prestigious university located in my city. I am just a resident of that city. I work full time and go to school part time and do not have much of a social life aside from that. We met because she was an intern at my company over the summer. She fell for me because I'm older than her (i'm 25, she's 20) and had just enough TRP principles to fool her into thinking I was alpha.

For about a month or 2 we had a nice thing going. Spent 4-5 nights together every week. Had plentiful amounts of great sex. Went on fun adventures. I was feeling very alpha about myself from the fact that I had this chick wrapped around my finger. Once or twice a week, post sex, she would hit me with the classic shit test ""When are we going to take this relationship to the next level?"" and I would deflect by telling her to stop being so impatient, she needs to prove her loyalty to me, that I wanted to see how things would be between us when the school year resumed and that it would be worth the wait.

3 weeks ago is when shit really hit the fan. She was getting very impatient and the shit test was coming more frequently. Post sex she asked ""Is there any other reason that you don't want me to be your girlfriend?"" and this is the moment everything blew up in my face. I was HONEST with her. I told her that I wasn't comfortable with her partner count (9) and that I still wanted to raise mine (6). She did not like that, not one bit.

I went home that night and was pretty bummed out that I was gonna lose this girl. I was telling myself stuff like:

""She has the most SMV out of any girl I had been with!""
""Sure her partner count is a little high, but the pussy is still cash. she isn't a slut she is just adventerous!""
""I need to keep this girl in my life because her high SMV will raise my SMV""

I actually consulted askTRP (you can still read the post if you wish) and was given varying degrees of advice. I ignored the good advice and went with the advice I wanted to hear. I went back to this girl and apologized to her, I told her I wanted her badly and that I changed my mind about wanting to be in a relationship with her. I told her I wanted to keep her in my life.

And that was the start of my betafication. It carried on over the past 3 weeks. We only had sex 3 times since that meltdown. Each time she was barely into it. I could tell she wasn't attracted to me anymore. I could see RP truths unfolding before my eyes. I was still thinking that she might come around and that NAWALT but I was mistaken. She actually told me that she knew she should be attracted to me and that I was being such a nice guy for putting effort into salvaging the relationship, but she just didn't feel the same way about me as she once did. (RP truth confirmed)

So I knew I was getting betafied but was still hanging around, trying to figure out what my best move would be. But yesterday morning she told me a story that enlightened me to her true nature and gave me the resolve to cut her loose... 

At the beginning of the summer she had gone on a backpacking trip to Bolivia, which I knew about but what I didn't know is that she had gone with her ex-bf from back home and that the trip ended badly for both of them. One night they went out to a club. She told her ex that she was going to dance with other guys and he said that ok. She was dancing with a guy and when the dance ended the guy starts kissing her. She was drunk and kissed him back. Her ex sees them kissing. He justifiably gets pissed. He wouldn't listen to any of her excuses and the next day he flies back to the states, leaving her in Bolivia to finish up the last 2 weeks of the trip solo.

I still don't even know why she told me this but I am glad she did. Really puts my mind at ease for doing what I did next. It also completely removed her from the pedestal I had her on and made me realize she is just a slut, she isn't loyal and since this had only happened about 2 weeks before she met me, I was most likely just a rebound to her.

So I went over to her place last night hoping to get 1 last fuck in. No dice. I went to bed with blue balls. When she was trying to sleep I refused to let her cuddle with me. I would roll away from her when she tried to put her arm around me. At 7am she asked me to get into the spoon position and hold her.

""No, I don't want to"" I said.
""Really?"" she said.
""Yes really. I'm not going to be your cuddle bitch anymore. This relationship has become very unsatisfying for me. I am going to start dating other girls."" I said
""That's very insulting to say while you are still in bed with me."" she said
""fine, I won't be in bed anymore."" I said. Then I got my shit and left.

And that's that. She might try and contact me in the future to resolve things more concretely or for a hookup but I am not hopeful. It sucks having to start back from scratch but i learned some great lessons:

1) **NEVER MAKE WOMEN YOUR MAIN FOCUS**
I spent way too much time on this girl only to get burned in the end. She was only good for having fun and pumping. I focused a lot of time on her but I was also thinking about all the other plates I could be spinning. I got lucky and snagged a high SMV girl I had no rights too and fucked it all up because I made pussy the focus. Her pussy and all the strange that's out there. There is practically an unlimited amount of pussy out there but you only have a limited amount of time. FOCUS THAT TIME ON YOUR GOALS! If I didn't pedestal her and then fuck it up by also pedestalling all the other pussy that I don't even have then I might still have her as a pump. I need to focus on myself first, second, third and women... 7th.

2)**AWALT**
thought that since this girl was a STEM major she could be rational. I thought her fireyness and strong will made her a better girl than most. I thought that her intense motivation would help to be a motivation to me. In the end I learned she is just like every other girl out there.

3) **HOLD FRAME**
I blew it in one of the worst ways possible. I blew frame so hard I became a super beta for the next 3 weeks, trying to make up for my colossal frame blowing. I should have seen the signs much sooner that she wasn't worth the LTR. She had so much going on in her life that she would have never have depended on me. Her count was already too high and I hamstered myself into thinking she was the best I could get.

Those are the main ones I can think of right now. As you can see, I still have a long way to go. Writing out this FR was theraputic (for me at least) Comments and advice are welcome. Also, as a side note, I think it would be nice if we had some more FR success stories.

My dad's family use to live in a port city in México. My paternal grandfather was a ship captain and he worked in the US for a while. When my dad graduated from high school, he decided to move to Mexico city and get a degree in law. One of my grandfather's friend from the US gave him the business card of a lawyer he met in Mexico city and told him that my dad should pay him a visit, maybe he could work for him. The first 3 years of college my dad was living with some relatives and forgot about that lawyer until he had to move out of his aunt's house. When he was packing his stuff he found the business card and decided to contact the lawyer, since he now needed a job.

Instead of calling him first, my dad just showed up in his office. In that exact moment, the lawyer was having an argument with their intern and the intern resigned. My dad got the job immediatly. He and the lawyer became very close and he told my dad that he wanted to introduce him to his oldest daughter so he invited him to dinner that night. My dad showed up at their place but the oldest daughter was still getting ready so the middle daughter - my mom-  went to open the door for him. And it was love at first sight. They got married 4 years later.

They planned on having only 2 kids. My mom got pregnant the first year of marriage but she had a miscarriage. A year later they had my sister and - im not sure why - her doctor told her that it was going to be difficult for her to get pregnant again. 3 years later my mom got pregnant with me. I was born premature, facing upwards and with the cord around my neck but healthy haha. 

What if he never found the card again? Or what if the previous intern didnt resign? I find it so interesting how a little detail could have changed everything.

2gej04,3,2014-09-14,Me [17M] noticed a change in my relationship with my [17F] whatever you want to call it now. I am sad.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gej04/me_17m_noticed_a_change_in_my_relationship_with/,"This is my senior year of high school, didn't expect to find a girlfriend this late in my HS career but a certain girl caught my eye. A little back story, her and I were always friends of friends and talked on occasion. I always thought she was cute and stuff, though she got out of a relationship during the summer (A yearish long?). So the first week of school comes around and her friends and herself always come to our table and hang out. Thought nothing of it, then she asked me why I don't talk to her anymore (Lost her number) so she gave me her number and I texted her that day. Talked about usual stuff, got to know her, she got to know me. 

I asked her out a week or so (not a date, but a date movie sort of thing). She said no, and texts me the next day saying she wants to go on that date (she had doubt before the first date I guess).

Fast forward 3 weeks, we are on a flirting basis, she loves talking to me and tells her friends she might be falling for me. I draw random things for her and she loves them, shows them off to her friends and all that jazz. Then we get each other small things, like I get her coffee in the morning and stuff. 

Moving on, I got an internship at my local paper to record local games and show the highlights (looked good on college apps so I took it), and she is on the dance line for our school. Her and her friends were shouting at me during the game to get my attention and we chatted on and off and she invited me to this restaurant with her friends and family because she is always busy (straight a student, forced to do extracurricular by parents). So we are having a great time at the place and all of our friends want us to hug or something, we ignored it due to it being awkward. It was around 12am when we left and I drove everyone home and she texted me saying if I still wanted that hug, she then said I could come over and get it. So what do I do? I go and get it. She means a lot to me and she knows how I am, or at least I think. So I get to her house (we talked about the first kiss prior and she said being spontaneous would make it most memorable, so what better than this?) she sneaks outside and we hold eachother for like 20 minutes. We had our first kiss that night, made out, and were in complete joy. She said she loved being in my arms.  --- But the monday after she got different (really stressed out) I got worried and asked her and she said not to worry about it so I didn't but still tried to comfort her.

She got back to her usual ways but didnt really flirt back. So I asked her last night (Week after the kiss) and I said (entire convo):

Me: Do you see me as I see you? It's obvious how I feel about you, but you barely express anything yourself.  I don't expect a kiss, or a hug, but if you like me then show it. 

Me: All I want to know is how you feel.

Her: I dont know

Me: Ok

Me: When i flirt with you, tell you how I feel, and do those small doodles that make you so happy, how does that stuff make you feel?

Her: I'm confused about a bunch of stuff in my life right now, but I guess those things make me feel special.

(I promised her I would never get mad at her, so I stuck true to my word)

Me: I'm just gonna drop it. You know where I am, how I feel, and that I would never hurt you. I want you to be happy no matter what, it's your call.

Her: I have to get up early again so I'm gonna sleep.

(About 5 minutes later, didn't know what to say without sounding like an asshole so I avoided it)

Me: Goodnight E-----(censoring cause you know)

Her: Goodnight T----(Just our names, keeping confidentiality.)

So what do I think of that? I've been sad, but happy she didn't say she didn't like me. Everyone thinks we are close but I feel like she's scared to be hurt again. I'm upset that it might be a trust thing. I don't know what to think, I left out some stuff but you got the gist. I need help, I am sad and confused.


---   
**tl;dr**: Girl meets boy, boy likes girl, boy makes girl happy and feel special, girl then likes boy. After first kiss things got different with her and she is confused. I asked her what she felt about me about a week later and she said she doesn't know. Feelings are there, she told me how she felt before, but I think she might be scared to get hurt in a relationship. "
2gezp2,7,2014-09-14,Advice for a freshman interested in Computer Engineering,Magnimous,SJSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SJSU/comments/2gezp2/advice_for_a_freshman_interested_in_computer/,"In high school, I did not have direction in where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do, at all. I wasn't aware of the opportunities I had in my school and city and so many cool internship opportunities flew out the window. I'm not trying to set my next 4-5 years in stone, but I do want to make an overall plan to become a good computer engineer.

Something I think would be helpful would be joining an engineering club. On the club website, I've seen at least 3 engineering clubs and so I'm not sure how I should pick among them. I had class on the day of the club fair so I couldn't check anything out. If you are part of one of the clubs and have info about that, I would really appreciate you sharing it! 

As for internships, I would ideally like to start getting experience either next semester or in the summer (what do most engineers do?). I was planning to go to the Career Center soon to work on my resume; although I have almost no experience related to engineering (and I can't take ENGR 10 until next semester), I plan to check out the 
Engineering &amp; Science Job/Internship Fair on the 23rd. What should I be doing at the fair? Because of my lack of experience, I doubt I have a shot, but this could be practice for the next job/internship fair.
And when looking into internships with smaller and larger companies, what are things I should keep in mind as well as pros and cons?

I plan to meet with an Academic advisor this week to plan out what courses I should be taking. If you have two cents on what years you took which classes and how you spread out your major courses and GE courses I would appreciate that!"
2gfaej,1,2014-09-14,Relationship advice needed. With everyone not just one person,throwawaydingding1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gfaej/relationship_advice_needed_with_everyone_not_just/,"[Edit - I'm 33 Male]

I have a feeling that this will be a long post and maybe all over the place. Not even sure whats the best place to post this.


I feel like my life is a bit of a mess right now. Career wise I'm defnitely not where I want to be. I'm working as an Accountant and making less than pretty much all my friends. (I mentioned this to someone on Reddit in Texas who said that's a phenomenal salary so perhaps the value of money is different in Canada?). I have people at work 5-10 years younger than me making the same amount of money. Last year my brother who is TEN years younger than me, on an internship (not even out of university yet) started making the same amount of money I do. I've been fired from SEVEN contract jobs between 2010 and 2012. I have no real idea why, they never explained why. I can make odd guesses here or there but nothing that would warrant this level of career disaster.


But the much bigger issue I have is my relationships. I feel that people dont really respect me much. I have 4 siblings of which 3 I have an on again off again relationship with, because I feel they dont act appropriately with me. All are younger than me, 6-12 years younger. At work I had lunch buddies for a while but then over lunch it used to get exhausting being made fun of all the time. I dont really have many close friends. The few that I have, some are married with kids so although I know they're 'there' for me when I need them they're not ones I hang out with except on rare occasions. My relationships with women are fairly abysmal. I've only had one girlfriend. She was great for 3 mths and for the rest of the 2 year relationship she was an absolute bitch. Used to insult me, fight with me regularly, used to say you're such a loser look at your grades etc. Basically a horrible person, but she didnt behave that way with others, so although I believe she was actually a bad person, it was in some way a reflection of me as well. Or rather something about me made her think she could behave that way. At the moment I hook up with a woman about once a year. Pretty pathetic.


What are things within me that could be causing this? In university (ended 9 years ago) and even after I was the 'nice guy' at least in my mind. I was always trying to be nice to everyone to get them to like me. Interestingly enough I dont think most people thought of me that way, which is kind of a mystery. I was told once in a while I'm a bit mean. I get that now as well. Now I dont make as much of an effort to be a 'nice guy' as I used to, but I actually still think I'm a genuinely good guy. But to be honest I really wonder if these even have anything to do with anything. I'm pretty sure the coworkers I have couldnt care less whether I'm a good guy or not. They basically go after me because they feel comfortable doing so for some reason. (not all of them of course, some of them).


One of the things thats started bothering me recently is the idea of marriage. I dont want to remain a bachelor forever, I do want to settle down some day. But I definitely dont feel ready for taht now. I even have trouble with phone contracts. But being with one person for the rest of my life?? Hoo boy. Also given my past relationship, which started off wonderfully but then became an absolute nightmare, it kinda concerns me. What happens if I end up with someone who, you know, doesnt make me feel awesome most of the time, who I end up feeling uncomfortable with? I'm also a bit concerned about finding said person attractive after a year or two. I'd hate to be married to one person while not being attracted to them anymore. For things like sex to be a chore rather than a desire. Right now the rare times that I do get some its exciting because I have to kinda work for it, run some game so to speak, there's that uncertainty.


I've read a number of self-help books over the years but havent really gotten anything out of them. To be fair I've never finished the majority of them. But thats because, although I never make a conscious decision to give up on them, however much I read I dont really see the value in it. Dale Carnegie's book I guess would be an obvious one but as i said above I dont think my being a 'nice guy' is really at the root of all this, although, again, I have indeed been told that I'm mean sometimes. I actually wish I could have someone following me around for a day and then give me feedback on what things are right/wrong, that would be the most helpful. Reading things out of a book, there's no real system of feedback. I've asked friends a number of times, have never gotten anything solid out of them.


I havent really considered a therapist seriously, but I've seen a number of posts in /r/relationships recommending that to others. I've seen a few over the years but never got anything out of them. The first time was back in 9th grade. Absolutely useless. Saw one in university. Again, useless. Saw one in 2009. This one was actually recommended by a friend, said he had helped her out a bit. Absolutely useless. So not quite sure what to do with that. Actually that's something I'm a bit concerned about as well. As I said above I've read a number of self-help books / programs (highly recommeneded by others of course) and found no vlaue in them, been to therapists, had 'coaching' (at $100/hour), no value, been to a number of Tony Robbins seminars, no real lasting value, while others get much out of them. Wtf??


I'm hoping someone can help with something there. Would be grateful for any suggestions on how to go about fixing my life.

Thanks!

I used to be your neighbor, room 8… To be honest, I meant to tell you this in person but I always felt that I annoyed you when I tried to talk to you. So I guess this way,  if you find this message annoying, you can just ignore it.

So here it goes: 

In my room, I left a can of  gravy (to prepare a traditional dish, you could find the recipe here – by the way, it’s pretty good and super easy to make), a white box with an alcoholic drink inside (I’m not quite sure what type, it was a gift from work) and some paper towels– you can find them as you enter, on the shelves on the left. I wasn’t able to take them with me because of luggage restrictions. They will be wasted and thrown away if the next tenant finds them there and I was thinking that perhaps they might be useful to you in some way.  I think the door will be unlocked until the next person moves in, so you can just walk in to take them if you see any use for them. 

Ok…well…this is pretty much what I wanted to say.

I wish you best of luck with the rest of your internship and your master thesis.

Take care, 
*her name*

PS: You might wonder/be freaked out by the fact that I know your name, so here is the full disclosure:

I know your last name because I would see it on the mailbox right next to mine every time I would pick up my mail, and I know your first name because you mentioned it at some point. So this is how I was able to find you...I usually don’t use facebook, but I guess it was my only option in this case. 

Ok… now I officially feel creepy and embarrassed so I’m just going to go hide in a transatlantic plane for the next seven hours.

2gfr2s,5,2014-09-15,I rely too much on my husband. I'm afraid.,anxiety0809,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2gfr2s/i_rely_too_much_on_my_husband_im_afraid/,"Hello. I am using a throwaway because I don't want people in the subreddits I frequent to look at my post history and think bad of me.

I am currently 23 years old, and I am married to an amazing man. The problem is...he does too much for me. 

See, I didn't grow up in the best of situations. My dad worked in a jail and I guess his work made him really angry. My mom was also super judgmental of me and the fact that I was fat and didn't have any friends. 

When I was sixteen I met a guy who was 20 years older than me on an MMORPG (online multiplayer game). We talked a lot, I sent him pictures of me, we'd tell each other sexy things on the phone...I even met up with him once. For the first time in my life I felt like someone really cared about me. That ended when I was 17 because he ""couldn't do it anymore"". I was heartbroken. He was supposed to let me move in with him when I was 18, so I could escape my family. 

Shortly after that, I met my now current husband online. He's only a year older than me, and I talked to him about everything. My parents wouldn't let me go on a date with him though because he wasn't from our culture, so I pretty much ran away with him and eloped when I turned 21.


Anyway, so the city I come from had a LOT of public transportation. Because I have a few medical conditions that deal with sight, I never got my drivers license. After failing three tests in my home state, and failing two here, I finally received my drivers license. 

Thing is...I'm afraid of everything. I don't know when this started, probably in my third year of college or so...I don't know why. 

I am constantly thinking about death, I'm afraid to drive (I haven't driven in months), every time I eat food and I'm alone in the house I'm afraid of choking, I triple check all the locks to make sure that no one could easily get into the house (even though we live in an extremely, extremely safe neighborhood). 

My husband has really great health insurance, and I feel bad that I spend 40-80 dollars in cabs every time I have to see a doctor because of my disabilities. He says politely that I could drive him to work and then drive to the doctor, but the last time I tried driving I had to pull over because my heart was racing and I was shaking so bad. I've never been in a car accident or anything like that. 

It makes my husband upset when he's driving us someone and I do a sharp intake of breath every time someone drives past us in the lane next to us or merges in front of us. I can't help it. I close my eyes tight and I try really, really hard to not be afraid.

I work from home, at a really good job. I worry because in four years we will be moving back to our home state, and I can't take my job with me. I won't be able to find something like it, and when I think about commuting on the train, I keep thinking about how people push other people onto the tracks and get caught between the trains. I don't know how I'll do it. 

So pretty much any time we need to do anything...like grocery shop or  get something for our pets or anything like that, my husband is drive one hundred percent of the time. He has to go run errands for us because I can't. He has to speak to people at the cash register because I can't. If we go out to eat and something is wrong with my order, I just don't eat it because I'm afraid of someone in the kitchen messing with it if I send it back.

At night my husband likes to walk our two dogs for exercise. He goes to the gym every morning, too, but he has to stay in shape for his job, so he's often walking them for 1-2 hours, and he takes them one at a time. I always feel safest alone in the house with my large dog, so when he's gone with her (and he's gone with her the longest) I always get these stupid thoughts in my head, like that someone is hiding in the house to kill me, so I need to be very careful when needing to go to the bedroom from the living room or things like that. 

Sometimes when my husband goes to touch me I flinch away thinking he might hurt me, even though I know he'd NEVER EVER hurt me. The hypocracy in that is that sometimes I hurt myself. I burned my arm a lot and cut up my leg. I do this when I get overwhelmed. 

I don't want people judging me for my body because I am a little overweight and because I hurt myself, so I always wear long sleeves and long pants even in the summer. My husband really wanted to go to the beach just once this summer (there's a beach right in the place where we live). So I ordered a long sleeved bathing suit top, but I got too scared to go out in it so we didn't go. I told him to go on his own but he didn't want to go without me. 

I find myself compulsively browsing subreddits like /r/wtf or /r/morbidreality and then imagining all those scenarios and things happening. 9/11 was also a big thing for me. I was in 5th grade at the time and, well, it happened very close to my school. I never USED to have a problem with being in tall buildings, I mean I did two different internships in tall buildings with no issue and I used to love going in the elevator, but now I can't imagine ever going back to work anywhere that high up. 

I know that after typing all this out that I need help. The problem is that I'm afraid of medication. One of my medical issues requires medicine every three hours, and I don't take it because I'm afraid of taking it wrong and killing myself. I know if I go to a psychiatrist and tell them all this, the way to help would be to take medicine...which I don't want to do, because I'm afraid of it killing me. 

I don't know what to do anymore. My husband is so patient and loving with me, and he is a good man, but I KNOW that one day he's going to get tired of my bullshit, and then he'll be gone...and then what? I can't go back to the family where guns are used in arguments and you get pushed down the stairs by parents who want you to spend your textbook money on the utility bill...

I'm so afraid and overwhelmed. I guess I just needed to type this all out.

Thank you for taking the time to read this if you did. It doesn't matter if you didn't, I just needed to get this all out there. 

**tl;dr: I am a crazy person whose husband does all the important out of the house things for them. I know eventually he's going to start resenting me. I know that I need help, but I'm afraid of the help because I'm crazy. I just needed to get all of this out.**  "
2gfsai,1,2014-09-15,Wondering how to get more women/girls in my current lifestyle,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/2gfsai/wondering_how_to_get_more_womengirls_in_my/,"Hi guys, right now I'm kind of in a strange place in my life socially, and I'm wondering what your suggestions are. 

I'm taking a gap year before heading off to college. Virtually all of my friends have left for college, with the odd exception of a girl I totally got friend zoned by, before I knew what the fuck I was doing. I created a Tinder, but deleted it after a run-in with a tease and basically getting matched up with a bunch of people I really had no desire to meet. As of now, basically all I'm doing is interning at a small startup and training Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (Think cauliflower ears and chokes, not karate or whatever).

The startup is great–it's an experience not a lot of people have, not to mention a lot of people my age. There are around 15 employees of varying ages, but I'm the only intern, and the youngest by maybe about 5-8 years.

As for training BJJ, I took a gap year in part to really get good and compete, so I train everyday, often more than once a day, and at odd times as my schedule allows (eg. three-a-day this past Friday). This might seem a bit excessive to people who don't train, but in this sport, my training volume is on the low side for someone who wants to excel. Needless to say, I'm not exactly meeting loads of eligible women via BJJ.

Anyways, I do **have** the time to meet girls, but I'm just not sure where/how to meet people who are close to my age and that I'd be interested in. I don't give a fuck about partying, sports, and shit like that. I'd say I'm relatively good looking, intelligent, but not overly social with people I don't know. Overall, I'm an interesting person, I'd like to think I'm beyond my years as far as my outlook on life and my diversity of experiences. Still though, I'm a virgin, and I've never really done anything with girls.

To this day, I have yet to make a cold approach, but I always kick myself over not doing it. I almost always hesitate, fabricate some bullshit excuse, or fixate on what to say/how to say it. Is approaching the answer here, or do you have other suggestions for me? I mean, I feel like the alternative is just living a female-less lifestyle until college.  

Thanks my friends!"

I love the thought of light bondage.  A little struggle.  Ultimately, surrender.

I would like to do a scene where a young, but legal,  female ends up with her wrists tied behind her back with her own bikini.  It could be your older neighbor in your yard or your room.  Perhaps your boyfriends best friend?  Maybe an incident at Spring Break?  Followed back to your motel room?  Or it could happen at a pool party?  Maybe you even get gagged with the bottoms?

I would like to hear your slant on this scenario.  Describe yourself and your bikini.  Let me know your limits? A pic is always nice but not required.  It could be a celebrity, or not.




I found your stash.  

You come back to your dorm room, late one afternoon after a day of classes.  You are expecting some quiet time.  Maybe get high, watch some TV.  But when you get back to your room, you find me sitting in your chair, your stash in my hand.  I have found it while doing an inspection or during some repairs in your room.  Not only do you want your drugs back, you don't want anyone to find out what you have been doing all semester.  

After some haggling we decide that a blow job will get you your stash back and keep you out of trouble.  Of course, when you are finished, I decide I want more.  How roughly do you want to be taken?  Will you give in right away, or struggle?  Do you want to be tied?  Gagged?  Cum in you?  On you?  Anal?  Maybe I take some pictures?  Call one of my buddies?

Let me know what you do or don't want to happen.

2gh37e,9,2014-09-15,I.T. Graduate asking about entry-level Business Intelligence field,kevhart,BusinessIntelligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/comments/2gh37e/it_graduate_asking_about_entrylevel_business/,"Hello everyone at /r/BusinessIntelligence, I graduated in IT about a year ago, and I had some questions about getting into the BI field as an entry-level guy.


I went to a Career Fair recently where a recruiting company has told me that they will train me for free in either one of some of the Business Intelligence tools and disciplines they offer : ETL, Tibco, Sharepoint and Informatica.  Apparently they have connections to Fortune 500 companies and can ship me off to a position there as one of their consultants. But more importantly, the jobs they said they can help me get into will pay very well, almost close to $70K. 


I cant tell for sure if these software tools are popular in the BI field or not, as I don't have much knowledge of this field of IT. From what I have gathered so far I think this field may be related to Database development jobs.


I was thinking maybe I could use this recruiting agency to get my foot in the door, and after a year of experience market myself with what I learned as an entry-level guy in the BI field. 


My IT background is mostly Networking+Linux courses, with some Programming courses and 2 Database courses (SQL, Oracle) thrown in. I have done 1 Internship while in college as an IT HelpDesk+Hardware Technician guy.


So, for me my career path to a Sysadmin role would be : 
Help Desk--(2 years)--Jr. Sysadmin--(2/3 years)---Sysadmin ; with a fair bit of certifications and good luck thrown in. 


I don't mind swithching fields as long as they are within IT.


The BI offer looks much more attractive then Sysadmin roles now and honestly by looking at my college friends I thought only Software developers get hired straight out of senior year into the Development roles they want. I actually knew someone who worked on Tibco for close to a year before moving back to Java. 



Could anyone tell me what the Business Intelligence field in IT is, and what kind of work someone has to do there and if its related to programming ? What is the scenario like for entry-level guys in the BI field ? Which one has the biggest opening for a beginner guy : Tibco or ETL or Informatica ? 


Edit : I am not the best of programmers, so I don't know how important it will be to learn a programming language.

How hard is learning Tibco or Informatica compared to say ...learning to develop in Java and C- Sharp ? 



Thanks for any answers I get.

As said in the title, I'm currently living in a European country and have a job opportunity in NYC, but I'm struggling to evaluate what would represent a decent salary for my situation.

I'm working in a tech company that is exploding, and recently opened an office in NYC. Since I've been in this company from scratch (did my first internships when the company had just being created), I've had a good relationship with top management, and have earned the trust and praise of many people. 

This company has been bought recently by a bigger company, tables have turned and top management from my company doesn't have a lot of impact on what happens overseas.

I've been officially in position for the last year and a half, and have all the skills such a company would require in an ambitious young profile. I know every aspect of the business having been there from start, have both technical and business diplomas (Master's degree), and always try to push people and the company as a whole upwards - I'm also a great bridge since I know everybody in the HQs. 

Additionally, I've been leading a team of 4 people for a year with great results, and had a central role in the headquarters in my home city. 

I have a chance to enter the sales team based in NYC, and have been offered the following:

60k$ baseline, with around 10% of my salary as a variable, which makes it a maximum of 66 to 70k$ with different advantages on the side (help on moving costs, etc.). 

Now, I'm currently paid around 55k$ in a city where rent is 5 times cheaper than NYC, and cost of life is overall pretty low. 

I feel this is an unfair offer, especially in NYC, in a skyrocketing company, and considering what I can bring to them - however, I have no idea how much junior profiles can expect to earn in NYC for similar jobs, and how salaries can increase along the years depending on responsibilities.

Could anybody give some input on this, or has similar experiences, similar profiles they can relate to ? I know salaries can be much bigger than this, very quickly, so any advice would be helpful. 

Thanks,

I'm looking for some advice on how to deal with 2 of my friends, because I'm not sure how to anymore. A little background first: I'm a dude, 23, just finished college relatively recently back in December and I've been working full time since. My two friends are both women around my age, and both are finishing their last semester of school. And before I get started, I'd just like to say that they're easily the two best friends I've had in my life.

I already know that I'm a large part of my problem here, not them for the most part. I do have somewhere between moderate and severe depression, for which I have started seeing a therapist. That said, I can only see them so often and these two having really been weighing on me a lot recently.

Warning, this may get long.

I often find myself lashing out (though this isn't too bad, certainly doesn't turn violent or anything) or withdrawing from them - like I said, certainly affected by my own problems. But at the same time, I don't really feel like I can trust them a lot of the time, though for different reasons.

The first, let's call her, idk, Alex? Sure, let's roll with that. Now, Alex and I go back a few years. Unfortunately, she claims to have fallen in love with me. I don't share the feelings. I knew for probably a year that she was at least into me but didn't really do anything other than continue to be friends with her since I wanted her to be able to do it at her own pace. Eventually, it just became too much for me and I forced the issue. That was many months ago, and somehow we've managed to remain friends since.

A little bit after bringing it up, I suggested that she should probably spend less time with me. Of course, she doesn't want it. Fine, I still like her as a friend, but it turns out I was really just scratching the surface. Turns out she had been maintaining a writing blog of stories about me, about us, and how madly in love with me she is. She still writes in it, though I've long since lost my will to stomach any of it.

I've been less and less enamored with our friendship since that all happened. It feels like less of a friendship and more like a shitty, romanceless relationship. Everything I say affects her in some way. Me having a bad day turns into a literal physical reaction from her in the form of not sleeping or whatever. At one point I was a bit more open with her about my depression and how sometimes I have suicidal thoughts (don't worry, I am getting help for this! Seeing a therapist, starting antidepressants, and some other stuff). Her reaction was first the normal I care for you etc etc, then drops the bomb ""If you killed yourself I probably would too.""

What. The. Fuck. I'm not ok with being responsible for Alex's well-being. This is way too much. But at the same time I don't even know what to tell her without absolutely destroying her. And even worse I feel guilty and responsible for it. I didn't even lead her on, I didn't manipulate her, I was just her friend, and treated her like any other friend.

Thankfully my other friend is a little less complex than the previous situation. Let's call her uhh.... Natalie? Natalie and I have (had?) a pretty solid friendship. No feelings either way. We each used to at one point or another, but we've got a platonic thing going on, which is good for me cause there is a lot less pressure - which also makes me more trusting I suppose. Anyway, we got really close over the past year or so. During the spring we probably saw each other like 2 - 3 times a week, which continued into summer when it even often reached 4-5 times a week.

And then it dropped off like a rock. There are a lot of factors that played into it. I was unemployed from mid-May until late July. She didn't have school during the summer, was only working so often, and her boyfriend was in Boston for an internship. Even after I started my new job we were still hanging out all the time. Myself, Natalie, and Alex are all friends by the way. These outings would often consist of all 3 of us, though Alex was significantly busier than myself or Natalie so was there maybe 1/2-2/3 of the time.

Anyway, me and Natalie still see each other, but there's no more ""hey, what are you up to tonight?!"" I kept trying for a while, but it seemed like she was just always busy. Even plans that were made in advance seem like they're getting cancelled, changed, or otherwise delayed for any variety of reasons but she generally at least tells me in advance. I realize that she's busy and has her own stuff to deal with too, but man that shit works me up.

And I kinda feel like it's my own fault. She always kinda prodded (haha, that would be putting it mildly) me to talk to her about what's going on in my life and why I might be feeling shitty or whatever. And she kinda became the person I felt like I could trust talking to about those things. I feel like the more I've done it, even though she had been actively asking me to, the further away she's been pulling. I'm told that it's not the case, but I don't really believe her. Some of her actions suggest otherwise. Sometimes I think that I'm right, other times I tell myself it's just the depression. She still tries to get me to talk to her.

 Maybe I'm just making a big deal out of nothing and being needy as fuck. I don't really know. But these days I get the impression that the reason she even spends time with me in the first place is because she feels obligated to do so. Particularly since I've haven't been in the greatest state mentally as of late. I'm certainly haven't been a fun person to be around for a while.

What do, reddit? What do? Clearly I have my own host of issues I need to resolve, but this stuff in particular is the cause of a lot of stress day in and day out that I'm not dealing with very well.



---   
tl;dr: I'm having a lot of issues with my best friends about a variety of issues that I'm not really sure how to approach without someone getting really hurt or making the problem worse."

Wow thats going to be a long post.I do not disagree with all of it I just think a lot of things are off the mark. I have troubles with some of the mindsets which are borrowed from or analagous to Marxism or Christian religions.


Privilege:


This is discovered by looking statistically at social groups and you come to the conclusion that some do worse than others, systemantically.But no one knows EXACTLY how this works.Yes there are studies that illuminate specific behaviours mindsets and so on that help to make this happen but it is very complex interplay. The problem is, if you imagine the disadvantage as a sort of grid, feminists are asking people to reify (recognise as real, solid) their 'privilge' in the grid. But a lot of whatever happens is subconscious and a lot of things you may do, do not impact other people in that way.Its kind of like ' The proletariat did not exist until marx invented them'...the privilege discussion attempts, in my view, to get people to socially fantasise something concrete but there is no reliable way to be sure that what we are doing to these 'privileged people' is actually fair.


Agency:


I have trouble with this one because of the underlying assumption.The underlying assumption is that being agentive is associated with power and being objectified is associated with powerlessness.But this is a value sytem derived from Patriarchy itself, problem number one, and secondly, we can find plenty of examples of people being non-agentive (Bill gates Male intern making coffee for him, a celebrity being tended to be his retinue) where the power lies squarely with the non-agentive part of the dyad.


Androcentrism



This one I basically agree with. Our society has had a 'boys club' for a very long time.
Internalized sexism
In many social justice philosophies it appears that those most oppressed are complicit in their own oppression.This is distasteful so it is explained away via 'false consciousness' or 'internalised misogyny'. The problem is, it is just too open to abuse.A woman can always do something misogynistic and chalk it up to internalised misogyny. So at times this strikes me as externalised blame rather than internalised misogyny. And just like in traditional patriarchal culture, where men have most power, most responsibility and most blame, this merely repeats the same pattern. Also, often those opposing it use an 'essentialist argument' claiming some mythic femininity free of male influence.


Intersectionality
Same problems as privilege.Also it turns debates into oppression top-trumps and shuts men down completely.


Lived experience



I see a value in being open to hear it, but it should not be used to reject other perspectives.Hitlers lived experience was that the Jews were evil and ruined Germany.



Male gaze:



This has been hotly contested by feminists themselves.It is based on Lacanian psychoanalysis, which is ..I wont say it is thoroughly discredited because it is so pseudoscientific that it is impossible to refute or prove. There are lots of reasons to think Lacan was a charlatan.In any event, it makes common sense that men dominating cameras and literature would lead to a bias, but reifying it into an almost palpable evil is misguided, in my view.



Objectification:



I am pretty much wholeheardtedly in opposition to this when it comes to race and other issues.It gets a bit complicated with the genders though.Objectification is just an inherent part of sexuality..I don't think demonising it is the way forward. Men are more sexually insecure for lots of reasons I wont get into here, so it makes sense they would want to have fantasies that 'cannot reject them' are 'always available' and 'cannot escape' and so on.



Othering:



A complicated issue. Othering may be objectifying but its opposite can also be tyrannical and traumatic.Zizek is good on this issue.



Rape culture:



There is a bit of a sleight-of-hand with this topic. The term indicates a widespread acceptance of rape but when you push feminists its about practices and attitudes that make it difficult to report rape, to avoid victim-blaming and make it difficult to get convictions."

2gkd7l,1,2014-09-16,"You're dissatisfied with life, have no idea what hardship is, and I'm not going to put up with the crap you throw at me anymore. (This is loooong but I would love advice)",shilabaca,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2gkd7l/youre_dissatisfied_with_life_have_no_idea_what/,"This is probably getting dangerously close to an angry rant but my roommate of 2 years is pushing me to the breaking point.  I know if I don't organize my thoughts and get it all of my chest here then I'm going to explode on him and make everything worse.  If you end up reading all of this I'd really appreciate any advice you might have.

For starters I live in a house with 5 other guys.  We all get along well except for me and the one I'll call Clyde.  Clyde and I used to be good friends because we were similar, we're both pretty goofy and ridiculous at times but ungodly stubborn, self-righteous, and proud at others.  We've had a lot of arguments but we've made up just fine until now. 

Clyde has a rice cooker he uses daily and he's pretty touchy about the rest of the house using it.  The other day I was working late, I was tired and feeling lazy.  There was some leftover in the cooker so I took some, finished the work I had, and went to bed.  I got up early the next day and went to my 8 am class when Clyde goes ballistic on the house group chat.  He's pissed someone ate some rice that he was saving for breakfast, immediately claims I did it, calls me a fucking peasant, and says that if I need food I should go beg with the rest of the homeless outside of Whole Foods.  Now I'm just as angry as he is.  And being so mad I, of course, make matters worse and lie about it.  Then my phone dies.  I spend the rest of the day fuming, trying to calm myself down, and thinking this will blow over in time.

I get back to the house at 9 pm and Clyde's sitting there waiting to interrogate me about it.  He's asked everybody in the house about this missing rice and keeps trying to get me to admit it.  I'm tired and just want dinner so I keep denying it.  Clyde eventually says we're no longer friends and our relationship only extends to formal roommates.  I finish eating, pat him on the head, tell him I did eat his rice, and go downstairs to my room.  Him and some other roommates are talking in the room right above me so I hear most of what they say while I try to go to sleep.  They joke and tell stories, talk about me a little, my mind starts racing, and now I can't sleep.  

I come from a large family, the middle kid of 4, my mom is one of 10 and we see our extended family all the time.  If you have anything you don't want other people to take, you hide it, this especially applies to food.  Clyde has one sister and moved here from Korea when he was young so I understand we can't see eye-to-eye on this and that since I'm the one that took what's his, I'm completely.  But this isn't what makes me so furious with him.

Clyde comes from a decently well-off family, he's probably going to stay a 5th year in college and can afford it.  We used to drink and smoke together, do stupid things, argue, pass out, and make up in the morning laughing at our own stupidity.  Now he just sits in his room playing League of Legends and he has the exact attitude of the people way too involved in the game.  If you don't know, that means he often breaks into a stream of angry, incredibly insulting comments.  He bought a butterfly training knife he plays with and a golden pocketknife just to say he has one.  He has a girlfriend (I have no idea how that works since she's all butterflies and rainbows, I've never seen her even raise her voice or not smile).  Clyde's said his life's goal is life goal is to be a some kind of middle range manager who works from home, passes his work to his underlings, and just generally coasts.  

I on the other hand, am not any of that.  My family moved houses 6 times before I entered high school, and has moved a couple more times since.  I grew up an angry kid with no friends.  I bullied kids.  I've had a part-time job since I was 14, when started being a lifeguard/swim instructor.  I ran away once and contemplated suicide.  Eventually realized what I was, and worked hard to change myself.   I rowed on an unforgettable club crew team and learned an endless number of lessons from my coach and teammates that will stay with me for the rest of my life.  I was top of my class in high school despite my job and crew team.  No one ever blew me away like the girl I first had a crush on, but I was still pretty messed up.  I had no idea how be genuine or open to her and got my heart stomped on for years.  My best friend once jumped off a swing and shattered his elbow and wrist when he landed on his side.  I gave him first aid, held his mangled arm, and took him to the hospital.  My parents' bought some land nobody could be used in the mountains with the dream of fixing the landscape, building a house on it, and moving there one day.  My family and worked on it for years.  I felled trees, dug trenches, and worked on a dam where a boulder rolled down and pinned my leg, I was lucky it wasn't crushed.  I watched my grandmother waste away to cancer.  Halfway through my freshmen year of college my dad's company suddenly decided to cut his entire department because development of the new iPhone platform they were working on was going slower than they expected.  My other grandmother gave us money so I could stay in college.  This older, drunk bald gay guy was harassing us one night after we left a party.  He tried to walk away with my friend's brother, pushing him down the street.  This drunk wouldn't back off so I punched him in the face and was happy to let the school put me on probation for it.  In my sophomore year I came home for Christmas elated my because my girlfriend's family were using their miles to let me visit her in Paris for the new year where she was going to study abroad.  When I came home my mom broke down crying.  My dad was in the psychiatric ward at the hospital from overworking himself to find a job for himself, all the people that had been in his department, while going to work on our property in the mountains.  I had to become the emotional rock of our family.  In Paris I had a fight with my girlfriend and she broke up with me a month later over facebook. Then my parents sold our property to pay for my college tuition.  I have to graduate and find a job this year so I can work off my student loans and help pay for my younger twin brothers to go to college.

Present day: I'm doing great.  I love my engineering studies.  I joined an ultimate frisbee team.  I have a well-matched internship.  I've made peace with the girl who dumped me and stayed in touch with my first crush.  My dad found a well-paying, stable job and hasn't ever gone back to the hospital.  I learned how to deal with hardship and live passionately.  I want to be an engineer, mechanical designer, artist, writer, traveler, and leave an impact on the world.  I learned to meditate, be quiet, reflect on myself, and to think deeply.  I'm no longer angry at everyone but goofy, clumsy, and content.  I am curious, driven, strong, and I've got willpower like a blade of Ramston steel (*Name of the Wind* anyone?).  I am proud of what hardship, mistakes, and regret have made of me.  More than all of that, I'm quiet about all of this.  I do my best to remain jovial, modest, and appreciative of everything I have.

Back to the rice.  Clyde comes along rage-guns blazing and insult-cannons loaded.  He's on a witch hunt for me like mob with pitchforks and I don't know whether to laugh in his face, stand up against him, let him blow himself out and apologize, or just part ways with him.

I'm going to make him a loaf of banana bread, his favorite food, because I owe him.  I would be pissed too if someone ate part of my breakfast.  But that's not the real problem.  I'm sick of this asshole and he's sick of me.  He doesn't know what I've been through and I don't know what he's been through but all I see in him is a stagnating person trying to figure out why he's not happy.  It's like I can his mind working.  He has a girlfriend, is in college, has a solid future, and is close to the top tier in his video games.  He has a golden knife and no one argues against him because he can shout and insult you out of it.  He thinks he's got it made and should be happy.  All I see is Cartman from South Park.

And that's everything.  It feels loads better to have all those words I've been keeping in for so long off my chest, it's like I can think freely again.

If you read this far, CONGRATULATIONS!!! You have my undying respect as person with astounding empathy, I hope I wasn't too ranty.  Secondly, I would love any advice you have about how to deal Clyde and my other roommates.  For me, that's what I'm really guilty about.  I lied to Clyde, then them because I thought this would eventually be forgotten. Now the truth is out and I know I've lost a good amount of their trust. That hurts me deeply because I value them so much and I know if I hadn't lied they would probably be on my side.  Thirdly, thank you for a space to write.

**TL;DR** My asshole roommate has been driving me up the wall and I'm not sure what do but I suspect it might be time to part ways."
2gkdy6,1,2014-09-16,I (27[M]) need some advice when living with SO (24 [F]) who does not what to pitch in,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2gkdy6/i_27m_need_some_advice_when_living_with_so_24_f/,"I never thought I would be writing one of these, but I have a tough time seeking advice, talking to people about personal things. I am 27/M.  GF is 24/F.  Been together for four years.  Living together for one year.  I will try to keep it short.  

Over a year ago, she got a job she thought she would like.  However, her roadtrip commute, was four hours in a car.  My commute was just about doable, two hours in a car.  We both lived with our parents, separately.  While I had a good situation at home, and she did not, I said we should move out b.c.  she cannot keep driving four hours a day.  I said if she really likes the job and company, then it is worth it.  Could be a once/lifetime opportunity working there.  We should find a place in between our jobs.  We did.  
Her job: Though she was closer, she was okay with working 9-5 and not a minute more.  As a contract to hire worker, and someone who gets pay hourly, I wanted to push her to show her coworkers/boss, she is deserving of a full time gig, while also getting paid more which would help our situation.  This never came to fruition.  She hated her job more and more, mostly because she was still a contract to hire.  The pay was not a lot, and knowing her potential, her degree, and one year experience prior to this, and the location, I knew she could command more money.  She looked for jobs, and finally found something in a even more demanding location, for about the same money.  Though it was full time, I felt like she was selling herself short, now with two years experience.  Short because of the pay, and the job responsibilities.  But again, I rather her be happy and gain experience then get paid a little more.
Me: Slightly older, I did internships during school to accumulate some experience (she did not do this).  Also went to Grad School.  So I was ahead of the game.  My job out of school, was good pay.  I put a lot of time and effort into it, grew, asked for more money with each review as I knew what I could get elsewhere.  I did my research.  Company agreed.  Have been here two years.


Issue 1: I pay 2/3 of the rent.  She pays 1/3 of the rent.  In the year we lived together, my salary has gone up 30% before taxes.  I busted my ass.  I would say her's has been less than 10%.  I have accommodated a lot of debt.  Moving out took more than I thought (my fault).  I recently had to put a lot of money into my car.  There was a trip with my family, then a trip with her family, then a trip for a wedding that was unplanned for.  I paid for a lot of this, as I thought I could find a way to make it work (my fault).  I learned my lesson.  I now know I will be saying no and not guilted into things. Selfishly enough, I'd like to see her make the money she could be making so be able to start paying for things, and getting rent closer to 50/50.  Plus she is deserving of so.  I am going to bust my ass either way in my career, don't get me wrong, but she was content with not working overtime to make more money to contribute more.  She has never logged in after work / weekends.  And I am a firm believer that in this cut throat businesses we are in, we are young enough, where we might need to every now and then.  I have already fielded a few opportunities to work elsewhere/lengthen my commute just to make more, even though I like where I am now.  There is really been no appreciation for moving out and staying here as she tries job #2.  But this is what I signed up for and I have been supportive.


Issue 2: Because I have more energy, it has been me who does most of the cleaning, cooking.  I have brought it up before and basically I've been told, ""don't do those things for me"".  She adds, ""Sometimes I rather come home and not do anything, than eat and clean"".  I just don't find this as a fair compromise.  We are adults on our own and an apartment takes some effort and responsibility.  At her old job for most of the first year living together, she hated it and that accounted for not wanting to do anything (depressed).  At her new job, her commute (public trans) is a lot, so now that accounts for not wanting to do anything.

Issue 3: Being taking for granted.  I will make dinner, clean up, make breakfast and lunch  and snacks for the next day.  It is almost expected.  I try to keep myself sane by telling myself, I would probably be doing these things if I lived together.  But I usually don't get a thank you.  Instead, soon as she gets home she tells me things I need to do.  You need to do this.  You need to call this person.  You need to fix this.  I hardly ask for any favors because I am independent and can do most things myself.  With her, it is asking me to do a ton without realizing I do a ton.  


Issue 4: Not realizing I want to get out of debt = big fight.  I made some side money.  She asked if we can go out to dinner.  So we did.  The bill was 70.  The side money covered 50.  I asked if we can split the different (20).  Again, I am in a lot of debt.  I grew up with nothing.  Once I got my job out of school, I wanted to do a lot with her and paid for a lot.  I felt i owed it to her as she likes nice things/places.  But now a days, I can't pay for everything.  We had a huge fight about how I don't buy her things anymore.  Though I buy flowers for no reason every now and then.  Will buy little things to show I think of her.  This fight just keeps coming up in my mind.  I am trying my best, trying to keep the place we call home running, always doing DIYs on top of mostly everything else.  And to get slammed that I ask for half when it was her ideas to go out.  If I ask to take her out, then I am paying for it.  But she asked if we can go out, probably knowing the side money I wanted to put away, could be spent all on dinner.


TLDR; GF is figuring out what she wants to be, I am supportive.  Now, I am depressed, no one to talk to.  Working hard at keeping our apartment up and running, working hard to bring in more money, but it seems one-side, with no appreciation.


Before I submit: I am not trying to come off ungrateful.  I am not trying to be resentful (I was okay with moving out knowing it would be lopsided at first).  This all sparked with me bringing up how I feel with being the one to do a lot, and all I get back is, ""then don't do it"".  My question is, where do I go from here.  I feel like I am being under appreciated.  But why do I care if I feel this way if I lived alone I would be doing all these things anyway?

2gkkay,15,2014-09-16,"I'm 21, I had a goal of saving up $20k and am not sure what to do with my money right now.",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2gkkay/im_21_i_had_a_goal_of_saving_up_20k_and_am_not/,"Hi All,

Yes I have read the sidebar and the FAQs. For more in-depth background, I just turned 21 and have been wanting to save $20k for awhile now. I made it my goal and finally reached it last week with my most recent paycheck.

Currently, I'm in my last year of college. I have been blessed and been very fortunate to not have any debts or loans. For starter, I know that I plan to save $6k or so in a savings account as my emergency fund.

Now here's my main question: What should I do with the other $14k? As my income comes from my internship, I don't have any benefits from the company I work for and thus, my employer won't match my 401k or whatever else I have read about on the sidebar.

I've been considering opening up a different account that has a high interest rate to put the money in that account, but am not sure what the best account for that would be. I plan on going to graduate school eventually (maybe 3 years after working after undergrad), so it would be nice for the money to help pay that off.

Thank you for any future advice/recommendations!"

i´ve started developing games when I was twelve, since then I have developed for Windows, Windows Phone and now Android (see [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avitus.lostpowers) and [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamedawn.dronerunner) for my latest work)

Now that I have graduated (HTL/technical colleg) I am looking for a Team, where I can help create an awesome game and learn from others. I´d consider myself a game designer, but apart from reading books and developing my own games (and playing games of course), I have no practical experience. If you have a game designer, I´d love to help and learn! Also, I am a quite good programmer (mostly Java, but also C# and PHP), can work with/develop for databases (SQL/MySQL) and am a decent graphical artist (check my games for samples)

I am currently looking for a job between October and (including) January - so it would be kind of an internship (limited due to basic military service - other than that, I am flexible with the time!)
I am living in Vienna (Austria).

If you are interested, please leave a comment or send me a message!"

2gl5ij,8,2014-09-16,I am currently a senior in college but I am at home taking 2 classes online because I could not handle college without my ex-girlfriend.,uwme,whatsbotheringyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/2gl5ij/i_am_currently_a_senior_in_college_but_i_am_at/,"I met my ex near the end of my freshman year of college and we dated until right before senior year. Everything was going wonderful until I got tired of waiting for her to be ready to have sex with me. I learned she was a virgin so I understood that she was not ready for sex right away. I don't think I pressured her into having sex and she has told me that I had not. Instead I think she pressured herself into it before she was really ready. We used condoms, the pill, and spermicide. She never initiated it except for once which was after she watched me play hockey. Looking back I should have seen the red flags and acted differently, but at the time I had been waiting a year for sex and was not going to ask any questions once she told me she was ready.

I'm not sure if it was the sex situation or the fact that I felt she sucked me in taking me away from my friends or just spending too much time with her. But eventually I began to grow annoyed with both her and my classes. This caused me to start smoking a lot of weed. Now I have always smoked but it was at most once a night once I had everything done. But I was smoking all day long. The last semester I was with her I was probably high more often than not. This caused problems because I never did anything. She never told/asked me to smoke less but she did ask for other things that I never did because I probably forgot them right after she told me. 

Anyways she got an internship out of state this summer and I went back home to get a job and do a class online. We had never been apart for more than a week or two before. I promised that I would call her every night and she thought that that would be enough. I decided that I wanted to do better in school and life so I stopped smoking entirely this summer. I realized how I treated her and was trying to make myself better for her.

Everything was going okay until she came to visit me because of a conference that happened to be close to me. She wanted to be with me the entire time but I had to do a lot for my class because I procrastinate things. I also was getting annoyed because she had work things to do but tried to get me to go with her or else she would not have any fun or even try to enjoy things. She left after a few days and I thought everything was still going good. I was going to see her and drive back with her about a month later.

After her visit we started getting mad at each other when I called her. I told her about my job too much so I asked her what she did that day. She would then get mad at me because ""I did not contribute to or care about what she was saying."" We talked about that and I thought that it might help if I called her less so we would have more things to say and be more excited to talk to each other. She thought that would help as well but just wanted me to text her more. Apparently I did not text her enough and she got mad at me even though she never texted me or tired to get a hold of me. 

About a week before I was supposed fly down and bring her back I called her. I told her that I was tired because I worked all day so I didn't want to talk that long. She told me that she didn't either and when I asked why she told me that she wanted to break up with me. I was shocked and wanted to know why but she didn't want to talk to me about it and hung up on me. That was shitty but I had 2 or 3 weeks to recover before going back to school.

Once I got back to school I hung out with a lot of old friends and was always busy and happy until I tried to go to sleep. I was living by myself so she could basically live with me. My queen sized bed was so big and empty and my apartment was so lonely that no matter what I did during the day, it didn't matter by the time I was going to bed. I ended up smoking again so I wouldn't hurt but all that did was make me realize that I had done nothing and felt the exact same a few days later. 

I eventually talked to her about everything twice. The first time I told her that I wanted to get back with her. That's when she told me she ""hooked up"" with another guy a few times after she broke up with me. But she seemed like she wanted to get back together with me too. The next time I talked to her getting back together was out of the question. I can't remember exactly what she said but it was basically that she didn't enjoy being with me and that she didn't have any sex drive with me but did with the other guy. That completely destroyed my confidence and my sex drive and me. 

I couldn't focus on my classes. It was so bad that I started crying in the middle of one of my lectures. I managed to stay caught up with everything but knew I could not keep doing that for an entire semester. I talked to friends and advisers and even a councilor and we all thought that going home was a good idea. 

When I was home I went out drinking with some friends. The only important one is Ash. My ex had invited Ash and her boyfriend to come to a football game with me and her. Somehow that came up and Ash asked if she should text my ex about that. My drunk hurt fucked up self saw an opportunity to hurt my ex and began to encourage Ash. Their conversation escalated until Ash told my ex that I had cheated on her before she broke up with me.

The next day I did some damage control and texted my ex and her best friend what had happened. I felt like shit and realized that instead of making my ex feel bad I just gave her a reason not to feel bad and I just ended up hurting myself. I began to move on until today. I felt shitty when I woke up and knew it wasn't going to be a great day but my ex ended up texting me. She told me that she saw what I texted her friend today and told me she only told me about the other guys because she would need to if we actually got back together. Also that she didn't sleep with him and that he was just a rebound. She thought it was a good idea for us to cut all contact but that she would always care about me.

Now I want to get back together with her even more now. A few days ago I thought that I had accepted that we were not getting back together and I was moving on, but now I feel like I have gotten nowhere. 

I want to be mad and text her back and tell her that I don't believe that she was ever serious about getting back together with me and ask her what the point would even be if she isn't even sexually attracted to me. 

I want to tell her that I have wanted to be with her and that I have not been able to move on at all.

But I feel like I should just delete her text and hope the rest of today or tomorrow will be better. But I still want to be with her. I get that she doesn't because she tried to do everything she could but I was too high to care or listen. But I haven't. I still have so much I want to do with her and so many things I want to tell her. 

I just don't know what to do anymore."

How can I [22F] cope with the fact that I am no longer the center of my boyfriends [23M] life anymore?,tomatoxpaste609,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2gl5to/my_cancer_has_made_it_difficult_to_spend_time/,"To give a little background my boyfriend and I have been seeing each other for roughly a year and a half. But, from the get-go we could tell that this was different than any of our past relationships in that we had instant chemistry both in and out of the bedroom and we are really just great friends as well as lovers. We are from two different countries and have spent about as much time physically together as we have long distance. In January of this year he was offered an internship in my state relatively close to where I live and took the opportunity to move to my country to be closer to me and work in a great internship. Now, at the same time this has been going on I found out that I was diagnosed with a relapse of Hodgkin's Lymphoma and began treatments right around the time that he was set to move out here. During the initial treatments we found an apartment together and I moved out of my parents house. However, as the treatments became more intense and I was forced to spend quite a bit of time in the hospital for bone-marrow transplants I was forced to move back in with my parents to be taken care of and in a place that is closer to the hospital that treats me. Since then I have spent a period of 5 and a half weeks and a period of 4 weeks in the hospital, during which my boyfriend came to visit almost every weekend. He really has been there for me throughout all of this process. And, to top it all off, before I left the hospital during my second stint he was offered a permanent position in the company he was interning for. However, it is since he received this permanent position and moved to a new apartment closer to his work place that I am realizing that he really doesn't have as much time for me. I am home with my parents now and can't take public transportation to visit him because of my immune system. So the only way I can see him is when he is able to spend weekends with me. So essentially we have kind of gone back to being a long distance relationship again, or at least thats how I see it. We are forced again to stay in touch either via text or skype or phone calls.. 
Now, let me also mention that because of my illness, I am unable to work or attend school or really be in any sort of social setting (including going to bars, restaurants, parties with many people attending). So when I'm not at a doctor appointment I am likely inside my house, doing absolutely nothing but watching tv, browsing reddit etc. It is a depressing existence, if I'm going to be honest. and I find myself becoming needier with regards to the attention I receive from my boyfriend because I have literally nothing else in my life right now. 
However, with his new job and coworkers and apartment and life it feels like more and more he has less time for me. He still comes to visit me just about every weekend but somehow it's not enough. I almost feel like we were closer when we were living in two different countries a year ago because even though I was in school and he was writing his thesis we made time for each other and skyped literally every night. Now I feel like he just doesn't have the time for me. I have all of the time in the world and he is always so occupied with work and running errands and just living his new life. I feel like I'm just kind of fading out of his life almost, and one day he'll realize he doesn't need me anymore to be happy in the way that I need him. It's a horrible feeling. And every time that I mention that I feel like he's getting tired of me and being with me he always says that he doesn't and that he loves me so much and that's why he moved out here in the first place. But somehow I'm just feeling like it's not enough. I don't know. I just feel like he is all I have to live for in this world as I don't work or go to school or have many close friends or really anything to do with my spare time (i do have things i guess, but I'm just so unmotivated to do any of them). But I am no longer what he has to live for. He has a whole new life that he is very content with and has nothing to do with me and I'm just afraid he's going to leave me. Not to mention his new job keeps him very busy and consume a lot of his day hours to the point where he is very tired at night and doesn't feel like skypeing. Please if someone can give me any advice or reassurance or anything it would be greatly appreciated. Because I can't keep having this conversation with him.. Even though he's really not the kind of guy to do this, I feel like he's going to be sick of hearing it and break up with me eventually if I keep complaining to him. 

tl;dr My boyfriend has a new job that occupies most of his free time and i feel like there is no room for me in his new life."
2gl7jo,6,2014-09-16,Should I (F/mid-20s) tell my former best friend (F/early 30s) that I was in love with her?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2gl7jo/should_i_fmid20s_tell_my_former_best_friend/,"I'm looking for advice but this certainly helps, I think, to get off my chest.  Thanks very much to anyone who takes time to read and offer words of advice.  This story begins over ten years ago, and I remain friends with ""E"", the person this story involves, yet somewhat awkwardly (at least to my perception).  We catch up every few months, live across the country from one another, and have very different lives.  I'm now happily married, for over a year.  And she in a serious relationship.  Yet there remains something very unsettling about the lack of closure and honesty about my past, and I'd like to gain some, and perhaps offer some to E, if beneficial.  I'm a Reddit regular but, for obvious reasons, am not posting from my usual account.

When I was in my teens, I was in a youth group where E, a college student, was an intern. We both left this church but what began as a mentor-like relationship slowly and naturally transitioned into a friendship as I went into my last years of high school and she finished college.  When I was in my later teens, what feels like eons ago, she graduated college and moved out of state, and we regularly talked on the phone, conversations largely composed of me lamenting my teenage woes, yet I was considered mature for my age.  She came to stay with my family for about a week around this time, and we celebrated her birthday.  I remember baking her a cake and treating her to dinner.  We rented a couple movies to watch that night, and I recall that night realizing that I was in love with her.  At the scary twist of one of the films, I grabbed her hand and held it for a good few minutes.  The sensation was, well, electric.  I remember it well.

From there began a variety of intense emotions and, in retrospect, some interesting behaviors.  I felt very passionately and sincerely about E yet I continued to date boys my age.  E and I never spoke about it, but when we were together (E would visit and sleepover for a few nights at a time for vacation), we spooned at night.  I kissed her cheek very occasionally, she very rarely would do the same to mine.  While she slept at night, I'd stare at her longingly.  My gut wrenched when she'd pull out of the drive.  Our goodbye hugs were long and emotional (for me, anyway).  She'd admit she hated leaving, as very good friends I understand do, but I got the feeling she had no idea how I really felt.  I thought of her constantly, and when I moved on to college, our visits continued, taking turns to visit one another several times a year.  When I had it my way, we'd mostly rent films and hole up in one of our rooms, but sometimes we'd spend time with our roommates and local friends, especially if it was up to her.  Everyone we knew well enough knew that we were best friends with an odd age differential, and that's all.  My parents, I came to realize, began to catch on in high school, and made their sentiments about my friendship with her somewhat transparent (my mom accused it of being ""weird"" and not normal once, but only to me), but never stopped her from coming and were for the most part pretty welcoming to her, at least in person. At this time, we were in the Deep South, and pretty religious which I think is at least somewhat relevant to mention.  But other than my folks, I have good reason to feel confident that no one has ever suspected anything of our relationship.  We both kept dating boys, though she did substantially less of that, and never even kissed a guy until I graduated college.  When she did go on dates, I tried to sound friendly and supportive, but felt tormented when I knew she was out with them.

Eventually while in college, I took E on a really nice trip to a big liberal city, far from where either of us lived.  I considered telling her how I'd been feeling for years, or I guess really hoped that she'd catch on and would make a real move.  I wanted to kiss her maybe more than anything I have ever wanted my entire life.  This, to me, was just like...what life was about. While on the trip, I felt somewhat entitled to be a little more bold physically.  The last night, I took her to see a play, and we dressed up.  I wore what I thought then was a truly bitching pantsuit (ha!) and she wore a smoking hot dress.  I made a ""joke"", before the play started, about how we probably came off as lesbian lovers and put my arm confidently around her, pulling her close.  If I recall correctly, we sat like this for a good bit during the play.  I really can't remember her reaction, and if I could, I fear my emotions then probably clouded my understanding of her response.  That night, I remember, we made our way back to the hotel, and I know in retrospect my hormones/emotions/what have you must have just been raging.  We kind of lounged around and eventually decided to change and go to bed. We started spooning, as usual, but I rested my arms really comfortably around her lower waist and kind of sensually rubbed her hip.  She didn't stop me at first, but eventually asked me why I wasn't going to sleep, and sounded kind of exasperated.  I remember her saying ""gah!"" and getting up, I asked what was wrong, and I can't recall exactly what she said, but she said something along the lines of ""what do you think that does? I have to pee"" and I recall feeling brain numb.  I don't remember what I did after that, but I'm pretty sure I turned over, tossed and turned, and eventually passed out.

The next day, we flew back to her city where I spent the night at her apartment before I was slated to drive home the next morning.  We got back towards evening and went to bed.  I felt miserable/tragically in love because I had wanted more than anything to have told her early into the trip how I'd felt, for one of us to have made the first move, for it to have been the next step towards a ""real"" relationship.  Not sure how it happened, but we ended up spooning with me rubbing her back for a very long time.  It became sensual, with me moving my hand up her top past her navel in a ticklish rub, and she turned to reciporocate, motioning me to let her spoon me.  I think she made a joke around the the likes of shuddering from the tingling sensation and making a related noise, saying something like ""you need to know how this feels"" and laughing.  So this continued, back and forth, and I eventually lifted the waistband of her pajama pants to lightly rub against the top of her thigh, never getting to her panty line.  She did the same to me and I came very close to orgasming.  We fell asleep like this and I woke up in the middle of the night only to start it up again, it continued back and forth in silence.  I *think* I remember saying something like ""I promise that this isn't just physical"" but looking back at how things went later on, I think maybe this is just what I wanted to say.  I eventually turned over to kind of straddle her leg and moved to kiss her, but her eyes were shut almost like she was asleep and she didn't move, so I didn't, and my heart hurt.  It was almost like it was okay to her that we went so far, and then the minute it got...real? it wasn't okay.  I think I just very slowly and agonizingly went to sleep in a depressed haze.

The next morning, it was weird.  She showered (saying something about a cold shower) and then I showered.  I got ready and got my things gathered to leave and it struck me that she was more than ready for me to.  She walked me to my car and hugged me goodbye.  I silently held back tears, nearly exploding in a deep and heavy sob as I pulled away.  It was a holiday, so I drove to my parents and stayed with them for a few nights, and she texted to check that I got in safely and that was all I heard from her until I got back to my college apartment a few days later.  One of us called the other and talked like nothing had happened, laughing and catching up, and then somehow we ended up on the sobering subject, but delicately.  She explained that she had been thinking, the entire time that we were doing ""that"", about the guy she had started dating.  I went silent and the quiet dragged on until she said my name followed by a hushed ""it meant something more to you, oh gosh"" in a sober and sad tone.  I told her no, but that I needed to go.  She tried to stop me and wanted to talk.  I hung up.  

We didn't speak for a good while, though I don't remember if it was weeks or months. Eventually, somehow, we started talking again like nothing had happened.  I've never spoken again of what happened to her or to anyone else.  She came and stayed with me for my 21st birthday and went out for a big celebration with my friends and boyfriend, and then the next night, when I wanted to go out again with more friends, she started crying as I went to get ready, saying that she felt like there wasn't room in my life for her anymore.  I called off my plans, embarrassed, and stayed in, trying to comfort her but feeling like I had moved on.  

We stayed in touch, and she moved across the country and I eventually did the same. Years went by, and we talked a few times a year, far less intimately before but still like old friends do, albeit I feel awkward sometimes and I get the feeling that she does as well.  After ""the trip"" I almost immediately started dating a guy and years later, married him. That's where I am now.

E and I are friendly, and I would have even asked her to be in the wedding, but it was still awkward to me.  I have since missed her close friendship but wonder if that is even possible, especially without coming clean about how I felt.  In writing this, I realize it is possible she knows without me saying a thing, but it baffles me how this can be the case and we can still be friends.  I feel like she may have really been hurt by what happened, and I feel guilty in retrospect for touching her without being honest about what made me want to.  I, in nearly every instance of physical contact, initiated.  She's gone through counseling, supposedly for issues leading from her parents' divorce in childhood, but she's now in her 30's.  She called me when she lost her virginity earlier this year, which was less awkward than I would have imagined, and from anything I know has never done or felt anything physical with another female (same here).

Over the past few years, I have contemplated working up the nerve to call and tell her my truths about our past, and have even scheduled phone dates only to end up chatting about careers and laugh about family stories.  I recently started writing drafts of things I apparently have a hard time saying out loud, thinking I'd mail them.  I have no intention of striking up our old relationship or anything like it, but only really want to be honest with the person who I have been most honest with about everything else in my life.  Maybe this is selfish, but I feel like it would grant her some closure, too.  I think maybe even our somewhat superficial friendship is worth risking for something honest, just between the two of us, instead of eventually dying with what still feels like a substantial secret past.  I know I would personally never share this with my spouse, because it's simply not who I have ever been to him, and he knows E well enough from her visits to see me in college.  I don't want him thinking, for example, that there was anything between me and E while he and I have been together.  Because there has not, and I think this is likely too weird at this point in the game, especially given our religious backgrounds.  To be clear, I'd never, ever leave nor cheat on my husband and am happily in love with him, reach for the stars, world series kind of stuff.

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to read.  It feels quite good to finally write this for the first time, years down the line.  I appreciate your advice with heartfelt sincerity.

2glax4,4,2014-09-16,I am a jealous person. I feel alone and I have a giant crush on my recently met friend.,NijiIroBasu,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2glax4/i_am_a_jealous_person_i_feel_alone_and_i_have_a/,"Hi there, 

I am currently 20 years old and I have a giant crush on my 19 year old friend. We see eachother for at least another half a year each single day. We sit across eachother and we became quite the buds. He brought me home after knowing eachother for a few days and we recently spend the weekend together. 

I find him to be very attractive and he is so genuine and really kind. I am not sure if he is attracted to men. There are some signs but I am not entirely sure.

Here is the thing, I recently invited my other friend over to join the internship. He needed one so I offered him to come. I knew that it would be troublesome on my end. I knew that I would get jealous because they live like 30 seconds from eachother and I live 30 minutes from them. They get to travel together and I dont. 

I am so afraid that they will become close and I would become third wheel. I dont want to be alone. And I want to hold him/love him. 
And there is nothing I can do about it. It hurts me so much. Feeling this way causes me to do everything to prevent them spending time together. 
I do it like it comes natural to me and it makes me feel like a fucking asshole. I am so scared of going into a depression again. 

I'm sorry this is something lots of you go through but I can't change the way I feel. I know it's wrong but still.

And sometimes we have this eye contact that feels so different than other times I have eye contact with people. We look at eachother so frequently but we don't smile or anything. It has this sexy vibe haha I don't know."

He is a junior and I'm a sophomore. We both attended a career fair today - I did really well. I have an interview scheduled with microsoft and amazon - I expect to get calls back from Google, Northrop Grumman, and more.

He didn't do so well and isn't expecting any interviews from top companies, and only 4 or 5 from lower ones.

The thing is... he's angry at me for it. He thinks he's better than me just because his resume is nicer (he has a 3.96 whereas I have a 3.09, he has previous internships and research whereas I don't etc). But the thing is, he seems to totally neglect the fact that I apparently have skills (eg: enthusiasm) that are desirable to employers that he lacks.

how do I get him to stop being such a baby about it?

I am very bad at talking about myself but i guess here goes nothing. 

-I am a very outgoing and fun loving person.

-I am a huge car nut, it is one of the few things i feel was able to hold my attention when i was younger and it still is one of the things i love the most. There is nothing better than to just go on a drive through the mountain passes and listen to music, its almost meditative. 

-I love to go out and do new things, with the free time i do have i try to make the most of my time and go out to enjoy everything, from working on my car to going with friends anywhere and everywhere. 

-As much as i love to go out i also love to have days where i do nothing. I can sit there and watch netflix marathons or just hang out with no plans.

Physically i am 6'2"", brown eyes and black hair, i am a not a small person but not gigantic either, i am working on it because i know i can be smaller even though i will never be a tiny person haha.

2glpsd,2,2014-09-16,Tired of letting people who don't really care about me make me feel shitty about my life choices.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2glpsd/tired_of_letting_people_who_dont_really_care/,"I just graduated from a pretty much no-name liberal arts college, and for four years I was in this Greek organization where everyone's aspirations were to be a big corporate type, with the perfect internship and perfect career trajectory. (Not that there's anything wrong with aspiring to be a senior level executive and to have lots of money, but what I can't stand is people who think that this is the only way to live, and people who don't want to be in with the Fortune 500 crowd are lazy pieces of shit and burdens on society. These are the kinds of people that these people are).

I don't know why I stayed in the organization for as long as I did, but I guess it's because I thought that their version of success was the only ""right one."" My parents, both of whom were never those kinds of people mind you, pushed me to get straight A's (which I couldn't always do), always wanted me to go into something Money Making (TM) (i.e. STEM, and I didn't, I got my degree in Literature), and to this day they nag on me for not getting into A Good School (TM). So even after they weren't pushing me, I decided to push myself and join this org that was all about creating instantly-career-ready grads, because it was the only definition of success that I knew.

I've realized as of graduating that being in this group, with all these ""friends,"" have been making me slowly miserable/insane.
Some of they say that they'll support me ""through whatever,"" and some of them I've had a lot of fun memories of partying and hangover-ing and crying-together-from-stress-ing with. But judging from the way they talk about everyone we know, I know that they look down on me for a) not having any idea what career path I should be taking, b) majoring in something that I merely enjoyed and wasn't just doing for the money, and c) not taking 18 units a semester in while aggressively pursuing an internship and working two part time jobs while also joining two clubs (a workload that almost all of them maintain and think is the standard work load for any college student regardless of circumstance).
There's one other girl in the org who isn't Doing Things Perfectly, who's half-assedly substitute teaching and just got married to her high school sweetheart of ten years. She doesn't seem to want to do anything other than be a housewife with her degree, which I sometimes consider doing and which I think is perfectly normal. But whenever get togethers happen, they all talk about her like ""I love J, but she's really let herself ago, I mean seriously, substitute teaching?"" and like ""I'm glad she at least got the teaching job, I mean what was she gonna do, sit around and pop babies out?""

And of course they'd never say any of this to her face. Later on when we're all together, they're fake-supportive to her. But seriously, every time I go to these get togethers, that's what it is: ""checking in"" on mutual friends to see who's post-grad trophy has the most bells and whistles, and shitting on people doing even remotely less better than themselves just to make themselves feel more ""successful."" (And seriously, none of us even went to a school that's even that prestigious...why the competition??? I just don't get it.) I know that my current status as an unemployed person who's living at home to work on a novel for fun, must be making them snicker at me in the exact same way, but if I wasn't paying attention to how they treat others, I'd be well able to believe that they ""loved me"" considering how they are up front.

I'm sorry that I'm the only 21 year old you people keep in your social circle who didn't immediately know what they wanted to do with their lives, and I'm sorry that I am useless to society because of that now. I know now that none of this is true, and that it's okay and normal to still need some time (maybe another two years, maybe five, I don't know) to figure out what kind of career I really feel passionate about. I just hate that I used to want to work so hard to fit in and impress these people. Now that I'm looking back, I've really let their standards become mine and it's really crippled my self esteem. Even when I'm all alone in my house, and even when the people who matter are telling me that I really am successful in their eyes, I still judge myself so harshly and consider myself a failure because for so long, I was in such a closed circle that I forgot that people outside of this circle existed, and lived, and were happy.

Some of my family members and some of the people I've met since I've graduated, ""poor people"" and college dropouts/people who didn't even go to college, have treated me so much better and so much less judgmentally than the people who were ""supposed"" to be my ideal partners and support group in college.

I really did the best that I could. Yes, sometimes it meant only working one job because that was all I could handle on top of school and being in the organization, but it doesn't mean that I'm worthless or that I wasn't really trying my hardest. Yes, sometimes that meant only taking twelve units instead of eighteen because of my depression (and the worst part is that a few of them knew that I was depressed/suicidal, and they still look down on people who can't just ""pull themselves up"" and do 8,000 things at once without getting exhausted from the physical burden that major depression can be. I've never once heard them say something like, ""hm, you know, maybe J is going through a lot right now, maybe all she can have on her plate right now is waking up, and cooking and cleaning."" never heard them be sympathetic, or willing to admit that mental illnesses can't just be wished away, like god these people have so few of my values and compassionate qualities in common what am I doing with these people)

If any of that means that I'm going to lose all of my ""friends,"" and if they can't be understanding of my pace in life and my definition of happiness, then why are they still in my life? If they really cared, then would they treat me this way? I would never judge someone that I said I cared about this way, and I don't. If they all quit their jobs tomorrow and decided to be professional stoners/fappers, it would literally have nothing to do with me so I'd be fine with it.

It'll be easier said than done to back out of this social life, as they have been my ""friends"" for three to four years, and a part of me still thinks that being surrounded by people, even if they suck, is better than feeling lonely. But I'm getting this off my chest because I'm tired of being made to feel like my simply being alive isn't enough for some people.

I do want to help society one day, and I do want to feel fulfillment in a career, probably as a self-employed artist of some sort. But I have to it slowly, only doing what I can handle, if I'm going get through this without going to that dark place where I wanted to die."
2glrjb,3,2014-09-16,I (23 M) have extreme feelings of inadequacy after looking at my recent ex's (20 F) LinkedIn.,jewfro667,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2glrjb/i_23_m_have_extreme_feelings_of_inadequacy_after/,"I'll spare the details about the break up but basically it was my first serious relationship, I was hopeful of working things out with her after getting my shit together given how we broke up but no longer hope for it because of recent events. Basically, we haven't talked since July, friend took my phone when we were drunk, texted her that I miss her and want to talk about what happened. She replied saying she moved on (which I don't really believe) and that talking wouldn't be a good idea, she isn't the same 18 year old I met and she knows more of what she wants in her life. Anyway, that last part upset me because it made it sound like I wasn't good enough for her despite how hard I tried when we were together. After that, I just gave up trying to make anything happen, gave up my hope and expectations and told myself that from here, whatever happens between us in the future I'll just deal with in the future.

So I check her LinkedIn today, see she got a new internship at a place she really wanted to be. I'm happy for her, I really am. But I just feel so inadequate now especially after that text and seeing her LinkedIn. I really do feel like I'm just not good enough for her. Some background is I recently lost the job that I got right after we broke up. So I'm job hunting now. Then I start thinking back to what her friend told me about me being the reason my ex changed, I had a bad habit, which I really didn't mean to do, of talking to her like I was so much more experienced than her, basically like my dad speaks to me. It annoyed her and I tried to stop it but I still did it occasionally. In an effort to push her to be the best, I forgot to push myself. Now not only is she on the road to success, she's possibly also thinking ""I'll show Jewfro he was wrong."" I really don't want that and I really miss her but there really is nothing I can do about it now and I gave up hope of anything happening anytime soon, if ever.

I just feel extremely inadequate now and I'm trying to push myself to be better so that I can at least say I'm on my way up when/if I ever start talking to her again. It's a shitty situation. Not to mention that she and I basically want to go into the same field so it's like I'm competing with her/will compete with her in the future. I'm trying to get my ambition back because I'm severely lacking in it and trying to get my shit together before even considering pursuing anything serious with any other woman. I just don't feel like the man I want to be or the man that she wants/fell for anymore and I want to change that for my own sake, not even for her even if I make it seem like it.

There really is a lot more I can say so if anyone wants to know specific details or something, just ask or let me know.

Edit: Jesus, you guys are harsh. I mean, I appreciate the advice but I'm really not an asshole nor did I mean to be. The instances where I talked down to her weren't exactly deliberate and I was just blunt with her, since I had a lot of problems in my own life to take care of. I did a lot more nice things than asshole things.

Ever since then I have been working on my portfolio and saving money from another job while I look around for something suitable. I am having real trouble finding something suitable. I am looking for work in an intern or graduate position, it seems most jobs in these positions are for people who work in VFX which really wasn't my strong point when I was studying.

I'm from Northern Ireland which is starting to develop more recently, though it is hard to find jobs advertised anywhere. I am willing to move to Dublin or more likely back over to England where I studied to find work. Location isn't really an isse, heck if I managed to get a relevant job on the other side of the world I would take it!

Any help would be greatly appreciated, even if someone could point me in the direction of a good website or something because the regular job websites don't really cut it.

2gm326,123,2014-09-16,"I was raped by my coach 8 years ago, and didn't realize it until now. (text wall, sorry)",tinypuppet,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2gm326/i_was_raped_by_my_coach_8_years_ago_and_didnt/,"I had previously this posted in r/offmychest, but another kind redditor suggested I post here. Sorry about the Great Wall of Text, but appreciate you reading.

When I was 17, I was on my school's diving team. My senior year, my coach raped me. I'm 25, and I'm just now starting to understand that what happened to me was, in fact, rape, and this realization is making me feel like it just happened, and it's sending me through what I imagine are the normal post-rape emotions, even though it's been eight years since it happened.

It started out with my coach offering to buy me alcohol in exchange for sexual favors. I think somewhere in the back of my mind I realized this was prostitution, but I didn't care. I didn't really physically mature until I was around 15, so I still felt like I had something to prove. I wanted to be the girl that would show up to parties with Grey Goose and Patron and Jaeger, all the stuff that we couldn't afford yet. It felt really good to have other kids want me around, instead of just tolerating me. I was 17, my coach was 23, he had tattoos, he looked great in a Speedo, and it was dangerous. I was hooked.

One day, he invited me to spend the night at his apartment. I was a virgin, and had no intention of losing my virginity to him, and I had made this very clear to him over the course of our ""relationship."" I reminded him that night before we started drinking that I did not want to have sex with him. He said it was fine.

He made some sort of orange vodka-gatorade concoction that I remember was pretty strong, but not so overwhelmingly strong that I couldn't drink it (I'm not a huge vodka fan). This is where my memory of the night starts to get pretty hazy - I don't remember how much I drank, but I've always been under the impression that I only had two drinks. I don't want to say he drugged me, because I have no proof, but I do know that I blacked out completely that night, which had never happened to me before (and has rarely happened since, even at my drunken worst), and I was no stranger to binge drinking, even at 17.

The next morning, I woke up naked in his bed, and he told me we'd had sex. I immediately did not believe him. I don't know why, but when he told me, I was so convinced he was lying that it didn't even cross my mind that it might be true. My immediate assumption was that he was telling me we'd had sex in the hopes that if I thought I'd already done it, maybe I'd do it again. This what was what I believed to be fact.

I'm now 25 and I'm still a virgin. I'm very open about this. All of my friends know, and many of my acquaintances, and they're all very accepting of it. But the question I always get asked that makes me very uncomfortable is, ""why?"" I always have answers ready: I'm waiting for the right guy, it's a religious thing, I move around a lot and relationships are tough, controlling my sexuality makes me feel like I'm in control of myself (for the more ""honest"" talks). ""I want to wait until I meet the right guy,"" I'd say. ""I want to be in a relationship when it happens, but I move around so much that I can't hold one down. So I'm just waiting until I'm settled."" These answers were never true. I wasn't lying - I just didn't know what the truth was. Now, I do.

When I think of sex, I think of him. I think about how his smile looked more like a sneer, and how his nose hooked in an ugly way, and how skinny he was. I hear his voice, which was nasally with a bit of a whine to it. I remember him looking more like a bird than a person. I remember when I was at his apartment and my friend called me hysterically crying because her best friend had been killed in a car accident, and he made me give him road head while he drove me to her house. It's the farthest thing there is from a turn-on, and I'm not interested in an activity that - regardless of how much fun it seems like it would be - makes me think of him.

I recently got a job offer in New York and moved out to the city. After years of job hunting and unpaid internships, I've finally been able to put the employment struggle behind me and focus on my other problems. But now that I'm here for good, the whole ""I move around too much to date"" excuse doesn't work for me anymore. And one day, it hit me out of nowhere - he wasn't lying that morning: he raped me, and I've spent the last eight years suppressing all emotional connections with men, refusing to date, refusing to open myself up, and refusing to even entertain the idea of having sex because I didn't want to admit to myself that I was broken. I felt so stupid - how could I have not realized this? Did other people know? Did my friends know? I sat there and cried for hours - real crying, the kind that hurts your chest so you can't breathe right, and gives you a headache so you can't do anything but sleep.

It's been weird, having realized all of this. I think of myself differently now, and I'm planning on seeking help, but the hardest part has been figuring out how I'm going to talk to people about it. I don't know how to approach it, even with my best friends, the ones who know about him (I've told my close friends about how I hooked up with my coach, but always framed it as more of a crazy story than a significant time of my life). They could think I was lying about it, or that I'm overreacting now, or that I'm just coming up with another excuse for keeping my legs perpetually shut.

This is the first time I've ever laid out the whole story like this. It felt really good to write it out. I don't know if anyone is going to read this, but if you are, I'm really thankful. You don't have to upvote or comment, I'm just glad that it's out there and someone knows.

Thanks :)

TL;DR: I ate too much ice cream and got a tummy ache :(

------

Edit: Thank you to who everyone for your kind words and thoughts. This is the first time I've ever told my story as it is, without sugarcoating it, and reading these comments is making me cry (in a good way!). Some of you know exactly how I feel because you've been through something similar, and I'm keeping you in my thoughts. 

------

Edit 2: A few people have commented expressing their opinion that this was not really rape. I agree that it may not be the best choice of word. I dislike using the phrase 'sexual assault' because I feel like 'assault' implies physical brutality, which was not the case here. Similarly, I dislike the phrase 'sexual harrassment' because I don't think it implies enough; he could simply make sexual comments towards me and that would be considered harassment. I rejected the word 'molestation' because I don't think I was young enough to be molested. I chose the word 'rape' because I felt like, thanks to media coverage and non-profit efforts, the definition of 'rape' has expanded to include a much more broad spectrum of forced sexual encounters.

[/u/dripless_cactus](http://www.reddit.com/user/dripless_cactus) left a comment using the phrase ""sexual malice."" I like this term because I think it gives a much more accurate idea of what I went through. I'll begin using this phrase from now on."
2gm54p,8,2014-09-16,Day 2,ohyeahhesdone,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2gm54p/day_2/,"Seeing so many people on this subreddit get to 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, ect... made me decide to post with the goal of hopefully being one of those people who make the 6 months to one year mark. 

I have a drug test coming up for a potential internship in accounting. I have faked drug tests before. It fucking sucks. I'm sure some of you have as well, and I am sure you know how stressful it is being in that waiting room with whatever you're about to fake the test with. I did not want to go through that again. 

While that is ""reason"" for me quitting, let me preface by saying I need to quit as well. I started smoking in 10th grade, and I was the last one in my group of friends to partake. I loved smoking from my first hit of the bowl. I became obsessed with it. I grew up in an upper-middle class neighborhood in one of the most affluent parts of the country, and the weed was DAMN good. I started selling, bought 3 bongs, and was just into the scene. 

When I got to college it was more of the same. I picked my fraternity because I smoked a blunt with a dude during rush. Fucking mistake, we got kicked off of campus after my freshman year. I moved in with a buddy who was selling weight, and when he graduated and moved out of town I took over the operation. 

Having massive amounts of weed around is not good. Without getting into to much detail, I dug myself into a hole setting myself back an entire year, if not longer, in college (changed my major, changed back). I would wake up, smoke whatever was in the bong from the night before, head to class, get home and get high. I was ripping through dabs like it was my job. About 8 months ago I decided that I was ready to dig myself out of this hole. I smashed my rig thinking that it was only the dabs, and changed my major back to accounting. I gave up selling. 

Now that internship season is almost here it is time for me to stop for good. It's been hard. My new roommate smokes and when he lit up I almost caved. The thought that kept running through my head was ""Damn, Day 1 can just be tomorrow, I know I wont smoke tomorrow."" Luckily, I didn't smoke. 

Sorry for the herky-jerky formatting. Today, I have wanted to smoke. I feel tired and listless. I think I will have cravings for a long time. In the last 6-7 years I think the longest I have gone without smoking is 2 weeks. I am ready to make this commitment and get this internship. I want to succeed, and weed was definitely holding me back.  "

He said there's not a lot of judgement here, and I don't really care. I like it, and he liked it too, so we hope you do too. 


For lack of a better word, when I was in high school I was kind of a huge whore, especially in my last two years. It's one of those weird things I found myself in and I can't really point out at what point I became this slut, but I came to the full conclusion of it one day when I was sucking some freshman's cock while his father watched while jerking himself off. I'm not depressed or fucked up or anything, I just don't know why but I'm just a horny slut that couldn't keep anything in her pants. I got good grades, had friends, no abuse in my childhood, just.. yeah. To give you an idea, I wore clothes that probably should have gotten me kicked out of school or at least given a detention, but aside from a flew slaps on the wrist I didn't get any punishment. At times I wore skintight shirts with no bra, and I wore see-through stuff all the time. Tanktop with too much cleavage, dresses that flashed everyone all the time, I'm sure I got away with it because the male teachers didn't wanna put a stop to it either. I sucked and fucked all the time and had a lot, a lot of adventures. I found myself being the “pass-around girl” for a group of guys (who I considered my friends at the time, but I don't really keep up with them anymore), and it evolved to us making ourselves into a “Psychology Club” at school and just met in an empty class after school so that I could have somewhere to give blowjobs to all of them after school. 

I've kinda gotten over the shameless cumslut role now, so it's a little crazy to think about all the stuff I've done. It feels like a second person, honestly. 

Those are all stories for another day, I guess, because this is my favorite story, the one that I have the most wet dreams about. It was in my last year of high school. Around that time I was pretty much where I am now physically; 34B cups, shoulder length brunette. I wasn't anorexically skinny, but I wasn't fat by any means either. I played basketball for my first two years, so I was pretty fit. 

Economics class, third period, was just starting when he walked into the room. He looked to be in his early 20s, super well built with a sharp face. He had one of those eyes that seemed squinty all the time. He was probably 6'1 or so. I felt that electric tinge between my legs as soon as I saw him. I wanted to rub my pussy right then and there. He introduced himself as “Mr. Cole” and as a new assistant that was here on an internship program from the nearby college. I don't even remember what he said aside from the fact that he was going to be there every Tuesday and Thursday from then on for nine weeks, because I knew right then I had nine weeks to have him. 

I started off slow, staying after the class bell had rung to talk to him. I didn't mind missing half my lunch period. At first it was with lame questions I had thought of, but after a while I would just go and talk to him, sometimes for so long that the Econ teacher would just have me staple papers and stuff to justify me being there. I got to know him a lot, and he with me as well. From about the third or fourth time staying to talk to him, I started to hug him every time I left the room. At first he resisted, and I could feel the tension, but I just told him I was being friendly and I do it all the time. 

All this time I wore the skimpiest outfits I could for Tuesdays and Thursdays. I only wore bras if they could be seen through the shirts, and I wore either the tightest yoga pants I could find, or the shortest denim shorts with no panties that gave that unmistakeable outline of my pussy and ass crack noticeable to him. A couple of times I wore dresses and intentionally flashed my panties at him multiple times, wondering if he would say anything. He did, once, coughing and saying “Uh, Ashleigh, you might wanna close your legs” to which I teased “No, I don't” but doing so anyway because the Econ teacher threw me a dirty look. 

I knew he had to be noticing me, though. It was SO easy to see that he was peeking in my skirt, or down my tanktop. I think he was holding himself back at first, but as I got more and more daring he would be more open about his looks. And every time I caught him looking, I'd either wink or give him the “Just come and fuck me” face, and he would turn away. The whole experience turned me on so much.  I knew this was breaking all of the rules which made it that much more exciting. One day, as I hugged him to leave, he reached around and cupped my ass, immediately apologizing with a “Whoops, sorry about that”. But I knew he wasn't sorry, and I knew he did it on purpose. Perfect, I thought. 

About a week before he left, I was talking to him in the room when he asked me if it was all right with me if he asked me some “extra questions”. My heart skipped a beat, and I think he could see my nipples harden through my shirt. I remember what I was wearing that day, a light blue shirt that was a size too small for myself, no bra, and white yoga shorts with blue panties. I told him of course he could. He said he'd like to do it in the teacher's lounge so as to not disturb our Econ teacher, so I agreed and followed him to the teacher's lounge. He greeted some of the teachers there, grabbed his bag from the corner, and took me into a conference room. 

The tension was incredible. This was different than other guys I had seduced in the past. Usually, I know they want it, or they know I want it, and we would just kinda find ourself fucking or sucking. But that time with Cole, it was both of us finally realizing that this may be the time for things to happen. I was a little afraid to make the first move, because I was scared he was actually just here to ask me more questions (or he was gay). 

“You can make yourself comfortable,” he said, so I sat on top of the conference table. He took a seat a few seats down from where I sat, took out a piece of paper, and started asking me some questions. It was about the curriculum, the workload, etc. One was about how I felt about him. I replied I thought he was a great guy and gushed a little. He gave me a look, then, and I gave him my best “Yes, please, for the love of all that is holy, just fuck me right now.” He was pacing around the room at this point, and I noticed that he locked the door. I smiled at him and started walking towards him. 

“I still have a question, Ashleigh,” he said, getting closer. My heart was racing. He grabbed me by the hips and sat me down on the desk again. I let out a small moan as he picked me up, right into his ear. He stood right in front of me, my legs a little spread and him standing in between them, looking down at me. 

“My question is, I wanna know what that pussy feels like.” At that moment, he thrust his hand into my  shorts, under my underwear, and slammed his index finger into my pussy. It slid in with no resistance, my pussy soaking wet from the past 15 minutes. I let out a small yelp but he shushed me, looking at the door. He took a second to pull down my pants and panties. He pumped his finger in and out of my pussy almost angrily, soon moving on to moving his middle finger in as well. It was like he was mad at me, and I guess I understood.. I did just torment him for a couple weeks. I collapsed into his body as each slam of his finger sent a jolt of electricity through me. “God, fuck my pussy, fuck my pussy,” I kept repeating in his ear. Each time I said it, I felt like he hit me harder. I pulled his hand out of my cunt and sucked it clean. 

“Fuck, you're dirty,” he said. “You don't even know,” I replied. He put his fingers back inside of me, and I begged him to finger fuck my pussy, my dirty fuck hole, punish me for being a slut. He went in hard and fast, the wet noises obviously at this point not being stopped by a locked door. In hindsight, I hope nobody heard. It felt amazing. I felt an orgasm start coming, but he got tired and slowed down. 

I hopped off the desk, got on my knees, and before I could even get to it he was pulling his belt off and his pants down. I pulled his boxers down and, almost without even looking at it, thrust his perfect shaved cock in my mouth. I pushed it in my throat immediately, feeling all seven or so inches of him penetrate my mouth. I held myself, my nose smashing against his body, as long as I could. I pulled out, spat on his cock, my hands, and started jerking him off almost as hard as he was fingering me. As I switched back and forth between sucking and jerking him off, he got bolder with what he was saying. “You dress like a fucking slut, I knew you were one.” “God you're a dirty fucking whore.” “You fuck everyone in the school?” I loved it all. I was no longer myself, some weird possessed self that just lived to pleasure this man. He spat on my face and I used his cock to lather it on my face. 

As I was sucking him off, he suddenly bucked and shot a load right into my mouth. He motioned to pull out of my mouth but I forced myself in, making his cock shoot his hot jizz right in my throat. It felt good. It was delicious. I swallowed it all and kept sucking him, tantalizing his head with my tongue. He was breathing hard, moaning a little even, and as I kept sucking him off he let out a little grunt, forced himself out of my mouth, and slapped my face. “Fuck, bitch, I was done,” he said. I said a mock apology. 

I wanted him to fuck me there, but it was clear he was beat. I wanted to say something more to him but he just pulled up his pants, immediately gathered his stuff, and marched out of the room. I got myself together and went to lunch. 

After that, he wouldn't make eye contact with me even at class. He would leave the class immediately after the period was over, and that was the last I saw of him. Oh well. 

I hope you guys liked it! "
2gmjn5,6,2014-09-16,I have no idea what's going on anymore,ChrysippusDonkeyFig,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2gmjn5/i_have_no_idea_whats_going_on_anymore/,"Don't know if this belongs here. Apologies if it doesn't.

I'm an engineering student in an internship. It's fun and challenging work and I like it.
The past few days have had me working overtime because we're running behind schedule for a product, so I've been a bit tired.

I am still living with my family because housing is expensive as hell. I like it here too, because most of the time I am left to my own devices to program or draw or something. My mother cooks very well, and I am happy that I have a roof over my head and food in my belly. I try to repay my family by babysitting my brother, filling up the car with gas, doing any errands I'm asked to, and asking my family how their day was every day when I come back.

My internship is ending in a few months, but it slides right into another one, so I am applying for jobs.

This conversation happens at the dinner table. My mother begins.

    ""How is your job search going?""

    ""Pretty well. I've applied to three so far.""
 
    ""Have you applied to any international jobs?""

    ""Not yet. I'd prefer to stay in this city; it'd be easier to contact my school and I have a lot of friends here.""

    ""You're lazy.""

    ""What?""

    ""You're just too lazy to move, so you don't want to apply for a job outside the city.""

    ""Well, no, I just said I'd prefer to stay here if I could.""

    ""Why? Don't you care about your future?""

    ""I'm saying is that if I can get the same experience while also staying in the city, that'd be a plus.""

    ""No, you said you'd prefer to stay in the city, because you are lazy.""

    ""Well, if someone asked you to pack up and move and not be able to contact anyone from this city for a year, would you just take it?""

    ""If I were you, I would. You're young, you have no children, you're single (Note: I'm not, but my mother doesn't consider my girlfriend a ""real"" girlfriend because we're not getting married soon), the only reason you don't go is because you're lazy.""

    ""Well, I said I'd prefer to stay here. Why does that make me lazy?""

    ""No, I said you were lazy at moving.""

    ""No, you said I was lazy, period. How come you get to say things like that to me? Nothing I do is good enough for you. I'm honestly starting to think that nothing I do, ever, will satisfy you, and I can't keep trying to if that's the case.""

    ""You always like to pick a fight. You have mental problems.""

After hours and hours at work, that kind of stings. Moreso when she turns to my little brother and repeats to him right then and there, with me still at the table, that his older brother is lazy and mentally retarded.

Thing is, underneath all of that she has a point; going abroad expands my opportunities. But this pattern has happened all too often: we talk about something, she makes a good point but coats it in just enough negativity where I feel sad but not enough so that I feel justified about being sad. Then I freeze up, because I'm not really sure what to say in response.

I don't know what to think anymore. I don't know if I'm justified in feel really angry when I speak with my parents, because my family has sacrificed a lot for me and they've financially supported me for most of my life. I want to communicate with them, but I don't know if they want to communicate with me, because it feels like my mother has the idea in her head that no matter what, she knows better than me, because I am a stupid child. I don't know if she's wrong and it's slowly killing me."
2gmksn,6,2014-09-16,"We have been nevermets for 6 years. Please help, how can I see him?",love-strong,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/2gmksn/we_have_been_nevermets_for_6_years_please_help/,"**TL;DR**: He is amazing and perfect (no seriously). It's been 6 years and we’ve never met. I want to see him so badly but it’s complicated (culture etc). How? (also I live in US and he is in Canada)

Okay first let me preface this by telling you how amazing my love is. I love him with such ferocity. We met through an online game clan, and talked on IRC every single day (yes, every single one). For hours on end. He has taught me so many things: that women and men are the same, how to love someone, how to treat someone… This is the only experience with a relationship I’ve had so pardon me if I sound like I’m stupid and naïve but seriously, he treats me *so goddamn right*. We have ***never***, I repeat, ***never*** had a fight. There has never been any cruelty or ill will in this relationship, it is beautiful and wonderful. If we are frustrated (note: not angry, not resentful, just frustrated) about something we just talk about it. And it’s so freaking chill. We have regular amazing cyber sex and he even acts out my weird fucked up fetishes with me! This man is so perfect and amazing. A rational, genuine, empathizing, human being. I truly feel like this relationship is the shining example, the very definition, of love. Sorry if that sounds like I’m arrogant or bragging but *seriously holy shit*. We’ve been like this for 6 years. And I’m young so that’s almost *half of my fucking life*.

I just wanted to tell you how lovely he is and how important he is to me.

So this started when I was very young; I was about 12-13 and he was 16-17. But please don’t talk about that. The only reason I bring it up is because it was illegal and so I had to keep it a secret for this entire time. On top of that, he’s from a different culture (Muslim). His family would absolutely under no circumstances approve of us. This is why we have never ever been able to meet. Even Skype conversations and such are difficult and must be planned/hidden. It is risky and he could get disowned from his family if they found out about me. Now I am 18 and he is 22 but he still lives with his parents (he has internship + college to finish) so it is still pretty much impossible. He says he would like to be independent before we meet and that won’t be until he graduates at least. Also, his family is of the culture that expects the child to live with them and provide for them too… so moving out on his own will be a shitstorm. 

Now, because of this, there have been hard times. We started out exclusive, as boyfriend and girlfriend. But this didn’t work because I would be aching so hard to see him, it hurt so much (it still does). So, he told me to go find other guys. He told me we’ll probably never see each other, or if we will, it will take years so I might as well date other people in the meantime. I had crushes and stuff and told him about them, but due to crippling social anxiety irl nothing ever happened. So for about 4 years or so our relationship has been “open” I guess, and I never thought of him as my official “boyfriend”. But yet he was always my best friend and lover.

When I started to recover from my social anxiety and things got flirty with someone, we would sorta prepare to break off just in case. But still, nothing happened. Until college. A few weeks ago I was hanging with this guy that I had met a few months before who I kinda liked/thought was cute. Anyways, I cuddled with him. Afterwards I felt so sick. I didn’t want that. I realized I don’t want to let my lover go. Sorry if it seems that escalated fast, but I really feel nauseous when I think of other people now. It’s a big change for me because I used to have crushes and I could fantasize but now I can’t do it anymore.

So now I feel even closer to him now and it hurts a lot again, not being able to see him. Just what do I do? I need to make this happen somehow, I need to see him. I bring it up again every once in a while but he always refuses because he says it’s too risky. Please help me. I don’t know what I’m going to do. I love him with all the strength of my soul and I don’t even believe in souls.

Also I live in the US and he lives in Canada.

Gooooooooood evening, race fans!  We're back on the air with a new broadcasting suite, an intern without a jack itch, and an engineer fresh out of the state penitentiary!

Now that it's been four weeks, and twice the average lifespan of your street runner, who here remembers **Vitabeans**?  Yes, that barely-legal crap that lasted on the shelves for a whopping eight days before being yanked away by the Man and barred from selling to the next guy looking for a buzz is back in the news!  It looks like we dodged an Assault Cannon round with this one, chummers!

&gt;&lt;&lt;**THE MANHATTAN ZIGGURAT - ALL YOUR INFORMATION BELONGS TO US**&gt;&gt;

&gt;**TRADING HOUSE INDICTED IN DRUG SCANDAL**

&gt;Powerful Wall Street broker under UCAS investigation after injuries on floor

&gt;**MANHATTAN** - Famed trading house Duke &amp; Duke was indicted in front of a federal court today as investigators uncovered a cache of previously-banned amphetamines that were sold for a short time on the open market.

&gt;The substances known as ""Vitabeans"" were uncovered in large quantities due to an anonymous tip after one of the traders had what witnesses described as a ""psychotic episode"" on the stock trading floor.

&gt;Claiming a 'vile and underhanded conspiracy against this great House,' founders Randal and Mortimer Duke were arraigned on charges of drug trafficking in UCAS Circuit Court.  Bail has been set at ¥1,500,000,000 for each founder.

&gt;Vitabeans, a nutritional supplement sold in most Stuffer Shack® franchises, was removed from the market after the UCAS Food and Drug Administration issued an immediate ban on the product.  Darleen Chandreskhajar, spokesperson at the FDA, said the chemical analysis was disturbingly familiar.

&gt;""It was a derivative of Long Haul,"" she said.  ""Long Haul cut with sucrose and soy flavoring.""

&gt;The supplement was linked to nearly two dozen hospitalizations across UCAS, CAS, and tribal lands in the span of approximately six days.  Symptoms of those affected by Vitabeans overdose include muscle tremors, synthesia, dilated pupils and aural hallucinations.

So...I hope none of you guys really payed attention to the ad, right?  &lt;nervous laugh&gt;

&gt;**K-E INVESTIGATING THREE OVERNIGHT ARSONS IN WEST SEATTLE**

&gt;Officers were called to assist firefighters of Franklin Associates for three suspected arsons in West Seattle overnight.

&gt;Knight-Errant received a call just before midnight Friday, after two witnesses saw a dwarf set fire to a dumpster full of mannequin limbs in the 4300 block of SW Admiral Way.  The witnesses yelled at the suspect just before he ducked between two buildings and fled.

&gt;At the scene, officers spoke with witnesses and firefighters and learned someone had set another fire earlier that night in a dumpster in the 4100 block of SW Admiral Way. Bystanders had extinguished the earlier fire before firefighters arrived. Melted lumps of plastic were found in the dumpster, along with traces of runic markings.

&gt;About two hours later, around 2 AM, K-E units were called to the scene of a third arson in the 3200 block of California Avenue SW after someone set fire to abandoned factory building, scheduled for demolition.

&gt;Knight-Errant Arson and Bomb Squad detectives are working with Franklin Associates to investigate these incidents. Witnesses who spotted the dwarf fleeing the fire in the 4300 block of SW Admiral Way described him as a white dwarf male, 4’6”, wearing a gray and white striped jacket and khaki shorts.

&gt;**ROBBER DRAGS WOMAN WHEN FLEEING FROM SCENE OF BITTER LAKE ROBBERY**

&gt;A woman told police she was dragged down the street by a robbery suspect Sunday night as he drove away with her purse.

&gt;The 43-year-old victim was walking near N. 135th and Aurora Avenue North shortly before 10 pm when the suspect—described only as a dusky-skinned elf male with short hair—pulled up alongside her on a green Yamaha Rapier.

&gt;The suspect leaned out and grabbed the woman’s purse before he cranked the throttle and began to drive away.

&gt;The victim’s cyber hand locked up and refused to let go of her purse. The victim was dragged two city blocks by the suspect, who eventually fled with the woman’s purse, wallet and an antique, mobile flip phone mistaken for a brick by onlookers.

&gt;The woman sustained serious injuries and may have damaged her wrist fixture in the incident.  Medics transported the woman to Northwest Hospital for treatment. Representatives from Shiawase are currently investigating whether the prosthetic actually malfunctioned, or the victim concocted a lie to recoup her losses in a convenient lawsuit. 
Yee-owch, Seattle.  Well, maybe she can talk to Greasy Joe if the insurance claim falls through, eh?  Half price on eyes through the end of the month!

Where was I?  RIGHT!  Seattle, keeping with the race theme of this week's broadcast, I have a *primo* bit of information for you today.  It seems the data filters found a **confidential security bulletin** involving two of the most favored employers and suppliers in the Shadows of Seattle.

That's right, the Cutters, and the Ancients.  Check it out...

&gt;&lt;&lt;**NIGHTWATCH SECURITY BULLETIN - GO-GANG ACTIVITY ACROSS SEATTLE**&gt;&gt;

&gt;by **Capt. Andrew Ten-Feathers, Executive Officer, Nightwatch Analysis Branch**	

&gt;All forces should be advised that during the recent data analysis completed September 16, inter-gang violence between the main bodies of Cutters and Ancients has been reduced by nearly 18%.  This improvement in safety to well under our violence KPI for the quarter - if sustained - can almost be completely attributed to the Analysis Branch and its ability to detect the trends in imminent violence.  Our predictive algorithms have been able to intercept gangs of Cutters before they can initiate violence with groups of the Ancients in meeting areas.  Security intervention has caused multiple deescalations of criminal activity with both groups leaving in different cardinal directions almost as Knight-Errant Nightwatch patrols arrive.

&gt;Forces should also be advised that a resurgence of activity in Puyallup has uncovered a colony of Kreiger-strain infectees.  Biozyme teams should take care in the area to ensure hostiles are properly sanitized before security contractors begin a sweep-and-clear of the block.  

&gt;Local clinics in the area have offered to bivouac injured officers and civilians in their facilities.  Analysis Branch recommends utilizing this resource for civilians, leaving professional medical care available for Nightwatch officers.

Peace?  Between the *Cutters* and the *Ancients*?  Something isn't right, and it doesn't involve as much of the Knights in Blue as they like to think.  But that's just the musings of Yours Truly, Mister Seattle Tonight.

Still no word out of Ares for a spellslinger named Jimmy who got snagged last week. If anyone knows about one of our fellows who's doing hard time, let Yours Truly know so we can put that matter to bed.

That is about all we have time for this week!  Jerry is frantically waving at his watch and Fritz keeps looking to the door with a pizza brochure in his hand, so Dominion is about to raid the studio!  That being said, let me leave you with some advice:

Drive on the right, pass on the left.  Make sure your tires are aired up and you've got a mag loaded in your piece on the seat next to you.  And finally, treat everything Johnson says as a lie and you will be right 90% of the time.

2gmmhs,1,2014-09-16,HTNGAF about comparing myself to my friends?,[deleted],howtonotgiveafuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/2gmmhs/htngaf_about_comparing_myself_to_my_friends/,"A little background to the story:

I’m a 20 y/o in my 3rd year of university. Two of my friends from highschool are in the same program as I am, while the rest of my group of friends are attending universities elsewhere.  

My two friends in the same program became very competitive with me even though I didn’t feel the same way.  Both of them are actually quite intelligent and were able to land some pretty awesome internships, while for me… not so much. However, that didn’t really matter to me until we hung out with the rest of my friends from highschool during new years, etc.

Whenever we’re together with others, the two of them would talk nonstop about their jobs/successes and would even sometimes subtly talk down to me in front of the group (and in front of the girl I like). This actually began to make me feel really insecure about myself, and I started to distance myself from all my friends because the two of them were always invited to the get-togethers.

Before I found this sub, I realized that I had to be more confident about myself and decided to go on a backpacking journey over the summer. It was amazing. I was able to take everything off of my mind and realize how small my problems were as I explored different cities and talked to many strangers. But this confidence was soon destroyed, as I’m back in school and forced to constantly interact with the two of them since we’re in the same classes.

I think my travelling has mellowed me down to not care quite as much as before, but I still can’t help comparing myself to the two o f them. This has been eating away at me for so long already and I’ve even become too nervous to talk to the girl I like because of the way I’ve been shamed in front of her. 

Is there any advice you guys can give me to stop giving a fuck?

2gn5o9,6,2014-09-17,Yet Another Business,thejedislayer,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/2gn5o9/yet_another_business/,"I've wanted to get into the IT field for a few years now. It's only recently that I've come to the point in my life where I now feel confident in my abilities to perform the services required of a desktop support technician. Having said that, I've attempted to get out of my dead-end job at McDonald's and attempt to seek employment within my city (Kettering, Ohio) as a desktop support technician - the pickings are slim around here to say the least. 
	
I've tried applying to most, if not all, the mortar computer repair stores, including seeking employment at larger companies, such as a company called Reynolds &amp; Reynolds, to no success in finding a job - not even an internship. Recently, there was a man on this subreddit, who also said that he lives in Ohio and has tried to find work himself as a desktop support technician, but has unfortunately not had any luck beyond less than a year's experience before leaving his former employer.
	
With that said, I've decided that with no other options available, at least none that I can presently see, I have decided to go into business for myself. Realizing that many start ups fail, that I may not find success no matter how hard I try, I accept these realities because I want to show initiative on my part to a future, potential employer. If all I get is one or two on-site calls a month, then at least that is experience I can put on my resume beyond just fixing computers for friends and family. I realize that computer repair businesses, such as the one I am starting, are not as successful as they once were, because now every kid can 'fix' their parent's PC, but I am resolved to do this as a step along the way to get out of my current job.
	
What I am attempting to do now is create a base for myself where I have the tools I need to start my business. Over the past few months, I have begun to collect a wide assortment of different tools that are essential to a desktop technician's tool bag, including live CDs, screw drivers, cables, replacement computer parts, Technibble's business kit, a computer testbed, even finishing up on building a NAS to serve as a backup for client's data when in the shop, as it were. On top of this, I have looked into filing for my own LLC, tax EIN, etc, as well as looking into ways of advertising myself through Ad Words, business cards, Angie's list, and perhaps even Craig's list.
	
Today, I want to ask for advice from those who have done their own start ups about the difficulties you faced along the way, what you could have improved upon, and how you interacted with your clients, such as having them always sign contracts as opposed to only the first few times, etc. Recently, I discovered two very informative threads here that answer many of my questions, but questions still linger on, such as how to interact with a long-time client as opposed to someone I just met, etc. Basically, I would love to hear your stories, failures or successes, in order to learn what I am getting myself into and the expectations I can expect or not.

TL;DR Looking to start up my own on-site computer repair business, and would love to hear your stories about your successes, failures, and what you did wrong and what you got right.

The two links to the other threads I've found on this subreddit: [Thread one](http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/12acox/starting_my_own_pc_repair_business/) : [Thread two](http://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/2eniy0/so_you_want_to_start_your_own_repair_biz/)

Thank you all in advance; I look forward to hearing your stories.

**[10 Disturbing Vault Backstories](http://imgur.com/gallery/smynh)**

---

**1. The Disneyland Cash Vault: 1970, Anaheim, California.**

Disneyland has only had two cases of finding bodies of children who were never reported missing. The first case, in 1970, sparked a controversy that almost closed the park forever. Two female interns, employed by the park, had hatched a plan to steal almost a quarter million dollars. Over a long holiday weekend while the banks were closed and the park was generating above average revenue, the would be thieves's plan was launched. It is unclear how they were able to get the key to the park president's office or the combination to the vault. When security arrived, they found the two women crying hysterically, trying hurriedly to place stacks of hundred dollar bills back into the vault. In their attempts to verify whether any cash was in fact missing, authorities found that the bills lining the bottom of the vault were ruined by some substance which appeared to have been dried and solidified over many years. In the very back of the 5'5"" by 5' vault, they uncovered the skeleton of a small child, estimated to be four years old at its time of death. To this day, the child's identity, as well as the cause of death remain shrouded in mystery.

**2\. Coca-Cola's Recipe Vault: 1931, Atlanta, Georgia.**

For 125 years, the Coca-Cola Company has been producing its signature product, now recognizable around the world and selling more than a billion products per day. Often the subject of urban legend, Coca-Cola's secret recipe was considered to be the best-kept trade secret of the 20th century. In 1931, in the midst of the great depression and a world war, another type of feud was plaguing the newly emerged industry of soda pop. Due in large part to the advent of national product marketing campaigns, this war would set the stage for the infamous ""Cola Wars"" of the 1980's. Pepsi-Cola had already risen and fallen into bankruptcy, however its name still lingered sweetly on the lips of many. Charles G. Guth, a ruthless businessman and owner of the Loft Candy Co., bought Pepsi-Cola with the intent of reworking the recipe. After several failed attempts and massive financial losses, Guth and three of his employees made an attempt to break into the Coca-Cola Co.'s vault and steal the recipe. The group entered the building through a rear window at midnight, carrying sticks of dynamite under cover of darkness. Disaster struck the group as the explosives detonated prematurely, killing two of Guth's men instantly. Undeterred, and amazingly uninterrupted, Guth and the remaining man managed to pry the vault door the rest of the way open. From Hugh Maxwell's personal account, published in the December, 1931 edition of the *Atlanta Constitution*:

&gt;""The recipe we sought was nowhere to be found. Together, we freed the door of its hinges. Inside was black as molasses, and our lanterns never lit the far wall. As [Charles Guth] passed his toe across the threshold, there was a flash like gunpowder. I reckoned some of the dynamite had gone untapped, and Mr. Guth had been wounded. He stood, stock still as a statue, staring into the inky blackness, before he told me to run. I can't say what he saw in that flash, but he'd never been the same after.""

No charges were ever filed against Guth or the other men of his party."

Waking up and crawling out-of bed is such a struggle at 8am in the summer. I couldn't find a good internship so now I'm stuck working for my uncles land shaping business. I absolutely hate it, long days in the sun and hardly any breaks. 

Today the sun is streaming down with high humidity making it almost impossible to breathe during work. Everyone is in an awful mood. Today we are working out side the local business center in down town with lots of fun little shops inside. 

As the day wares on my sanity is straining and my attention is slipping. That is until I look up and notice you. Nice and young and fit. Nice tight body. But what really captures my eye is the way your tits are bouncing in your tight white t-shirt. I am absolutely mesmerized so much so that you catch me staring as sweated rips down my body. You smile a little bit and scurry inside. 

All day I can't stop thinking about you. I need to see you again. I keep checking the door hoping to see you walk out. Finally I look up and see you! But I've missed you, all I can see is you ass peaking out of your Jean shorts. Slightly disappointed I get back to work. 

This becomes a pattern, every day at noon you shown up and leave at 4 and like clockwork I stop and stare. I normally don't do this sort of thing, but you have me under so sort of spell. I can't get enough. The thought of grabbing your body with my rough hands and having my way with you is what gets me through the day. One day finally I walk inside the mall to go to the bathroom and while walking out I bump into someone. 

""Oh oh! My god! I'm so sorry I uh didn't mean to! I'll look where I'm going! "" I can't believe I just hit you! 

| you can respond and keep the story going or we can talk about what ages we want to be and any kinks we like before hand! My hard limits are scat and blood and incest. I live cum play and light bandage and light non con, I can work with anything but my hard limits! Can't wait to hear from you! |"
2gnz1y,70,2014-09-17,I found the condom.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2gnz1y/i_found_the_condom/,"Over the summer I traveled to intern somewhere, and found a group of other interns to hang out with regularly.

Slowly, gradually, steadily, sexual tension grew between my flatmate and one the girls we hung out with often.

Near the end of the summer she spent the night frequently, but he said they never had sex.

On the second-to-last weekend she was going to spend the night again, and I gave a condom because he didn't have any. Apparently that night they didn't have sex, but he didn't give the condom back.

On the very last day of our lease, the Saturday after the last day of our internship, I woke up at 5am to see everyone off for their early flights. I found my flatmate and the friend I mentioned earlier in a pillow fort they made on the couch. Thought nothing of it.

After they left I headed to sleep again; my flight was at 10 that night.

When I got up I was alone. The apartment had no evidence that anyone had even lived there. The whole complex was a ghost town and it was sad to be there. I decided I'd just clean up and head out early over to a friend's whose internship lasted longer so I didn't get sentimental.

And while cleaning up, under the couch, I found it. The condom I had lent my flatmate before. Just the wrapper.

**FUCK YEAH YOU TWO.**

Edit: to clarify, ""fuck yeah"" means something like ""you go guys""

I just didn't want to tell anyone because my flatmate told me they considered it private when I congratulated the two of them."
2go2vc,26,2014-09-17,My [21F] boyfriend [21M] of almost 3 years doesn't want me to visit him while on his study abroad.,leighbee93,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2go2vc/my_21f_boyfriend_21m_of_almost_3_years_doesnt/,"Hey guys. So my boyfriend and I are both entering our senior year at college. We are both from very different places (US and Canada, West coast, east coast) and have had to do long distance during summers in the past. When we are together, the two of us have an awesome relationship; but when we've been apart during the summers, I've found it a lot harder to do long distance than he does.

Naturally, when he told me he wanted to do a study abroad in his final year, I took it kind of hard. He assured me he wanted to stay together during the time apart. It was one thing to be apart for the summers, but during the school year? We were such a huge part of each other's university experience; I couldn't imagine being at school without him. I was staying in my college town for the summer, so I reasoned that he should also try and get a job for the summer, so we won't be apart for 8 months straight--instead, he took an internship in the middle of nowhere.

Logically, I can understand why he made the choices he did. We started dating right at the beginning of first year, so it makes sense to want to go out and explore on his own a bit. I should have been a much more supportive girlfriend. Instead, I let his decisions affect my happiness and I spiralled into a dark period of negativity this past summer. We talked everyday, and each conversation I was jealous, mean, and insecure. I was not a fun person to talk to. 

We met up at the end of the summer, and I brought up how we would coordinate visiting while he was on exchange (something he promised me we would do from the start). He admitted he wasn't sure he wanted me to come if I was going to be the same negative person I was this summer. After a few more days he told me he was sorry he said that, and of course he wanted me to come. We patched it up, whatever.

Fast forward a week, he's at his exchange and I haven't heard from him too much (I wholeheartedly trust him; he's just busy settling in and only has texting/internet at home). I asked him about visiting, and he says he's not sure he'll have time, there will be a place for me to stay, etc. I got really frustrated at that point, realizing: whats the point of being in a relationship with someone who doesn't even want me around? I told him this and decided we shouldn't talk for a week in order to reevaluate things. The next week, we talk and he says he was sorry, I didn't give him enough time to settle in, of course he wants me to come visit... but I think he's saying this stuff for me, not him. I think that, given the choice, he would rather I didn't come and we just pick stuff up where we left off when he's back. He sees this visit as the only way to keep the relationship going, so he's doing it for my sake.

I can kind of understand his point of view--it makes sense he wants to have an experience that is entirely his own. But not wanting to share it with me at all? That really hurts. I love this guy, he definitely loves me, he says he just needs space. But isn't 4000 miles space enough? I want to go. Everyone says I'm worth something and I shouldn't be at his beck and call. Want to know what you guys think.

edit: My roommate did this same exchange last year, and can personally attest to the fact that it is super easy to coordinate visiting--he's living at a research centre with extra rooms that are $20 bucks a night. The workload's also considerably lighter than actual school, in her experience.
---   
tl;dr: Boyfriend and I are 5 months in to an 8 month ldr. We've had a rocky summer and now that he's starting his exchange he told me he didn't want me to come. A week later, he changed his mind, apologized and says he just needed time to settle in. Tired of being at his beck and call. Do I go?"
2go4s4,4,2014-09-17,How to heal a broken heart when you both still love eachother.,kimballin18,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2go4s4/how_to_heal_a_broken_heart_when_you_both_still/,"I am 20 and my ex is 21. We have been in a very serious commited relationship for 4 years. He was my first kiss (first everything) he had many previous sexual partners before me but never a commited relationship. We broke up just 2 days ago and I am really needing some advice/support. 

Being that I was 16 and he was 17 we have really grown together. But we both have had a gut feeling about experiencing other people just because we got serious so young, and now we are at that transitional stage. I moved away to college. He moved an hour an a half away from me for an internship. 

I have my future pretty planned out. I want to fishish school in Occupational Therapy(3 more years) then move to california and pursue my dance dreams in California. He worries about me dancing because of jealousy reasons but will still support me. He wants to go to school for collision repair (2 more years) and eventually open up his on buisness. But he is not really sure what and when or how he is going to go about things. So he is lost and not really sure how to go about things.

This past year he has just pushed me away on a emotional level. I haven't felt that strong connection from him. More just like we are best friends. He came to me and said that he has pushed me away so far because he wasn't being a man enough to express his feelings. He loves me so much but in 5 years or so when we are married he feels he will regret not experiencing other people in his college age. He also told me that he knows that I deserve the best and he is willing to give that to me but at this point in his life he can't give it to me right now. 

I have felt extremely depressed and just painful. I feel as though I am losing so much. Almost like it is a death of someone. But in the same breath I feel such a sense of freedom. One second I am okay and another I am a mess. I took him off social media and changed his name in my phone to PAIN. I am trying to stay strong and not text or call him. Because I know this is what is best and if I want to be happy with him or another man one day I need to follow through. 

Any advice? I don't want to jump into any relationships. Is it normal to want to have one night stands? Just as rebounds? Ugh. I want to get through this day by day. I want to become the best person I can be and grow and learn from this. How do I keep moving foward?

I have a career fair coming up this Friday and I am pretty lost so I could use all the help I can get.

I am currently working on making a polished resume but I have some questions as this is my first real networking event.

A little background: I'm 20 y/o with a part-time job at a Healthcare IT company in NYC where I do internal accounting basically. I have been working there for more then 2 years now.

My job consists of A/P, A/R, credit card reconciliations, invoicing and managing 120+ clients, expense reports, booking travel, hardware and purchase orders, and things of that nature.

I like everybody else am interested in landing an internship opportunity with one of the big 4 but have no idea how to go about it.

I need some help working on an ""elevator"" or introduction pitch I can use while introducing myself to the various companies at the fair. I don't know how to market my current job as a strength to the recruiters. I don't really have any extra cirriculars on my resume and my GPA is very sub par (2.9 currently, expected to go up a bit after this semester).

Basically I'm looking for any advice/help that will help me excel at the fair on friday."

2go8cg,2,2014-09-17,Should I Consider This New Job?,millipedetamer,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/2go8cg/should_i_consider_this_new_job/,"Hey guys, I would like your advice on something. Currently, I'm a senior in college who will be graduating this May with a Bachelor's Degree. I currently am working two jobs.

The first job is with a Silicon Valley tech company (can't say which one) doing a variety of promotion and training work on my college campus. I don't work that often, but I enjoy it, make my own schedule, and it really helps with my social anxiety. I want to get a job full-time with this company after I graduate, and will be applying for a variety of positions within them, including a lot of software engineering positions.

The second job I work is at the University lab that's modeled after a creative agency. We make web and mobile apps for researchers and some area non-profit organizations. I helped start this ""lab"" about a year and a half ago as a freshman. Originally, I was in charge of a lot of things, including interviewing, presentations, coding standards, and project management. Now, we have a full-time Lead Developer and a Project Manager who handle those things. The problem being, I'm not happy with either of them. They're incredibly condescending at times, unwilling to listen to the ideas of any student staff, and have reduced my duties down to simply coding with occasional outreach. My title is a ""Lead Developer"" and I get paid significantly more than my co-workers for this, but I don't feel many times like my work is appreciated. Also, many of the apps either fall through on the business side or there's so much politics behind them that employers won't be able to see them on the market when I graduate.

Recently, an opportunity came about at a job fair I was at. I was actually at the fair to promote Silicon Valley tech company, but decided to come early to mingle. I ended up talking with a recruiter at an area e-Commerce development agency. They're really popular, have a decent work culture, and while I don't feel like e-Commerce is in my future plans, they would help me build more skills and talent before I graduate. I'm actually proud of myself too for being able to have an awesome conversation about my skills without boasting and also portraying myself accurately as the fun person I am who codes.

The recruiter mentioned their Software Engineering Internship and that I would be a great fit for it. I agreed, and she is in the process of sending me more information. If I like how the internship sounds, I am definitely going to apply.

It would also pay me more than I'm making. However, I still feel somewhat loyal to the lab - like it's something I started and don't want to leave. I also don't want to burn bridges nor my coding portfolio. That's one part of me. The other part of me is saying I should vary my experiences, get this internship, and hopefully it will help me post graduation and boost my talent. I'm not sure which route I should take, and I feel like an aspie point-of-view on this would help. Does anyone have any advice or words for me?"
2goee8,1,2014-09-17,[23M] Girlfriend and I broke up recently [22F] dating for 2+ years....confused what to do next?,skybreeezy3,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2goee8/23m_girlfriend_and_i_broke_up_recently_22f_dating/,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 2+ years and of those 2+ years, only the past 2-3 months have been tough. It was basically a match made in heaven as we both met at college. I recently graduated and started a full time job in Philadelphia (where we both went/go to school) and she is entering her senior year. We both played on sports teams at schools and were one of the stars of each team respectively. She recently got kicked off the team for unknown reasons that the coach kind of made up and used her as an example. To both of us, sports were our lives and as you can imagine she was devastated and depressed as the team was her friends at school and most all of them turned there backs on her when she needed them the most. 

It was her roommates/teammates who made up information to get her kicked off the team so for the past 6 months, I let her move in with me for free to get away from those people. I didn't make her pay rent/utilities/groceries or anything as I know she is depressed and does not have a job. 

At this time, she seemed to smother me a bit, always yearning for my attention which I was happy to give her. However, she recently was on an internship during the spring/summer when i was going through my final term of school. I barely had classes so the roles reversed and I became a bit clingy. But things seemed fine. Once her internship was over, she went home for the final 2 months of the summer to enjoy the beach. We began to grow apart in the past 3 months having ZERO sexual or physical actions as she always said she wasn't in the mood because of her depression.

Let me first state that I knew she was depressed, and did everything she asked to make her happy always putting her before us. I did everything and anything she asked during any kind of hardship and never asked for anything in return. 

So, she recently went home for the summer, when all the sudden her grandfather passed away (expected but never easy to come to reality when it happens). After trying to console her over the phone and saying that I will come up for the funeral etc, she calls me the next day and says she wants a break. I am devastated but again, whatever it takes for her to be happy I will sacrifice for her. She recently came back to campus to move into her new apartment (1 bedroom), and asked if I could help. Obviously I said yes as it would have been the first time seeing her in about 2 months. After helping her she said she realized that she wants to be in a relationship no matter how hard it is on her and says that she wants me to be there to help her. I am ecstatic!

Fast forward another 2 weeks, and her aunt whom she is very very close with gets diagnosed with lung cancer. Same cycle happens, except this time she wants to break up with me. I am so lost and confused as to why.

Fast forward another week, (last week) and she came down to the city to get away from the hardships back home and spend time with friends. She goes out friday night, gets pretty drunk, and calls late at night seeing if I can pick her up. I care for her so I said yes and pick her up and let her spend the night. The next morning she is being weird and doesn't want to talk and just sleep. So me, stupid me, is looking for answers as to what this was tonight, and why she broke up with me as she wasn't clear initially. So I go through her phone text messages for the first time in our relationship and found a text with her friend saying she ""didn't think twice about it when I (gf) cheated on him"".....I'm heartbroken but I am open to forgiveness. I wake her up and ask to talk about where our relationship is, or where it should go. She puts up a wall but I break it down to get her to talk to me. She said she didn't say any of this before because she didn't want to hurt me. She said I didn't take her out to dinner enough......smothered her......reminded her about her past of athletics and how depressed she is because of that whole situation. She would not admit to cheating on me, and just says hurtful after hurtful thing. I tell her to call her friend to pick her up now.


I am HEARTBROKEN. I want our relationship to work. I genuinely believe she has hit rock bottom emotionally because of her family matters and depression, and she says she wants to be alone. I can respect that but I don't want to lose her forever. I am clinging to the fact that I believe we still love each other. I want to not talk to her but am afraid if I do, she will be gone forever. If it is meant to be, she will come back to me. 

Then last night, I get a text saying exactly this ""Please don't respond to this: I wish I was better to you and I'm so sorry from the bottom of my heart. I failed us not you."" I know that a relationship is both ways, and it is not entirely on her. 

TL:DR broke up with my GF of 2+ years because I believe she is depressed and emotional very unstable. Don't know what to do next....I feel very sad/used/frustrated.

P.S. got angry later that night after going out with friends trying to cheer me up...broke my hand punching a building wall. NEVER TRY TO FIGHT A WALL YOU WILL NEVER WIN!"
2goflm,3,2014-09-17,I really don't know where to post this so I'll start here,asshatforyourass,Needafriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/2goflm/i_really_dont_know_where_to_post_this_so_ill/,"I have been trying to deal with so many things over the past couple of years and each day is a struggle just to put my feet on the floor in the morning.  From a chronic illness to losing all friends, losing my ability to take care of myself, having to rely on other people all the time, severe social anxiety that has never been this bad, and now I am so lost and confused I really don't know what I'm doing anymore.  

I had been seeing a therapist every week for the past 8 months to try and work on some of these issues, but I really think I need to find someone new because this person just doesn't seem to be doing me any good.  She is a smart person, and I'm sure she is trying, I just don't think she has the experience to deal with someone like me, since she is young and has just finished her internship for college, so I think I'm going to seek out a new therapist.  What I need to figure out is whether I need to upgrade from a therapist to a full psychiatrist/psychologist, someone with a full doctorate with more experience so that things might get sorted out with me.  

The one and only friend I have has her own life and is very busy most of the time.  I'm lucky if I get to speak to her once a week and that is only if she calls me when she is on her way home from work at 2am.  I need more than that and I hate having to rely on her all the time and always being the ""gloomy gus"" that I am all the time.  If she has a night off, and her husband is at work, she will invite me over to hang out, but that has only happened 3 times in the past 5 months.  She has been my closest friend for so many years and she knows I'm going through so much stuff right now, but I still can't help but hold things back because I don't want her to know how much it hurts to be in so much pain, both mentally and physically.  

I really don't know what I'm expecting from posting this here, and don't know if this is even the right place for this.  I'm just so lost and alone.  "

I am very bad at talking about myself but i guess here goes nothing.

-I am a very outgoing and fun loving person.
Between work and school i value any free time i have and because of that i am always open to doing new and interesting things.

-I am currently going to school for computer science and am looking to start some internships since i will be finishing school soon and who knows where that will take me in the country.

-I am a huge car nut, it is one of the few things i feel was able to hold my attention when i was younger and it still is one of the things i love the most. There is nothing better than to just go on a drive through the mountain passes and listen to music, its almost meditative.

-I love to go out and do new things, with the free time i do have i try to make the most of my time and go out to enjoy everything, from working on my car to going with friends anywhere and everywhere.

-As much as i love to go out i also love to have days where i do nothing. I can sit there and watch netflix marathons or just hang out with no plans.

Physically i am 6'2"", brown eyes and black hair, i am a not a small person but not gigantic either, i am working on it because i know i can be smaller even though i will never be a tiny person haha. I used to have a beard but had to cut it for work (think my manager was jealous and he forced me to shave when someone called his dumb looking) anyways heres a pic sorry its not the best quality. http://imgur.com/m7KpvpF

While I know I don't have to deal with this until a couple more months, I would like to know beforehand just what I should expect.

Backstory:

So this summer I had an internship, and for 3 months I made some solid income. With that said, I also paid around $6,000 in taxes, give or take some. However, being a full time student I have not worked this entire year besides those summer months. 

What I am getting at, is that I made around $20,000 over the three months, and paid $6,000 in taxes. My main question is if I can expect to get almost all of that back on my tax return in January? 

I checked out some tax calculators, and it looks like my marginal tax rate is something like 12.73%, with tax looking like around $2500.

This is a ton of money for someone that doesn't work, and is living on student loans to finish up school. Just wondering if you guys could be kind enough to give me an hint on what I should be expecting, things to do/not to do come tax time, and any other general help.

Thanks again, "
2gozax,4,2014-09-17,I [F22] am nervous about my partner's [25] upcoming visit. How do I relax and enjoy the present moment; how do I avoid being anxious about something going wrong and spoiling our precious time together?,ejhops,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2gozax/i_f22_am_nervous_about_my_partners_25_upcoming/,"Hello, my fellow heart travelers!

I would like to ask for some advice regarding my partner’s upcoming visit (just three more sleeps! Eee!) We'd been dating seriously in the same city before I moved nearly 9000 km for an 8 month internship. This is our one and only visit before we are reunited on Jan 2nd. We will stay in my apartment for a bit as well as go backpacking through Europe. Though the distance hasn't been the easiest thing for us, we both still feel loved and supported and are thrilled that we’re together.

Now that some context's been given, I’ll jump to my request. I want help with being able to live in the moment while I have my love beside me, and not overwhelm myself with the pressure of making every second count. I know this time together is precious, but I don’t want to spend that precious time dreading when we are nine time zones away from each other. I’m afraid of being anxious about something going wrong (and thus wasting that precious time) when everything is fine, or being consumed by negativity when something isn't perfect instead of having a greater perspective. Ultimately, I know that an extra few months of separation isn’t the end of the world and that a spoiled day isn't significant when I think of the thousands of days we will eventually have. And yet before I left, there were some times spent together where I was more focused on the distance to come than the closeness of that moment. 

So, /r/LongDistance, how do you maintain perspective, peace, and bliss during your visits?

2gpdzu,42,2014-09-17,[No Regrets] I blew up my marriage and feel absolutely no remorse.,dontcare61,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2gpdzu/no_regrets_i_blew_up_my_marriage_and_feel/,"[No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad 

My wife WAS beautiful.

Married for three years.  It was good for two months after the wedding and then she cut off sex completely.  The nagging, the criticism, the hurtful words.   She was selfish and would pick fights constantly. Depressed and critical of everyone.  Her extended family loathed her and she had no friends.  

I did my absolute best as a husband.  I consoled her when she cried, we had a nice house, decent jobs.  I worked my tail off.  No kids, but we talked about it.  In the last couple months of our marriage, I started standing up for myself and fighting back.   We started going to counseling and the counselor would 95% of the time side with me.  The counselor gave her things to work on and she would just never attempt to remedy her problems.   She got more and more angry with me.   She gained at least 30-40 lbs during our marriage.  No sex on our 2 year anniversary, not on Valentines Day, not on my birthday.  

I started not coming home after work, preferring to get a beer with friends or ride my mountain bike around a trail system around my office.   

There is this semi-ditzy intern girl that worked in our office.  She was 23, I’m 34.  She had a great rack.  I’d always crack jokes and played a lot of pranks on her.  One day, she grabbed the belt loop on the back of my pants while I was talking with a co-worker  She did it in such a slow, methodical way - I know what it meant.   That’s how it started.  A week later, she followed me down a corridor in a building where we kept refreshments, etc.  She got up really close to me and just smiled and then just ran away.  

A few days later, I asked her why she did that when we were alone, and she just blushed and smiled and didn’t say anything.   She sent me a message on Facebook that night and told me she had an answer.   

Her last day on the job was just before labor day weekend.  She threw a party at her apartment and invited co-workers and some friends.  I lied to my wife and told her I was going to a friends place - she didn’t even care.  

The intern girl cornered me when I went out to he porch to get a beer.  She asked me how long I planned on staying and I said “for a little while” and she said “Good, stick around a little bit I want to talk to you.” 

I hung out in her parking lot, I was the second to last person to leave.  45 minutes went by and she sent me a Facebook message to come back up because everyone was gone.  I went back into her place and I sat on the couch and we got close and talked a bit.  I made the move by grabbing her legs and putting them on my lap…I then kissed her.   We made out for 20 minutes.

We then went to her bedroom and we had sex - unprotected for at least an hour.  I came inside her too and she said she was fine because she had birth control.  

It was the most satisfying sex of my life.  I felt a huge wave of relief and happiness to finally be intimate again after not having sex for at least 6 months with my wife.  

I took a shower at her place and went home happy - cranking loud music the whole way home.

This past weekend, I asked to divorce my miserable, nagging, bitchy, fat wife.  I never told her I banged one of our interns and never plan to.  She cried for three days straight, but I did not care.  She didn’t love me anyways.  I’m better off without her.  

The intern has moved to another state and taken a new job.  She’s not pregnant either, I have no STDs.  I got away with it.

Sorry if this is too long.  I just got fed up with my lousy marriage.  "

What do I wear? My wardrobe can accommodate anything from lady neckbeard to smart prep to power suit, so just say the word. Usually I dress pretty business-y for interviews, but I've heard overkill can really backfire in CS. What do you guys think?

Basically this is my first time going through the recruiting process and was looking for some advice as to what (if anything) the invite means.

1. Is this something where the firm invites everyone who spoke to them at MTF? or is it a sign that I'm at least on track to at least get a campus interview.

2. As far as atmosphere, I assume it's going to be even more of a social event than anything else, but considering it's a bar I imagine the majority of people over 21 will be drinking? (side note: If I was to be offered an internship I would still be under 21 throughout, is that something that would present any issues?)

3. Any advice to succeed in this environment. I'd like to think I'm pretty solid in the small talk category, though this is a 2.5 hour event which seems rather long tbh.

really appreciate any responses. Reading everyones input on this sub has  helped immensely in the recruiting process so far.  "
2gq2bw,2,2014-09-17,23 [M4F] Office Politics (Long introduction),gottalovedpp,eroticpenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticpenpals/comments/2gq2bw/23_m4f_office_politics_long_introduction/,"Hi, so I'm posting this here as it has a rather long introduction. I wrote this after swapping a couple messages with a delightful partner who has recently deleted her account for whatever reason. Part of posting this is in the hope she'll see it and want to continue with a new user, but I also figured why let the idea go to waste.

I like writing in first person and I like longer term stories as it allows for various time zones and availabilities. Kink wise I prefer playing as the submissive partner, but I'm fine with vanilla. For this scenario, I feel like competitive sex and/or power struggle stuff is the way to go, as the characters are competitive rivals.

The gist of the story is my character and yours are rivals who have been at each other for a year or two now. My boss who is threatened by the idea I'll replace him bets me I can't seduce you, thinking it's an impossible task. The reward is a promotion so even though it's a bit dodgy, I go with it.

If this scene interests you, feel free to message and I'll be happy to share a more detailed list of kinks/interests.

-------------------------------------------------------------

After talking a guy through how to open his email, I'm feeling pretty drained. Dealing with idiots all day has made me tired. I look at the clock and notice it's almost 4pm. Great, I'll be heading home soon.

I stretch my arms out and sigh. Looking at my desktop, I see an email from the boss asking to see me. The old prick has been growing antsy as he knows I'm a promotion away from being a threat to his job. Unfortunately, he's also the guy who has to give it to me. Luckily the upper management love me so he can't keep reasonably putting me off.

I get up and walk towards the head of IT's office. I've got the sleeves of my ocean blue shirt rolled up and I'm wearing black jeans with some converse shoes. There's an unspoken dress code in the office requiring we look professional but IT tend to push against the rules where everyone else toes the line. We make the computers work and in the digital age, that's an important skill.

I notice the condescending looks from a couple accounts drones and casually flip them the bird. One of them looks like he’s gonna say something but backs down. Last time an accounts drone spoke back to me, his email stopped working and wouldn’t you know it, we couldn’t figure it out until the next day. Only the senior accountants are game to fight with me, you in particular coming to mind.

Just as I’m the up and comer of the IT Department, you’re the rising star for the accountants. Your talent with numbers and ability to get concessions from other departments have made you a leader among your staff. Same as I pick on your newbies, you go after my weaker willed compatriots, also happily using anyone else from any other department to get what you want. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy the sparring, but I can’t help but feel it’s a shame. You’re rather hot for someone who’s so good at being a bitch…

Fuck me, I’ll be 26 in two weeks and the highlight of my day is getting into a shit-fight with accounts. God, that’s a little grim. I shake it off and walk into the office of my Boss. He’s looking out the window with a scotch in hand, clearly preparing how he wants to approach this. He can’t dismiss me outright since half the upper management call me exclusively when they have a problem.

“Ah, Daniel, you’re here, good have a seat.” I arrogantly flop into the chair and consider his face. I don’t like the look of that smile, like he’s about to drop the hammer on me.

“Sure thing Max, what’s up mate?” I let my Australian accent flavour my words, knowing it will annoy his English sensibilities. Pompous prick. He smiles thinly but never loses the superior expression on his face. Well shit, he must have something on me. “Daniel, I don’t especially like you, neither do you like me.” He adjusts his pressed suit and looks me in the eye. “But we have a common enemy here. Accounts, and one accountant in particular has been especially irritating me lately. I want you to reign her in. If you can do it, I’ll promote you.”

I smile warily, knowing there has to be a catch. I know he’s talking about you and I’d be happy to do this normally, but there has to be something bad coming. Maxwell continues while smiling unpleasantly.

“I feel the best way to do so wouldn’t be strictly… ethical, but between you and me, if you could seduce her, it would go a long way to tarnishing her in the eyes of everyone here. Inter-office romance isn’t forbidden, but it is frowned upon and we both know the old boys among the directors will not look kindly on her while you will be fine.”

I look Maxwell dead in the eye, frowning while considering my answer. Part of me knows how dodgy this is, never-mind being sexist as hell and borderline sexual harassment. Shit, it’s probably in violation of a bunch of HR rules. But on the other hand, you are very attractive and I like a challenge. There’s always been an undercurrent of tension between us, maybe there’s something there and this could be the way to find out. Everyone in the office knows how we fight… Oh, that’s his game. He thinks I’ll never be able to convince you to have sex with me. Ah, we’ll see about that.

“Fine, I’ll do it.”

“Excellent, I’ll leave you to it then.” Recognising the dismissal, I trudge out the door considering my next move. I walk over to the door to your office, mildly annoyed as always over how yours is bigger than mine. As I’m walking over, a different accounts drone gives me a dirty look and walking past his desk, I raise a fist as though I’m going to hit him. He flinches backwards, dropping a container of Chinese food onto the floor. The sweet and sour makes a bit of a mess and I look at him with disdain. I’d never hit another guy over giving me a dirty look, but apparently he didn’t know that.

“Clean that up, do you want us to get ants? Because this is how we get ants.” I say with disgust, continuing my journey to your door. I open the door without knocking, not caring if you’re busy or not. You’re sitting at your desk and look up when I enter. I notice you’re going over some paperwork with an intern. Great this will be easy. “Out.” I order the intern, watching with amusement how the poor girl doesn’t even question it, not wanting to be in the middle of what she probably thinks is going to be another battle of wills between us. It may end up one yet, so I sit down in the chair across from your desk.

“You and I are going to have dinner tonight.” I just come out and say it, watching your face and waiting for a reaction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR: We work for rival departments in a big company and I get bet I can't seduce you. If the idea sounds fun, feel free to message and we can discuss what we're looking for out of it."

Great....just what i need!

Im kinda in a relationship with this girl. Sweet girl, really amazing. I really have strong feeling for her and so does she. A relationship is sadly out of the question because we are literally in different ""point in our life"" and other stuff going on in the background. Even so we still chat daily and get along really well.

.


Was on the phone with her not 5 minutes ago. Her grandmother was living with her uncle for some time now. Because of a familiar dispute between the uncle and her mother (Father is out of the picture) they havent talked in years. Just last week her grandmother was put into an Elder house. She has lost A LOT of weight, cant speak or walk anymore, has NO TEATH (really...wtf was that), and is in a real need of physical therapy, because it seems the old woman has been lying in bed for more than a year. The uncle has declared 100% Dementia, even though the lady actually still can recognize things. And the more you talk and interact with her, the more she kinds of ""comes back"". I've been with her last weekend and Ive never seen her cry so much. Really breaks my heart. And the scumbag uncle ...no goddamn idea what he has been telling the people on the Elders house, but everyone seem kind of against us. Making stupid complaints against almost every idea we have to make the old womans life a little better. Even making problems because of a photo of her we put on the room.

.


The worst part is that I would want to be beside her because she can barely take the emotional impact of being there to begin with. Im doing an internship 3 hours away on train and even though I told her I can take a week off and help here even further she actually doesnt want me doing so, because I really need the hours for rent/to graduate from the university. Im planning to do it anyway. Just dont want to start a discussion about that right know.

And while writing this I just got another text message. Uncle has pull some crap again....Lets see what it is this time.

Im a college student in Michigan, studying mechanical engineering. I graduated high school in 2012 where i was active both in cross country and track &amp; field. At that time i was about 6'2"", 180lbs. My diet consisted of fast food and plastic cheeses, chips, soda, and beef. Oh how i loved my meats. Now, 2.5 Years later i am 230lbs, the gain being mostly fat(for obvious reasons). Living a mostly sedentary lifestyle, I was oblivious to my weight gain until the end of this last summer. I had an internship with a local power company and ate like a person who has never seen food before. By the end of the summer i had noticed that my clothes no longer fit me, and that my stomach covered a good portion of the ground beneath me. Now i am looking to change that. 

Here come the questions:

I know that weight loss is 80% diet 20% exercise, but i have become a picky eater, who eats a lot, and quickly. What is the best way to start eating healthy? I know this sounds like an odd question, but Im having a hard time with a straight answer. I know i need to expand my pallet, but I am at school(commuter), without a kitchen or way to cook or keep things cold. What are some things i can bring to eat or snack?

My school has a gym which i plan on using, I am there M/W/F and I have classes at the local community college on T/Th, so i plan on incorporating a c25k on T/TH/SAT. I dont have any goal weights in mind, just that i would like to look muscular in a tight t-shirt, and be able to bench press my girlfriend. What is a good program for me? Also before i start, my lower back is significantly weakened from my weight gain, and that i was sitting during most of my internship. How can i strengthen that before i start with any other exercise? I know back extensions on a roman chair but thats about it.

And lastly, is protien something i need to incorporate now? or is it counter active until i begin to actually gain, vs losing fat. Powder mix and bars seem like good ideas because i can easily eat them while driving to school, or that i can make/mix them there, without the need for a kitchen.

Also any general tips would be greatly appreciated. If i left out anything please let me know.

Thanks in advance guysngals!"

I am currently doing an internship at a medical devices company and have been tasked to model some medical device. I have worked out a nice, accurate model (took quite some time). Tomorrow is the last day of my internship. Normally I would be able to show my fancy model during our team’s weekly meeting.

Except…

It works for almost every input except the input that I want, shown below.

http://imgur.com/Zk3ur8q

The input is fabricated by using a switch block It switches between the first function, y = 5.2x and the second one, y = 2x, at time instant 4.69. The first function starts at time instant 4.44 and the second one at time instant 4.04.

Each time, matlab gives the following error:

The time 4.69 corresponds to the moment the the switch happens. Apparently matlab cannot deal with this (FUCKING MATLAB). How do I circumvent this? One solution would be to approximate the function that I showed by a continuous function. Except I don’t know which one. Plus it is already 11pm and I still have alot of other things to do :(

Help me please?

Is it better to keep the SP3 plugged in while working with it, or does this harm the battery in the long run? 

It's all a matter of how the intern charger works - if the battery is at 100%, it should stop charging the battery and of course it should not use the battery to run the hardware. But I have seen different views on this - some say this harms the battery, because the surface runs on battery all the time.

Is there any way i can get a answer to this problem?"
2gs6aq,0,2014-09-18,When did loving your family become a bad thing?,[deleted],Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/2gs6aq/when_did_loving_your_family_become_a_bad_thing/,"When I was in high school, I learned about a glass ceiling; a metaphorical representation of boundaries that existed as a female, but something that could be broken when hit at the right angles. I have always believed in being able to have both a family and a successful career, but my once adamant attitude towards my ability to break through this ceiling has weakened over the years and I no longer believe in a glass ceiling. I believe in a cage that can only be opened by silencing important parts of yourself, no matter how many volumes they speak of your diligence and good character.

During my senior year of high school, I got pregnant. To the surprise of many and with the help of an amazing family, two unparalleled teachers, and loving friends, all of whom I am forever indebted to, my life did not crumble. Despite less than ideal circumstances, I maintained my GPA and graduated on time from my small, dual enrollment high school where I took college courses for high school credit. I continued to work at a restaurant past graduation until I was 37 weeks pregnant and saved all of the money that I earned. Beckam was born on August 18th, 2011 with the most beautiful face and a full head of hair. Four days later, on August 22nd, 2011, I attended my first official day as a freshman in college. A month later, despite my full time school schedule and beautiful new baby, I returned to the restaurant to work. 

Most of the time, people look at me like I am insane, tell me that I am insane, and then ask: “But how?” My response is that I cried a lot, and that is true; I came home every day the first few weeks and bawled my eyes out from exhaustion and feeling incompetent. The whole truth is that I believed in the glass ceiling, and more than ever, I was determined to break through. 

The next few years went something like this: I turned 18. I applied and was approved for two credit cards so I could begin building my credit. We celebrated Beckam’s first Thanksgiving and then his first Christmas. I got a new job. I bought my first car. Beckam learned to crawl. I was accepted to the honors program at college. Beckam said “Mama.” My essay was nominated by a professor and selected for publication in the student essay anthology. Beckam continued to grow rapidly.  I finished my first full year of college and enrolled in summer courses. Beckam learned to walk. Beckam turned one and I have never been more proud of all that was accomplished in a year. I began my second year of college and applied to UCLA and UCSD as a transfer student. Beckam began saying short sentences. I created an internship with Operation Gratitude. I got accepted to UCSD. I didn’t think I would be accepted to UCLA ,so I submitted my SIR to UCSD. Beckam and I went to Disneyland. I got accepted to UCLA. I withdrew my SIR from UCSD and submitted my SIR to UCLA instead. Beckam learned to ride a tricycle. I graduated from community college with two associate degrees. Beckam turned two and I have never been more proud of all that was accomplished in a year.  I started my first day of classes at UCLA. Beckam began to speak in complete sentences. I married the man of my dreams. Beckam learned to recognize every letter in the alphabet and how to count to twenty. I bought a new car. Beckam began potty training.  I created another internship. I finished my first year at UCLA and enrolled in summer classes. Beckam turned three and I have never been more proud of all that was accomplished in a year. 

Despite all odds, in May, I will graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the highest-ranking schools in the country and in the world.  In the past few years, I have learned how to do homework with one hand while rocking a baby with the other. I have learned the value of time and the importance of hard work. I know how to study well enough to set the curve on exams and assignments, while still caring for a small human. I am a professional fort builder, a nurse, an ATM, a dentist, and a librarian. I pay my own bills and I have an excellent credit score. I have learned how to seek out opportunities and develop creative solutions for accomplishing everything I want to accomplish. I have done more in the past few years than I ever thought imaginable: I turned a poor situation into a positive one, I fought hard with all the odds against me and I excelled, but I am not supposed to tell anyone about it.

Now that I am in my last year of college before graduation, I have begun to think about my future career. I am not a perfect mother, wife or person, and I have done many things that I am not proud of. However, Beckam is someone I am endlessly proud of and it is because of him that I am able to be proud of myself. My problem is not my ability to perform diligently and produce exemplary work, but rather that I am advised to not offer the evidence that I have of my abilities. It is recommended that I do not tell a potential employer about Beckam and all that I have accomplished because of him, for fear that I will be labeled as being undedicated to my work. My husband is in the army, and I am incredibly proud to be married to such a brave, selfless man, but I am advised to not wear a wedding ring to a job interview because it lowers my chances of being selected by a potential employer. You see, I can break through this glass ceiling so long as I don’t reveal the parts of myself that speak volumes of how qualified I actually am. I can only receive keys to the metaphorical cage as long as I keep quiet about the things that society has decided make me incompetent.

 I believe in equality for women in the workplace, and I understand that it is difficult to change societal perceptions about women who desire to “have it all.” The mother working at the baseball game is seen as a workaholic, but the father working at the baseball game is given a pat on the back just for showing up. When did we give men such low standards and women such high ones? When did just showing up become acceptable, but caring for a family and pursuing a career become something to hide?

2gs7sk,155,2014-09-18,"Today, fellow Planeswalkers, my heart broke. [Long text post, but I had to tell someone]",LegendaryPrimate,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2gs7sk/today_fellow_planeswalkers_my_heart_broke_long/,"I got into Magic for the first time at the tail end of the Return to Ravnica set.  One of my friends, who had played for years in the late '90s/early 2000s, found his old decks and offered to teach me to play.  I was initially reluctant, but upon trying it out, I realized what depth of strategy went into the game.

As we kept playing, I got more and more into Magic.  It wasn't so much the competitive scene or the deckbuilding that I enjoyed, but rather, it was the chance to spend time with one of my best friends.  I'd come over, we'd pour some drinks, break out the decks, and have a good time.  Each game was different, and each game was just a social opportunity.  As time passed, my friend's interest in Magic dwindled until finally he stopped wanting to play.  At that point, I stopped as well.

Shortly thereafter, I realized that I missed Magic.  Even without someone to play with, Magic provided me with an escape from my personal life.  I got into deckbuilding, and created a few decks that I enjoyed playing (though weren't competitive in the meta at all).  I found a playgroup of like-minded individuals--people who weren't interested in going to PTs or GPs or even FNMs, but just sitting around and socializing over a game.  I was finally having fun with Magic again, but I still felt like something was missing.

I started buying cards to create new decks, thinking maybe I just needed more than my normal two decks to revive that feeling of freedom and excitement when I play.  What I realized, though, is that it wasn't just new decks or new friends that brought me pleasure through Magic--it's the cards themselves.  The art of the cards, the texture, the ink, the font, and even the way they feel in my hand makes me happy.  I wanted to collect.  Somehow, over the short amount of time I've been playing Magic, I fell in love with the cards.  They kindled a passion that I don't feel for anything else, and I made it my mission to collect a complete set.

I am well aware that collecting a complete set of Magic cards will be time-consuming, expensive, and really sort of pointless.  But it's what makes me happy.  Some people play Magic for the competition, some for the deckbuilding, some for the fun they can have on Friday nights at a shop.  I play to collect the cards.  In my mind, that's the most fun part of this exciting and gorgeous game.  So...with my new goal in mind, I started to buy.  About the time JOU was released, I had just finished acquiring a complete set of Return to Rav, Gatecrash, and Dragon's Maze.

JOU was released in May this year.  I had been collecting since...probably May of last year?  I don't know; the timelines are a little hazy.  This past May, I had to leave town for three months to complete an internship in Ohio for school.  I talked to my landlord, and she let me store most of my stuff in her basement during the summer.  Since I was going to be mostly broke and very busy, I left my Magic cards (which were packed in a box, which was wrapped in a plastic garbage bag, which was placed in another box) in her basement.  I came back home a few weeks ago, and just yesterday found the time to pull all my boxes out of storage.

This morning, I opened my boxes.  Everything I owned was covered in a bright orange mold.  All of my winter clothes, all the books I own, my records, my bedding, all of the hard-copy photos I have...and my cards.

At some point over the summer, my landlord says her basement flooded.  A pipe broke somehow, and by the time she found it, there was a good foot of standing water in her basement.  I didn't know any of this until I found the mold and asked her. I don't care about most of my stuff.  Really, I can buy new clothes, bedding, and books; most of my photos were just prints from a digital file; I didn't own any particularly valuable records (I'm kind of a vinyl junkie, but most of my collecting went to Magic).  But the few personal mementos I had (a first edition of a book my grandmother gave me, a photo of my mother I have no copy of, and a few others) and my MTG collection are gone forever, and I am crushed.

I know that I can buy the cards again; most of my collection is even still in print.  I know that I will buy them again, given time.  But this hurts; I loved those cards.  I put energy into their acquisition and care.  I cared about them.

I'm taking them to the dump now, and then I have a class to attend.  Thanks for reading, if you made it this far.  I just wanted to tell someone how upset I was before I see my playgroup in class and have to tell them.  I'm not sure they'll understand.

Edit: **TL;DR my cards got wet and molded while I was out of town, and I lost my entire collection.  I'm crushed.**"
2gsb68,5,2014-09-18,My brother [18M] asks me [21F] for lots of relationship advice. Don't know how to tell him his 'perfect' relationship is actually unhealthy,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gsb68/my_brother_18m_asks_me_21f_for_lots_of/,"Basically, he's been dating this girl for almost a year now. It started in high school and they spent a lot of time together then (hanging out pretty much 10 hours a day on the weekend, seeing each other for an hour or two during the week). Now he's in college an hour and a half away (she's a senior in high school) and he lies to our parents about how often he's coming home to visit her. It's about twice weekly (with one of those visits being a full-on weekend extravaganza), though my parents told him he should only make the drive every 3 weeks. These trips cost like $30 in gas money, so I cringe to think how much of his savings he's wasting because they can't survive 5 days on their own. I have a lot of reasons to believe that they are waaaay to dependent on each other, but I won't get too into it for the sake of brevity. 

   The problem is, he's a very very open person and tells me all the details of his relationship, including things that he really shouldn't be sharing. Back when he was in high school, he had a big problem with telling me about his plans to sneak out of the house and threatening me if I told our parents. They found out anyway, he exploded, and he eventually came to understand that it was really unfair to put me in that position and agreed to stop. 

   But now he's back to telling me every irresponsible thing he does and I finally let go and told him that he is making himself look desperate and clingy by a) driving home to see his girlfriend so often and b) talking about it obsessively. He seemed a bit hurt so I backed off, but after the conversation was over I started thinking ""you know, this is really unhealthy and he's going to pass up a lot of cool opportunities to study abroad or intern in a different city during college if he and his girlfriend stay this ridiculously needy."" I don't know if I can continue to have these conversations with him about his relationship when every fiber of me believes that it's getting completely out of hand. I feel like I don't even recognize him anymore, he's completely lost his sense of self. I can never talk to him for more than 5 minutes without him bringing up his girlfriend and it's starting to drive me up the wall.


I'm running a few options through my head:

1) ""I'm glad you feel comfortable talking to me about personal things, but I'm seeing a lot of red flags in your description of your relationship and I just don't feel like I can pretend anymore that your behavior is normal. Please keep those details to yourself because I don't want to end up in a disagreement with you.""

2) Telling my parents about his extra trips. I know I could pull it off so he never knew I said anything (they told him they might be periodically checking his odometer and that would be a dead give away) but I'm worried about starting a needless fight within the family.

3) Telling him what about his relationship is unhealthy every time he tries to ask me for advice. Benefit here is that he'd really get the message, problem is that I don't want to lose the close relationship we have. I also don't want to be the evil sabotaging bitch in his girlfriend's eyes in case these two end up married or coparenting some day.

tl;dr: brother and his girlfriend are super clingy and don't have their priorities sorted out. He asks me for relationship advice a lot and I'm trying to find a way to make it clear I think they're making a mistake without damaging our own relationship."
2gt6io,1,2014-09-18,My parents aren't being direct about our financial situation and multiple things are clearly wrong. Can you help me figure out what's going on?,muchconfuse,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2gt6io/my_parents_arent_being_direct_about_our_financial/,"Many years ago my brother and I had the promise of significant savings that would enable us to go through an in-state college for most likely 4 years without any trouble.  My father does not have a low-income job.  I've deduced in the last year that my dad makes slightly over six figures in a year.  Although my dad has had multiple jobs in the recent past, they've all been around that level of salary.

However, something is seriously wrong.  I'm at college right now, but almost all of the information I have comes from last school year when I was a senior in high school and living at home.  I've heard my parents talking, sometimes to each other, sometimes on the phone.  I've heard them say that they're undergoing financial struggles.

I think I know at least part of the source of this.  My dad was unemployed for about a year at one point.  I don't really get it, but we basically kept living life like normal for the duration.  I'm thinking it was accomplished through a lot of loans.  At one point, right before he got a new job, he asked to temporarily take the $4000 dollars out of my savings account so that he didn't have to take loans in order to ""look good for employers"".  They're listed on my savings account so they can do that, but not my checking account.  He actually did give it back a while later, though.

While we were applying for colleges, my dad was freaking out about the financial aspects of it.  Part of the reason why, as I discovered, was that he had a big severance package from his previous job, and that inflated his income on the FAFSA form, so they were much less likely to help us.  He kept telling me to apply to every scholarship and and make sure I was doing things on time, and I could see he was fighting tears.  I knew it was more than that but I didn't really understand what was going on, and he wouldn't tell me anything when I asked.  The most I got out of him was that we didn't have that much money and that he was doing some weird thing with a different bank than our usual one- he was really rough with how he explained it, but it sounded like he was effectively describing the equivalent of something where *he would write checks and it would become debt* in some loan account.  I don't really understand it that well but it sounds like a really bad idea.  He was all casual and acted like it wasn't a problem though.

Later, I found out my SAT scores gave me a full tuition scholarship to one of the colleges I applied to.  It was one of the last on my list, but it was a college.  My dad was ecstatic when he found out.  Maybe he didn't mean to say it, because he's never mentioned it or anything about it ever again, but he said with a big grin on his face *""before you had that scholarship I thought you wouldn't be at college next year""*.  I immediately knew then that accepting at any other college was not an option.

Before we did the FAFSA form, my dad made us withdraw any money from our accounts (which is probably fraud, but whatever).  I don't think there was much in my parents' in the first place, but I don't know anything about their accounts.  All I know is they removed the $4000 dollars which I had in savings, the result of internships and Bitcoin investment.  Somehow I had a feeling I wouldn't be getting it back this time, but I didn't say anything.

Here we are many months later, long after everything from FAFSA has been done with, and I asked for my savings back so I can buy food and games and such (or at least part of it, because putting the exact amount back in after this year's FAFSA is over is probably suspicious lol), and he just replied with ""I've put $100 into your account"".  I don't think I'm going to get that money back.

Anyway, that's the situation.  How is this possible when my dad has six figure income?  I know we have debt, but I don't know how much.  What exactly is this thing where he writes checks and they automatically become loans?

Most importantly, if you have a good idea of what is going on, what is the correct action in this situation?"

Original Post

So, this is going to be a little long probably so bear with me please. Without the context it might get tough to relate or empathize. Thank you for even trying to read.

So I met this girl on the internet, and we decided we had a pretty similar personality and want to stay in touch. We met and went out a lot of times together and it was a mutual understanding that we shared that we wanted to be just freinds. Sometimes messaging each other for hours and this goes on for about a year. 

Finally I had to leave the city to move into another for work and she was loaded with work with a fucking busy schedule like 30 hour shifts as an intern (it was crazy), and we started talking less. I realized I miss her a lot, but whether or not I want her to be my SO, I could not decide (I was not talking to anyone else either), so I left it at that. We talked like once everyday and that was cool for me.

She usually stayed depressed, had a medical condition and it was tough at times for us to communicate well to each other. I tried my best to keep her company, but sometimes I could not do enough or should I say that I did not know well what to do, neither I had the wisdom.

Now fast forward to end of last year, we are still close friends. Someone at her workplace approaches her. It was fun for her at the beginning, and even I was kind of happy for her, like she finally met someone she could relate to well enough. Trouble here was that he was elder than her by almost 10 years and was married. She was very discreet with him in the beginning but finally with his persistence she gave in and he proposed and she was like okay lets see how this goes. I wanted to stop her, because underneath I knew what she valued most was emotions and happiness and she could not live with feeling of robbing someone's wife's happiness for long enough. I personally believe what she did here, was mostly in a plunge of loneliness, depression and grief coming out together (She never gave that excuse herself).

Now, since a few months, I have started to realize that the way I shared myself with her, I never could do with anyone else. I always had good friends as girls but never a girlfriend. So, the concept of being closely connected souls together was a little alien to me (this sounds wierd). And probably I was in love with her. Knowing she was in love with someone else, I tried to get away, increase distance and was finally succeeding in it. I never told her my feelings.

Maybe I was being too choosy or probably critisizing myself way beyond necessary, even at times to find flaws in myself to find a reason not to keep her. I guess I was just trying to find a reason to do what was the easiest rather what was necessary. (Keep in mind -ALL THIS- I havent thought of before and this occurs to me just now. I wasnt aware of what I was doing WHILE doing it)

That's when she started calling me and texting me and telling me that her relation with the married guy is driving her crazy, because the guy's wife had a pretty good hunch about something was going on in her husband's life and now everything is a mess. I didn't know what to tell her this time, she said she cannot move away from the guy right now since it would be so bitchy to dump him right away and given these few months were the happiest times of her life.

2gvwd6,15,2014-09-19,How do I (24 M) tell a single mother coworker (30 F) I'm not interested in dating?,throwawayargggg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gvwd6/how_do_i_24_m_tell_a_single_mother_coworker_30_f/,"I am not a bad person.  I want to make that very clear.\

I work a pretty nice little office job, I started as an intern and look like I have a pretty decent future at the company (if I want it).

Anyways, one of my co-workers is ""Jennifer,"" a pretty, slightly older girl, I developed a crush on her immediately when she got hired a few weeks ago. I didn't really interact with her, she was in a different department, but I was afraid that someone else was going to ask her out (water-cooler talk) so I asked her out almost out of the blue.  She said yes, and I had a lunch date with her on Tuesday.

During that lunch date, she said she had a kid, I realized I didn't want a relationship with her.  I have a couple of reasons why I don't want to date someone with a kid, some of them being:

1) I like relationships where me and that person can be the most important person to each other.  I like being caught up in a girl, and I like her being caught up in me.  I don't think it can happen if they've got someone more important (which is completely correct, don't get me wrong I don't think I'd want to be with someone who prioritizes me over their kid either).

2) I've never tolerated being in a relationship where my partner still has significant contact with her ex (I got cheated on when I was 18 because of it and I'm not doing that again).  If the dad is still in the kid's life, that means I'll have to see him/deal with him every so often.

3) I want a nuclear family.  I want to marry a girl, go through getting married together, a house together, having a couple of kids together, and I feel like it won't be special is someone's already done that.  Everyone I date at this point is a potential wife to me.

4) I honestly don't think I'd be able to love that a kid that's not mine.  I'd care to the extent that I care about her relatives, but I'd never feel a parental bond with a kid that's not mine.

Anyways, the date goes nice enough, while we were walking back to my car, she made a move to kiss me, and I did the whole present my cheek thing, so she kissed me on the cheek.

I just got a text from her asking if I'd like to go a bar with her on Saturday.  How do I go about telling her I'm not interested?  I've never really been put in this position before.  I can't use the work together thing, since I just asked her out and a lot of co-workers date.

There's another problem, I wouldn't mind asking out the other new girl (26 F), she seems pretty into me, we've jokingly flirted (she works much closer to me than the single mother). 

Tldr- Asked a coworker out, found out she has a daughter and now I don't want to date her.  She asked me out for this Saturday, how do I go about telling her I'm not interested without making it impossible to ask out another girl I'm interested in?"

The objective statement (my school advises we have one) also says ""Looking for a internship in tax"".

Last night I get a email saying I can schedule an interview with that firm and go to do it. Turns out the job listing under which I scheduled an interview for is the Staff Accountant position. This also happens to be the only position firm X has listed on my school's career services site.

It's definitely my fault for not reading the position for which I scheduled the interview for. I was just so excited to have received the email about an interview I just proceeded to schedule it and assumed it was for a internship in tax.

Now I'm sitting here wondering wtf I have gotten myself into. On one hand, I think it's for the Staff Accountant position, but on the other I'm saying to myself that it's got to be for the tax internship since that's what I talked to them about and have on my resume.

Anyone been in a similar situation?

2gwq2c,2,2014-09-19,Wanting Feedback on Weed Usage,pirate314,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2gwq2c/wanting_feedback_on_weed_usage/,"Hello all, long-time lurker, first time poster. I want to get some advice on my weed usage, because I'm still a little new to this (~3 months).


The first time I had weed was sometime in early 2013. Vaporized with really experienced friends. Didn't really enjoy it probably because I had way too much for a beginner (got dizzy, nauseated, confused), and coughed a lot.

Rougly a year later my roommate starts smoking a lot of weed, and I decide to try it again (smoking from a bong instead of vaporizing, plus taking much smaller amounts). This time, I really enjoyed it. Not only that, I started experiencing positive effects long after I had the weed. I started to wonder if it could be a replacement for my ADHD medication because of how focused, relaxed and productive I was. 

I wound up getting my own bong and started purchasing weed on a regular basis. At the same time, I also got a personal trainer and worked out 4-6 days a week - mostly barbell stuff. This was mostly because my job involves sitting all day (engineering) and I didn't want to have the physique of Dilbert.

The routine I got into was to go to work at my internship for about 8 hours, get off, go to the gym and work as hard as I could for an hour (plus I had to walk/run to the gym), take a shower, get nicely high [3-6] and then spend the evenings playing with my hobbies (amateur radio, mathematics or 3D printing) or reviewing work-related materials. 

I used to think of weed as being like alcohol - akin to a fine glass of wine. But I soon began to use weed *instead* of my ADHD medication, and in a number of ways, I prefer the prior. This idea was cemented when I realized that my boss' praise of my work wasn't just flattery (in the form of an offer letter from the company, and in a number of forwarded emails, etc.).

So now school has started. It's senior year and so far I'm doing well. I've never smoked regularly during school before, but I was curious to see how it turned out, since apparently I was doing well at my internship. So far it's been good. My grades are good, no one is saying anything to me that would hint that I'm falling behind, slacking or doing piss-poor work. The only downside is that I haven't found a good regular time to lift since I also work  roughly 20-30 hours/week during the semester at a different job so I can pay rent.

Last week, I bought an MFLB. I wanted to stop smoking because I want to be healthy, but I wanted to still get high. My friends brought over some really high-quality stuff and I bought them dinner, and we got high using the vaporizer. The only problem is that I wasn't using the MFLB right. Namely, I didn't realize that the vapor output of the MFLB was so thin compared to the smoke output of my bong, and the effect didn't hit me as soon as when I smoke from a bong. I got so high I started forgetting things really badly. I was probably a [9] or a [10] and was rambling about random and deeply personal things. Eventually I started talking about my long-lived fascination with hallucinogens (Mescaline, LSD, DMT). Now, to be clear, I've never done anything stronger than weed; I'm too intimidated by the potential psychological harm and genuinely just interested in how the brain works. 

My girlfriend got understandably worried, since I didn't smoke earlier in the relationship, and I never talked much about my interest in potent hallucinogens (she smoked/vapes with me on occasion; she actually rather likes weed, but has a super low tolerance). This, in turn, got me worried and I decided to watch my weed intake for a few weeks, taking a few breaks and using my prescripton ADHD medicine on days off. It might still be too early to tell if weed is a good thing during the school year, but I'm starting to think that weed might actually help me about as effectively as my perscriptsion ADHD medication. 

What do you think? Am I getting addicted to weed? Is my situation a scary or bad one? Should I be worried? Thanks"
2gwzou,2,2014-09-19,"Me [20 M] with my girlfriend[21F] duration, 7 months. She ended things because she was afraid of hurting me more, but I want to fight for her.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gwzou/me_20_m_with_my_girlfriend21f_duration_7_months/,"Hey everyone, I come seeking relationship advice after a recent break up. A couple of days ago my girlfriend of about 7 months decided that she couldn't be in a relationship anymore and ended things. Now I know with all of my being that this girl is special. I don't know if she's my future spouse but I know she has great potential. I've talked to numerous people about what I want to do next because of how I feel for her. She did end things, but she also said she just needed time and space to think and sort out her life. 

Our relationship has suffered from some intrinsic difference in our personalities. I've never been much of a drinker or partier, and I don't turn 21 for a couple of months. She however began to do those things starting freshman year of college but she has never forced them upon me. She did however make it clear that she would really like to have a boyfriend who would be willing to go out with her and be with friends and have some drinks, maybe get a little drunk. At first I never would do this, the idea scared me because I haven't been around alcohol much in my life and I've always been someone who wants to stay in complete control, I don't want to ever blackout and find out the next day what weird stupid shit I did.

I think in alot of ways she wanted me to be open to the experience and to people who drank because I've been a judgemental person and have completely shut myself off to things because of it. I think she wanted me to be open and try new things because it would be good for me, but I also think she had some selfish desires in there as well. This was one source of conflict.

Another was that at the beginning of our relationship, I had come across as a religious guy who knew what I believed in. I was in a Christian frat and hung out with Christian guys and what not, but the truth is that I've never really known what I believe in. I've felt that what Christianity teaches is the truth at times, and more recently I've been having doubts. Either way, she noticed that I hadn't really been focused on being religious in any way and I told her that I've never really known what I believed in as far as all that goes. At this point I think she began to worry that she was changing me, she was afraid that I would later find out that I'd turned into someone that I wasn't or never wanted to be and then it would all come back to her. I know why she felt this way but it wasn't true. 

It definitely wasn't true for the religion part (she's atheist), and I'll admit that her influence in my life is the reason I've been more open to drinking, I got drunk alone with her one night and went to a football party the next day and had some beers. 

A last, and most important source of conflict was her personal issues. She started having some rough family issues over the summer, a summer that we spent apart because I had an internship in another city than she. She lived at home and just felt alot of unfairness being put upon her from her family. I think this stress caused her to start treating me poorly in some ways, and when she broke up with me she said it was because she wasn't being the girlfriend that I deserved. 

There's a little more information here and there, but that's the basic jist of things. Now here's where my question comes in. I'm crazy about this girl, its only been a few days after our break up I know, but I want this girl in my life. I know that for now I have to give her space, I need to be respectful of that, and I need to work on other things in my life that I have control over and keep strong emotionally. If she were to see that I'm not handling myself well, she'd more than likely blame herself but lets also be honest, girls want a strong man in their lives. 

This girl is slightly different though, she tries to be/thinks/is very independent. I think near the end of our relationship she may have gotten the feeling that she was starting to depend on me and it freaked her out. She won't be dependent, it scares the living out of her and she just won't have any of it. I think that could be part of why she wanted to end things, aside from wanting to work on things in her life. Here is my question.

I love this girl. More than most anything in the world. I let her become my world and that was a mistake for which I am now paying the price, it's been a rough couple of days. I know that I let that happen though and I intend to not let it happen ever again, but I want to fight for this girl. I don't want to let too much time go by and then lose her forever. I want to fight her because she is special and not to be boastful but I truly think that I could make her happy for the rest of her life should we decide to do that sort of thing in the future. What do you people of r/relationships think about my situation? and what do you think that I should do? I appreciate any responses and I know this is a fairly long read so I appreciate those who read it until the end.

**edit: Last Friday was her birthday. The night before was the time we were going to celebrate her birthday because she was turning 21 and I wasn't and so I couldn't join in on the next days activities since they included going to bars. I bought her roses and made her a cheesecake. I did other things and worked really hard on making it a special birthday for her. Being dumped a few days later sucked so hard because of this. Just a little fun fact I guess.



---   
**tl;dr**: I want to fight for the girl who broke my heart a couple of days ago. She ended things because she was afraid she was hurting me, and she may have been, but I think she has the potential to be better and be someone who I could spend the rest of my life with. What do you think and what do you think I should do?"

I have 16 credit hours at school this semester. A compiler class and a theory of algorithm class. Both are taught only in the fall and if I fail I have to stay till next fall if I pass both i'm graduating in may.

The problem is I have no time for anything but these classes. I woke up at 8, went to class at nine, finished class at 2 and then worked on homework till just now and i'm still not finished and i'm still struggling with tests. 

When was I supposed to find the time to do open source work look for internships. It feels like the only way I would have found the time is if I didn't work a job to pay my rent.  I don't have time for anything else anymore. Even laundry has to be planned two weeks in advance because finding two hours to do all my clothes is hard. 

What employer is going to bother with a guy with just a degree when they can choose between me and people with a degree and experience. It feels like the moment I tried to go to college and try to keep a job was the moment I screwed myself. How crappy would it be to have saved up for all this time, to plan for all this time and still come out of this working a shitty job that pays for crap or finding no job at all. "

It was actually my first day of my internship. I had my outfit/hair/makeup ready, handbag packed, HR papers signed. What could possibly go wrong?

*I'm going to be a bit... straight-from-my-mind in telling this story, mostly because I'm not in a good mood, and writing it down exactly how I'm thinking makes this easier to get down. It's sort of snarky^sorry but I promise it's not to be rude. It was more serious at the time, but it's easier to tell this way.*

**Glass Breakfast**

I woke up earlier than usual for the first day of my summer internship. I was excited; I had gotten an extremely competitive position at a pretty well-known software company. This is a company I'm strongly considering working for once I graduate, so this internship was a total blessing for me. One month back in college, and I'm still gushing happily about my internship experience. :)


Anyway, I got ready for my first day and headed to the kitchen to make myself breakfast. Normally, NMom will sleep in until 10 or so, then get up, make herself breakfast, then browse the internet the rest of the day. I wish I were kidding. She works a few months out of the year, and the rest of her precious time is spent inconveniencing my family. NMom woke up bright and early today and stormed into the kitchen, already in a bad mood. Why? No reason, purely just because fuck you all; that's why.


I was almost done making breakfast (toast and jam, comfort food for me), and was almost on my way to the dining table, when she yelled at me to ""eat something substantial,"" made me get rid of the breakfast I had made, and made me sit down and wait for her to cook something. By this point, I wasn't too happy because I had been ready to leave, and waiting for her would make me late. But that doesn't matter, because NMom *has* to make breakfast (specifically *today*, she never makes breakfast otherwise) because she's an amazing mother (/sarcasm)! EDad is downstairs getting ready for work, because he's dropping me off before he heads to work. He is completely oblivious to everything going on upstairs, as usual.


She's clearly angry, and is slamming things around in the kitchen, screaming and complaining about god-knows-what, and generally being noisy. I know by now that ""talking it out,"" will not work in my favor, so I quietly get up and retreat to my room for ten minutes.


Fun fact, I hate loud noises, and the sound of my mother's voice *especially* bothers me, so I generally try to stay away from all of it.


She yells that breakfast is ready, so I scoot back into my chair, and she places a plate of eggs in front of me (ew, I'm not a huge fan of eggs). I pick up my fork and start eating, when I notice that there are some really solid pieces in my eggs. Crunchy, almost. I ask my mother why it feels like there are small hard-to-chew and sort of crunchy pieces of egg, and I get another earful of that annoying, piercing shrieking (and a glass of milk, hooray for dairy).


She tells me to stop being ungrateful because she put so much work into making breakfast for me so I better shut up and eat. I do appreciate that she made me breakfast, but firstly, eggs are so goddamn easy to make; secondly, I technically *had* my breakfast made before, and this was just making me late; and lastly, milk isn't that hard to pour into a cup so I'm not even sure that counts for effort. Or so I thought.


I force down the eggs with the milk, and I notice my throat starting to hurt. Not aching, but sharp pains. Maybe even tasting a bit of blood. I look over at the counter to check the time, and I notice two things: one, I'm definitely late now; two, there's broken glass on the counter.


So somebody (namely, NMom) definitely couldn't handle pouring milk from one container to another. Pure amazement at this point.


I look back at my plate, and where the eggs were, there are pieces of broken glass. I get up and show my NMom, and of course, get another earful of banshee wails. ""Shut up and stop complaining! You're fine, stop making such a big deal out of everything!"" By this point, EDad comes upstairs, and as usual attempts to calm down the firefight about to go down between NMom and me.


He asks what happened, and I tell him that NMom fed me broken glass, and she starts yelling about how she accidentally broke the glass on my plate and how it's not her fault that I didn't pick out the glass (I'll mention here that she gave me *no* warning whatsoever, not even a verbal one). You may be wondering why I don't thoroughly inspect my food before I eat it -- oh, you're not? Ah, because that's not a normal thing to do! Normal people don't need to concern themselves with wondering whether or not their next meal will kill them. But it's also because glass is clear, so it's pretty hard to pick out in a plate of eggs; let's also not forget I did notice something but NMom shoved it down my gullet anyway.


**Conclusion**


NMom makes me a breakfast that I didn't need, makes me late for my first day of work, breaks glass, gets some broken glass in my food, tells me there's nothing wrong with my food, says I'm ungrateful for not eating her food, yells at me to eat it, then claims it wasn't her fault that I ate glass.

2gxl21,9,2014-09-20,I need advice. [19/m],[deleted],bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/2gxl21/i_need_advice_19m/,"Hi all, 

So, I think I'm bisexual. I'm attracted to men. Sort of. Let me explain. 

Me and my freshman year roommate hit it off as soon as we moved into the dorms together. We lived together, we studied together,  failed exams together, took road trips together, etc. We grew really close really quickly. We're in our junior year now, and our friendship has only improved since freshman year.

Last spring semester (this was the spring semester of our sophomore year), he told me that he was bisexual... and that he had a crush on me. I told him that I was bisexual as well, and had felt some inexplicable non-platonic feelings for him in the past, but I was with someone at the moment so nothing came of it.

During the summer, we both went our separate ways (we had internships in different cities) so we rarely saw each other. However, he had a party as his house one weekend during the summer, and I had some free time, so I made the trip from my house to his and stayed the weekend.

Now, over the summer he had found a boyfriend and had discovered that he was solely gay. I had recently become single. Anyways, long story short, he (roommate), his boyfriend, and I end up in his room making out after the party ended. I loved it. Tons of fun. But I couldn't get hard even though I was incredibly attracted to both of them. I back out of the situation and let them do their thing. I don't really know why, even though I was attracted to them, my body didn't respond. Nervousness, maybe? I dunno. 

So, now I'm all confused. When I look at girls, I get this primal instinct to have sex with them. my body *ahem* responds accordingly. 

When I look at guys, it's a much different kind of attraction. It's still sexual, but it's just... different. I don't get hard (you'll have to pardon me for being so frank). It's a different kind of attraction which is almost more emotional than the kind of attraction I feel towards women. 

However, here is where the stories about my roommate become relevant: when I see him, I just want to tear him apart. Sexually, of course. It's still a different kind of attraction than what I feel towards women, but it's much more intense than what I feel for other men.

With other men, I find them attractive, but not to the extent that I would go out on a limb and start flirting with them.

With roommate (who is no longer actually my roommate, I should note), I want him. Bad. My body doesn't respond right off the bat when I feel the attraction for him coming on, but I think part of that is just the fear - caused by the fact that this is all so new, and a little scary. But, beyond that, I am insanely attracted to him on an emotional level, and that attraction goes waaay beyond what could be considered platonic.

Can anyone help me figure out what this means? 

Really, any kind of advice or input here is welcome. Sorry if the story is a bit disjointed, I'm sleepy. 

**tl;dr attracted to men, attracted to women, really attracted to (male) friend. help me sort out what this means?**

I got accepted into a great university (first gen) and everyone was proud of me, I was happy. My hard work finally paid off. Then I began my internship which had me do nothing but glorified secretarial work. The work I did was never good enough. My week would begin with being called into my supervisors office, be reminded of how I failed to do a simple task for 45 minutes and then the meeting would end with an agreement to meet again on Friday to go over even more of my failure. When it came time for class, I felt like I did not belong, again I felt like I could do nothing right. My worst day in class was actually the last day of the semester. Before class began I uploaded my term paper to the class blackboard. When I checked I realized I had uploaded the wrong version, the unrefined version, the version that somehow had half of the paper in font 15, halvetica. My soul dropped as I had to gather my nerve and explain to my prof that I had uploaded the wrong version of the paper, she asked if I was stalling time because she thought I did not complete the assignment, which sunk my soul even farther. There I was, and to me it felt like my prof was insinuating that was using the oldest trick in the book... The look on her face said it all ""another brown mail that is trying to ease through"".. She let me resubmit my paper, and I was relieved. After class I went to see my therapist we talked about my day at class, and I felt better, happy even. The following day was also my last day at my internship. That day me and my supervisor went over my evaluation. Everything was "" poor""... Even know I wonder how this conclusion was reached. After she suggested that I see a shrink (this was at the beginning) I was not allowed to do anything. Three times a week I would go and simply sit in a chair, in front of a computer doing nothing. How anyone could evaluate that is beyond me. I hated that final meeting. It got to the point where I didn't care. I asked to leave since frankly I didn't know if I could stay any longer but I was told that I would be let out 15 minutes early. Instead I was given a simple task, and even that overwhelmed me. People kept talking to me at the office, but aisde from them speaking English, I didn't grasp, catch or understand anything. My entire body had an overwhelming urge to run. A client came in and my supervisor went to speak with her. When she closed the door I gathered my things and thanked everyone. I couldn't stay anylonger. I went home and I slept. I slept all the way to Monday. To say that I was tired is not even close. I was defeated, I had spent all of my energy trying not to have a freak out in the office. Tuesday came and I went to my shrink. Since I was taking a leave of absence,y insurance would run out in a month (covered by the school, while still registered as a student). We went over the options, and me not having any health insurance or a job (was a student worker) the idea of going to a CBT therapy was proposed. I accepted. The CBT therapy did not work. Every week the shrink would assign me a small chapter to read and we would discuss it in the next session. After four weeks of this, and me getting annoyed by the pointless reading assignments, the therapy switched over to more of me talking and disussing what was going on. This helped immensely. My relationship and friendships were  all affected, and in some ways talking helped me to repair these relationships. Then june comes and I am informed that our sessions are coming to an end. I  am given a list of other theaputic services and it comes to an end. When the sessions ended I thought I could do it. I thought that the old me would be back in action... I was wrong. I started to sleep more,  I didn't go out and did not care about anything. That creeping feeling of failure slowly came back. I started to think about bashing my head into the bathroom mirror, I thought about where in the mirror would I bash my head in. The last time I had that thought was mid march, so I did what I could do. I went and signed up forhealth insurance, and through the exchange I qualified for medicaid. This small accomplishment lit me up like a Christmas tree. I did it! By myself! And it was a success! I was overjoyed, elated, excited! Something was finally going right for me! 

I have an appointment next month to start the process for a new shrink. I can say that from the friends I have left they think of me as some sort of Sheldon. They think I am weird, and many cases I am not included in the group activities. My relationship with the lady friend is no more.  Sometimes I think tbat maybe smashing my head would be easier. I feel like a giant tree log taking up space and being burdensome. There are times when I don't like tomorrow because there is nothing for me. I don't know I am here? Sundays are the worst, everything begins again, and for me the click reset. 

I am tired, I am lost, and  frankly I don't know."

Who's ready for Part 2 of my *Breakfast-of-Champions* saga? I am, so let's get this over with. I'm hungry for some actual food, but the dining hall doesn't open for another hour or so. Also, y'all kept asking if I was okay; this happened a few months ago, I'm totally fine now. Back at college, far away from the family (and the glass). :)


*Part 1 is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2gx4gs/i_prefer_my_breakfast_without_glass_actually/).*


**Glass Breakfast (continued)**

... so after EDad came upstairs and I ""threw a tantrum"" about breakfast, NMom yelled a lot, berated me for eating my breakfast, and more or less attempted to justify feeding me glass. At this point, my throat definitely hurt, and I was a blubbering, crying mess (as was my hair and makeup, aww). EDad checked my throat and it was definitely pretty red, so I asked if they could take me to a hospital after work.


Side note: I said to go after work, because I was running late already and I wanted to screw up my first day of my internship about as badly as I wanted to forgive NMom for what she did. And for those of you wondering, yes ^I ^still ^have ^a ^grudge ^^sorry . I can normally forgive (but not forget), but this was way over the line for me. And I told her that (in different words). Which was met with more screaming and blame-throwing. Surprise! Wasn't expecting that (/sarcasm).


Asking if they could take me to a hospital was a big no-no. NMom started screaming about how I'm making a big deal out of everything, and about how I wasn't allowed to go to the hospital because I'd probably ""tell them some story that would make her look abusive"" ^really ^no ^shit ^maybe ^if ^you ^don't ^want ^me ^to ^think ^you're ^abusive, ^don't ^be ^abusive . Unfortunately, EDad took her side because he didn't want people to start questioning why I had ingested glass, because it would most likely land back on them.


So I'm leaving for work and NMom is following me around and silently glaring at me (I picked the wrong day to start a fight)... that's uncomfortable. She gives me lunch and (big mistake), I decide to be a little snark and tell her, ""thanks, but I'm going to buy my lunch; there probably won't be glass in it."" ^Okay, ^I ^don't ^always ^make ^the ^best ^decisions, ^bear ^with ^me. 


And this starts off another round of yelling. EDad is waiting in the car (smart move, this house is now a battlefield), so I run out the door. But I'm still crying because NMom *never even once bothered to apologize or ask if I'm okay*. Her first reaction was to defend herself, then attack me. So yes, I was more upset about that than I should have been.


So fine, off to work we go. I'm still crying a bit in the car, and my throat is hurting more and more (my sobbing doesn't help any, mostly just makes it worse). EDad is sympathetic, but is also trying his damned hardest to convince me that NMom is not a bad person, that I should forgive her, that she cares, that I'm being too hard on her, that she shouldn't need to apologize (because parents shouldn't have to apologize to their kids for anything), that it's okay to not apologize because she's my elder and I should treat her with respect no matter what (this is wildly irrational reasoning to me, respect should be earned even for parents), that I should love her because she's my mother, and a bunch of other bullshit I wasn't in the mood to hear.


I do make it to my first day of work just barely on time and barely looking presentable. Nobody suspects a thing, and I don't tell them a thing. But I made it. So I go in, set up my office and all, and get down to business. Okay, maybe not business. I tinkered around with some software/breadboards for a couple hours, because everyone knows interns don't do much work on their first day. ;)


By the time lunch comes around, my throat is still hurting. It hurts to swallow (how will I eat?), it hurts to talk, it hurts to breathe. Anything and everything hurts. Then I cough and some blood comes out (and I get some stares from my coworker, damn). Oh, boy. So I skip lunch, and I update EDad on the status of my throat. Take note, EDad has been constantly checking in on me, whereas NMom hasn't called, texted, or emailed once yet to apologize/check up (or complain, so hooray for that).


EDad is beyond worried at this point, and tells me he'll take me to the hospital after work. He tells NMom, who then starts calling and texting every five minutes (all of which I ignore, because I wasn't in the mood for more yelling). I struggle through my first day (and went into the bathroom a couple times to cry it out, which wasn't how I wanted that to go), and EDad picks me up in the evening to take me home to change/drop off my stuff. NMom comes down and is waiting for me. She yells at me for not taking her calls or replying to her texts. I'm tired and not in the best of moods, so I respond with, ""as if you really care. I'm going to the hospital.""


Another yelling battle ensues. But this time it's mostly just her yelling because I can't really talk back without my throat hurting or without coughing up blood. Some of her justifications include:

* you're going to lie and tell them I'm abusive! *That's not really a lie at this point, is it.*

* hospitals are expensive, you're just wasting money! *Funerals are also expensive, you know.*

* stop making such a big deal out of everything!

* shut up, just shut up (this one's her favorite one to use)! *I'm not even talking, my throat is bleeding!*

* I bet so-and-so's daughter wouldn't make this big a deal out of everything! *I bet so-and-so doesn't feed their daughter glass for breakfast.*

*And still no apology*.


So EDad whisked me away to the land of x-rays, scrubs, and waiting rooms. This was around 11 at night, because we got pretty held up at home. I did have work early the next morning, but screw sleep, right? Right.


We get back around 1 in the morning, and luckily(ish?), nothing was majorly wrong. I didn't have massive internal bleeding, because the pieces were rather small, but the glass was small enough that they couldn't do anything about it, like surgically removing it. I was told to wait it out. I'd be in pain for a few days, but hopefully the glass would pass through without causing any serious damage. If I see any changes, let them know, blah blah blah. Pay the $20 copay fee (gasp! $20, surely we'll be bankrupt at this rate!), get back home, get yelled at some more, go to sleep. She tells me the next morning that she's taking the copay amount out of my paycheck, which is actually ridiculous because *100% of my paychecks go straight to them*. I didn't get to keep my internship money. :(


But it's okay, I thoroughly enjoyed the internship itself. That was good enough for me. I suppose money is just a plus. :)


**Conclusion**


Luckily, no serious damage or internal bleeding. EDad can be reasonable at times but defends NMom far too much, NMom doesn't know how to apologize. GC brother slept through basically everything, so he's a lucky duck."

We started dating during a summer internship at our school.  There we could spend a lot of quality time together and I really loved that...

But now we have moved into seperate dorms only a few blocks away and the rest of the student body is coming back from summer break.  This is where I have some worries.

Her 'best friend' is a [20M] moving into the same dorm that she is giving them more time to hang out while I have to get signed into a building a few blocks away.  I am still trying to accept their relationship as nothing but plutonic, but it is difficult.  

They would sit close studying together, she would text him all the time, and he's even spent the night at her place.  I have already discussed my feelings with my girlfriend, and I have noticed that she has started to text him less in front of me, but still keeps contact almost every day.

I don't know if I'm just jealous, or insecure, or even right about these feelings, but I do know that I want these feelings to stop.

I also feel really bad about these feelings because apparently her guy friend has no other real friends.  I don't know if he's playing a sad sap card complaining how his life sucks or his life might actually be terrible!  And part of me feels sorry for him, but another part wants him to keep his distance.  I've only meet the guy a few times and he has already made me get bad thoughts of poeple who resemble him in any way, even just his name.

All I want to know if the best way for me to get rid of these feelings while keeping our relationship strong.  Thank you.

tl;dr - My girlfriend and her guy best friend are too close for comfort.  How do I get these insecure feelings out of my head?"
2gz3nl,1,2014-09-20,[REQUEST] Blizzcon virtual ticket ($39.99) [story inside also],stajmw,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/2gz3nl/request_blizzcon_virtual_ticket_3999_story_inside/,"Good afternoon GoG,

First and foremost I want to say that I absolutely do not expect to be gifted this large of a gift, but I do figure that it never hurts to try or ask.

With that being said I would like to take a second so sit right there and I will tell you why I want this virtual ticket.

I have been an avid Blizzard gamer for quite awhile now.  I grew up playing Diablo 1 and transitioned nicely into Diablo 2 then WoW then into Diablo 3 now.  All of these games were played alongside my father who at the time was very much so into gaming.  It was an amazing time and it often allowed us to bond since we generally didn't see much of each other with him working 16 hour shifts as a welder on midnights.

Blizzard has kept me occupied with their many a games since I was a kid and ultimately helped form my passion of gaming and computers.  I am currently a senior in college who is currently jobless but actively searching to fulfill full time employment.  I did have a summer internship with a large corporation that did pay us nicely but I saved all that money for a new PC and to help my parents pay for my last semester of college.

Now that I do not have the bank account I once did I am regretting it.  I am unable to purchase the things I want and with my fiancee currently saving her money to pay off her student loan debts I do not feel comfortable asking her for the money.

This is not a plea or a ""hear my sob story"" but rather a request if anyone has spare change lying around.  As I had mentioned I sincerely do not expect to be given but why not try.

Thank you for your time, I hope you all have an amazing weekend

Sincerely,

Stajmw"

2gzloi,2,2014-09-20,Stuck at home until college is over [vent/help],lmcr,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2gzloi/stuck_at_home_until_college_is_over_venthelp/,"My parents have always been a bit strict with my brother and me. I was not allowed to go or large as a kid, no boyfriends while in high school, and determining what my brother (a year older) and I could and couldn't do.  

When I turned 16, I started to think about college. Both of my parents have doctorates in engineering and teach at a local university.  Although they always claimed that my brother and I should study something we liked, the few times I commented I might be intrested in studying something that wasn't engineering, it led to a longwinded argument that boiled down to it all being a waste of money (in many cases stating I could do that on my free time). Afterwards, when ithought aboutstudying somewhereother than the local University,  the arguments are about the being no reason when the program here was good and it would be to expensive to be somewhere else.  My mom even used my health problems to persuade me against it.  

That's how we get to the present:  I'm 19 years old and in my third year of a bachelors in mechanical engineering and even though I enjoy it, I'm never sure if this is something I chose for myself or not.

I discovered this sub a few months ago and had a small crisis when I notices how many N traits both my parents have. It opened my eyes to the reasoning behind most of their behaviors (they think they're superior to most and always right,  they, especially my mom,  make my achievements about them). 

My mom likes to say that I'm the improved version of her, if I accomplish anything is either because of her in some way or what I accomplished is not all that important.  I always feel sick to my stomach when other people comment on me 'following their footsteps' and things like that. I feel like they're stripping me of my identity.

To my parents,  the most important thing I can be doing is studying. Any time not spent studying is time misspent, unless I'm cleaning my room or doing some other activity they approve of. Like I said, I'm 19 and in college; I've already had an internship with a big company (and I'm returning next summer), I've gotten mostly As and Bs all this time while juggling a boyfriend and projects. 

I think I'm both the GC and SG, my brother is usually left alone to do as he wants (and he is not nearly as restricted as I am). 

This year, I decided to participate in student government, and I really like it. Due to late classes and meetings, I come home 'late' (8-10) mostly every day of the week. I sometimes go to the University on weekends to study or do group projects. 

I've mentioned to my parents that it might be a good idea for me to stay at a friend's apartment sometimes when I have late meetings, that way I could hang out with the friends I made afterwards. This was met with sharp criticism on the fact that I spend so much time in student tormenta when my priority should be studying. I commented that this doesn't seem like a balanced life since I never went out. Apparently, meetings and going out with my boyfriend to exercise count as going out and having fun in their book.

I want to be able to go out to bars with my friends and act my age without worrying about a screaming match (the drinking age here is 18), to be able to visit my boyfriend's apartment without them freaking out. I want to be able to say my opinion without it being discarded as me not understanding due to my age just because they disagree with it. I want to be myself without being criticized, for them to say that something I'm doing is great instead of pointing out everything that they think is wrong. I want to make my own decisions without second guessing myself about if it's good or bad or if its what I want or what they want me to want. 

Basically, I'm feeling trapped: I don't have time to get a job, nor enough money to move out. My boyfriend's parents would probably crown upon me moving in with him (and I don't want to cause him any problems). I've resorted to spending as much time as possible at the University and locking myself in my room when I'm home. I give them the bare minimum of information when we talk, stay away from sensitive subjects, and try to not engage in arguments. 

Do any of you have some advice on how to deal with this situation or the thoughts that I keep having?"
2gzr0z,5,2014-09-20,Time to vent: Problems with my family,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2gzr0z/time_to_vent_problems_with_my_family/,"Ok, so my life at home is driving me insane and I need to vent before I go crazy. I do realise, however, that my problems are not nearly as bad as many on here so sorry if they seem a little trivial or petty.

Just a few recent examples of the things that are getting to me (in no real order, it might be a bit rambly):

Recently I graduated from university with a degree in English. My university isn't exactly the most respected in the world, but I managed to get a 1st class degree (for those who don't know, here in the UK degrees are classified with 1st being the highest, then 2:1, then 2:2 and so on) so I was happy with what I'd achieved.

My parents have not told me at any point that they are proud of me. There was a brief mention of 'oh well done', but that quickly turned to enquiries regarding me getting a job, telling me I'm just lazy and wasting my life etc. Now, while I agree getting a job is important after leaving uni, I don't feel I was committing some heinous act by taking a little bit of time out after studying and everything to just relax. 

In the end, I finished my last class in late May, applied for jobs through June and July, had an interview in August and now I am in a graduate intern position within my university. Sure, I probably could have applied to more places than I did, spent every second desperately begging for employment (and I do realise I was lucky to get the job I did), but I hardly think I deserve the accusations from my nmom (and more subtle comments from other family members) that I am wasting my life.

I remember just about two weeks after I had my last class my nmom took my sister and I out to get some breakfast. Everything was going nicely and it was enjoyable, but then she asked 'You don't seem to have any desire to do anything and it seems like you'll never get a job at this rate. So, what are you doing with your life?' My answer of 'I'm eating breakfast' didn't go down well, as she turned it into a whole big thing about me being lazy and using her for money, not like (list of other people my age who are apparently perfect) who are so much better than me. 

When I was at home I was 'lazy' and 'did nothing all day'. Now that I do have a job I'm 'not talking to her enough' and 'not spending enough time with the family'.

Graduation itself was ruined (though I didn't say anything) by her complaining about every last detail. A few of her complaints: It was too hot. The place was too crowded. I didn't want to eat when she did. We had to walk too far. There weren't enough toilets. I didn't know which seats they'd be in. And so on.

Afterwards we went to a restaurant for my 'treat', except I had no input on where we'd go. Not really a big issue in itself as I mostly don't mind, but then everyone still had complaints about the menu, the location, and countless other things which led to my nmom shouting at my sisters in the middle of the crowded room before continuing like nothing had happened. So I was forced to sit there while everyone else stared at our table, yet was expected to be hugely grateful for this spectacular treat. Again don't get me wrong it was a nice idea to go out to eat afterwards and I didn't have to pay and everything, but the whole feel of the day was ruined by stupid petty public arguments over minor inconveniences.

Now, when I'm unhappy with family members I tend to be very quiet and withdrawn, avoiding them wherever possible, it's the only real way I know how to deal with being upset or angry with them; I can't bring myself to confront or challenge them directly as I'll be shouted down and invalidated. It's a natural reaction more than a concious choice. However, my parents have noticed this and try to undermine this as well. A couple of weeks ago or so I was screamed and shouted at for asking a question. I asked 'have you done the laundry yet? I had a few things I wanted to put in'. A shocking, disgustingly antagonistic question directly attacking my parents authority as I'm sure you can see. Somehow this question turned, in my dad's mind, into me saying 'WHY HAVE YOU DONE THE LAUNDRY I HAD STUFF TO PUT IN THERE, IDIOT!', causing him to get angry with me, causing my mom to get angry with him, causing them both to get angry with me. Solid logic there. 

So after being screamed at for bringing down the hierarchy of the family with my laundry-based rebellion I didn't feel much like talking to them for a while. Again this was unacceptable. My mom pulled me to one side and said she doesn't like when I'm quiet and that I should just talk to people even if I'm annoyed or upset, with the main reason being that my grandma (who was visiting) had noticed I seemed down and wondered if I was ok.

Now I said to my mom that I can't always be happy, especially when I am treated badly for little or no reason. To this she said 'well then you should just act'. No mention of any fault on her part. No mention of it being a concern to her in any way that I'm unhappy. No, for the benefit of appearances I should just act like I'm happy and that everything is always ok. I suppose it'd make things easier for her--why bother treating people with a basic level of respect if you can just get them to act like they're ok with you no matter what you say or do to them.

And now today my mom bought me a lasagne. Great, I like lasagne, that was nice of her and all. However it apparently came with a debt of gratitude beyond the level I realised. She burst in to my room demanding to know why I hadn't put the lasagne on yet and if 'I was even ever going to eat it after she bought it specially'. I told her I'd already put it in the oven, but that information was again seen as a direct challenge to her authority, leading her to stomp around the house shouting about how I'm so ungrateful and rude. My dad said 'well she bought that for you as a treat, she just wanted you to be happy and grateful that was all'. Now again, I like lasagne. But I didn't think it was cause for great celebration or that it demanded that my mom should be worshipped as a god for her generous bounty. But hey, I guess I'll know that in future.

Of course, my sister can shout back and be rude and do whatever she wants to do while still being praised constantly and being seen as if she can do no wrong. This being the girl who stole £100 from me and emptied my other sister's bank account (only stopping because there was nothing left to take), taking her card and hiding all her bank statements. The girl who is yet to pay the majority of that money back and is now asking me for £100 a month from my salary because her student loans 'aren't enough'. The girl who has bought herself three phones, two laptops and an iPod within the last 6 months because she breaks them or gets bored with them. I could go on but that's another story really.

Typing this out makes me feel like my problems are incredibly petty and small. It also makes me feel like a complete child, when I'm supposed to be an adult. I intend to move out as soon as possible (I'm saving right now) and then hopefully I can leave all the insignificant, childish issues behind and move on. Hopefully it doesn't sound too silly me posting these here.

This is all just one big ramble type thing and I'm not sure it will even make any sense, but I really needed to just get it out somewhere, so thanks. This sub is really helpful."
2gzs3s,2,2014-09-20,"Should I, [19 M] wait for my (ex) girlfriend [18 F] of two years to come back?",ThatKidWithTheHat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2gzs3s/should_i_19_m_wait_for_my_ex_girlfriend_18_f_of/,"Allow me to give you the background of our relationship. Settle in, because I want you to fully understand why I need help.

Two years ago, I was going through a rejection that had me in a state of depression so deep all I could stand to do with myself was lie on my bed. I was being pestered by my buddy to come over and spend a few days at his house down the shore. Finally having had enough of his bothering, I relented and went over. 

That was the night I met her, his cousin, who was visiting. We'll call her Ester. She sat up from the bunk bed where she was napping and looked down and asked who the fuck I was. She had a pixie cut and a baby face, and she was really really tiny. She was wearing a white spaghetti strap top and purple pajama pants. When I first saw her I thought she was a rude twelve year old boy. 

I sat down and set up my laptop, and began to play Borderlands. I didn't pay much mind to her at first. My friend was on his laptop too, so she climbed down from the bunk bed and got hers out, knowing she wouldn't be able to resume her nap. It was at this point that I realized she was a girl. Still disinterested due to the pain of rejection, I just intently played my game. 

I don't know what she was doing, but I played for at least an hour until she said to me ""you are like, super focused on that game bro."" I can't remember what I said back. She asked me why I never took off my hat. I took it off, just to humor her. She gasped and said ""Oh my god your hair is so fluffy and gorgeous!"" She stole my hat and refused give to it back. I was embarrassed, but in a good way.

A little more time went by, I had grown tired of borderlands and was just browsing reddit. She started to play Disney songs. This is the moment things started getting interesting. As an animator, I am a huge Disney fan, and I know all the words to most songs. The first song she put on was ""Make a Man Out of You"" from Mulan. I sang along quietly. She asked me if I liked Disney. I asked her if she was joking. The rest of the night was spent singing Disney songs non-stop at the top of our lungs, and just talking about Disney stuff in general. I began to realize how pretty she was. Her auburn hair, her rosy, chubby cheeks, her cute button nose, her incredible smile, her wide, gorgeous blue eyes... My friend shot me the most shit-eating of shit-eating grins. 

She got a call from her boyfriend. She said goodnight to him, and that she loved him. I thought ""well, there goes that.""

Time for sleep came. Her Aunt instructed her that since she was family and I was a guest, I would be taking the bed. After she left the room, I told Ester that she could keep the bed. I made a bed on the floor. We didn't sleep at all that night. We talked until the sun rose. Not just about Disney. I can't remember everything. 

She talked about how she had been trying to break up with her boyfriend, who was abusive, for a while. Hope! At on point in the conversation, her cousin playfully insulted her, as cousins do, which I laughed along at. She said to me ""fuck you, kid!"" to which I replied ""Yeah, I bet you'd like to."" Her cousin gave me that shit-eating grin again, and in a shit-eating voice said ""Ooooh shit!"" I couldn't see her face at the time, but it was probably bright red.

The next day came, and I had to leave for the day for a dentists' appointment. I said I'd like to keep our conversation going, so I asked for her number, which she practically gave me before I could get the words out. We spent the whole day talking. She pretended to know what Doctor Who was to impress me, a huge DW fan. I knew she was faking but I thought it cute. After I returned, our conversation seamlessly transitioned, as if I had never left at all. 

The next day Me, my friend, Ester, and her little sister all went to the beach. Eventually we went in the ocean. Her little sister told me that Ester liked me, as little sisters do to embarrass their big sisters. I, being the awkward nerd I was, didn't know how to move forward with that information, so I just kept body surfing. I cut my chin on some shells on a bad surf. Ester, who was sitting at our towel camp, saw my bloody scarred chin, immediately grabbed a towel, and started playing nurse. It was adorable, and I was blushing.

Night fell. She wore a nightgown with patterns of Mickey and Minnie kissing on it. Cute. At this point we both knew we liked each other, but didn't know quite how to express it. My friend was in the top bunk of the bed, and we were lying together on the bottom. We talked for some time, shifting positions, trying to get comfortable while still being able to look at each other.

She said jokingly ""I don't know what to do with my hands."" I told her, "" You can hold mine..."" She turned bright red, grabbed my hand, and buried her face in my chest. We spent a little more time talking. She asked me sheepishly ""... when are you going to kiss me?"" So I admitted to her that I'd never kissed a girl. At least, not passionately, seriously. She laughed, then realized I was being serious. She leaned in and said ""well, let me fix that."" Her lips were warm and soft, and she trembled and breathed heavily. She smiled between kisses, and, out of breath, said ""For never having kissed a girl before, you're really good at it."" ""Thanks."" Back to kissing. We kissed for a long time. She bit my lip. She immediately apologized, ""I've never done that to anyone before, it just felt right."" I said don't be sorry, I liked it. 

As we kissed more, she began climbing on top of me, clutching my shirt. I reminded her that her cousin was still in the top bunk, (who, though we didn't know it at the time, was taking pictures to blackmail her with later) and that I had only known her for three days, and we shouldn't move so quickly. (She would later thank me for being a gentleman) She said ""you're right, I've just never felt so instantly connected to somebody."" Back to kissing. 

Finally, she stopped, put her head on my shoulder and whispered in my ear. ""...I love you Greg..."" It was scary and wonderful all at the same time. I didn't know what to do, what to say. Could it be true? Where do we go from here? Did I just help a girl cheat on her boyfriend? Do I say it back? Do I really mean it if I say it? I just resumed kissing her. After a while, she blew me a kiss goodnight, and left to sleep in the other room. 

The next morning came. We all went to breakfast. The family had already caught wind of what was going on between us, and decided to torture us. They sat us next to each other at the table, talked about love, etc. We blushed, kept looking at each other and kept looking away. 

Finally the time came for her to leave. I had learned that she was visiting from Florida, 1000 miles from me. I thought that was the end. Until she gave me a letter. A wonderful, corny, sappy letter:

*""Hey batman (a nickname she gave me, based on the shirt I was wearing),*

*I really had fun these past couple days. I hope we can make this last. You make me feel so wonderful. I've never felt so much like a girl haha... No pressure. I know things may get difficult but I'm willing to try for such a great guy. I don't want to ever forget you.*

*This is Pikachu (my nickname for her). And she adores you. My stomach is like jello and my mind melting chocolate. 
I hope you feel the same.*

*Ester Jager*

Fast forward a few months, she comes to visit. We had been video chatting every day, and were facebook official. But I was scared that after so much time we might not be the same way in person. I was wrong. I was overwhelmed when I saw her again. She was standing there awkwardly, cute as I remembered her. She got all dressed up for me. I picked her up and spun her around. she grabbed me tightly and kissed me. We both had tears in our eyes. We went about our day together, and everything was wonderful. The next day, we took each other's virginity. We were closer than ever. She left again, but any and all doubts we had were gone.

Fast forward to the Summer of that year. She is now a fully indoctrinated Doctor Who fan like myself. She comes to visit and we go to an anime convention, Otakon, together. We've set up a cosplay, me as the Tenth Doctor and she as the TARDIS. We are in the dealer hall, and I have her wrapped up in my coat with me. Somebody comes by and asks to get a picture of the two of us, so we begin to pose in character as we have all day. She stops us and says ""No, I want a picture of you two as you just were! You're the most adorable couple I've ever seen! I ship you so hard!"" It was weird, but I had never felt better about our relationship than at that moment.

That night I went to dinner with her and her Father, who had accompanied her on this trip. Because her parents are separated, this was the first time I had met him. He told me to call him (we'll say) Dan instead of Mr. Jager, which I refused. That was a test, I passed. We bonded and got along instantly. We play the same games, have the same opinions, and obviously both have a great deal of love for Ester. He told me to hold onto her, because I was the best thing for her. He told her he would never forgive her if she let go of me. The next morning he pulls me aside and gives me a patch. *94th FIGHTER SQ. HAT IN THE RING.* ""I give these only to men I trust with my life. It's obvious to me that you love my daughter and would do anything for her. It's obvious to me that she feels the same."" I shook his hand, thanked him for the honor, and we went off to the next day of the convention.

Fast forward again, I am beginning my first year of college. She, still a senior in high school, jokingly warned me not to fall in love and leave her. I assured her that would never happen. She came to visit me for Valentines, and I went to Disney with her for Spring break. Our connection was never stronger. I visited her again in the summer, and finally got to meet all her friends. Her friends tell me they love me, I am the best guy she's ever had, they've never seen her so happy, please hold onto her. We go to Disney World for three days with her family and her cousin (the same one who is my friend from before) and his family. At the end of my stay of the trip, I get onto the Disney's Magical Express bus to take me back to the airport. She was the only one to see me off (the rest of the family was having breakfast). I climb onto the bus, and we just look at each other longingly through the window until it finally leaves. The man sitting behind me, a father, says to me ""I don't know what the whole story is, but hold onto that girl. She's cuter than a bug in a rug, and it's obvious she loves you.""

Fast forward. She has decided on her college destination. The school is less than five minutes from my house, though I warned her not to make her decision based on me. The two of us are extremely excited! We are finally going to be together after all this time! I get a paid summer internship so I can take her out, and she is working to pay for books and supplies. As time goes by, I become increasingly paranoid about the state of our relationship. I am constantly afraid I will lose her, as a good number of her friends are guys. I don't want to lose her when we're so close to being together. She assures me that she would never do that to me. She quickly moves up at her job, and gets offered an opportunity to open a new location for $1000. She accepts, and goes to spend a week opening up this new location.  

After a few weeks, our anniversary comes around again. Though she's isn't here, we tried to spend it together, but ultimately decided that tomorrow would be better. On that day she admitted to me that over her trip she got blackout drunk and woke up naked next to one of her coworkers. She promises she doesn't remember anything that happened and that if anything did she would be in pain (she's very tiny). Though I'm angry, I'm not about to give up on us over something we don't even know for sure happened. I forgive her, and ask her not to drink anymore, to which she agrees.


Finally the day comes when she moves in. I know everything is going to go back to normal. But everything isn't right. She still feels shame over what she did. On the first night, she expresses to me that she doesn't feel worthy of me. She thinks she's holding me back. She's too fucked up. She will never be able to give me the kids and home we'd talked about once. I tell her I don't care about any of that. All I know is that I want her now, and that I love her now. I don't want to throw away any chances for what we could have just because we are afraid we might not last. I ask her if she still loves me and still wants me. She says that's not the point. I keep pressing. She says yes. Then I say, don't worry about the future. She leaves without kissing me goodnight, hugging me, or a final I love you. She later texts me saying she's sorry about all of that, and that she'll see me tomorrow.

The next day I show her the letter that I've held on to for all this time. She cries, but tries to hide it. I ask her if she still means all of the things she wrote in the letter. She says yes. So then I hug her, and tell her not to worry about the future. She kisses me. The next day I take her to dinner. She takes my hand from across the table and says ""I'm so sorry for the other night. I'm glad everything is finally going back to normal."" I took her back to my dorm and we had sex for the first time in six months. Everything was truly back to normal.

The week goes on, and we're both in school. She tells me about her band, which she formed on a whim with people she met and jammed with. She shows me pictures. I tell her I am happy for her, but to be careful. The drummer definitely has a crush on her. She assures me that I'm the only one for her, and that they're just her friends. We spend the weekend down the shore. We have more sex.We cuddle, we kiss, she says I love you. Everything has truly gone back to normal.

The next weekend we planned to go to a drive-in movie theater. She tells me she is going camping with her bandmates the day before, but she can cancel to spend the night with me instead. Not wanting to be *that* boyfriend, I tell her to go and have fun with her friends, but to be safe. She promises, says I love you, and goes.

The next morning I got a call from her. She spent the night in the hospital. One of her friends' boyfriend bought alcohol for them. I am angry at her, because she broke her promise. She could have been raped, she could be dead, etc. I calm down. I tell her I'm glad she's ok. She's at her Aunt's house now. I go to pick her up. We spend the rest of the day together. She and I cuddle on the couch and talk about the incident. She's still a little drunk so she's fascinated by my hair. She says she loves me, and she's never touching alcohol again. Eventually it's time for me to bring her back to her dorm. She says ""I love you, I'll see you tomorrow"" and kisses me like she always does. She then goes off the hang out with her friend. 

The next day, my mother wants to bring her food and gatorade to help her get over her hangover. She tells us not to come, she doesn't need help. My mother persists. Ester reluctantly agrees to come outside and get the stuff. When I see her something is noticeably wrong. She won't look me in the eye, and doesn't say much. She thanks my mother for the stuff, asks for a kiss, says to me ""I love you,"" then goes back into her dorm.

The next morning I text her to see how she is. I get no answer for hours. I start to get worried. What if she's more sick than we though? I text her a few more times. I message her bandmates. None respond. I'm worried sick. Finally, she texts me back. She says she slept late and didn't see my messages. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. I tell her to keep me updated on her condition. Okay.

The next day I get hardly any response. Quick, one word answers. Not tonight hon. I'll talk if it's not too late when we get back hon. Then, on Wednesday, silence. I try to call her several times. No response. I ask her if she needs time. She says she thinks its over. I ask her why. She won't say. 

The next day I ask to come and talk to her. She agrees. She's not wearing the earrings I gave her anymore. She hadn't taken them off since the day I gave them to her, Christmas of 2013. I ask her why she's doing this. She says she's not good enough for me. She says she's fucked up, and she keeps fucking up. She says if I knew everything I would hate her. I ask her if she's cheated on me, if there's anyone else. She says no. I tell her if you want to get rid of me you'll have to make me hate you. Instead of saying anything, she gets up and walks away. She storms up the stairs into her dorm building. I can't follow her. I talk to the security guard for an hour. Eventually her bandmate, the guitarist, comes in, and he asks me if I want to talk. I talk to him for two hours. Her other bandmate, the drummer, arrives. He won't say anything, won't sit down, and can't look me in the eye.


I later find out that she and the drummer have formed some kind of relationship. I ask her why she didn't just tell me she was seeing somebody else when I asked. She said she wasn't dating him, it didn't go that deep. I said that's not what he told me. At the very least he admitted to me that he liked her and something happened between them. She said she doesn't love me anymore, and that we're just too different people, but she couldn't look me in the eye when she said that. She doesn't want me to fight for her anymore. I ask her why she stopped loving me. She says I don't know. I ask her when she stopped loving me. She says I don't know. I asked her if she could ever love me again. She says no. I ask her if she loves the drummer. She says it isn't like that. I say ""How can you say you can definitively never love me again if you don't know why you stopped? Was that 'not good enough for me' bullshit just a lie then?"" She said that much is true, and that wasn't a fair question. She has since said she wished she could make this all better.

I'm pretty sure she is definitely in a relationship with the drummer, or at the very least they are fucking. I told her I'd wait for her, because I'd always love the girl who said I was worth it. For now, I text her every once in a while, and every once in a while I get a response. She has been friends with her exes in the past, so it's not unlikely that I will become one too. I still talk to all of her friends and family, who are furious with her for doing this to me and herself, and don't like the drummer at all. Am I a fool for wanting her back, and waiting for that day when says ""I love you"" again?

**tl;dr**: My girlfriend of two years, with whom I've had incredible chemistry on all fronts, has decided to end our relationship after finally being short-distance, seemingly for no reason except that ""she's not good enough for me."" Supposedly already has new boyfriend."

Ok reddit. Right now I have so many issues I don't know where to start. I'm going to make a few posts in varying subs which relate to aspects of my problem. r/relationships , you're first. If you want more info on anything just ask. There are things in this story I am Only beginning to admit to myself. My apologies if anything comes across as feeble or odd or wierd, and I
Would appreciate the empathy that this sub shows.

Ok so there's a guy and a girl (if you didn't guess). They met at ages  11 (Her) and 13 (Him) and both had huge feelings for each other almost immediately. Nothing happened because He has an incredible ability to overthink and overplan everything.

Instead they became very close friends. Helped each other through life,  both of them went through relationships and they slowly grew up. Always with a feeling that there was more between them. 

2 school years Her senior, He left for uni and,  to cut a long story short:

 Became single. Was drugged and raped and mugged. Became suicidal. Got back together with Ex. (Should note here that Ex saved his life from suicide, multiple times). He struggled intensely.  Lost all contact with everyone due to inability to cope with the world.

Skip 12 months. He met Her once. They kissed. He fell apart from betraying the trust of Ex who saved him. Broke contact with Her. Confessed to Ex who forgave both Him and Her (Ex was amazing). 

He (with Ex's help) slowly pieced life back together. Skip 18 months. Him, Her and Ex are all back in touch and all is as normal. He turns 21, small party of close friends (He cannot deal with large groups). Feelings between Him and Her begin to reemerge. 

Skip few weeks. Him anf Her have long conversation.  Admit mutual feelings.  Agree that nothing could realistically happen as He is with Ex etc but if this were not case then who knows. (Should be noted Him and Ex have been having reccuring issues for several months.)

Skip 2 months. Him just started working internship year.  Him and Ex decide they no longer feel like couple, more like friends.  Breakup. Him now living alone. Depression and self hatred resubmerges.

End of cut down story.

So. I am Him. Feel free to ask for elaboration on any of the above with the exception of what happened to me which I am in no way shape or form ready to talk about.

I message Her a lot to begin with and it is clear that feelings are still there. But I need be alone and fix my own head. I want to be with Her, to make Her happy. NOT to use her for support. Is this wrong? 

Recently she has stopped messaging. When we speak, she seems great, but she never instigates conversation. She says she'll ring,  then never does. She agrees to meet up, but always has plans (regardless of time on advance) at weekends (I don't work weekends). I feel like she is trying to distance herself. She does run her own business,  is about to head back to uni and has a LOT of friends to see. Im also aware I may just be down abd overworrying I just can't shake the feeling I'm being fobbed off.

It should be considered that I'm depressed (doctor has noticed and is now wanting to run tests/questionnaires :'( they're talking about antidepressants :'( :'( :'(    ) and am well out of my depth at work.  (as an electronic engineer in my first ever real world job, I'm struggling to say the least). This leads me to be tired and maybe over worry/be oversensitive.

I've been trying to message her less so as not to come across as needy and obsessed. Is this the right thing to do? Or am I over worrying? 

Also as Her is one of my closest friends I would normally go to her for help.  But I once read ""nobody wants something that's broken"" so I'm worried I'll scare her away if I tell her how much I need help. She knows I was raped but not that I attempted suicide twice,  nor that I have horrific nightmares and wake up shaking and sweating and screaming.  Nor that I occasionally have panic attacks where I don't know who anyone is or where i am and go into fight or flight mode (of which I am fight orientated and have attacked friends and Ex for coming near to me to calm me down, not intentionally and yes it makes me feel even worse about who I am.)

Should I talk to her about it or am I right to keep this quiet. 

I really like this girl. Like, REALLY like and I'm so lost as to what to do I would appreciate any advice/help.

Also I am back in touch with Ex (spent 2 months out of contact) who is helping me (as a friend) with my depression.  Is this unfair on Ex? Should I stop.


I seriously appreciate all help/advice/thoughts on this.

Thanks guys.

Tldr

I was raped. Need help. I like girl. Mixed signals from girl am o overreacting.  She is close friend. Is it acceptable to ask her for help or will this scare her away. Is it unfair on ex to still be accepting support toward depression considering possitive platonic breakup?"

I did two years at community college so I've got zero debt from that. (love my parents)

I've had one year at university, and now two more years. Then I'll have my two bachelors to accompany my associate.

I got a government internship working toward my field making 25K a year, but I still need to play for food, gas, ect. I budget like crazy with excel and sometimes sell rare things I come across.

I'll hopefully have a job making $75-$90-ish thousand per year after I graduate if I work my way up where I work now. I plan on living with friends after college, and throwing as much as I can at payments and into an account to auto deal out payments to loans so I can play the credit game a bit to help establish a good credit rating faster.

Any other ideas? Is this plan good?"
2h0lch,13,2014-09-21,"3 years in and only now have I realized this subreddit was a thing! My story, condensed.",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2h0lch/3_years_in_and_only_now_have_i_realized_this/,"Okay, sort of a condensed version, because the entirety could be a novel. It's also 1:30 am where I'm at and I'm tired but really pumped about this subreddit!

Basically, I was a depressed emo freshman girl with daddy problems, and he was the senior that was genuinely nice to everyone so all the freshman girls developed crushes on him. Including me, but I was incredibly shy, never made a move. I learned later he never made a move on me because he thought I was into ""bad boys"". Well, partly true. I dated another senior who sunk his talons into my daddy problems, and it ended up being a 3 month relationship of constant abuse, all of which I was too scared at the end to press charges over, and never told anyone. Halfway through the summer, after my now SO had graduated and everything, we casually hang out. We actually went to the high school where they had a Driver's Ed course set up, so we arranged the traffic cones into a penis shape. We're classy.

Anyway, we ended up making out, and it was so foreign to me because, for the first time in my life, I made the first move, because he was too nervous to. We kept hanging out through the summer, and we knew he was going off to college in the fall and I was starting sophomore year. We never really talked about ""what we were going to do"", we just sort of went with it. He was 3 hours away, but me not having a license put a damper on it. The first time he left we both cried.

That same year, I developed some issues that we eventually learned was a form of PTSD triggered by the other guy. But first, it just came out as seizures. They'd happen once a week, then suddenly every day, and suddenly multiple times a day. Being a smaller town, we couldn't come in with the big guns, so they just kept treating me with epilepsy drugs before I was given a diagnosis. Eventually they hooked me up to an EEG machine and learned that, no, they were not epileptic. I remember telling my SO that we were going downstate when he was home one weekend to check for the possibility of a brain tumor. We both sort of got through the night crying. I felt so horrible because he was constantly stressed...I was having terrible problems and he felt too far away to be able to do anything. 

Brain tumors were ruled out, so my EEG was sent to Mayo Clinic, where I was diagnosed with PNES (Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures). At this point, still not a single person knew what happened with the last guy, and later on that year I just sort of exploded. Honestly, since then it improved, and as I got specific therapy and regulated medications, they went away. (It's also been 2 years without seizures! YAY!) My point in bringing this up is sort of my own reflection of, holy shit, what an incredible guy to stay with me through that. We had only been together for a few months, and he was trying to manage college. There would be times I was drooling and nearly catatonic because of medications and he still held me and said I was beautiful. I don't think most guys could have gone through that.

We have had a few ""break-up scares"", both times we couldn't stay broken up for more than 24 hours. We worked through our issues together, and we take care of things before they become problems. His parents are bad at communicating, and while my mom is awesome, my dad is not model ""relationship partner"" by any stretch of the imagination, so we both are devoted to making sure we don't fall into the same thing. Which is great, it actually results in a lot less stress.

As time has gone on it's gotten easier. He was there for me for every school dance, and graduation. He got an internship 12 hours away from where we both permanently live, and I am thriving at my dream college. His internship happens to be about an hour away, so that was sort of the cherry on top. My family adores him, and while I see his less, we get along great and they don't think I'm Satan. So unless something insane happens, we're sticking with this.

I'm also really tired of people asking, ""So, are you STILL with him?"" in the tone that, gee, how are you not getting bored? GEE, I'M CONTENT WITH MY RELATIONSHIP, BACK OFF. In all seriousness, really glad this subreddit exists, and I'm pumped to talk to people who get it!

2h1n25,805,2014-09-21,Blaming me constantly? Have fun getting in trouble,Charmeleeeooonn,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/2h1n25/blaming_me_constantly_have_fun_getting_in_trouble/,"This, is very petty. And the revenge is not as great as those other stories on here, but I wanna share this. It's pretty long, because I need to include the details. This is a tale about how being immature will get you in trouble and being nice get's you cool people. I'm gonna preface this saying the maintenance man was here a few times fixing my a/c and I gave him cookies or whatever I had as a thank you- so we're on a name basis and friendly.
 
I'm in a common dorm type setting in NYC- Theres college students and interns for all places in a building. The room next to mine (it's around the hallway, but their back wall is my side wall- so from my bed I hear everything) is being obnoxiously loud until like 2 am- screaming, laughing, knocking into the wall. I didn't do anything because, well, it's fucking college and I'm not gonna complain. 

The next day at NOON, I'm making my bed and it bumps against the wall- I figure ""eh, it's a tuesday. Everyone's probably at class."" I hear knocking on my door (slightly open) and the girl pushes the door open. ""hi. you keep banging your bed against the wall and my roommate and I are *trying* to sleep. Keep it down. Thanks."" 

I didn't really know how to reply, because are you fucking kidding me? So I just go ""well, it's noon so I figured everyone was up."" and shut my door. 


A few days later I'm in the kitchen area (common area) cooking, and the girl comes up to me and goes ""you broke our wall!!"" I blink and she rambles about how theres a *huuuuuuuge* split down her wall and it's from me banging my bed into the wall, and I'm gonna have to pay for it. I go ""there's no way that's from me."" and she gets very nasty and is insisting it is from me, because I bumped my bed on the wall and the split is from the inside and I *haaaave* to fix it. I just walk away, and after I'm done cooking, I go to housing and talk to the dude. As soon as I say ""They said I broke their wall"" (Dad told me to report it to housing, to cover my bases in case they try to fine me at the end of the semester) He cracks up laughing and goes ""No. No you didn't. Is this from room 1763?"" I  told him It was either 1763 or 1762, but described what the girls looked like and he said he knows who I'm talking about, and he'll take care of it, and that I won't get fined. 


A few days after, I'm walking to my dorm and see maintenance going into their room. I run onto my bed so I can hear the details. I hear the one girl go ""...and she banged the wall and it broke."" Maintenance chuckles and goes ""Tim (housing director) told me about that, no, she didn't. Kids have punched walls on their side and not made a dent to their walls, let alone their neighbors. We've gotten noise complaints from this area so it was probably people being rowdy in here."" He patches up the wall with something, and as he's going I hear him say something about the door. I hear the girl go ""Well, *she* has a sign on her door!"" (they have a whiteboard on their door- which isn't allowed. I have a piece of paper taped up) And he goes ""Hers is tape, yours is peeling the paint off. Take it down."" So, I walk by and see paint flecked off the door- another fine they'll have to pay. 

So, from now on, I like to kinda bump the wall here and there- just as a little reminder that if you blame me for something I didn't do, it'll come back and bite you in the ass...and I'll keep annoying the shit out of you. Have fun hearing the walls go bump.

I just set up my 360 in my new apartment and got Xbox Live, just started playing Destiny a few days ago, I'm only level 3 right now, have barely played. I'm hoping to find a good social experience with the game and build up some friendships with other gamers who are getting into Destiny. I have a headset and would dig talking to people. My Gamertag is MiDeOl.

A bit about me -- I'm a 20 year old college junior studying computer science with a focus in natural language processing. I'm also studying creative writing and math, as my minors. I've done some internships and I love talking tech, literature, and just life philosophy in general. I'm living on my own for the first time this school year in an apartment, and I'm hoping to branch out with Xbox Live and make some friends. Feel free to PM me if you'd like to connect.

Thanks all! :)"
2h20ap,1,2014-09-21,To SpaceX and beyond!,Skyientist,spacex,https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/2h20ap/to_spacex_and_beyond/,"To begin with, I just registered an account with reddit to make this post. This place seemed like a pretty knowledgeable spot where I could get some great advice and information.

I'm currently working through a Cal State Channel Islands in Ca with a double major in Applied Physics and Math with a minor in polysci. To get to the point, SpaceX is my dream employer and I want to spend the rest of my life furthering humanities future at this epic company. I've read the reviews about working there and know it's difficult, but this type of work does not bother me. It's all worth it to me. Now here's the slight catch. My Uni is relatively new and does not have much money. Our physics program is tiny and our lab equipment is almost nil. I feel as though I'm struggling to get much real world experience. I'm trying my hardest to get internships at various places and, obviously, SpaceX is my number 1 choice.

My question to those who have experience in the field, and possibly at SpaceX, is what else do I need to do to get a job there? Should I begin applying there directly after I graduate? Or, should I continue in my schooling to get a masters in aerospace engineering? I'm not sure where to take my education or my life to make this job a reality. I have no problems repeatedly applying or doing whatever I need to do to show that I will be an employee worth hiring.

I'm worried I don't have the experience for SpaceX right now, or even the experience to get an internship to gain that experience. I'm sort of lost about where exactly to go. A push in the right direction and some advice would go a long way to achieving my dream of spreading humans through our solar system.

Thank you for any replies and your help!

How competitive was the selection process, and how impressive were your grades/resume?  What role did you play and what was your typical day like while working there?  Was there any compensation?  What are some pros/cons, and your overall impression?  Would you consider a career with Tesla?  As someone who lives in the midwest, I'm also interested in options for housing while out in CA."
2h2mqz,7,2014-09-21,"Me [20 F] with my friend [20 F] of a little under a year, her ""friend"" of about a year or two [22 M] who she has a history with has become physically abusive and has left bruises",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2h2mqz/me_20_f_with_my_friend_20_f_of_a_little_under_a/,"I became friends with this girl, who I will call Julia, as roommates at an internship at a very popular entertainment company. She and I became really close and she's great, but she's really sheltered and innocent in a lot of ways because she comes from a protective family who are very religious. There is nothing wrong with that and she's super sweet and not outwardly judgmental at all, I just feel like this background might be relevant to the situation she's in now.

She's had this best male friend of hers, we'll call him Kevin, for maybe a year and a half, I'm not exactly sure. They met online through mutual love of the previously mentioned entertainment company and the fact that he had worked there and she also wanted to, and began to talk online with others in their group a lot. They had an online relationship that lasted two months, which ended with him beginning to ignore her, and eventually ended with him coming out as bisexual and then later fully gay. 

There are many incidents that have happened with the two of them over their friendship/relationship. He's never treated her particularly well. Basically she's always available to him and doesn't have a lot of other close friends, and so he takes advantage of the fact that she's a reliable presence and will treat her however he feels like it that day. She'll stay around anyway.

They met for the first time in person after Julia and I were already roommates and friends, as he moved to the location of this entertainment company while we were all there. I have since moved away, but the two of them are still there and hang out upwards of four-five days a week. When she updates me on her life 9 times out of 10 it's about him and how he's treating her that particular day.

Kevin's always been emotionally abusive. I've never liked him. I've met him and tried to appreciate him from her perspective since she's important to me and I wanted to understand someone who is so important to her. He's really charismatic and friendly and the type to make friends with everyone he meets. She's just put way too much of an importance on him. If you read lists of what constitutes emotional abuse, he does at least 3/4 of the things on the lists and I've told her many times that he's abusive of her. 

Some days he's really nice and sweet and acts like they're a couple - going as far as holding her hand, calling her pet names, telling him he loves her, and making her think he's going to kiss her - despite the fact that he's out as ""gay"" (I honestly don't believe he is, it's a really big thing to be gay at this entertainment company, but that's a separate issue). He leads her on constantly to make her think something will happen and treats her like a girlfriend some days. But other days he insults her, puts her down, makes her think issues between them are totally her fault, and controls her.

But it just got worse. Today Julia let me know his family is mad at him for the way he treats her, and she thinks this is her fault. I told her if he's saying anything to make her think the way he treats her is her fault that that's manipulation and a hallmark of emotional abuse... She then told me that it's escalated to physical abuse. She said that she'll do something as trivial as touch a hair on the back of his neck and he'll slap her across the face. She said she has two bruises from him right now.

I told her that terrifies me and tried to make her realize the seriousness of this and said she should cut him out of her life. I also said it will only escalate. She said she's about had enough and is about to confront him, but this is so not about confronting someone anymore. 

Is there anything at all I can do to convince her to cut him out, permanently? They aren't even in a relationship. What have you done in these situations?

---   
**tl;dr**: My friend who lives many states away has a male best friend who she has a history with and centers a lot of her life around; he has been emotionally abusive for as long as I've known my friend but she just told me he's gotten physically abusive. What can I do?"
2h2rce,2,2014-09-21,Work on it a bunch; dream on it a bunch?,datachange,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/2h2rce/work_on_it_a_bunch_dream_on_it_a_bunch/,"Whenever I do an activity of some sort for a great amount of time -- putting much brainpower into it, I start to semi-dream about it. However, this seems to occur in the semi-awake, semi-asleep state where dreams happen in the brink of being awake, often shifting in and out of states. This becomes hindering to my ability to sleep comfortably. For example, at work, I have been working on some test code, and I get dreams/thoughts about how to break it down into sub-tests, struggling to do so.

This has been happening for years when I start doing something consistent for days. It is borderline nightmarish when I am trying to sleep. It is like I am struggling to solve the ""problem"" that either my mind made up on the spot or one I have been having.

What I want to ask is if this is a normal thing and if there is a way to sleep peacefully. I am a co-op (intern) and I enjoy what I do; I just don't want to have this ""nightmare"" the rest of my life.

Thank you very much."

qler stands for Quality Living by Education and Research

STATUS

We are recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a non-profit organization under 501(c)(3).

MISSION

Our mission is to help people from all walks of life to achieve Quality Living by Education and Research.

INTERNSHIP FUNDING

We provide year-round funding to college students that want to obtain research experience in life science research laboratories. We also provide funding to high school students for summer internships in life science research labs.

GRANTS

We provide grants to various life science research laboratories, but primarily to those that do research for the development of diagnostics and cures for cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, we give suplemental grants to those research labs that provide training to interns.

LEGISLATION

We support current and future programs of passed/pending legislation that enable students that want to intern in Life Science labs to obtain paid internships. We also support current and future programs of passed/pending legislation that incentivize Life Science labs to train students in basic research skills.

Mission

Our mission is to help people from all walks of life to achieve Quality Living by Education and Research.

We believe that while the Affordable Care Act gives access to more individuals, our healthcare system is not structured in such a way as to provide the best care for the least cost. We believe the cost of healthcare can be reduced substantially through education and research that focus primarily on prevention. Additionally, we believe that with respect to cures, equal focus should be devoted to research on natural compounds because the time interval from the lab to the market is shorter than the traditional path of synthesized drugs.

We also believe that Life Science labs can benefit by engaging undergraduate college students and high school students in research projects that aim to train these students in basic research lab skills. Our goal is to encourage students to do internships in research labs, and to help these students through paid internships. This involves the co-operation of several entities including federal, state, and local level government agencies. It also includes the co-operation of high schools, community colleges, universities, research labs, and Life Science companies. Qler is trying to put together programs that require the co-operation of all the above mentioned entities.

2h51ii,5,2014-09-22,I'm not sure what else I should be doing...[mini-rant],ThatIOPsychGuy,IOPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/2h51ii/im_not_sure_what_else_i_should_be_doingminirant/,"The most difficult thing about unemployment, for me, has been the deafening silence from potential employers and the isolation from everyone else.

I recently moved into the area, and have been searching for I/O-related jobs for a while now. I've done everything by the book from the start: got an advisor, got pubs, took an internship, finished with an M.S.. At first, I could only get temp contracts doing random work. But soon, I was starting to get pigeon-holed into a specific topic area, and not growing professionally because limited scope of responsibilities.

I spend my days filling out applications, carefully tailoring the resume to each position and answering every single question, so that no one can get back to me. I've tried networking - spending $20, $30, $50 dollars for memberships and attendance fees, to fight for people's attention and maybe get one e-mail reply if they reply at all. I'm keeping in touch with my cohorts and professors, but they could only do so much with referrals and LinkedIn introductions.

I'm not a bad worker. When I did have jobs, as short as they were, I got along with everyone. Supervisors and colleagues alike could depend on me to perform the most difficult and tedious tasks. I always end up working my way up and unofficially take on support roles for my supervisors.

That's all I'd really want - contribute to my field and the community, ideally in selection and/or psychmetrics. But after trying to reach out to other professionals, and not hearing back after plugging in applications day after day, this feels like a sisyphean task that I'm not qualified for. If there's something that I'm doing wrong, or not doing at all, I don't know about it at this point and no one is willing to tell me what that is. I'm still maintaining a modicum of optimism and hope, but would be lying if I said I wasn't utterly miserable with this whole process.

**tl;dr: Nearing depletion on options, resources, tactics, and patience. Still trying but not sure what else to do at this point. Just want to do some I/O work and give back again.**"

	The sun rose on a new day in the magical realm of Taloncrest; laser-hawks hunted prey overhead with their laser guided lightning beaks, stone golems tirelessly built up their mountains with unyielding strength, and wild Pandas roamed the forest, refusing to mate with each other. “What kind of pandas?” you might be wondering, “are they demon pandas? Or maybe their claws are made of the rarest psychic sapphire?”. Nope. Just regular-ass pandas, because pandas are retarded in every realm.
	Nearby In a wooded clearing in front of an ominous temple stood two hooded figures: a woman in flowing white robes, and a lanky looking wood-elf in a green cape. 
	“There's no way the new guys gonna show. He probably wet himself when he found out where we were going and stayed home to clean the piss stains out of his granny panties.” grumbled the wood-elf, leaning against a tree, “We should just go in without him.”. The women looked up at him from where she had sat down to meditate, “Patience; He'll be here. The council wouldn't have let him join REquest unless he was up to the task.”
	REquest was the name of a guild that provided services for adventurers who were to stupid or lazy or cowardly to do their own damn quests. Whenever some derp-headed level 2 Fart-o-mancer was commissioned by a village to slay the resident level 50 soul-sucking omega viper, they would pass the quest on to the guild in exchange for a share of the loot. The REquest council would then send in a crack team of their best adventurers to get the job done right. This particular quest was commissioned by a treasure hunter of who had just discovered the location of a rare artifact in the old world ruins of Taloncrest. The Fedorica: an ancient  helm that happened to be last item he needed to complete a legendary armor-set that had been lost to the sands of time. The only problem? Everyone who had ever entered the overgrown temple that housed the Fedorica was never seen nor heard from again. In response, REquest sent their two hottest and kick-ass operatives to explore the temple. 
	QUICK ZOOM ON THE WOMANS FACE WITH A MOVIE TRAILER BOOM WHILE A NAMEPLATE POPS UP THAT SAYS “PRECILLA THE GENTLE: HUMAN CLERIC AND CURER OF WIZERD CANCER” 
	WHIP PAN OVER TO THE MAN WITH A WICKA WICKA WHAAAAT “KURTRICK RUSSY: WOOD-ELF RANGER, ALL AROUND BADASS AND ALSO THE GREATEST ARCHER IN THE WORLD.”
	ANOTHER WHIP PAN OVER TO SOME BUSHES. A moment of silence................. Then a skinny young man wearing suspenders, skinny jeans and holding a staff stumbled out of the bushes, breathing heavily. “Huh, sorry I'm late guys. I was busy arranging my collection of ironic shirts and shutter-shades” BOOM FREEZEFRAME. “Bimble Mcgimbles: Hipster Summoner, unpaid intern and all around dill-weed” He dusted himself off.
	“Just point me to the Temple bro,” Bimble said, Swag walking over to Kurtrick. “and let ol' Mcgimbles handle the hard part”.
	“Yeah I bet you handle hard parts,” Snorted Kurtrick, “and what'd you say about my gimbles.”
	The party gathered their belongings and proceeded to the temple gate. Precilla unrolled their assignment scroll and skimmed over it. “according to that hobo we kicked in the balls earlier, we have to strike a small hidden crystal on top of the southwest column of the building in order to open the temple doors. After that we're on our own.”
	Kurtrick smiled “sounds right up my ally.” he scanned the columns of the building until he spied a small twinkle coming from the top of one. Kurtrick reached into his pack and pulled out the reason he was known as the worlds number one archer. A magical psychic bow named Archie. As he notched an arrow and took aim at the distant crystal, he could feel Archie's voice become one with his mind. It whispered “yo faggot, you might wanna aim a little more to the left if you wanna hit anything, Bitch.....”
	yeah, Archie was kind of a dick. Kurtrick would have gotten rid of him ages ago, buuuuut without Archie's guidance he was actually a pretty shitty archer, so he just tried to put up with it. You know, for the sponsorships. The arrow flew strait and true, glancing off the crystal and opening the temple doors. As Kurtrick put Archie away it whispered “Git Rekt...” and sent Kurtrick a bunch of psychic visions of people flipping him off.
	The trio cautiously entered the first room of the temple. It was as roomy, dark and moist as your moms.....chocolate cake, with unlit torches in all four corners of the room. At the back of the room was a giant door with an ornate golden lock hung between its handles, and a single lit torch hung next to it. Our heroes searched the room for several minutes looking for the key to the golden lock, but to no avail. All they found were some used condoms and a nasty pair of HUGE gauges which Bimble immediately popped in because he's such a dill-weed. Eventually Precilla's attention was drawn to the solitary lit torch by the door. “wait a minute....” She said to herself, as an idea formed in her head. She took the torch off the wall and ran to all four corners of the room, lighting the other torches as she went before placing the original back in its place. The golden lock seemed to absorb the light as the adventurers look on in awe.
	They waited........................ Nothing happened.
	Bimble turned to Precilla. “Was that your plan? Light all the torches? What kind of retarded door opening mechanism would even work on that principle?”
	“I dunno,” she shrugged defensivly, “it felt obvious!”
	“Ok whatever screw this manual labor crap, I'll just summon one of my familiars to open the door for us.” Bimble raised his hipster staff and called out the magic word. “HASHTAG!!!” there was a blinding flash of light, and standing before Bimble was a 20 foot tall EMPEROR DEMON. It raised its hand towards the door and unleashed the power of a thousand tortured souls in the form of an all consuming fiery inferno that exploded and left a scorching crater where the ENTIRE TEMPLE used to be.
	“HOT DAYUM!” screamed Kurtrick as the Emperor Demon disappeared, “I thought you were a total dill-weed before, but that's the most useful freaking thing I've ever seen!!!!”  At the center of the smoldering crater that used to be the temple lay the Fedorica: completely unguarded except for the huge dragon with lazer breath and a hundred flaming mecha wings. Kurtrick immediately grabbed Archie and lept into action. “Man fuck you I ain't fightin' that, you on your own Katniss.” spoke Archie. 
	*Sigh* “Fine! Quick Bimble! Summon the Emperor Demon again!” shouted Kurtrick.
	“I....I Can't!” stuttered Bimble “I can only summon each of my monsters once per day!”
	“Well don't just stand there man! WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE!?”
	“Ahhhh all I've got is a ring-tailed lemur that can hypnotize people and a  Mini Skeleton Spider that can open any lock or any door....wait, shit.”
	“I take it back, you are more usless than my great grandmothers wrinkly nutsack.” 
	Precilla tried to cast flame shield on Bimble to prevent sick burns but wasn't fast enough. At that same moment all three of them realized that the dragon hadn't moved at all since they'd first laid eyes on it. 
	“Hold on,” said Bimble, “I think it's just an illusion meant to scare us away! Well, that makes things much easier. Now to get what I came for!” before the other two could react, Bimble Raised his staff and Shouted “YOLO!” as the Hypnoomafoo appeared on his shoulder. Kurtrick and Precilla stood frozen in place, caught in the hypnotic gaze of the little lemur. 
	“You........traitor.....” grunted Kurtrick through clenched teeth as Bimble casually walked through the image of the dragon and picked up the Fedorica. He then turned to our heros and motioned towards himself. “Come, friends” he said. Kurtrick and Precilla both jizzed themselves as commanded. 
	“AH JEEEZ NOT LIKE THAT, YOU GUYS ARE GROSS.” exclaimed Bimble. He held up the Fedorica and said, “I've searched for this legendary helm my entire life! They say that when worn, the Fedorica boosts both intelligence and fashion by 100 points each! I even joined your stupid guild because I knew they were about to get assigned this very quest! And now......it's MINE.” he laughed as he slipped in on his head, but wearing it was his fatal mistake. The Fedorica is in fact cursed. The wearer will think their intelligence and fashion were boosted, but in fact, the Fedorica lowers fashion and charisma back to 0 instead. 
	“You know what would go good with this Helm? A trenchcoat.” stated Bimble, seemingly forgetting about our heroes. With Bimbles attention now occupied by how good he thought he looked, Kurtrick fought his against his trance, grabbed Archie and pointed an arrow at the traitor. 
	“Do it pussy, I bet you've never even shot a man before, Bitch.....” whispered Archie. 
	Kurtrick glanced at Archie. “Am I gonna have to choke a bow?” he let the arrow fly and it struck Hypnoomafoo between the eyes. “M' Lady!?” Bimble exclaimed as he got tackled to the ground where Kurtrick, Precilla AND Archie set him on fire and all three of them took turns farting on him to make the flames better.
	“AHHHH FRIEND ZONED AGAIN!!!!!!” Screamed Bimble as he got Fart-Burned to death.

THE END

	Credits roll as “In the end” by Linkin Park plays over It. “One thing, I don't know why, it doesn't even matter how hard you try....”
	Post credits scene: two Pandas return home from their Panda-date. “uh, you wanna come inside my Panda-house for some Panda-Coffee and ahhh.... see where it leads?” said one of the Pandas, batting her Panda-lashes. 
	“No thanks!” said the other, “ I think I'm just gonna go home and watch The Big Bang Theory BYE!” Pandas are the worst.
	Cut to black. “Archie will return, In Avengers: Age of Ultron."
2h5e4b,2,2014-09-22,Me [30 M] waiting on my EX [32F] of almost 4 years. We live in the same building and are up and down.,WaitingRoom4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2h5e4b/me_30_m_waiting_on_my_ex_32f_of_almost_4_years_we/,"Ok, so this is a bit of a wall of text, apologizes in advance.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for close to four years, with a couple road bumps. We've had two earlier breakup periods, once was her fucking up while drunk/on molly/on aderol after a wedding, and almost cheating on me, (but this was a weird almost-rapey situation where she doesn't remember aaaany of it,) and we got back together a week later. The second break-up was 3 weeks and was my fault for not being around enough.


Outside of those two bummer events, the majority of it has been great. Movies, dinners, hanging out with friends, moving, walks, and small trips. Two years ago she moved into the building I live in, one floor down.

Soooo the latest break-up was me. I was majorly depressed for the second time in my life, and was wondering if it was the relationship, or my work, or something else. I wasn't mean or harsh, I just wasn't around much, hanging out only 1-2 days a week. I told her I wasn't happy and wasn't sure what it was, and that I wanted a week alone to think about it.


She got upset, and agreed that I'd been drifting away, but just wanted a break-up. After just a week I realized my depression wasn't stemming from my relationship, but from my work/video games. I was working long hours, and then coming home and playing games to escape how much my job wears on me now (after 7 years at my company.)

I quit games altogether, took up the gym and hiking, and re-did my resume while looking for work. This year I've finally been able to make money off my art as a side job, and re-doubled my art efforts as well. Meanwhile I talked to the lady and apologized for hurting her, realizing that I should have turned TO her for comfort, not treating her like another aspect to analyze.

This is my second serious relationship ever, and one of my pieces of baggage has been anxiety about planning a future with anyone. Before this job I never let myself look forward at new jobs or plan new aspects of my life, a side effect from losing my first girlfriend in a rough way while also dropping out of college after losing a scholarship that was paying for half of my tuition. I was pretty hard on myself for awhile.


So I also grabbed a therapist, and started trying to get the lady back. I went to farmers markets and left her fresh food at her door, we went on a picnic together, she came to my friends art opening, and I took her out for her b-day. We were seeing each other about once a week. I made her two pieces of art, (her dog with a crown, and a squid wrestling a sperm whale with a heart on it.)


On our fourth hangout, I was going to take her salsa dancing, and she broke down and said this was too hard, that she just needed time to think. She asked for a month to herself. I told her if she just wants to break-up and have me move, just tell me, because the month apart was going to hurt me a lot. She told me that wasn't it at all, she just needed to think.


And the month did hurt a lot, to ease my own anxiety, I wrote her a book. 65 pages, fully illustrated. It includes a ton of pictures of us, and a transcript of our first talk ever on OK Cupid. At the end of the book it has a little model of a home, with trees in it, telling her how I want to build a life with her, how she's the first person to make me want to plan a future.

When we met in a month, she broke down, and said it was a lot to take in. She asked for two more weeks, and I gave them to her. This whole time still telling me she loves me, and keeping all the gifts I give her.

When we met again she agreed to try out a week of us together. The week was relaxed for the most part, I would come over and make dinner or do the dishes, walk the dog with her, see a movie, (there was one night she came home drunk and we had sex, the next day she said that was a little too much, and then thursday we had sex sober anyway.) I was just trying to be present, and show her how much work I've put into myself, how I'm making big changes in my life, partially for myself, partially to never repeat the mistakes of the past.


At the end of the week together she broke down and said it was too much right now. That she doesn't want to date anyone else but just needs time still. We agreed to get coffee later this week. So that's where we're at. She's still keeping all the gifts, all the art is still on the walls, she took my drawing of her dog to work. She just this week helped my little sister get an internship. She still says she loves me. In the end I think I hurt the girls trust so much that she's half running from me and half wanting to hug me.


Any advice? This entire situation hurts a ton, but I really, truly believe we can work. I've changed my life for the better, and in the last few years she's gotten a much better job and circle of friends. It's just waiting for some ethereal feeling from her to where she thinks she's ready again that has me worried. I've drawn art and written her a book, I've given her space and tried being there. I feel like a boy in a waiting room, just hoping for good news.

I'm normally the kind of person that relates happiness and success to how much I can get done and how much work I do.  Lately I just want to give up.  A few weeks ago I found out I was pregnant when I went to the Dr. for what I thought was a pulled muscle.  I was only 2 weeks on and am waiting to get an appointment at Planned Parenthood to get a surgical abortion.  

All while this is happening I got a job at Target working stupid early morning shift, started getting more work at my other job (it's directly related to school hours) and am still doing 2 internships. 

The first day I started working at target my boyfriend had a massive breakdown at work and got fired.  He's gotten himself meds and some help, but it's still been incredibly stressful.  He's now gotten himself some work and I also was able to steer him to some work similar to my own. 

I am also staff at a game I play and have been having some 'drama' issues over a woman who is in charge of my group but hasn't been at the game properly (for a year and a half) and I've been pulling her weight. 

Waiting for the appointment has been terrible as I have really bad pain from cramps(I think) and even worse nausea 3-4 times a day.   I'm tired and emotional and can't handle ANY of this stress.  I've had to call out of work and have passed out at my other job twice because of this parasite.  

I haven't told anyone but my bf, and I geuss his little sister knows, but I haven't TALKED to anyone who I consider a friend.  I never thought it would be this hard for some one to know I'm preggers and don't want it.  

My mother passed away a few years ago so I also have been missing her, thinking talking to her would have been easier.  It also hurts to see my bf's mother being so wonderful and helping him out so much.  I'm glad she is, it just makes me miss my own so very much on top of everything else. 


And then I've started (maybe because od this cell bloop in my belly) to go all depressed and hating on the little art work I've been able to accomplish lately.   


I've been trying to take care of a lot of these issues as well as I can but even a small amount of stress right now is sending me to the floor.  I want so badly to be able to get my shit together, and hopefully before I get fired at the early morning job.  I could do all this so much better if I wasn't harboring a mass of cells that use more of my energy but make me so nauseas that it's hard to recoup the losses!!!  T-T

2h5oxr,20,2014-09-22,Linux Training for Youth,2manyPenguins,linux,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2h5oxr/linux_training_for_youth/,"Hello everyone, I have come seeking your advice on a program that my organization will be running for At-Risk Youth (High School Seniors).
 
We are starting a digital literacy program that will be focusing on helping youth gain computer skills, contribute to the community, and gain certification and employment in a Linux related field.
 
The program is inspired by Rob Litt, a teacher in California who built his own computer lab for his students using Linux. The idea is to take this and instead have Youth build it and learn from the experience.
http://ifixit.org/blog/3001/how-one-teacher-built-a-computer-lab-for-free/
 
We will be taking in donations which Youth will then be using to create a digital literacy (computer) lab within our organization (to further develop a youth resource room for those w/o computer access) and a lab for a partner organization which will count towards 60 hours of community service time. They will finish up with the certification test and a 100 hour internship.

Youth will test the working condition of donated computers, identify possible hardware problems and solutions and attempt to restore. Then, youth will be installing Linux OS on the computers to increase the functionality of older or “broken” computers. Youth will learn Linux and networking skills along the way.

The first lab is meant to be used as a training point for the skills they will be learning as they will also be taking a class in Linux (offered by the Linux Foundation on edX). The second lab will serve to reinforce the learning objectives and will be followed by the certification test.
 
The certifications we are currently looking at are:
 
The comments from the class say it is a good way to prepare for the LPI Linux Essentials Exam.
http://www.lpi.org/linux-certifications/entry-level-credential/linux-essentials
 
They have also announced recently that the Linux Foundation has launched. This exam looks to be more expensive but would likely be perfectly in line with the class
http://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification
 
Alternatively, we could go with SUSE which is found here but this would involve changing the course to SUSE as well I believe which could be more expensive.
https://www.suse.com/training/linux-certification/cla/
 
I was wondering if anyone here would help me with a question or two that I have? Such as:
•   How employable will this certification and program make Youth?
•   What kind of jobs will this program open up for them (I'm thinking things like desktop support)?
•   And overall what do you think of the program? Do you have any suggestions?

2h5upt,0,2014-09-22,Does anybody need a roommate? I just moved to the area to start a job in Georgetown and need a place to live.,[deleted],washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/2h5upt/does_anybody_need_a_roommate_i_just_moved_to_the/,"I'm not sure if this kind of post violates the subreddit's rules, but I saw some similar posts on here from a while back, so I'm assuming it's OK.  

I'm a 23-year-old guy who recently moved to the area to start an internship writing for a website/news publication in Georgetown. Unfortunately, when I say ""the area,"" I mean White Mall, MD - which is north of Baltimore, and is a 3-hour one-way commute to Georgetown. It sounds shitty – and it is – but I'm living rent-free with an awesome aunt and uncle who live in a big, nice house out in the country. It's beautiful and very comfortable, but the commute is not sustainable – actually, it sucks and is slowly killing me, so I need to find a place that is within a reasonable distance to my office (I've only been here two weeks, and was always planning to stay there temporarily).


I'm looking for something that is within biking distance to a metro station and preferably somewhere that has some good bars and restaurants nearby. I've been told to look into these neighborhoods by a coworker:

In Arlington 
-	Rosslyn
-	Clarendon
-	Cherrydale
-	Virginia Square
-	Court House


In DC 
-	Glover Park
-	Woodley Park/Cleveland Park
-	Dupont Circle
-	Foggy Bottom

 
I've already arranged meetings with a few people in these areas, but these have been random people through Craigslist. 


A bit more about me: I like to read, write, exercise, drink, watch movies, play guitar (will not be a noise problem I promise), I'm OK with smoking, things like this, blah blah blah. I do like to go out, but I also have a full-time job that I take seriously. I'm trying hard not to use the phrase ""young professional"" here. I don't what it is about the term – it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Sorry young professionals. 


My price range is relatively low, maxing out at about $700. I realize this will limit my options greatly. 
If anyone is looking or knows someone who is looking for a respectful, responsible guy to rent a room in his/her place, send me a message or post here. Please include a bit of information about you, your roommates and your living situation in the message. Thanks.

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. We're both in our early 20s. Things seemed to be going great until we moved in together for an internship and realized that we got into more arguments than usual. I sensed that something was wrong but he always said that everything was alright. Mistakenly, I latched on tighter as I felt like he was drifting away from me and it probably helped make him more bored/sick of me. I don't blame him; I've felt ""bored"" in all of my relationships including this one, but the good things in our relationship and the reasons why I liked him always prevailed and I would get over my ""phases."" I felt like moving in together was a bad idea because there were many moments when I felt like I wanted to be alone but there was nowhere to go but home. I contemplated taking my things and just going to a Starbucks but it was never ""bad"" enough that it forced me to do so. My boyfriend said he felt the same.

A few weeks ago, after much prodding, he finally confessed that he felt differently about me the whole summer and now feels bored/less excited to be around me. I proposed a break and he agreed, and the few weeks after that we just became friends. He admitted that he felt a lot better about me and the summer just suffocated him. I was happy as I thought things were going to go back to normal and I also enjoyed the time alone but knew I wanted to get back together.

However, fast forward a few weeks and I started feeling that he should know by now whether or not he wanted to be ""dating"" or ""not dating."" We didn't have to jump directly into seeing each other every day even if we were ""dating,"" but having the label would be nice. (Just as an aside, I know that he's not reluctant to use the label because he wants me to wait and still be able to date or hook up with girls, I know him well and he's not that type of person.) He said that he really likes me but he can't make up his mind on whether or not to commit and so since it's not fair to me we should just break up. I told him that if we break up I would proceed to go No Contact for a few weeks to a few months and then we can start over as friends. And that if I do that I would be very very unlikely to ever want to get back together with him. At this point he became really upset and even though we were talking about this in public he started crying. He told me that he still loves me but his feelings about me have been much more volatile than before, oscillating between feeling as happy as he used to be with me to feeling like he wanted space and didn't want to see me, and he can't seem to stabilize his emotions. He said he wanted to break up and be friends so that maybe things would ""reset"" and he could fall in love with me again the way he first did for the same reasons that he did the first time. And that while he can't make any guarantees he could definitely see it happening. However, if I go no contact and get over him then that would never happen.

I asked him whether or not he's ever felt bored in our relationship and he said no, this is the first time. I was surprised as there were a few periods of time when I had felt bored but I always got over it. I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone for years without occasionally feeling bored and I wouldn't dream of breaking up with him over this because I'm pretty sure that is more a statement about me than him. Is it possible that he has never felt that before and so may be overreacting? 

In the end I decided that I do really like him and see myself being with him forever if things work out. So instead of going no contact, I will stay friends with him, and see how things go. If this works out our relationship could probably be strengthened instead of weakened. But I've always been taught that if someone really likes you, they would do anything to not let you go, even in times of crisis. I'm really torn at whether I'm doing the right thing or not because I can't get over someone unless there's a period of no contact and so it will probably be emotionally impossible for me to move on or date anyone else. A part of me thinks it's worth it though, but I might just be blinded.

So TwoXC, have you ever been in a relationship where one of you broke up with the other and changed your mind? What made you change your mind and why did you break up in the first place? How common does this happen and is it worth trying?

Thanks for all the help. I really appreciate it &lt;3"

tl;dr: Boyfriend says he loves me but his feelings aren't the same. He feels uncertain at times and can't commit. We had a great relationship up until this point and he says he wants to break up but still be friends and maybe fall in love with me again. Not sure if this ever actually works and if I should try or just cut off contact and get over him as being just friends is painful."

My name is David and I am a 26 year old white male, living with his parents and underemployed (I make a sliver above minimum wage). I live near a major metropolitan area in the United States, and have been struggling with being FA for the past 3 years or so (prior to that I was also FA, but for some reason playing WoW for 80 hours a week didn't strike me as that odd for some reason).

Here is a little about my past:

Ages 5-12: About normal. Had some friends, played some baseball...on track to leading a slightly above average life in most regards. I always excelled in school with little effort, and continued to do so through high school.

Age 12: Parents divorce

Age 15: Parents both pass in murder suicide. End up moving to and living with a distant uncle. (I was a loser before this, I do not think this caused my FAness)

Ages 13-18: High school for me was dreary. I had no friends, no love interests, and no prospects. At my first job an 'okay' looking girl pursued me heavily, but due to severe anxiety and depression I was unable to do anything. Freshman year I had a few friends but they quickly abandoned me and by mid freshman year I remember eating lunch in the bathrooms alone to avoid the social torment of the cafeteria. At around age 16 I decided that being fit = being popular, having girls, etc. I joined the football team (perennial benchwarmer/punching bag) and started lifting. I went from a scrawny 110lbs to a less scrawny but still lightweight 140lbs (at 6'0).


Ages 18-24: Went to college. Big STEM school with few girls in classes. Also made no friends here as I continued to ignore my academic and social life in the pursuit of phat loots on World of Warcraft. My warddrobe consisted of mostly second hand clothes and shit I have outgrown from high school. I basically looked like a homeless thug 90% of the time. I would go to class, enjoy time with my 'school friends' (god forbid they would invite me to a party or something!) and go home to play whatever my drug of choice was (currently it is LoL). I finished my academic career with 0 internship experience, 0 job prospects, no friends, a poor GPA, no gf (not even a kiss or hand hold ever), and severe anxiety/depression. On the other hand, I did have 6 dope WoW characters and a League account I would sell for half a grand. 

While in college I still subscribed to the 'workout, you will make it brah' mentality and actually aquired a respectable physique. I tried to play in team sports, dance, etc. but my anxiety and depression were too much and I was unable to participate when there were women around, and many 'bro' types would ostracize me. Up until this point I have been an extremely negative person and it is no wonder nobody wanted me around.

Ages 24-Current: Mostly working at a dead end job, while my STEM degree goes to waste. Paying off student loans, working out, and basically avoiding women. Going home and playing LoL, waking up going to work, My life was an endless cycle of Work -&gt; LoL/reddit -&gt; sleep. I looked forward to Mondays because it would at least soothe some of the crippling loneliness that I feel on the weekends. 


About two months ago I have decided that this is not the life I want to live, and I am going to do my best to change it in anyway I can.

What I have been doing:


- Joining meetup.com groups. I actively go to 3 different meetup groups, and while I have made a single aquaintance there, any interaction after working hours with people helps to alleviate my loneliness. If I stop going for a week or more I quickly notice how the carpet of loneliness is beginning to smother me.

I have made a single aquaintance here, and he seems much more social than me. He has gotten laid before and seems to have quite a few friends. I am trying to befriend him so he will invite me to his social life, but progress is extremely slow here, and we only chat after volleyball matches briefly. Not even sure if I register on his radar as an aquaintance.


- Working out. I already had a good physique to begin with after years of training, but it has waned in the previous years and I will not stand for that. I am back in the gym at least 3 times per week.


- Created an OkCupid/Tinder/Craiglist CE account to look for women.


- Actively working on correcting any negativity and turning into a positive person. I will first analyze anything I am trying to say and if it is negative I keep my mouth shut. (harder than it seems, for me at least!) 




I have begun some of these months ago, and a few just this week, as the desperation of aging and trying to avoid true forever-aloneness sets in. I will update this post as I see fit (whenever something meaningful happens) to continue on my journey. I will answer any and all questions honestly. Thank you for reading. I have nobody to share my feelings/story with and sharing it here gives me a warm and comfortable feeling of belonging that I have not experienced in decades.

2h7z0n,1,2014-09-23,[Serious] Have you ever pulled the disappear/reappear act on someone you really liked? why?,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2h7z0n/serious_have_you_ever_pulled_the/,"The Story:
In November I was on a trip to the southern portion of the US, I met a guy on a popular online dating website. We hit it off, and so when I finally returned to my state the first week of December we got to meet each other. I went to his restaurant and we talked for 8 hours and then I met up with him that night as well and we talked for 5 more hours. He told me this later, but, when I was in the bathroom that night he told his roommate that I would be the last girl he would ever bring over again, and that I would be here a lot. I was supposed to go back to the region where I originally visited a month later, so he decided that he wanted to spend as much time as possible until I left (again)..... Every day, and most of those nights together. I never ended up going back to the area, so we just continued to hang out everyday until the weekend before New Year's Eve, he was arrested after getting into an altercation with his brother-in-law and spent the weekend in Jail... He sent me a vague text right before he was arrested, I eventually found out that he was indeed arrested. I talked to his mom, and told her that I would be happy to help out where ever needed. He was released on New Year's Eve and he told me to come over right away so I could meet his mom (well, in person... when I talked to her before, it wasn't best circumstance to meet her! haha) On my way home, he told me that he told his mom that he was exclusive with me, that I was one of the few girls in his life that have ever met her, and that she was really impressed with me- especially when I reached out to her while he was in jail. He then told me about his experience in jail how he was in cell #13, which is our lucky number... how he thought about how he needed to get his priorities straight, and find a girl who can be there full time to support him, like me, and that I would be a great example for him and I would make him a better man... I thought he would ask me out, but he didn't. Mid-January as I was starting the first week of my new job, I found out that I was accepted to an internship four states away, and if I was going to accept the offer I would need to move within two weeks. I told him about it, and he was very upset and told me that the internship was more important than him and that he was worried that it was a matter of time before I deemed him unfit and left him for someone else... He deleted me from his face book, and I didn't hear from him again until my birthday at the end of January, He sent me a text the morning of my birthday wishing me a happy birthday and asked if I wanted to spend it with him at his bar for my first drink. I was just so excited to hear from him, and that he remembered my birthday :) he picked me up, he made me some drinks, and we went back to his place. We talked for a couple hours, he told me that he wanted me to be a part of his life... especially since we can coexist and spend quality time while he (or we) play(s) League of Legends, and how much he loves this about me... and how much he missed me. I told him that I was dating a new guy who I met at work, he was really crushed. We talked a few more times, and hung out a few times after that... I decided to make it up to him by buying him front row tickets for Monty Python's Spam-a-lot for Valentine's Day, he refused to go, told me at first that he was sick, then that he wasn't into the holiday at all but it was a great gift for him, and then finally, that he wasn't interested in dating me... and that I should take my new boyfriend to Monty. I didn't hear from him after that until May, I went into a restaurant.... that he ended up working at! I sat there reading a book while and eating my food... I was grabbing my things so I could leave after paying the check, I looked up and he was standing there! I was surprised because I thought he worked at the other restaurant and I dropped my glass and ran out. I sent him a text apologizing for the mess. He told me that it was alright and that he wanted to talk to me but he was busy, but we could hang out since I lived five blocks away. I moved recently, and I guess I told him where I was moving to... because I found it rather strange that he worked ten minutes from my home.I didn't hear from him again until June, where I accidentally called him while I was on a business trip, we talked for a few days. He told me that he missed me, and that he wanted to be with me, I was still taken though.... and he was going to either go to jail for six months or be on house arrest for a year. My boyfriend found out that I was talking to him, so he asked me not to talk to him again, so I stopped. July, I was walking around town and I decided to stop in to his restaurant that he now worked at, hoping to see him :( I asked if he was working, and his co-worker said that he wasn't... She was off duty but hanging out for a drink, she asked how I knew him, I said that we were ""friends"" and that friends was a loose term. We started talking about what we want in a man, she started giggling after I described my dream guy and said ""that sounds exactly like him, why haven't you gone for him?"". I called him as I was walking out of the restaurant, we talked for awhile... he told me that his house arrest was supposed to start next week, and that he wanted me to be around. I saw him later that week because he told me that he was deathly ill and he needed someone to take care of him, when I got there we talked for a little bit, he said that he wanted me to be his, he then told me that he was really, really sick. He fell to the ground and started having a seizure, I drove him to the hospital, and then waited for his mom to show up so I could leave with my boyfriend....He added me on facebook again that night, and sent me an email about how he was so grateful that I was there to help, I also got a call from his mom, saying that she was glad I was there to help, and that she didn't know what would have happened if I was not there. Two days later he told me that I needed to make a choice, and that he would give me a few days to do that. I told him that I wanted him, and that he had no idea how hard this would be... it has been a month since I have heard from him..... he has since blocked me on face book, so I feel like I did something wrong, like scared him off or something... but this leads me to want some opinions on this, that's why I am asking you guys!

TL;DR Version:
Have any of you guys done the disappear/reappear act?

2h87nz,2,2014-09-23,[For Hire] JavaScript developer looking to work remotely at 1.5 BTC/month,[deleted],Jobs4Bitcoins,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/comments/2h87nz/for_hire_javascript_developer_looking_to_work/,"I am a 21 year old college student looking to earn some extra pocket money. I am willing to work for you remotely at 1.5 BTC/month. I am available to work for about 3 hours a day, 5 days a week.

I am familiar with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I consider myself an intermediate JavaScript programmer - I am reasonably comfortable with functional JavaScript and closures.

In the past, I have made an HTML5 game using the Phaser framework ([Line Runner](http://arunmahadevan.com/linerunner/)), and a chat bot ([Chat with Amy](http://chatwithamy.github.io/)).

I have interned at a pretty well known startup in my country (I shall PM its name if you're interested), where I worked on their custom URL shortener, and contributed highly scalable code to it. I have worked with GulpJS, Grunt and Yeoman to automate several tasks. I am reasonably comfortable with MongoDB and Redis, having used both at my internship.

I wrote the URL shortener I mentioned above using NodeJS and Express. Apart from that, I have also used Socket.IO, and am reasonably familiar with concurrent programming using Node.

Other miscellaneous stuff I've worked with include: WordPress, Jekyll (the CMS), Bootstrap, Foundation.

I can also help you speed up your site on the frontend: Minifying JavaScripts and stylesheets, loading them asynchronously if needed, optimizing your images, making image sprites, etc.

[Here's](https://github.com/arungm29) a link to my GitHub.

I hope I can be of help! Please PM me if you're interested!"

Waking up and crawling out-of bed is such a struggle at 8am in the summer. I couldn't find a good internship so now I'm stuck working for my uncles land shaping business. I absolutely hate it, long days in the sun and hardly any breaks. 

Today the sun is streaming down with high humidity making it almost impossible to breathe during work. Everyone is in an awful mood. Today we are working out side the local business center in down town with lots of fun little shops inside. 

As the day wares on my sanity is straining and my attention is slipping. That is until I look up and notice you. Nice and young and fit. Nice tight body. But what really captures my eye is the way your tits are bouncing in your tight white t-shirt. I am absolutely mesmerized so much so that you catch me staring as sweated rips down my body. You smile a little bit and scurry inside. 

All day I can't stop thinking about you. I need to see you again. I keep checking the door hoping to see you walk out. Finally I look up and see you! But I've missed you, all I can see is you ass peaking out of your Jean shorts. Slightly disappointed I get back to work. 

This becomes a pattern, every day at noon you shown up and leave at 4 and like clockwork I stop and stare. I normally don't do this sort of thing, but you have me under so sort of spell. I can't get enough. The thought of grabbing your body with my rough hands and having my way with you is what gets me through the day. One day finally I walk inside the mall to go to the bathroom and while walking out I bump into someone. 

""Oh oh! My god! I'm so sorry I uh didn't mean to! I'll look where I'm going! "" I can't believe I just hit you! 

| you can respond and keep the story going or we can talk about what ages we want to be and any kinks we like before hand! My hard limits are scat and blood and incest. I live cum play and light bandage and light non con, I can work with anything but my hard limits! Can't wait to hear from you! |"
2h8jds,1,2014-09-23,"Me [22 M] with my girfriend [22 F] of 3 months today, here is what I am feeling and going through. Not sure what to do.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2h8jds/me_22_m_with_my_girfriend_22_f_of_3_months_today/,"6 months ago, I was broken up with by my girlfriend of over 2 years (22F) . I drove to her house after spring break, and she broke up with me. It was a total shock to me and her roommates (who I asked if I should have seen this coming). This was her nature though, K (Ill call her that) only confided in me usually, and few other people.  Her reasoning was that, with graduation coming up, she couldn’t be in a relationship right now. At the moment, I didn’t understand. I will say, knowing where she is now, it makes sense. She didn’t do a good job of explaining it at the time, but after hearing about what she has done from mutual friends, I understand. 

I spent the first two months drinking a lot, going out…trying to live college while I was single with a few months left. I asked a girl that I thought was cute freshman year out on a date, and we started dating in early July. I will call her E. E likes me a lot. She wanted to say she loved me in August, she has anxiety and overthinks if I don’t kiss her goodnight. She likes to text A LOT, which I do not like to do. I was happy for a while, but recently I am not. I have one semester left of school, while I work 30 hours a week as an engineer. 

Side note, I am an intern, but my boss quit, so they expect me to do both duties. I am an intern expected to complete the work of a full time engineer. It’s stressful to say the least, and takes a lot of time. 

Today I am going to break up with E. It’s a combination of trying to finish school, being extremely busy with everything, combatting feelings for my ex, the fact she is more invested than I could ever be at this point, and a general feeling that I do not want to be in this relationship right now. She deserves someone who isn’t a zombie at the end of the day. Yesterday I was at work at 6 AM, then school at 1, then meetings until 8 PM. 

This sounds so cheesy to me, but at no point in the past 6 months have I ever stopped loving K. I honestly think about her every day. I’ll admit that I was depressed and sad in the beginning, but I have moved passed that. I just think every day that “hmm, I really miss K. I hope she is doing well.”  I still can’t think back on any of my college career because it was the best time of my life. She was a part of all of that, and memories of her are woven through it. It SUCKS to not be able to reminisce about the best times of your life. 

I found an album we both loved on Vinyl for 2 dollars, and sent her a picture of it saying something simple like “Found this for 2 bucks! What a deal! Hope you are doing well.” Or something close. She responded, saying it was an awesome find, she is super busy but staying afloat for the moment, and hoped that I was doing well too.  I don’t know what I am asking exactly, but I just want to tell the story. I want to be over her, but I don’t. There is this lingering feeling that I don’t like, that we will end up together when we both figure our stuff out.  It’s been six months, and I am still struggling with this, and I hate that I can’t think about the best time of my life. And honestly, I don’t want to think about it unless I can reminisce with her.  

The reason I sent that text was to open communication. She has never reached out to me in the past 6 months, and I am not surprised because K always bottled things really well. In the next month we are both going to a wedding of a mutual friend, and I honestly dread it. I think there might be a guy who was a fling over the summer ( I know I dated someone, and this is a completely two way street, she can do these things. ), maybe he will go? I am not sure. How do you move on when the only reason you broke up was because we needed to tackle big life choices alone right now? Sorry this is so scatter brained, but that is how I feel right now. I can’t point to one core reason or feeling that is the center of all of this. What should I do?

2h8l4j,3,2014-09-23,"[AMA Request] Disneyland Cast Members who were ""Power Rangers"" or worked while they were there.",kamenr2j,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2h8l4j/ama_request_disneyland_cast_members_who_were/,"So I am probably one of the biggest Power Rangers (tokusatsu in general, but I try not to bore non-fans with that) dorks you could ever meet. But I also love Disney! This year after the Power MorphiCon convention in Pasadena, I took a day trip to Disneyland for the first time ever (yes, I know) and it was one of the most fun weekends of my life.

But I was curious to know. I've learned a little about the intricate operation that is being a Disneyland/Disney World cast member after several of my friends worked the college internship program. I've done research, read other AMAs, and am fascinated by the job.

From around 2001 until 2010, the Power Rangers were a Disney brand and although not fully integrated (no Mickey in a Red Ranger costume, sadly), the Power Rangers did have a presence in the Disneyland park.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMf2d-H1h4I

I was hoping if I could ask anyone who played a Power Ranger at Disneyland or were at least working in Disneyland while the Power Rangers were there. I definitely have a handful of questions.

1. How similar was the audition process to the other Disney roles?
2. ""Power Rangers"" was kind of Disney's red-headed stepchild in the nine years or so they owned the property. Were the Rangers treated as such in the park?
3. Were they popular at all? I imagine boys would be excited and girls not as much.
4. Were adults confused? One of my closest friends who is a Disney fanatic never understood why they were there.
5. Much like in becoming a Disney character, there needs to be a deep understanding of the character. Did you guys study or watch the Power Rangers series your Ranger would have come from?
6. Who decides who to be which Ranger?
7. Was there anything you liked about being a Ranger instead of a Disney character?
8. Was there anything you didn't like?
9. Were you also confused as to why Power Rangers were included in the parks?

Thanks again for taking the time out. I certainly have plenty more questions, but I don't want to overwhelm you guys. I definitely wish I could have gone to Disney while they were there."

Since then I've been able to work on a variety of project types including web series, narrative short films, promotional work for small businesses, documentaries and corporate training videos.
  
  I'm a strong believer in collaboration and I always strive for perfection to produce the best quality in my work. I have a friendly and approachable manner, and a good sense of humor, all of which I have learned, make the close working relationships, tight deadlines, and occasional stressful periods all the more bearable!
I’m creative, focused, organized, thorough and above all else, passionate for video production.
  
  I appreciate you taking the time to look over my resume and I hope to be considered for a position within your company.

(Details Inside)",[deleted],cad,https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/2h8nws/recently_laid_off_havent_touched_autocad_since/,"I will be honest, I am very rusty on my Technical Drafting.

I graduated in 2011 with an Associates in Computer Aided Drafting/Design. I had experience with AutoCAD 2012, Microstation, Inventor, Revit Architecture and Sketchup.

Back then, I couldn't find a CAD job when I finished, and to be honest, I wasn't the best drafter out there more so due to my confidence to perform by myself. Though I was always asking questions in my internship which I caught on quick. I found a random Administrative job that I had the last few years but unfortunately my site closed and I'm left here without a job. 

It's been a few weeks and I'm still looking for a job. I'm considering going back to drafting. I still have all my books and my computer still has all the student versions from Autodesk, but to be honest, if I were to apply right now and they asked me questions about CAD, I don't know how well they'd take ""I'm sorry, I'm very rusty on my CAD."" as an answer (I know that'd be a terrible thing to say to an employer but I'm just being honest here)

I'm not even sure where to start. What are some of the essentials I should be preparing for if I do apply for Architectural drafting jobs? This was more of my area when I was in technical school. I feel like I'm starting from scratch again.

I'm sorry if my post is vague in any way, I'm willing to answer any questions."

Need advice on how to not ruin it, myself.",TA230914,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2h949g/me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_have_been_in_a/,"There's a quite of background story I need to give, so I will try to summarize events as much as I can, to get to the main question. I will try my best to give a good TL;DR. This is a pretty long post, so please be ready.

So, I am an Indian and so is my girlfriend. I am getting nationality out of the way so it becomes easy to explain cultural norms.

My both parents have been working and I am the only child. While it means I was pampered a bit, I had to stay long periods of time, alone in house. Also I had to change schools a lot in my childhood, because my parents' jobs used to transfer them to different cities. Due to this, I was never actually able to make very close friends, until my very last school (which was mostly luck). The key term being here,""close"" as I had quite many good friends and was very social. But I didn't have a person I could share my emotions and feelings with properly.

**7 years ago** : I got into my first relationship. But it was a LDR. I confessed, developed my relationship, all through phone calls and messages (video calls were not that easy to do, back then). My girlfriend and I met each other, because our families were friends from my grandfather's generation and even in mom's. She had only come to visit the family but we kept in contact and then after 3 months of meeting her, we got into a relationship.

**4 years ago** I broke up with my girlfriend because I was dumb. Though I gave many reasons (when she was crying over phone and asking me) like ""I suddenly stopped liking you"", ""We were having constant fights and I don't feel this is working out"", etc. but the actual reason was more like I got influenced by my friends around me, who were single and supposedly living a ""free and peaceful"" life (though how my life was not, in a LDR, I don't know). But that was the worst night of my life. She had just started college and was not meshing well there and I broke up when she needed me.

**3 years ago** I passed my high school exams, scoring poorly and was in danger of taking a gap year. Then somehow I came to know through some people that I can pursue my dream (which was a career in games development) and pursue a degree in UK. I should have known that you should not just jump on any opportunity you get especially seeing clearly that I was definitely lacking concentration and the correct mental state to tackle a university life.

**1 and 1/2 years ago** At this time, I was in my 2nd year. I had passed my 1st year with decent marks, but that was because first year was easy and I could go by, without putting an effort. 

I had become a shut in, essentially at this stage of my life. First year, I went to parties, hung out with people but I could never find people who I could call ""close"". Those were just ""good"" friends. But by this time, I guess I couldn't just be bothered to be around them and started becoming unsocial. So much that my housemates used to say jokingly, that they had thought I had died since they haven't seen me for a week. Yes, my own housemates. I had stopped going to classes, started ordering food or mostly getting takeout every day. I skipped a meal every day so I was getting more and more unhealthy. Not to mention, my room was shit. And the worst of all (which I didn't realize at that time), was I had gotten addicted to online gaming (for interested, it was league of legends). 

I used to just go, give attendance once a week, when it was required (as to not alert the UKBA aithorities) and stay home. I skipped giving those small assignments (5%, 10%) and just used to study 10 days before exams. And surprisingly, despite getting a lower average than last year, it was still decent. 

All these years, my ex used to keep contacting me (via phone/facebook) using some excuse or the other to talk to me, but I used to refuse. This time, around Feb, I was kind of nostalgic and I got to talk with my ex again and maybe you can call, it was a decision taken not with rational thought, but we went back together.

Lots of thing about us has changed though. I had become a recluse, selfish person, who had trouble sharing his inner thoughts with someone else (kind of opposite of my previous self) and she had turned from the sweet, innocent (and a bit naive) girl I used to know and date, to smart, daring and more extrovert personality than I remembered. The very first two things she told me, was that she was currently in a relationship of an year (which was a rebound from me) and secondly, she was virgin. I won't go into many details, but Indian culture is still old fashioned in many sense, so I hope you get the meaning. I kind of was hurt (and I deserved it) and it took time for me to get over it while she took time getting over her guilt of breaking up with a guy who had nothing wrong. I felt bad for him, but I was selfish. I couldn't give up on the very last chance my life had provided me, to redeem myself. 

It took time, but throughout these 1 and 1/2 years, with many ups and downs, we became a much stronger couple than we were, 3 years ago. We no longer had that childishness and our motto of the relationship was to change at each stage of life, as it required us to, for each other and for our future. 

**1 month ago** While we were in LDR (she in India and me in UK), she was preparing to give GRE and get to US so in some form, she can come closer to me. My plan was also to somehow get to US (no basis for this, I was just stupid). 

The major thing that changed from our last relationship was a role reversal in some sense. Back then, I was very career oriented and talked about fulfilling my dreams and now here I was, supposedly living those dreams and my girlfriend was actually on track of fulfilling her goals. 

I had been lying to her though and even my parents. I still didn't go to class. I still didn't eat properly. I still was a shut in and had a huge addiction to online gaming. The only thing that had changed from last time was I had someone I could talk to. I kept procrastinating stuff I needed to do. I always told myself, I have a month, then 2 weeks and then 1 week and then one night. And I realized for the first time in my university life that I had fucked up majorly and there was no way to pass my exams this time, just preparing few days before.

I knew that I was a quitter. I had realized this long back from the time, I ran away from India to UK because I couldn't get into anywhere there, on my parents' money. My parents, even if they couldn't give me time, but were the best parents I could have ever hoped for, sacrificing everything for me. And the guilt had been killing me for over 6 months and I had started having suicidal thoughts. And when I reached this deadlock finally after 6 months, I realized there was no way left. I didn't just go to my exams and lied to my parents. Even then, I had a hope that I can study and prepare for resits. But people can't change that easily.

Since I had to go back home (I only went home once a year since air fare was pretty expensive), I was there for a brief period of a month and then I had went back again to give resits, 1 month ago. But since I knew I was not prepared, I knew that there was no hope left. I just felt despair over and over and finally researching all over net for specific and painless ways (yes, I am a coward too) to suicide, I finally found one. As soon as I reached UK, I ordered the equipment and decided the date to die as 24th August. I couldn't face either my parents or girlfriend after this. The shame I will bring them and the failure to give them happy lives, it kept crushing me. Just one thing I did, was I sent my suicide notes (which I had prepared earlier to be sent to their email ids) just few hours before I do it. In India, it was already night so my parents were asleep, so the time was right. In US, though (she had already gotten accepted in a university of her choice), it was midday - afternoon and by some chance, she read it. She then kept calling me and messaging me on whatsapp. I just picked up once, maybe hoping somewhere that I will be given a reason to live and my girlfriend kept sobbing through the phone, repeating that ""I should not take such a big step in life"", ""There is always something we can do, everything is not lost"", ""if you want me to leave, I will. Just don't take such a step"". More than these words, the thing that was tearing me up was how my girlfriend was crying so much that she had trouble breathing. This was the second time, I had put my girlfriend in this situation and at the very same point of time (when she is starting a new chapter in her life) and I couldn't bear it. At that moment, more than my depression, I just didn't want her to cry. So, I calmed her down and promised I won't do anything. Afterwards, she had contacted my housemates and friends to keep an eye on me. Hours later, my parents also had seen the mail and for the first time, I heard my dad cry and that was one of the most painful moments of my life. My dad had always been my inspiration and a strong figure who had never faltered in any situation. And this strong man, was crying in front of me. 

I won't go more over it as even a month after I still tear up thinking about that moment. In short, we reconciled. The only good thing that came out of this situation was my parents and my girlfriend bonded quite well (which is an impossible scenario in India). I am currently doing a placement year which was to be done between my 3rd and 5th year (undergrad is 3 years in UK and I was in a Master's programme), in India, itself. And my some form of luck, I am currently living with my parents for atleast a short period until I am assigned a project in a different city. I got into touch with a therapist and my addiction of gaming has gotten quite less. The plan in short though is, I will finish my internship -&gt; repeat my 3rd year back in UK -&gt; pass out as Bachelor's in CS instead of CGD. -&gt; meanwhile giving GRE and get to US. This process basically takes two years and I should be atleast in the same country as her after a long while. It is a long process and we have to wait a lot. She will already be done with her 2 years of job (ideally), by the time I get a job. In India, parents start pressuring their daughters to get married when a particular age comes and arranged marriage is still preferred over love. She has said though that if they say anything like that, she will just straightaway reveal about us (which we were planning to, after we have successful careers of atleast 1-2 years, to please her parents and approve of our relationship).

Now comes the problem. 

**TL;DR #1 : Got into relationship with my girlfriend 7 years ago; broke up with her after 3 years because I was stupid; Went to UK to study; Became a loner, stopped going to classes; Got back with her, 1 and 1/2 years ago; Girlfriend gave GRE and went to US to get closer to us; My quitter/lazy/procrastinating attitude finally came to bite me in ass as I failed my 3rd year; Was in despair for 6 months already. This was last straw and thought of suiciding; Girlfriend saved me and now we created a plan to get in the same country in 2 years.**

Wow, that was a long TL;DR.

Now the advice I need is how to cope up with these 2 years? I am currently stuck in a boring job with only a Sunday off. The time difference between me and my gf is 10.5 hours. We get very less time to talk. Sometimes we have arguments because of it. I feel lonely and sometimes feel jealous and become overprotective when she is with guys, even though I trust her. I know it is not her fault. I just want to be a better boyfriend. I know many people will feel I already am getting way more than I deserve. And I just want to keep repaying that favour back to them, throughout my whole life. But this much of a time difference, creates problems. When one misses the other, he/she is asleep or busy most of the times. By the time, the other gets back to talk, the feeling has moved on. I know we have to stay strong in this time. But I just don't want us to get used to this so much that we don't start feeling anything when we don't talk for days. 

I just want to know, how I can stop getting upset on things obviously which is not her fault and am able to keep fulfilling the faith she has displayed in us, because I am asking her to wait for me for minimum 2 years. 

**TL;DR #2 Need advice on how to be patient for 2 years in LDR and not get upset, jealous, overprotective on stupid things, over a 10.5 hours time zone difference (will become 6 when I go back to UK, next year).**"
2h976y,1,2014-09-23,I[23/F] did not sign up for this with him [23/M]. Help me please!,bfproblemz,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2h976y/i23f_did_not_sign_up_for_this_with_him_23m_help/,"Apologies for the long story.

Background: I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year now.  We dated for about 8 months before becoming officially boyfriend and girlfriend.  We went to different colleges, graduated, and have been living at home now.   I am in my last year of grad school and am very busy with my internship and school; he works full time.  Things have been stressful but manageable until now.

We had a wonderful conversation about how moving in together might be an option once I graduate in May.  We also talked about how it was living at home and he stated how much he loved being around his family.   2 days later he texts me at 9:30 at night, before my first day of classes saying that hes moving out.

Being the anxious person that I am I immediately freaked out and was entirely caught off guard.  I had a panic attack about the issue and was very upset.  After calming down and talking, he told me he wanted to move closer to the city, an hour and a half drive for me.  He also wanted to live with his friend from college.  I commute 2x a week to the city, which is difficult enough as it already is.  During this program I have no time to work, and knowing this, I have built up my savings account to be able to afford gas and tuition.  I have everything budgeted out to the last penny, enough to barely get by.

When he first told me about this I didn't think it was actually going to happen, I thought maybe he had a bad day or something.  3 days later, he texts me again the night before I start my internship telling me he's signing a lease for a place that starts in a few weeks.  Again, I had another panic attack. 

All of this happened about 3 weeks ago.  After having multiple fights related to this...mostly about how I won't have the time/money to see him no matter how hard I tried, we finally came to a conclusion that we would try this once he moved in for at least a little while.  He does not feel the need to help me out by paying for my gas and parking, not even once in a while.  He also doesn't want to visit me because the whole reason he is moving is to be away from our area. 
 
He is moving in next week, and I don't feel ready.  I feel that he is ""leaving"" me to escape from our relationship, even though he claims he isn't.  He says it will be better for us because we will be able to spend nights together/ he will be more independent.  I think he will regress and turn into a college frat guy (I have known him for 8 years so this isn't an irrational fear necessarily).  He has no other reason for moving except that he wants to be young and social (his words).  He actually is doubling his commuting time for work, so this isn't in anyway benefiting him. Also, I have a puppy at home and his apartment doesn't allow dogs, so it puts us in an even more difficult situation.  

I am so lost as what to do.  I am so hurt and angry I find myself crying almost every day and constantly fighting with him.  I feel as if I am trapped.  I have never done well with long distance relationships, and especially now when I will be at home studying and he will be out getting drunk with his buddies.  I find it very hard to see us living together now and fear that he will not ever want to move in with me when he's out having the time of his life.

While I understand that he needs to grow up and be independent, I think he is choosing to do so at the cost of our relationship.  Has anyone been through something similar and had it strengthen their relationship?  I do not want to breakup with him, he treats me very well and I could see myself spending the rest of my life with him.  Should I let him move and be crazy and drunk and stupid and let him ""get it out of his system""?   

tldr: My boyfriend made a unrealistically quick decision to move an hour and a half away, to be ""independent"".  He says it will be better for us, I think it will be worse.

I have neither (working on it). Is there any way to get my foot in the door another way?

In terms of skills, I know some basic stats/math, and intermediate programming in Java, Python, Scheme."
2h9apy,2,2014-09-23,"I'm trying to start a relationship with a guy friend I have had feelings for a while, but I'm having reservations because of a past emotionally abusive relationship",LovelyDinerDate,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2h9apy/im_trying_to_start_a_relationship_with_a_guy/,"I have been getting closer with my friend (let's call him Daniel) lately. We have been friends since our freshman year of college, and we have been going to dinner together almost once a week since then. This dinner ""tradition"" never stopped, even when we were dating other people, so I never through much of it.

But, I have always had feelings for him, even if I tried to ignore them. And I am beginning to realize the feelings have always been returned. Apparently this was obvious to all of our mutual friends, but not me. Now we are getting even closer, we have been spending more one on one time together at each other's houses and calling each other more often. I could start something, and I know I want to, but I am scared.

And that is really bothering me. I know him, I know his friends, I know his fraternity brothers, I know one of his ex girlfriends. He doesn't have any anger issues or self confidence problems like my ex did. He treats everyone really well.

Even when I was with my ex, Daniel always knew exactly what to do. He knew my boyfriend hated him, but he stuck with me. He would text me regularly, asking how I was doing. If I said ""not good"" or mentioned that my boyfriend and I were fighting he would take me to get sushi (my favorite) and talk about everything except my boyfriend.

Now, it's months after I finally realized I was in an emotionally abusive relationship and broke up with my ex. Daniel was in another state at an internship all summer, but he still messaged me every once in a while. When he got back we resumed our weekly get togethers, but now it is less friend-like. He has started putting his arm around me and when I responded to that well, he pulls me to his chest. It's all going so slow, it reminds me of my first relationship when I was 15. And I think part of that is because I think he knows just how bad my last relationship was.

But I really want to move forward. I want to enjoy my time with him. I'm tired of avoiding physical touch. I hate that I am scared of being in a relationship with someone I really care about.

How do you work through something like this? How do you get comfortable with someone after the last person you got comfortable with was so awful to you?

**TL;DR- I was in an abusive relationship a few months ago. Now I am wanting to move forward with my guy friend who I have had feelings for for a long time. But I am having reservations, because of the past abuse, and I am wanting to know how to get over them.**"

I will give you some background first.

I graduated in May last year with a 1st Class degree in history and found very quickly that that meant absolutely nothing. I moved back in with my parents expecting it to be a temporary thing and have found it to be very much the opposite. 

I have only been employed for one month since leaving university when I was duped into working in a call center after being told I was getting a admin job with minimal phone work. I left to purse a internship at a PR company, this was an okay experience but only lasted a fortnight and left me a stage one.

As time has passed I'm finding it more and more difficult to keep my enthusiasm up and an impetus to keep trying. Any semblance of a sleep pattern has gone by the way side as I generally seem to go to bed between 3-4am and not get up before 11am.

One of my big issues is that i'm chronically apathetic, I really have no idea what I want to do with my life and have absolutely no great dreams or aspirations. I lack any real direction at all. The only things in my life that I show any real passion for is reading and football...

I spend most of my day just searching reddit and the internet, I've tried doing some writing but I find that I lack any real creativity.

Anyways I hope someone can make sense of this mess and give me some ideas.

Thanks.

2ha7wd,1,2014-09-23,I need your help MFA. Help me evolve my wardrobe.,Explorer21,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/2ha7wd/i_need_your_help_mfa_help_me_evolve_my_wardrobe/,"This is going to be a bit of a long post so thank you in advance to anyone willing to answer.

For reference, I am 18, 5'10, 150 but bulking up. I have a semi-athletic build. To clarify, I am slim but broad shouldered and while not gigantic, am somewhat toned.

I am entering a stage in life where I need to change my wardrobe substantially. I have always tried to have items that fit well instead of just baggy t-shirts and ripped jeans, but I just recently landed a pretty good internship and want to evolve my wardrobe a bit. Fortunately, this leaves me with some excess spending money and I am looking for items that aren't designer expensive just to be expensive, but certainly well made and I am not too concerned what price tag it takes to make that happen.

Before I go further I have read the sidebar but I am younger than usual for the situations I will need these clothes for likely, and am looking for more specific recommendations for a wide variety of questions.

The first situation is for business. Meetings with lawyers, development teams, and the like. I already have a suit and your standard oxfords, but need recommendations for a formal coat for winter and fall.  Overcoats are too old but I need something to keep me sufficiently warm that still matches being young, but professional. The point isn't to go in looking like a kid, but not to come off like I think I am 35. I am lost as far as finding something sufficiently warm while also not to ""old"" for me to wear with a suit during colder weather. 

Along the same lines, I am looking for a pair of boots I can dress up with denim. Most of the time I won't be required to wear a suit. A nice pair of raws or chinos with a sweater will be sufficiently ""dressed up"". I am looking for a pair of boots that can handle inclement weather, while still looking dressy or formal for use during spring and fall. I have looked at and quite like some of Crockett and Jones's options, but want to know just how well they hold up in the winter. Can they take getting a bit wet?

That is it for formal wear at the moment. Now a bit for recommendations as far as fits. I have a relatively short torso due to my height. Length wise your typical small fits me well, though medium sometimes is okay. The problems come in the wasit and in the shoulder. I am not huge by any means, but I have broad shoulders and small sizes never fit at the shoulders. Medium shirts typically fit best at the shoulders. However, with mediums they tend to be far too large around the waist. My options are either too small in the shoulders and across the chest and it makes me look like I am trying to wear far too tight clothes, or too long and fits baggy.  Does anyone have a recommendation for a brand that sell shirts (casual button downs, t-shirts, formal shirts, anything) that come a bit broader at the shoulders and slimmer at the waist?

Those are the two main issues I currently have. 

If you didn't (understandably) wan't to bother reading, it is:

A formal coat for wearing with a suit in winter that is suitable for a younger person

Nice boots that can take a bit of wetness/snow

Shirts that are either shorter than usual in medium sizes, or broader in the chest and shoulders for small sizes while remaining slim at the waist.



I appreciate any and all help in advance. I am just one person and feel kind of bad taking up anyone's time just for me, but if you are doing nothing else any advice is welcome. Just to say again, this job which I am quite fortunate to have has given me money to not be concerned about sacrificing function for money. That being said, I don't want to just pay more for a name. 

If I had to take the formal look I am going for and put it in a sentence it is ""I am young, but I wan't to be taken seriously"". Nothing too out stated or daring, but nothing that makes it seem like I am trying to be 35+.


Thanks again.

2haa22,99,2014-09-23,"Devnote Tuesdays: The ""Walt Doesn't Make Blue Keth"" Edition",RowsdowerKSP,KerbalSpaceProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2haa22/devnote_tuesdays_the_walt_doesnt_make_blue_keth/,"**Felipe (HarvesteR):** Experimentals is upon us again and things are moving at a very intense pace to make sure all the features we’ve added are stable and polished. The upgrades we did to the issue tracker last week are definitely showing their worth now though, as there have been several cases of issues that were technically low-priority and would have been dismissed earlier as unimportant, that rose to the top of the list after receiving several votes. Sometimes a very mild, small detail can have a major subjective impact on the way the game plays, and issue voting lets us finally measure this perceived importance for all issues.

Besides that, most of the work this week and the last was basically bugfixing and adding polish to the things we’ve implemented. The Strategy system and the Admin Facility were met with very positive responses overall, but I must say I’m very happy to see how the new spaceplane parts are turning out.

I must warn however, that several SP+ parts do replace old parts, and it’s very likely that some spaceplane designs can become weird or misaligned. This won’t actually break saves, but ships featuring those old parts won’t look their best until rebuilt in the editor. For most cases, simply detaching and reattaching the misplaced parts will do. We decided it was for the best to simply bite the bullet on this one, because there is no point in having old parts linger around, wasting our already cramped memory space, just for the sake of delaying this inevitable change.

If you want to start preparing your saves for the release, I recommend recovering all ongoing spaceplane missions. The parts that have been most changed are the C7 delta wing and triangular wing sections, standard and small control surfaces, and minor changes were done to the mk1 fuselages and cockpit, and the entire mk2 set. I know it’s a bit of a hassle to have to do this, but trust me when I say it’s going to be well worth it!

**Alex (aLeXmOrA):** Last week I took a 5 day vacation in Querétaro to celebrate Mexican Independence Day (September 16th - “Fiestas Patrias”). It was a really nice time of relaxation and fun with the family. I needed that a lot. When I came back to the office on Wednesday, I set everything for the Server Migration (second attempt) scheduled for Thursday night. Unfortunately, the migration failed and we had to suspend it and I set the sites back online. This week, I cleaned our databases and made some reports. Also, I’m testing the last tweaks to the KSP Store website.

**Marco (Samssonart):** Last week and also this one, we’ve been deep in QA and experimentals.Luckily not too many bugs have surfaced on my part and the ones that have were not that serious - the NavBall appearing in weird places and things like that. What has been keeping me busier than I expected is getting the arrow indicator for the maneuver vector on the IVA NavBall. Since all of the vectors share the same relative position to the center of the sphere and all is managed through rotations, it’s a whole different thing than for the staging NavBall. I’m taking the dust cover off my old math books for this one.

**Daniel (danRosas):** It’s been almost a month since we started working on the asset production. That task is going well, walking small steps to Kerbal kind. On the other hand, I helped prepare the Kerbals that are going to be advising your administrative actions on the Administration Building.

One of those Kerbals is **[MORTIMER KERMAN](http://i.imgur.com/FlqiM8X.jpg)**, which quoting @maehlum ‏is going to think *""You spent the whole budget on SRBs and snacks?!""*.  It was interesting to play with his face, since he’s the first Kerbal that has got wrinkles and some bags under the eyes. The **[FIRST ATTEMPT](http://i.imgur.com/qveA9lb.jpg)** had grey hair (my main visual support was Mad Men's Roger Sterling, which could be slightly biased by my effort of going through season 6), but talking with Felipe, it didn’t look well with the background and the environment. Then I added some facial spots and other details, but got a little **[CREEPY](http://i.imgur.com/QATdLix.jpg)**. A bit too old. On the other hand, there was an interesting discussion: How do Kerbals get old? What are their muscles in their face? So far, we haven’t seen Kerbals grow old.  We know that they move their mouth, and that they can speak, smile and cry. But, since it’s mostly a toon character, grounded slightly on a human face, it was a tough call to make the wrinkles and to spot them in their proper place.  There’s this other scientist guy, which is mostly Wernher’s intern, which overlooks Science and Research funds, since Wernher is too busy to be bothered with such small talk. **[WALT](http://i.imgur.com/uNUizJZ.jpg)** is the most intriguing Kerbal in the Admin Building (of course he’s got nothing to do with that other Walt, nor is he in the same line of business, though somewhere in the project folder I’ve got a blue extinguisher waiting to be used). He’s the PR and likes to wear a Hazmat Suit to the meetings. I’m not so sure if he’s got some sort of illness that could make Kerbalkind extinct (at least in his mind), or if he’s just preventive about his working environment. He’s wearing **[THIS](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/NASA_SCAPE_protective_suits.jpg)** NASA suit with a slight color variation. We don’t want the hazmat suit to be mistaken with the EVA suit, and be launched on a mission instead!

**Jim (Romfarer):** It’s been a week of modifying older GUI elements and fixing bugs. Among other things I added a feature so you can scale the ContractsApp while in vab and sph. I also added the Application Launcher to the tracking station. The ContractsApp, MessageSystem and all mods will be visible in there where applicable. As for bugs i fixed one bug that has been around for a long time in one form or another where parts are picked in vab/sph when you have the loading or flag menu right above the part.


**Max (Maxmaps):** Been spreading myself across tasks this time around. Keeping contact with you lovely people on the forums and offsite communities, making sure that the massive art project goes as planned, and also helping as much as I can to get the new update in your hands. Scripted the prerelease features video already, but you guys are gonna love what the media team is cooking up.

**Ted (Ted):** Now that we're firmly in Experimentals, we're racing through the issues and the builds (as those of you that lurk steamdb will know!). The new testers are settling in well and filling the tracker to the brim with some good and tasty issues for the developers to eat up. It's been a very busy week to say the least, but I've managed to grab a few moments to make some improvements to the part folders. I've renamed almost all of the Squad part folders so that they're both better organized in the editor part menu and so that they better reflect the part title in-game. Additionally, I've renamed the part config files to be the same as the part folder name, that should help a lot when having tabs of them open in Notepad++.

0.25 is shaping up nicely, though we still have a handful of areas to polish and refine so that they're at their best when they arrive on your hard drives!

**Anthony (Rowsdower):** I can't believe we're almost at the end of the month already. Time's flying by, isn't it? Not much for you all this week except to remind you that our Coub contest will be coming to an end on October 4. Also, by chance, would any of you modders out there be interested in showing off what you do on KSP-TV? Hit me up with a forum PM if interested.

**Rogelio (Roger):** I’ve been doing some changes to the assets I’ve been modeling along with Max and Felipe, I think we’ve finally gotten to the same visual style. This week, I went crazy fixing some Maya issues. Many of my models seem to have just disappeared. Later on, I noticed that they, in fact, didn’t disappear. They just weren’t assigned to a shader and it was really annoying to reassign shaders. On the other hand, I’m really happy with the new stuff we’re cooking for you guys. Today Dan put together some of the stuff we’re modeling and it really looks nice. We’ll keep polishing the models to make it look even better."
2haanz,0,2014-09-23,Quit internship or continue to deal with cat calling and other unsettling behavior (20F)?,ssenippah,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2haanz/quit_internship_or_continue_to_deal_with_cat/,"Hey everyone,
I'm a lurker on reddit/twox but I really need advice and want a larger-women opinion/solidarity/anything really.

I am a 20 year old, female, college senior, currently interning in a not-so-great part of the city. I've been there since June, and have loved every moment of it. It's really been enlightening to learn about my career and have gotten so much out of it. 

But, since June, I've always been cat called on my way to work. There is a 2-minute strip (which feels like forever in cat-calling land) between me leaving the metro and the office that has always really irritated me. But, you know, that's life in this society and sometimes we just got to move on.

Then, maybe in late August, I was almost to work when I heard a woman screaming and yelling - saying something about ""how dare you touch me! i can't fucking believe it omg where are the police"" etc. I had a feeling that someone had groped her or assaulted her but she was in such hysterics that I didn't feel comfortable approaching her, so I went to work. Either way, it was definitely unsettling and worrying.

Then, on Monday, I was walking to work and a woman not 30 feet in front of me was walking past a man who was sitting on a stoop near her. The man reached up for her leg and she jumped away and kept walking. There is a 10% chance that he was trying to steal her phone from her hand - but they way he moved his hand (relatively slowly with an open palm), intuition tells me he was trying to touch her inappropriately. Thankfully there was a police car in front of my building and I told him about it - he drove around the corner to see but I'm not sure (if anything) happened. 

So, in combination with these two incidents, plus the incessant cat-calling (that I don't feel comfortable talking back to since I take the same route almost every week-day), I'm wondering if I should just quit my internship. I love it there so much and it would break my heart that I would need to quit my job because some men can't keep their words or hands to themselves. *sigh* sorry for the wall of text.

ps - just to clarify - it might sound like since I'm a 20 year old feminist and self-aware woman that I am exaggerating these incidents or spotlighting the bad of this area - but after looking at a local crime map - more crime happens within 1500 feet of my building than the stereotypical ""dangerous"" neighborhood's subway stop. Also, the two women-events I saw happened on the path I always take. I just feel like I could be them eventually. 


**tl;dr: Thinking about quitting my internship because**
* think I saw a woman reacting to the aftermath of assault
* saw a woman almost actually get assaulted
* get cat-called at least once on my way to work, every time.
Thoughts?

2hb4ud,1,2014-09-24,"My[22 M] girlfriend [21 F] of 2.5 years cheated on me with a guy [26 M] at her internship, trying to stay together",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hb4ud/my22_m_girlfriend_21_f_of_25_years_cheated_on_me/,"Hello /r/relationships,

I'm a first time poster here. The last time I posted to the internet about my relationships was in high school, and I thought I'd grown out of it, but I'd really like to hear from multiple sources and this seems like the place.

I've been dating this wonderful girl for 2.5 years. We've had our share of modest problems, but they were usually my fault. And let me just say, never so bad as what she did this summer. (For example one night I fell asleep on a couch spooning another girl. That was pretty bad at the time.)

While all of our previous problems were minor and were always solved trivially with some communication, both my GF and I returned from our respective trips this summer and she was acting weird. So I asked her about it, and bit by bit, she revealed that ultimately she fell in love with another guy at her internship and had sex with him. 4 times. (She said after the first time, which crushed her, the next 3 were ""fuck it, I've already fucked up, why not again"" )

I was floored. I still am. I feel like I've already looped around the grieving spectrum about 3 times, from disbelief to blinding anger.

The thing is, we're communicators, and we've been talking about it pretty much nonstop for about 4 days now. And we've made the decision to stick through this, because we think the relationship could still work despite this massive fuckup. If this is confusing to any of you, feel free to critique this decision. This is why I'm posting here, because I'm confused and hurt. We've been working through it, but I feel like I can't make it better fast enough.

She says she loves me, even still after loving another, she wants to stay together with me, and that she won't ever cheat again. I believe her words, but I don't know if they'll be true in the future, since this impossible situation has already happened. She still loves this guy, and they're going to be long distance friends. For some reason, I can accept this.

I feel like I love her so much that I can take the hit, and we can grow through it; that, or the relationship will die if that's the way it's supposed to be. If she needs to be with this guy instead of me, we'll find out soon enough as her feelings settle down.

Reddit, I guess the reason why I'm posting this is because I need to vent. I've already told my 2 closest friends, but if I ever told anybody else, the world would ransack this relationship that I'm actually trying to save from destruction!

This cheating is a cataclysm for me, I already didn't know my place in life, and the girl I was considering as a candidate for marriage in the future does this extremely hurtful act. I love her. I choose to pursue this relationship to the end because if I let that fucking asshole across the sea break us up instead of it being our choice, I would feel like the worst of trash.

Reddit, what do you think? I mean, honestly, I've already made my decision, but I really would like to hear what people think about this. 

And of course, since the world is crazy complex, there are MANY details I left out just because of the volume. I'd be happy to explain more in any comments.

Thanks,
nefariousvile

2hb7po,124,2014-09-24,[Method] I'm starting to overcome rejection.,Diece,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/2hb7po/method_im_starting_to_overcome_rejection/,"A few days ago I made one of the biggest discoveries of my life. I discovered I am afraid of rejection.

Today was my first day in handling my fear of rejection. What was the plan you may say? Get rejected FIVE times. Yep, only five fucking times but man was it hard.

I planned to take the subway to an area that I wasn't familiar with and knock on people doors selling life insurance for a fake company called Amco. I wanted my pitch to go terribly and did not want the people interested in the insurance. 

My pitch went 

&gt; ""Hi, I'm working for at an internship for a company called Amco. As part of the internship I have to go door to door and ask if 
&gt; people would be interested in life insurance.""

It really surprised me when I started walking on the street too scared to go up to peoples doors and deliver my pitch. I spent a good thirty minutes walking around trying to convince myself to do it. Every time I came close to following through I started to breathe really deep and heavy. I started shaking and become nervous. I can't believe I was experiencing so much anxiety from just the thought of getting rejected. Slowly I started to convince myself to go with it. I asked myself these questions...

What is the WORST that could happen? Be told no.

How badly do you want to fight this fear? No one said fighting fear is easy but it's an obstacle that doesn't exist. It's just a figment of your imagination.

Do you want to let pain control you? Go ahead, don't get rejected but just remember what could of been if you were comfortable with making yourself uncomfortable.


These questions started to give me power over my fear and I decided to do something about it. I walked up to the door. Gazing at the side hoping there wasn't a doorbell and I would have an excuse to not follow through. Unfortunately for me there was a doorbell, I forced myself to hit the little button. Three seconds later the door opens, *Gulp*. Once the door opened and I made eye contact with the person all of my fears and anxiety melted away like a chocolate that has been left out in the sun for an extended period of time. After delivering my pitch I was told 

&gt; ""Sorry, I'm not interested"". 

I didn't die, no one mocked me and I didn't get shot. I survived, I survived rejection.

Despite my small success I couldn't just leave with one rejection. I had to do 4 more. Fuck. Surprisingly the second, third, fourth and fifth approaches were each easier than the last. I started to build momentum, I could feel the fear dissolving. After my fifth rejection I jumped and screamed ""I DID IT, I FUCKING DID IT!"" pure joy flowed through my body.

As I reflect on my life I am starting to realize how much rejection has controlled me. I've been passive most of my life because I don't want to get rejected. I never thought I was scared of rejection but I now realize the key to my problems has been under my nose the entire time.

Tomorrow I plan to do the exact same thing, five rejections.

2hb87o,2,2014-09-24,I feel like writing about my life and family.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hb87o/i_feel_like_writing_about_my_life_and_family/,"This will probably be a very, very long post. I’m not crazy or narcissistic, I just feel this is helpful somehow.


I'm a 30 year old single white male with an 8 year old daughter. Aside from my daughter, my family consists of just me, my brother and parents, no other relatives are alive or in the area that we talk to. I have a decent job and I’ve been living either with friends or alone for about 12 years, and I’ve had weekend custody of my daughter her whole life, but that's about to change to full custody. My brother (34) has been living primarily with my dad for the majority of his adult life. Living off my dad, I should say, as my dad has been paying for all of his, often lavish, living expenses. I think the best way to get this down might be to break my family up into sets of relationships. 


My daughter and her mother: My daughter and I are close, she is the highlight of my life and she is smart, sweet, and wonderful. I met her mother at my job when I was 19, and aside from ending up with a daughter that I love, getting involved with the mother was a huge mistake. I was young and naive. She's what a lot of people would call a ""ghetto hood rat."" She has a great personality in a lot of ways, but more than anything she is chaotic, prone to losing her temper, and prone to making bad decisions. My daughter had been living with her mother, for the first 7 years of her life, I would have my daughter on the weekends (her mother and I couldn't make the relationship work, having tried and failed several times). For the past few years up until about 9 months ago, my daughter's mother had been living at her mom's and was for the most part unemployed and living off child support and welfare. She had also gotten involved with someone who made money through a fake charity fraud, and so she was living off that as well. Perhaps no surprise, she had also become an addict. She took Norcos, at first for back problems but soon recreationally. She was open about taking them for her back, but soon it became obvious that she was taking more and more. She would create ""emergencies"" and use my daughter as a way of getting me to give her much more than the $600 per month I paid in child support, saying things like we're out of food, I need gas money/ bus money or I’ll miss this job interview, ect. These emergencies became increasingly frequent and her behavior was getting increasing erratic and hostile, and she was already a pretty erratic and hostile person, with me at least. After discussing the situation with people and putting some thought into it, I decided that I should stop giving her additional money, as I was clearly just enabling her drug habit. Meanwhile, I was planning to eventually hire a lawyer to attempt to get increased or full custody, though I was beginning to realize that a father getting full custody is extremely difficult in California, not to mention extremely expensive. Part of my plan, honestly, was also to wait for her to make a huge mistake and end up in jail or something, likely by getting into a fight with a friend or boyfriend. Despite her chaos, she was always pretty good with our daughter though. She was warm and nurturing with her, hadn’t lost her temper or hit her or anything, and hadn't yet put her in any risk or danger through negligence. Then one day she called me with one of her typical emergency situations. It was on a Saturday evening during my daughter’s winter break from school. I had my daughter and was scheduled to bring her back that night and then go to work (I work graveyard shift). It was 11th hour and she told me that she needed $100 for food for the week, otherwise I would need to keep my daughter for the rest of the week, knowing that that would be really hard to manage on short notice. I went back and forth with her for a while about it (I make sure my daughter doesn’t overhear these conversations), and eventually called the grandmother and told her about the situation. She told me to just bring my daughter there, said there was plenty of food in the house and she could look after her. The grandmother’s a lot more reasonable and knows all about her daughter’s tendencies. A little while after bringing my daughter there, I got a call from my daughter’s mother, who was furious. She told me that she had picked my daughter up and brought her to her friend’s house down the street (where she was now crashing at about half the time). She said her mother couldn’t watch her, and said that if I didn’t wire her money or pick my daughter up immediately she was going to drive my daughter to a park somewhere and leave her there. She told me this on the phone and via text messages, and at this point I had installed a call recording app as means to get more evidence for custody, so I decided to call in sick to work and go there and get the police involved. Immediately after emailing work I got a text from her saying that she’d just kicked my daughter out of the house and sent her walking. I called the grandmother who was already on the phone with the police. My daughter had run to her house screaming and crying. I drove there immediately and picked my daughter up. Her grandmother and I then went through the long process of getting CPS involved, who took about a month to even get the ball rolling on anything. I told the grandmother that I didn’t want to bring my daughter back to her school until it was illegal for her mother to come get her, so I worked it out with my parents to keep her with me over at their places for about a month. This actually proved to be a pretty wise decision, because the principal later told me that my daughter’s mother had been going there almost daily looking for her, and legally they would have had to let her take her. After a bunch of meetings with CPS, they decided to place my daughter into temporary foster care custody with her grandmother, and would give re-unification programs to both me and her mother, though mine would be much easier and have many less requirements. I was OK with temporary custody for the grandmother, as I was living with roommates and needed a little time to move out, not to mention change my shift at work, but CPS’s justification for not giving me immediate full custody was that they believed that I didn’t do enough to protect my daughter from her mother and try to contact authorities or get custody. I strongly disagree with that decision, as before this incident I didn’t have any hard proof that she was on drugs, I had no smoking guns for a custody case, and any attempt to gain custody would have likely backfired and resulted in minimal custody (weekends, which I already had) and caused retaliation from the mother. This is getting to be an incredibly long post, so to finalize this part, I’ve now moved out and I am in the process of moving in with my dad, as it’s the only way to make full custody work immediately with my graveyard schedule and CPS’s requirements. I currently take my daughter there about 4 days a week and should be getting full custody within 6 months. My brother is moving out of my dad’s and into my mom’s garage, and right now the two of us are sort of living at both parent’s houses.


My brother and dad: My brother is 34, he’s an art major and has a degree, but has mostly been unemployed his entire adult life and has mostly been living at my dad’s. He and my dad have a codependent relationship, they are both pretty socially isolated and in some ways socially inept. My dad is 73 and is still working, mainly just to support my brother. Neither my dad, nor my brother really have any friends, and it’s me and my mom’s suspicion that my dad wants my brother to remain dependent on him out of fear of being alone. I see my dad about once a week, bringing my daughter there, though now it’s gone up to 3 or 4 days a week. My mom sees him about once a week, though the two of them are divorced and get into fights on a pretty regular basis, mainly due to my mom’s personality issues really. My brother’s pretty immature for a 34 year old, and he’s also obsessive about a lot of things. He spends a ton of time looking in the mirror and obsessing about his appearance. He had a nose job when he was younger and he tells me, on and off, that he’s going to get another one because they didn’t make it small enough. More than anything, he’s extremely scattered. He loses things all the time, misses appointments, and can’t manage bills. He started taking Adderall for his ADHD a few years ago, and it was around that time that he decided that he was going to launch his own startup company and make an a children’s storybook app. This involved renting out an office by my dad’s house (while unemployed), taking questionably legal advantage of free interns via craigslist ads, and for over a year costing my dad at least twice of what he normally costs him, which is a lot. My brother has since stopped taking the Adderall and the startup company has since mostly fallen apart, though he’s still saying that he’s going to release this app soon. The app, like many other aspects of my brother’s life, reminds me of that door in the Shining that kept getting further away the more the woman ran towards it. It’s been “just about finished” for maybe two years now, and before the app even, my brother had been telling me for years that he’s just going to work on (fill in the blank) for a little while longer, and if that doesn’t work out he’s going to just get a job and work on a career. One reason I think moving into my dad’s will be good is that it might break the codependency that he and my brother have. My brother has been staying in my mom’s garage pretty much since I moved out. I have been there a lot because it is closer to my job than my dad’s, and because I am fixing up the garage, trying to entice my brother into staying there. I have made the garage extremely comfortable, having moved in my 70 inch TV, a mini-fridge, internet, etc, and my brother found himself a full time job at minimum wage about 5 minutes away from my mom’s. My mom is on board with having her garage taken over and wants my brother to live there for the same reasons I do. But as I’m seeing my dad and brother more, I have realized the crazy extent of my brother’s mooching. In the past week, I’ve seen that my brother has called my dad at least five times, each time asking him to wire at least $100 into his account for one reason or another, and each time my dad’s done it. I would probably estimate that my brother costs my dad at least $2,000 dollars a month. I’ve talked to my dad before about the possibility of cutting my brother off or least having a small set amount that he gives him each month. My dad says that he’s planning to eventually do that but won’t simply cut him off immediately, because he thinks that my brother would end up homeless. He’s also told me that if it weren’t for my brother’s costs he would be retired now. This is frustrating to know, especially seeing the way my brother frivolously spends. He wastes tons of gas, buys tons of trivial toys that he clearly doesn’t need, he’s even adopting a child in some third world country at $80 a month. Don’t get me wrong, that’s a great thing to do, but not when it’s someone else’s money you’re spending. My dad often talks about his own budget concerns and I doubt he would do that himself. The other day my brother was over and couldn’t find his pen for his Wacom tablet, and after looking around for it for about 15 minutes he decided that the dog must have gotten it and so he called my dad saying that he needed $100 to buy a new one, and my dad wired him money for it. 15 minutes tops he looked around for that thing and I’m willing to bet the dog didn’t take it.


My mother: My mother is smart and has several very good qualities, but she has some odd emotional issues and a definite drinking problem. She’s can get high strung, often has very low patience, and at certain times is pretty much impossible to avoid getting into an argument with. I have a much better, or at least calmer relationship with her than my brother does, and don’t argue much with her these days, but I think that’s partly because I’ve learned how to deal with her. She doesn’t really get outright hostile, but often is very passive aggressive and talks to people in a very insulting, sarcastic tone of voice. She was adopted into a family that neglected her, and she can’t really seem to get along with anybody for a long period of time without fighting with them and thinking that they’re being abusive or manipulative in some way, when usually that person is simply responding to her defensiveness. She’s pretty quick to get very, very defensive over nothing. She’s also pretty intrusive and controlling. It’s hard to fully relax in her presence because she’s always liable to start commanding you around in a very bossy tone. She also has a tendency to over worry, and she treats her children like children, often referring to me or my brother as “my little baby” or something along those lines, talking to us in the tone that a mother would be talking to her infant child, and I think that’s kind of weird


Anyway, that’s about all I have to say about all that."
2hbqcp,3,2014-09-24,[PI] The Man in Blue - 1ML CONTEST ENTRY,chrisman190,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2hbqcp/pi_the_man_in_blue_1ml_contest_entry/,"Let me tell you about the man in blue, the smartest man I have ever met. Most of our meetings are unplanned, random encounters and not prearranged events. Noticing him at a restaurant I am sitting in, beside me on the beach, stumbling through a forest, I give him my full attention. Over the years he has shared with me countless stories, his thoughts and ideas, musing and ramblings and I write these down. Prior to this I worked in an office doing administrative duties, faxing, filing, photocopying, work I was destined to do. Quite simply the man in blue has changed my life. Renowned across the world for my writings which have been translated into twenty-seven languages, I can celebrate two of the stories are currently having the screenplays drafted - screenplays of the man in blue's work!

So I'm telling you the man in blue has told me everything I have ever published; I am just a fraud taking his glory, and if my secret was ever revealed I would be ruined. That underneath this guise of a writer is a kid that was bottom of his English class, a fact that has been overstated in newspaper articles and television snippets based on hope and an underdog coming through in the end.

Unless I could come up with a way with a way of getting some time back, away from the demands of young children, meeting the man in blue would become more difficult with every expectant baby into our fecund household. Vasectomy, the surgical cutting or blocking of the sperm tube to cause sterilisation, as the doctor talked me through this a week ago, will hopefully be part of the answer.  With all young children the most common side effects are lack of sleep, time and money; however my wife has yet to learn about my procedure. 

Xanax or similar benzodiazepines are the only things that relax me these days, but despite that and my exponential fame, my anxiety grows. Yet I still maintain the facade, the fame orgasmic, the money relieving, the praise never enough to satisfy, so I pray he never tells the world of the truth. Zero awaits; in my future if I am ever discovered, and in the talent I display with the amount of original words I have put into those books with my name fraudulently printed on the front cover.

Awakening in a cold sweat, I've been having been dreaming myself in a courtroom, with twelve pairs of judging eyes facing me and the man in blue at the witness stand, calling me what I am, a plagiarist.

""But it wasn't like that!""

Crying out, I am dragged from the courtroom for repeated disruption of the session. Dark moments cross my mind from the past, thoughts that I will never see him again. Eight months is the longest we have gone without a meeting and during that time my writing had ground to a halt.  

From my simple background I rose to unexpected heights, and I have everything to lose from revealing my secret. God knows, I regularly shake at my desk, pen in hand, trembling over an unmarked piece of paper, wondering when I shall next see him. He has no distinguishable features, this man in blue; I wouldn't know how to begin describing him but I always know when he is there.

If I don't meet the man in blue sometime soon I will have to return to work again, back to the copies and copies, the telephone calls and meetings, the plastic potted plants, the starched white shirts. Judgmental interns at Christmas parties question me as to why I haven't released any new material recently and guffaw when I tell them I just can't think of any ideas at the moment.

Keeping awake is growing harder now as I continue to start at the blank page; I hope I see the man in blue tonight after what has been an awful long time."
2hcsgm,10,2014-09-24,Should I do IVF #5 now plus a small rant (possible trigger-miscarriage mentioned),bxchica84,infertility,https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/2hcsgm/should_i_do_ivf_5_now_plus_a_small_rant_possible/,"So, as everyone knows IVF 4 failed. I'm meeting with my Dr on Oct 7th to discuss the IVF. I feel like a lot went wrong with my medications. I also have a concern of my uterus not wanting to keep any embryos in it. Now here is when I'm at. I started Grad school. IVF 4 had perfect timing where if I did conceive my due date would be after the spring semester ends, perfect timing. Next year when I start up in the fall I have to start an internship that will be for both fall and spring semester. Therefore I would not be able to take any time off from school next year. I'm so tired of waiting, IVF #3 was in 2009 and we waited till 2014 to try again due to insurance issues/work issues. I want to just go and try again as soon as possible. But since I'm seeing my RE after my October menstrual therefore we would have to wait till November. This will mean if i do conceive my due date will be in August and I would be starting school one month after giving birth. Logically the best thing to do is wait till July of next year so that if I conceive I'll spend the whole 9 months finishing school. So do I do the logical thing or just do the emotional thing??? 
And I also feel like a horrible person. My husband's friend and coworker knew we were doing IVF and was asking a lot of questions to my husband. Well it turned out his wife was pregnant with baby #2 and he was hoping that we would be pregnant together. When my husband told me this I just cried why they get baby #2 when we still haven't had one. And she had surgery to remove scar tissue before baby #1 and after the surgery got pregnant naturally. She also conceived baby #2 naturally. Made me even more jealous, my surgery took out my tubes. Now here is where I am a horrible person, she miscarried at 1 month. While I feel so horrible for her, I wish miscarriages on no one; a part of me is a little relieved that I don't have to watch another pregnancy. I feel like a horrible person. 

Thank you all for listening to my rants.

2hcxa5,2,2014-09-24,Reapplying to Udub. What is your opinion?,Paraboliod,CollegeAdmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissions/comments/2hcxa5/reapplying_to_udub_what_is_your_opinion/,"Hi, Here is my story
I applied to UW for fall 2014. But, I was denied admission. I talked to one of the advisors and expressed that I was thinking about reapplying. Besides applying to Udub, I applied at WSU and WWU and was able admitted. The reason why I didn't go to both of those schools is because I am majoring in Mechanical engineering. WSU has a great program, but I would have to go to Pullman. And WWU doesn't have Mechanical engineering, but they just started Electrical engineering. So, What I decided was to reapplying to Udub one more time. And also apply at Seattle U which I didn't do last time and for my third option, I would apply for the WSU-everett Mechanical Engineering program. The WSU-everett program( everett is really close to Seattle and my hometown) was full for 2014 fall so they said that they can let me into the program for 2015. So, I thought since I am waiting a year, why not reapply to Udub one more time. Udub advisor asked me to participate in the engineering club and also focus on finding an internship. So, this past summer, besides working 40 hours, I worked to teach myself Catia V5, solidworks 2014 and AutoCAD. 
My GPA is 3.0, which is probably why I wasn't admitted to the program. But, the reason why my GPA is that is because, when I first started college I had no idea what is going on. I am a first generation college student. Also I moved to US when I was 17, so it took me a while to work on my communication skills while I was learning the American Culture. All, my close friends while I was in college were quitting college and either driving truck and some where getting into drugs. But, I kept working and finally started making friends in Science and Mathematics classes. Those guys helped me figure out the different schools that I can apply to and from them I learned about engineering. 
Also, The last four quarters I have been getting all As, in all the higher level classes such as Engineering Physics series, Statics, Dynamics, Mechanics of Materials, Matlab, Calculus 3 and 4, differentials equations and Sequences and series. I have been on the Dean's List for last two quarters. 
I am wondering what do you guys think?

2hd98g,2,2014-09-24,[21/M] Insupportive of my girlfriend (21/F)? Internship abroad.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2hd98g/21m_insupportive_of_my_girlfriend_21f_internship/,"So we are in a relationship for over one year, we already have established a long-distance relationship (she comes to visit once per 3 months I come back to my hometown for Christmas, Easter and 2 summer months). We had our ups and downs but we always found a way to solve our differences and I really love her. 

She wants to apply for an internship abroad (she hasn't decided which country yet) and wants to have a conversation with me about it. Being a moron in the past telling her what to do using some kind of pressure I felt bad and said to her

""You can do whatever you want to do, go wherever you want to go and have your internship for as long as you want to. I don't know what else is there to discuss about it, I don't want to influence you over your choices"".

After that we had a fight and essentially done the harm I never wanted to do. To sum up what she said, she thinks I'm really not supportive of what she wants to do and that she needs to beg me in some way to have my support.

I really don't know how to show her my support. She wants to go abroad in one year and I don't know how can I be useful to that cause so early. It really hurts me though because the fact that she wants to go abroad just for the experience of going abroad is terrifying to me. I've heard a lot of stories of infidelity and I can't stand that. We have a lot of trust and faith in each other but I feel that she's almost asking me to let her go [not just go abroad, go out of this relationship].

It's weird because I want her happy and I'm ready to support her...

.

This will probably be a very, very long post. I’m not crazy or narcissistic, I just feel this is helpful somehow.

.

I'm a 30 year old single white male with an 8 year old daughter. Aside from my daughter, my family consists of just me, my brother and parents, no other relatives are alive or in the area that we talk to. I have a decent job and I’ve been living either with friends or alone for about 12 years, and I’ve had weekend custody of my daughter her whole life, but that's about to change to full custody. My brother (34) has been living primarily with my dad for the majority of his adult life. Living off my dad, I should say, as my dad has been paying for all of his, often lavish, living expenses. I think the best way to get this down might be to break my family up into groups.

.

**My daughter and her mother:** My daughter and I are close, she is the highlight of my life and she is smart, sweet, and wonderful. I met her mother at my job when I was 19, and aside from ending up with a daughter that I love, getting involved with the mother was a huge mistake. I was young and naive. She's what a lot of people would call a ""ghetto hood rat."" She has a great personality in a lot of ways, but more than anything she is chaotic, prone to losing her temper, and prone to making bad decisions. My daughter was living with her mother for the first 7 years of her life, and the two moved in with my daughter's mother's mother about four years ago. I had a verbal agreement of getting my daughter on the weekends (her mother and I couldn't make the relationship work, having tried and failed several times). Daughter's mother was mostly unemployed, living off child support and welfare, but had also gotten involved with someone who made money through a fake charity fraud, and was living off that as well.

.

Perhaps no surprise, she had also become an addict. She took Norcos, a high strength form of Vicodin, at first for back problems but soon recreationally. She was open about taking them for her back, but soon it became obvious that she was taking more and more. She would create ""emergencies"" and use my daughter as a way of getting me to give her much more than the $600 per month I paid in child support, saying things like we're out of food, I need gas money/ bus money or I’ll miss this job interview, ect. These emergencies became increasingly frequent and her behavior was getting increasing erratic and hostile, and she was already a pretty erratic and hostile person, with me at least. 

.

After discussing the situation with people and putting some thought into it, I decided that I should stop giving her additional money, as I was clearly just enabling her drug habit. Meanwhile, I was saving to eventually hire a lawyer to attempt to get increased or full custody, though I was beginning to realize that a father getting full custody is extremely difficult in California, not to mention extremely expensive. Part of my plan, honestly, was also to wait for her to make a huge mistake and end up in jail or something, likely by getting into a fight with a friend or boyfriend. Despite her chaos, she was always pretty good with our daughter though. She was warm and nurturing with her, hadn’t lost her temper or hit her or anything, and hadn't yet put her in any risk or danger through negligence. 

.

Then one day she called me with one of her typical emergency situations. It was on a Saturday evening during my daughter’s winter break from school. I had my daughter and was scheduled to bring her back that night and then go to work (I work graveyard shift). It was 11th hour and she told me that she needed $100 for food for the week, otherwise I would need to keep my daughter for the rest of the week, knowing that that would be really hard to manage on short notice. I went back and forth with her for a while about it (I make sure my daughter doesn’t overhear these conversations), and eventually called the grandmother and told her about the situation. She told me to just bring my daughter there, said there was plenty of food in the house and she could look after her. The grandmother’s a lot more reasonable and knows all about her daughter’s tendencies. 

.

A little while after bringing my daughter there, I got a call from my daughter’s mother, who was furious. She told me that she had picked my daughter up and brought her to her friend’s house down the street (where she was now crashing at about half the time). She said her mother couldn’t watch her, and said that if I didn’t wire her money or pick my daughter up immediately she was going to drive my daughter to a park somewhere and leave her there. She told me this on the phone and via text messages, and at this point I had installed a call recording app as means to get more evidence for custody, so I decided to call in sick to work and go there and get the police involved. Immediately after emailing work I got a text from her saying that she’d just kicked my daughter out of the house and sent her walking. I called the grandmother who was already on the phone with the police. My daughter had run to her house screaming and crying. I drove there immediately and picked my daughter up. 

.

Her grandmother and I then went through the long process of getting CPS involved, who took about a month to even get the ball rolling on anything. I told the grandmother that I didn’t want to bring my daughter back to her school until it was illegal for her mother to come get her, so I worked it out with my parents to keep her with me over at their places for about a month. This actually proved to be a pretty wise decision, because the principal later told me that my daughter’s mother had been going there almost daily looking for her, and legally they would have had to let her take her.  

.

After many meetings with CPS, they decided to place my daughter into temporary foster care custody with her grandmother, and would give re-unification programs to both me and her mother, though mine would be much easier and have many less requirements. I was OK with temporary custody for the grandmother, as I was living with roommates and needed a little time to move out, not to mention change my shift at work, but CPS’s justification for not giving me immediate full custody was that they believed that I didn’t do enough to protect my daughter from her mother and try to contact authorities or get custody. I strongly disagree with that decision, as before this incident I didn’t have any hard proof that she was on drugs, I had no smoking guns for a custody case, and any attempt to gain custody would have likely backfired and resulted in minimal custody (weekends, which I already had) and caused retaliation from the mother. 

.

This is getting to be an incredibly long post, so to finalize this part, I’ve now moved out and I am in the process of moving in with my dad, as it’s the only way to make full custody work immediately with my graveyard schedule and CPS’s requirements. I currently take my daughter there about 4 days a week and should be getting full custody within 6 months. My brother is moving out of my dad’s and into my mom’s garage, and right now the two of us are sort of living at both parent’s houses.

.

**My brother and dad:** My brother is 34, he’s an art major and has a degree, but has mostly been unemployed his entire adult life and has mostly been living at my dad’s. He and my dad have a codependent relationship, they are both pretty socially isolated and in some ways socially inept. My dad is 73 and is still working, mainly just to support my brother. Neither my dad, nor my brother really have any friends, and it’s me and my mom’s suspicion that my dad wants my brother to remain dependent on him out of fear of being alone. I see my dad about once a week, bringing my daughter there, though now it’s gone up to 3 or 4 days a week. My mom sees him about once a week, though the two of them are divorced and get into fights on a pretty regular basis, mainly due to my mom’s personality issues really. My brother’s pretty immature for a 34 year old, and he’s also obsessive about a lot of things. He spends a ton of time looking in the mirror and obsessing about his appearance. He had a nose job when he was younger and he tells me, on and off, that he’s going to get another one because they didn’t make it small enough. More than anything, he’s extremely scattered. He loses things all the time, misses appointments, and can’t manage bills. 

.

He started taking Adderall for his ADHD a few years ago, and it was around that time that he decided that he was going to launch his own startup company and make an a children’s storybook app. This involved renting out an office by my dad’s house (while unemployed), taking questionably legal advantage of free interns via craigslist ads, and for over a year costing my dad at least twice of what he normally costs him, which is a lot. My brother has since stopped taking the Adderall and the startup company has since mostly fallen apart, though he’s still saying that he’s going to release this app soon. 

.

The app, like many other aspects of my brother’s life, reminds me of that door in the Shining that kept getting further away the more the woman ran towards it. It’s been “just about finished” for maybe two years now, and before the app even, my brother had been telling me for years that he’s just going to work on (fill in the blank) for a little while longer, and if that doesn’t work out he’s going to just get a job and work on a career. 

.

One reason I think moving into my dad’s will be good is that it might break the codependency that he and my brother have. My brother has been staying in my mom’s garage pretty much since I moved out. I have been there a lot because it is closer to my job than my dad’s, and because I am fixing up the garage, trying to entice my brother into staying there. I have made the garage extremely comfortable, having moved in my 70 inch TV, a mini-fridge, internet, etc, and my brother found himself a full time job at minimum wage about 5 minutes away from my mom’s. My mom is on board with having her garage taken over and wants my brother to live there for the same reasons I do. 

.

But as I’m seeing my dad and brother more, I have realized the crazy extent of my brother’s mooching. In the past week, I’ve seen that my brother has called my dad at least five times, each time asking him to wire at least $100 into his account for one reason or another, and each time my dad’s done it. I would probably estimate that my brother costs my dad at least $2,000 dollars a month. I’ve talked to my dad before about the possibility of cutting my brother off or least having a small set amount that he gives him each month. My dad says that he’s planning to eventually do that but won’t simply cut him off immediately, because he thinks that my brother would end up homeless. He’s also told me that if it weren’t for my brother’s costs he would be retired now. This is frustrating to know, especially seeing the way my brother frivolously spends. He wastes tons of gas, buys tons of trivial toys that he clearly doesn’t need, he’s even adopting a child in some third world country at $80 a month. Don’t get me wrong, that’s a great thing to do, but not when it’s someone else’s money you’re spending. My dad often talks about his own budget concerns and I doubt he would do that himself. The other day my brother was over and couldn’t find his pen for his Wacom tablet, and after looking around for it for about 15 minutes he decided that the dog must have gotten it and so he called my dad saying that he needed $100 to buy a new one, and my dad wired him money for it. 15 minutes tops he looked around for that thing and I’m willing to bet the dog didn’t take it.

.

**My mother:** My mother is smart and has several very good qualities, but she has some odd emotional issues and a definite drinking problem. She can get high strung, often has very low patience, and at certain times is pretty much impossible to avoid getting into an argument with. I have a much better, or at least calmer relationship with her than my brother does, and don’t argue much with her these days, but I think that’s partly because I’ve learned how to deal with her. She doesn’t really get outright hostile, but often is very passive aggressive and talks to people in a very insulting, sarcastic tone of voice. She was adopted into a family that neglected her, and she can’t really seem to get along with anybody for a long period of time without fighting with them and thinking that they’re being abusive or manipulative in some way, when usually that person is simply responding to her defensiveness. She’s pretty quick to get very, very defensive over nothing. She’s also pretty intrusive and controlling. It’s hard to fully relax in her presence because she’s always liable to start commanding you around in a very bossy tone. She also has a tendency to over worry, and she treats her children like children, often referring to me or my brother as “my little baby” or something along those lines, talking to us in the tone that a mother would be talking to her infant child, and I think that’s kind of weird

.

Anyway, that’s about all I have to say about all that.

As you read on the title I'm closing Dogeeshop.com, it makes me kind of sad.

I remember when we just started, we were like the 3rd dogecoin eshop over here.
I'm more like a silent shibe who reads all the threads but is afraid to comment. So the admin's where thinking I was a scam.

It was a good run guy's, That's why I want to say thank you to all of you.
You are such an wonderful community, who trusted a guy from nowhere.
Without your support I would not have been interested in cryptos.

And because I did I found a awesome internship on a startup specialized on doge, ltc and bitcoin.

So, yes my story badly written, like all my post's, but the point is I owe you some hamburgers, pizzas and my awesome internship, and I wanted to tell you thank you so much.


PS: If you think you can handle the eshop or you want the domain, and you think having enough WOW PM me.

You are amazing !!

What should I learn?,[deleted],dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/2hduva/want_a_aspnet_mvc_job_after_i_graduate_what/,"I will be graduating in less than a year with a degree in Computer Science.  I have worked an internship using C# and ASP.NET (not MVC) and currently have a job maintaining a PHP site on a Windows 2008r2 Web Server with IIS7.  I like C# a lot and have an interest in ASP.NET MVC.  So, I am hoping than once I graduate I can get a job doing it.

But, I don't want to work at any ole .NET shop.  I would like to work somewhere that practices TDD and agile development.  I would also like to work somewhere that designs good software.  No spaghetti code.  It would also be nice if they were ""modern,"" using later versions of MVC (4 or 5) and what not.

I believe that some of these places will have higher standards than average and that's where my problem begins.  I don't know the .NET ecosystem very well.  I have been developing PHP using Laravel, on a Mac, for a while now.

What are some of the acronyms that I should be reading up on and what do those acronyms mean?  What technologies related to ASP.NET MVC should I be learning?  Is there specific software I should learn?  Is a year enough time to gain the knowledge I need?

Oh, last, but not least:  can I use VIM?

Thanks.

EDIT:  Forgot to mention.  If there are any resources that would help in learning any of this stuff, I would appreciate it (prefer videos but not adverse to books)"

Neither of us have progressed really far in the company, with our combined income we live comfortably though in a 1/1 apartment with our 2 cats.

Since we got married, and even before that a little, we have been wondering how we will handle having children. We don't plan on even beginning to try for at least another 6 months, but it hasn't stopped us from talking about it. The biggest snag we come across is that we dont have any kind of support network here. No family and no friends close enough that we could rely on them for that sort of thing (I realize this could change by the time we have children, but the population here is very transient so its hard). The idea has come up recently to move to Kansas City with my family so that we could have the support that we would be missing here. Her family lives in the Chicagoland area, and we just don't want to deal with that cold.

We don't love Orlando, but we do love Disney World. We love the perks of working here (free admission to the parks, cheap cruises, job security, benefits, etc...). Orlando as a city has never appealed to either of us, and we have agreed on numerous occasions that we wouldn't live here if not for Disney.

There are a lot of pros and cons to each location, and I will go into more details on them in the comments if they are asked. This gives you the gist of the situation though, I didn't leave out anything critical. It really boils down to: Kansas City has support network, Orlando has lifestyle we enjoy.

**TL;DR**  
So this leaves us with this question:

Move to Kansas City to be near family and have a network of people to support us in our efforts to grow our family.

Or

Stay in Orlando where we enjoy our current jobs (even if the pay isn't fantastic) and try to raise a family here without a support network.

-Doc's custom gaming computers, and his upcoming project that he says had a budget of 5 or 6 figures.

-Beef's sponsorship from Xbox and Microsoft for the new Forza Horizon 2 game, and the corresponding reality show-esque trip across Europe

-Sethbling hiring Dr. Brian to do the monotonous and repetitive redstone work in his complicated machines, gadgets, and gizmos

-BdoubleO looking for someone to do editting for him so he can potentially record more content and spend more time with his family

What are everyone's thoughts on this? Are you excited? Do you think they're becoming too mainstream and selling out? Do you feel like this is a step that has been needed for a while? Are you hoping all the Mindcrackers move into Guude's new house and start their own reality show?"

A discussion, mainly directed at pre-college, current students, and post-graduates. Many thanks to r/personalfinance :) Triumphant Thursday!",ultraLORD91,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2hel6p/the_importance_of_family_and_of_working_your_butt/,"**Today I officially have no debt.** I am four months out of college with no debt! It is great and feels good to not be a slave to the debtor. Anyways, here was the situation, and I had to share to encourage those who are near, in, or out of school to keep working hard and not quit.

2010-14: 30k a year for college for a total of 4 years equaling ~120k

2012-14:  18k truck over two years 

Note: No I did not pay all of my debt myself but also with the help of scholarships totaling about 16k over four years and parents and grandparents helped pay for part of college. This is where the importance of family kicks in. Sorry to those who aren't bless with a family to help them pay for higher education :( The truck I paid off all by myself. And sorry I didn't direct this post at people who don't go to college.

**My advice. Work your butt off before, during, and after college and live with your parent's as long as you deem necessary. Sounds crazy I know. Be thrifty, keep a budget, and dedicate all if not a majority of your income to paying off your debt.** 

* Before College

I always had a summer job and even worked part time sometimes during the school year. Yes it sucked sometimes when your friends want you to come over and spend the night and you have to get up early to go to work I know. Over four summers and school year in highschool you can easily save somewhere in the range of 15k-20k if you are working hard and getting above minimum wage. My advice here would be to ask grandparents beforehand if they think college is important and if they would be willing to lend or even better chip in! It doesn't hurt and may even get them excited or proud to know that their grand kid is going to State University of SuperIntellects and that they didn't have the chance to do it so they are going to help you do it! On the side apply for scholarships and grants like its your job. Besides this your're still at home so life is good financially!

* During College

Get a part time job if you are a full time student. Once again try not to settle for minimum wage if you can. I was a furniture delivery guy. Classic college job I know. And I was also able to be a TA part time at the college. This pays the bills for food and fun. Budget though! Beer is good but do you need to be buying that craft beer or really expensive organic food! Same with frozen! Its usually a rip off in my opinion. Buy food that can make multiple meals like potatoes or raw chicken. Ask yourself these questions about money constantly. Then during the summer if your job does not require you to do internships which in my opinion can be good and bad... Get a job you slob! You are a college student now and are hopefully responsible! Businesses expect this of you and prove it! Don't be arrogant about manual labor either. Sometimes manual labor jobs pay better and allow you to get a good work out, tan, and breath of fresh air. You should be able to make anywhere from 4-10k a summer depending on the job! Also keep applying for scholarships. There are a lot out there from your school that only juniors or seniors can get. Most people forget this. You're still partially at home so things are annoying at first because your parents are back on your case but financially they are still alright, you're broke but at least you have a place to come home to and eat some food :0

* After College

Now is the time to make it count. You have no expenses. You live at home with your controlling parents but hey rent and food are free(hopefully)! You decide how much you're going to spend on entertainment! Budget! You're most likely broke and in debt. What do you do? You get a job. Easier said than done. It is your job to get a job. Get up on time, don't sleep in and if possible get a part time job while looking for work. You're qualified, its just a matter of time. Once you have a job take the first paycheck. This is your spending money for the next 6-12 months depending on how you do. I was making about $1300 every two weeks. That money lasted me six months! Thankfully my job was close to where I live so gas was not a huge expense for me. Now put every other check that you make towards your debt. Mine was my truck and college debt. Hopefully at this point your parents and grand parents have seen the importance of helping you pay for college and have helped! If they did, pass it on forward to your kids in the future. Now slowly but surely your debt will dwindle and become zero as your are putting your entire paycheck towards your debt. Forget the post college road trip and Europe trip, those places will always be there! Get a job and work your butt while you live your parents. Then get your investments going! RothIRA yes please! It sucks to be stuck with them at home sometimes but financially in the long run it will make your more financially secure.

2helsd,1,2014-09-25,My senior year of college has me worried about my sanity.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2helsd/my_senior_year_of_college_has_me_worried_about_my/,"I intend to graduate next spring, but I'm taking 6 classes (19 credits) this semester, and will have to do the same next semester to meet all of my degree (Csci) requirements. They're all upper division classes; there are plenty of grad students in them. Thus, I'm being held to a bit of a higher standard than I'm used to. 

None of the classes I need would be offered in the summer, so another semester would delay graduation by about 7 months. 7 months where I could be making a good salary, instead of an intern's.

My school has a policy where 13+ credits are required per semester, but anything beyond that is free. Which is a huge incentive to pile on credits; but I'm always behind, and just working on whatever is most immediate. 

I have a math class that is just 4 tests and a final. That means I don't do any work for it, because there are always more pressing issues. Now, I have my first test on Friday, and I literally haven't studied once.

Add on to that, I need to work at least 25-30hrs/week at my internship to pay rent and other living costs. 

And I'm moving house this weekend. Which involves paying October's rent and a security deposit...AND I have to pay for October at my current apartment, because I'm a dumbass who doesn't know how to read a lease and didn't give the contractual 90 day notice (I gave 60).

I haven't seen my friends in about two weeks. 

This summer I was working out 4-5 days a week, and running about 15 miles. That stopped September 2nd.

I don't know if I can do this, but I have to try. It all reminds me though of my most recent semester from hell (last fall). Around finals, I just wanted to curl up in bed and cry. I felt both numb and a huge weight in my chest. Now I feel like that everyday, and I've still got 3 months left...And then another 4 after winter break. 

Fuck, I need to get on Adderall immediately."

I never liked living in the middle east. If I had to write the reasons, it would take a couple of books to write them all down. And frankly the only thing I ever liked there is my friends. I feel trapped in this country and in my own home. I always felt like there is something wrong with this way of living, even before I started travelling, but once I started studying in Europe I found out how behind the middle east really is.


Anyway, it was the hardest thing having to leave and knowing that I cannot afford buying a 400 euro ticket each time I want to visit him, and even if I could afford it, I would not get a visa that easily or that cheap. Good thing is that I have to go back to finish some papers in February.


PROBLEM: We do skype at least once a day. we supposedly broke up the other day because it would make us sad to not be together, and it would be easier if we were friends, (but we will always keep the light on for a future relationship). I cant seem to handle either of these options. It's too hard to see him on the other side of the screen and it's making me sad. I still haven't found anyone more fun than him to talk to either, he made me see myself in a better way and life as more innocent and free. He seems to be handling it better, moved to a new place and met new people. I want him to be happy but I am still trying to find a way to get to him (internship, job).


Question:I just need advise if I should break the connection or keep trying to move there... I have no idea. I can write more details if necessary.

10 days later she came asking me back, I was in a really depressed at the time so I took her back without questions. That was when I started acting like a needy unsecure beta. Our relationship wasn't good at this point but it was in the right path, until her mother got diagnosed with cancer and she started acting like she didn't care for the relationship.

We broke up because I was going on an internship for 5 months and things weren't going well (she said she wasn't sure what she felt about me) . 

But after 4 days I got a message saying I lost the internship so now its been 1 month since we broke up and I want her back because I realized that she wanted to come back to an alpha and i acted like damn beta. But if I go after her she'll see me as a desperate beta but if I don't she won't see that I changed and the only thing she'll remember when she thinks of me is my needy beta side.

What do you guys think I should do? I know I sound like I'm suffering from Oneitis but I just don't want 8 years to end because of circumstances and me acting like a beta when we got back together."

I was great at my job, received many praises and was given a lot of projects even though i was not technically qualified to do them. I got a lot of amazing feedback throughout my employment. I worked there for a little over a year, but we're cutting a lot of jobs and unfortunately I was part of that group. They offered to keep me through an agency but it would of resulted in a huge pay cut for me (about 9$/h). They also helped me find another job in another department before my contract ended. 

That's where it all begins. The place that hired me seemed amazing at first. It was mostly men I worked with (which I'm used too) and they made me feel welcome. Right away I could tell they we're impressed with my technical skills since I was given a lot of freedom and whenever I received feedback it was to tell me I did a great job. Over the weeks, things started shifting. A new guy started (which I knew previously) and I realized that boss #1 was way more friendly with him and he ever was with me. They would sit there and chat for hours while I'd be working right next to them and pretty much ignored me. 

Over the weeks, this boss #1 became more and more hostile towards me. Would not talk to me unless it was work related, would pretty much give things to do to other employees even though I was available.  There was talks about me getting a term position there (benefits) and I asked him if I was still considered for the position. He said I was. Over the weeks the hostility became even more present to a point where I felt I had to find another job. I told him that I was offered a contract in another department and he told me that they were still planning on offering me a term position at the end of my current contract, so I decided to stay.

At the beginning of September I asked boss #2 (which was away for a month) about the term position and he seemed surprise that I asked since it was decided that they would not open the position after all. I told him that I confronted Boss #1 about it a couple weeks earlier and he felt awful since he was not part of the decision of not keeping me. He offered to give me great references and that if any job opportunities came his way to refer them to me.

I met with a co-worker for coffee a couple weeks ago and he told me that since he’s been working here (5 years) only one girl stuck around. Whenever they hired women they never lasted long and I feel like it’s the same deal with me. For the first time in my life I feel like being a woman stopped me from accomplishing something great in my work environment and it makes me so sad. I’m actually worried about finding other jobs in the same field (IT) and I’m very worried things like this are likely to happen again.

Thanks for taking the time to read this long post, English isn’t my first language so sorry for all the typos..

TLDR; Got a job in IT as a woman, feels like I’m being treated unfairly because of it.

Advice please?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hga7v/21f_cheated_on_my_new_boyfriend_24m_with_my/,"Throwaway since my friends know about my main account.

I dated my ex for ~3 years. Great relationship, can talk about anything, his family loves me. We've experimented with open relationships and I had the green light to explore. Met my current bf shortly before leaving for 3 months for an internship. We moved quickly and decided to date. I told the now ex all about it and told him I needed space to explore this and told him he could see others. 

Fast forward after the 3 months period. The LDR with the current bf started to get strained because of the distance. I told him we should hold off till I get back. Once I got back things were a little strange between us and it took a few weeks to get comfortable around each other again. In the meantime I had sex with my ex twice. He wanted it and I went along with it. I didn't want to disappoint him. I still care about him and don't want him to feel bad or upset. I stopped once me and the current became official again.

That was until last night. The situation is all my fault. Some of my things are still at the ex's. I went over to take care of it. At one point I was bent over…my ex came up behind me and pulled my pants down, pulled his dick out, and without a word we had sex like that for a few minutes. The whole time all I could think about was why am I not saying no? This is wrong the current would be upset and I don't want this. I was in shock at first but I still was in control, I should have done something. Now it's the next day and all I want to do is cry. I talked to my ex and told him it could never happen again, he understands. I REALLY don't want to tell my current. It would hurt him and I would lose him forever and our friends would hate me. I don't like having secrets from who I'm dating but I think this is something I can't make myself come clean to. Please, give me advice. I'm a long time lurker and now I'm the one that needs help.

TL;DR Cheated last night on my bf with my ex. I REALLY don't want to tell him. It won't EVER happen again. Is it okay to forget it and move on?"
2hgvss,10,2014-09-25,"Just got home after almost 15 months of treatment, living with my parents and they don't trust me at all",DreamwingTheDruid,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/2hgvss/just_got_home_after_almost_15_months_of_treatment/,"Edit: I'm an 18-year-old gay male.

Rewriting this cause the first draft was so long I didn't think anyone would read it.

It all stems from an incident last year, before treatment. I had just started coming out and being more comfortable with my sexuality. We were in California, I was talking with a guy on Grindr , he came to the hotel and picked me up, he took me to his house, he banged, and he dropped me off back at the hotel. He was 37 and I was 17. When I left, everyone had been of doing their own thing, but when I got back, they asked questions and I bullshitted about where I had been. I'm not good at lying and don't like to do so, and when my sister took my phone while I was in the shower and started snooping around, she found Grindr and the texts and blah blah blah. My parents confronted me and I told them everything. They were livid, but not too much came from it since I went to treatment less than two weeks later.   
  
I admit it is not a good idea to have a stranger take you to his house out of state and not tell anyone where you are going. My penis clouded my judgment. Though I was very cautious and if I had noticed anything suspicious I would have immediately broke off contact while talking, not met up with him, or left without a word etc. I insisted on condoms and refused poppers. I did minimize risks a bit. I thought thing would have changed after all the good work I did over the past 15 months: learned to manage anxiety and depression, lived in an apartment with two roommates, completed high school, held an internship, got off my meds, further honed my emotional abilities, became much more patient, preparing to go to college, etc.  
 
But they hover more than ever. If my phone vibrates, my mom asks who I am talking to. If I leave the house, if I don't tell her exactly what I'm doing and how long it will take, she starts asking who I am going to meet. If I'm in the bathroom and I don't pick up the home phone when she calls, she texts me asking where I am and who I am with. She constantly tries to see what I'm doing on my phone or computer. She won't leave me at home for over an hour and even when I am home she constantly checks in on me. My dad isn't nearly as overt, but he supports her. My brother took my car for the winter since I was gone and I have to be taken everywhere by my parents. My town is small and nothing is in walking distance. I have no friends. My mom says I need to leave the house more, but still acts like the gatekeeper. I am taking classes at the local college, and yet I have to be dropped off by my mom. I just feel so unbelievably trapped, especially since I had just been living in an apartment in Puerto Rico and had so much freedom. 
 
But the hardest part is that I can't just tell them that I won't meet up with any guys (and normally it is just to meet or a mini-date, not NSA sex), because I'm not good at lying. And all I want, more than anything in the world right now, is to feel the embrace of another man. A hand on my chest or shoulder fills me with electricity that I can't experience anywhere else. I have felt as though my heart is ash, and my veins are filled only with cold sand for all my life. I desire that warmth. It fills my every waking thought. 
 
When I said to my parents a few days ago that I was going on a date with someone, we started to have a conversation/argument. To break it down, they think it's inappropriate to have a relationship with anyone who is not 18 (my age), that men are too dangerous, it's too risky to meet anyone you haven't met in person, etc. They are pretty conservative, and I can hear from the way they speak and craft their sentences and the words etched in their faces that they are trying to be accepting of their son, but they don't want him to be with another man. 
  
My therapists and life coaches always told me ""it gets better."" And I know this. But that doesn't help me in the now, where the pain takes place. I have no support network. I feel caged and as though my wings have been clipped. This is all so much harder when you're alone and I don't know what to do.

Thank you if you got this far, I appreciate it immensely."
2hh804,3,2014-09-25,"Me [24M] with my ex-GF [22F] of 5 months, she wants to keep the baby and have her family in another state pay for it all",throwawayABC1236,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hh804/me_24m_with_my_exgf_22f_of_5_months_she_wants_to/,"tl;dr - A week after our 3rd breakup, ex-gf finds out she's pregnant, quits her job, goes out of state for 3 weeks, wants her extended family to pay for everything, wants me out of the picture, I need advice

Here's a little set up: I was an intern at this firm and started dating the receptionist. She's gorgeous, extremely friendly, and a very positive person in general. I was told it wasn't a great idea to date a co-worker, but I was only there for a 3-month internship while working another job, but there weren't any open positions at the company at the time so I didn't think much of it. Anyways, halfway through the intern semester, I get hired and after the first 3 months of dating each other, we start to fight. I'm not one to fight or even raise my voice at another person, but this is how she communicates when she was sad, angry, insecure, or sometimes even hungry. We broke up and got back to together, broke up and got back together--pretty much over the same things. The last break-up happened because she got to the point where she would throw a fit if I were to hang out with other people (mainly my two best friends). Not my style. This break-up was the real deal and people at work would actually find out about this one. It seemed like a clean break, no yelling or fighting or vicious language. She was broken hearted, but so was I--it was just the right thing to do for our future.

After a few awkward days at the office, things settle down. Everything seems fine. Then, a week later, I get a text for now ex-gf and she tells me she's pregnant. Now, during our relationship, we both agreed that if this were to happen, we'd get an abortion. I have no desire to become a parent and she had the same thought. She tells me that she's getting an abortion and wants me to pay for half. Fine. Perfect. I said I'd help find the right place and go with her. She doesn't want me to go, but wants help finding where to go. So that's what I did. Then, I had to fly out of state for a few days (this was planned for months) for a family thing. And then I got back. I don't know what happened, but she quit her job (gave 1 days notice) and now wants to keep the baby. Oh yeah, and she's leaving in 10 hours to go across the country for 3 weeks.

PROBLEMS HAVE RISEN!

I barely make enough money to support myself, let alone a kid. She says she's really scared that she'll regret the abortion and go down a path of substance abuse. She also hates me to my core now--she believes I lied to her about my love for her, she feels abandoned, lonely, and that we only broke up because of her hormones were crazy because of pregnancy. She also told me that if this was a stranger's baby she would abort no problem, and that if we were together she would abort without hesitation. She also wants me to have no part in raising the baby and thinks that her loaded extended family (grandma, uncle and aunt) will pay for everything and these things ""have a way of working out, people make it work."" 

So, my problem is if she does have the baby, I have an obligation to raise it and I can't pay for it. Her plan is ridiculous, but there is no rationalizing costs with her because ""poor people make it work all the time."" I think that she wants to have the baby to somehow trap me in a relationship with her or have something to remind her of our relationship or something as equally crazy as that. I know that sounds insane, but she is not thinking clearly at all. I feel like she went off the deep end and I have no idea what to do or say. I'm calling her today to ask WHY she wants to have a baby and to generally just check up on her well being. After all, I do have an immense amount of feelings for her still--we just function horribly as a couple.

One more thing. She smokes a lot a weed and has only cut back since she found out.

Any advice would be great!

(NSFW),Throwsitallaway86,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hi260/i_cant_believe_have_to_do_this_a_third_time_nsfw/,"You and I have been together for over five and a half years. I fell so head over heels for you when we first met. You were a lot of firsts for me. I remember when we kissed for the first time, it was the moment I knew for sure that I was gay. And I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the day. You were the first man I ever truly loved. We were there for each other when we came out to our families, and we helped each other through some tough times. 

But the past few years have been rough for us as a couple. I remember when we first started dating you asked me if I would regret not dating other people before throwing myself into a serious relationship with you. I told you I would have no regrets. And at the time I meant it. You were all I ever wanted. I even tried proposing to you after 3 months of dating. Not that I was foolish (I was a little), I was so in love. I still have no regrets about our relationship. But we were always long distance for several years. Me moving to another state for an internship. You being in school for another couple years. Then I had a job where I traveled 25 days a month. Once I had settled on a job where I was home a lot more, I noticed the cracks forming. The typical things couples go through when moving in and spending more time together. But little things like watching TV together. You never sat with me, and we don't like the same shows. You make fun of my music, and I can't stand yours. You support my hobbies, but I wish you had one of your own. I tried to shrug it off as all normal parts of a relationship.

But the one thing that really has made us fight more than anything, is our sex life. We have two very different libidos. I was much more upfront and asked for it more. In fact I felt like the only one who was horny and I was always coercing you into having sex with me. I hated that when I touched your penis, you recoiled, or got upset. And I hated that sex was only on your schedule. But I went with it anyway because it wasn't hard to turn me on. When it came to anal, you were so stubborn. I get that some people aren't into it. But you wouldn't even try it for so long. For years, our sex was foreplay, hand job for you, then I masturbate. Finally, recently after one of our fights, you said something that completely broke the relationship for me.

You told me that when you get horny, all you want to do is cuddle. I'm so much more physical than that, and a huge factor in me getting off, is if the other person is enjoying it, and is as passionate in the love making process as I am. Now I know that when we are much more physical in the bedroom I feel that you're only doing it to make me happy and get it over with, and not because you really want to. And that completely turns me off. Sex has never been the same since. I don't want it from you anymore. When you cuddle with me and you poke me with your boner, *I* recoil. 

After quite some time feeling this way, and after my unhappiness was really starting to take its toll. You came home and I sat you down. I looked into your eyes and said ""I want to break up."" I wasn't satisfied with our relationship anymore, physically or emotionally and I wanted to start seeing what else was out there. That regret about not seeing other people before getting serious, resurfaced. I had regrets and that regret started turning into resentment. You were very calm and agreed that the physical aspect of the relationship needed work (same as every other time we've had this argument). 

We decided to try and open up the relationship a little bit, so that my physical needs can be met. No full on sex, but I can make out with guys. I think making out is really hot, and you can tell by the way they kiss, how passionately they're into it. So I went to a bar while I was on a business trip, and a guy approached me. We flirted, he was extremely hot, and we started making out. Holy shit, it was amazing. It was a  combination of the fact that it was someone new, and he was absolutely into it, since he was the one who approached me. It was completely different from what I had felt from you in a long time. I don't remember how long we made out, but my mouth was sore the next day. 

I came home from that trip, told you all about my experience with the other guy. You were fine, and I tried to carry on with business as usual. But I was still unsatisfied with us. Sure my physical needs were being somewhat met elsewhere, but why would I stay with someone who wasn't fulfilling them at home. I don't have a problem with people who are in open relationships. But it's not for me. So for a second time, I broke down and told you how I felt. That this relationship wasn't working, and I needed to move on. 

This time you broke down and cried. You had had a rough week while I was away. Our friend was diagnosed with cancer and you were helping him deal with it. I understand the timing was terrible. But there is no good time to break up with someone. Was I supposed to wait until you were happy again, and then crush your dreams? But again I couldn't stand firm. I may not love you as much as I used to, but I still care about you, and I never want to see you hurt. But I realize I'm sacrificing my happiness by staying with you and pretending like nothing is wrong. I'm writing this up instead of cuddling with you in bed. You held me when I came home from work and you told me how much you missed me and were looking forward to seeing me. You act as if I haven't tried to break up with you twice in the last three months and everything is fine. I wish it was fine. I wish I could feel like I did when we first starting dating back when I was in college. But I don't. I don't love you anymore. And I can't change that. 

And I can't believe I'm going to have to look you in the eye for a third time and try to end this relationship. I am not happy. I don't regret our time together, but I realize you're not the man that I want to marry.

2hi2os,3,2014-09-26,Me [22F] with my (ex)bf [23M] of a year. First relationship ever just ended; I need advice.,wearyandconfused,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hi2os/me_22f_with_my_exbf_23m_of_a_year_first/,"We had known each other for a few years before our friendship started to develop into something more. Since the beginning he always told me things like ""you're the driver"" in regards to how our relationship progressed. Because of this mentality I always seemed to be the one to initiate everything.

Shortly after we started dating he moved to different city. For the winter we made it work and had so much fun, we never fought and seemed to have no issues communicating. When the school year ended he moved even further to pursue an internship. I was upset but agreed that school and finding a good job came first.

While he was gone I felt like I always had to dog him to get a reply to text messages and when ever I asked to skype or facetime he would agree but it never seemed to happen. I would constantly be consoling him about his past, present and future, but when I came to him I received cold answers and felt brushed aside. Small things like promising to send me a gift for my birthday and then not even sending a card hurt a lot. 

In the four months he was gone I tried to keep myself occupied and ended up making a few really great friends, one of which (21M) had feelings for me. After I explained I was in a LDR he seemed to understand and back off, but he quickly became one of my best friends and we began to spend a lot of time together. It sounds bad but my Bf even said that I didn't treat him any different than my other friends, we were strictly friends and they both knew that.

Then he was finally coming home and I was so excited to see him. We spent a week together and I realized that something had changed. I no longer felt interested in having sex and felt annoyed that we couldn't agree on simple things like picking a movie. He just seemed so different. It seemed like he had completely changed, I felt guilt tripped into being intimate and belittled about being upset. I started to feel unhappy a lot and it affected my performance at work and my relationships with friends and family.

I'll admit that I may not have handled it properly, I began pulling away and got stuck in my head trying to figure out what I wanted. When I was with him I felt indifferent and when he was gone it was the same. He figured out something was up pretty quickly when he asked if he could come stay with me for the weekend and I told him maybe he should come the week after because I needed a few days to sort myself out, I told him it felt like he had stopped listening to me and was being cold when I was upset. Instead of giving me some space he showed up to my work with flowers. I appreciated the gesture but it just enforced the feelings I had.

In the weeks after that it got worse. I realized that his anxiety and bitterness about his past took a huge emotional toll on me. He then told me he loved me and basically said that he needed me to say it back. I told him I wasn't ready to say it because I didn't feel like it would be honest. From there we continued to spiral downwards until we hit bottom.

When we really started talking about things I thought we were moving towards working things out. We explained how we felt and his only major issue was my friend. When it was my turn everything poured out, I was honest about how I felt. After the talk I felt better and I thought everything would be alright again, but the next day I received a message saying that after our conversation a relationship wasn't possible anymore and that none of our issues could be fixed in a foreseeable amount of time. He even added a quip about not wanting to watch me fall for my best friend.

We have spoken since then and he told me he would always be there for me and then blocked my number from his phone shortly afterwards. I feel guilty for hurting him and I blame myself for not being able to figure out how I feel and not talking to him when I began having doubts.

I just feel like I'm going crazy and I just need a little advice on what I should do next.

2hi5ls,1,2014-09-26,How can I prevent this from happening again? [Rant/Question],slam7211,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/2hi5ls/how_can_i_prevent_this_from_happening_again/,"So I am going to go on a bit of a rant so sorry in advance. For some background, I have limited real world job experience (I just started grad school right out of college) I have had a few internships, and a few stints in academic research (physics research for anyone interested). I also have mild CP, I use canes to get around (though I can generally walk around in building no big deal they make me more stable and it ust makes life easier).

 It is the stint in academic research that I am going to rant about. So did the research at my college for a year both during the semesters and full time during the summer. It is a small department. I would say less than 10 professors, everyone is kinda like ""family""ish. When I started I was working with another student in my year, I had one boss who was basically the lab manager, lets call him Jack, and his boss was the professor in charge of the lab lets call him Greg. We had easy access to both of them, they also both knew me for a year before this. For the most part of 6 months I was doing basic research, and a lot of programming.

 After about 6 months of working in the lab, we decide we need to basically rebuild the lab from the ground up including a big new heavy vacuum chamber (it is big enough it takes 2 people to lift and move), when it comes it is going to be an all day install, even though it is during the semester most of our time not in classes is going to be installing/putting the chamber together. Obviously I cant really help lift/ move the vacuum chamber at least not without serious risk of dropping it which would be terrible, so I let my coworker and Jack grab the heavy equipment and move it into the lab. Now this chamber needs to be basically bolted together on the ground before we actually lift it all the way up and do the final installation. At this point I figure I can actually do something useful, and given that, I am about to jump in and grab a wrench to start bolting a piece on, but my coworker beats me to it, no big deal. A bit later my coworker goes to class, and it is just me and Jack, The next part requires 2 people to complete, either part I can do just fine, and it should be obvious that I would have no real problems doing either part. I Offer to help Jack with the next part, he says no, he is fine. Well 2 seconds later Jack steps out of the lab, grabs the nearest person walking down the hall, and has random guy help him do everything. When that is done he goes back to the install, which really only needs 1 person to be working on it at a time. I offer to put in the work, he says no. I just stand there, at this point feeling like I'm being stuck in the corner for no real reason. After 10 minutes of standing there waiting to see if he actually needs anything I tell him I am going into the next room (office attached to the lab) to so some HW if he does not need me. No response. I leave. An hour or so later I am hungry and leave the office to go get some food. Right before I leave Jack asks (in an angryish tone) ""Slam7211...where are you GOING?"" Me: ""to get lunch"" Jack: ""Well you coworker is outside looking for a piece I think we are missing...."" Me: ""okaaaaaaay I guess I will help him find it"" (Im sitting here thinking ""JACKASS I WAS LESS THAN 2 FEET AWAY AND YOU NEVER WALKED OVER AND TOLD ME THERE WAS A PROBLEM THAT YOU NEEDED ME FOR AFTER SIDELINING ME FOR NO GOD DAM REASON AND YOU ARE MAD AT ME?!?!"") I walk outside to help my coworker, I help for about 2 minutes before Jack walks outside saying he misplaced the part and we are all good. I proceed to spend the rest of the day in a constant cycle of trying to help, but being stuck standing around doing nothing because Jack basically tells me to stand around doing nothing, and then getting mad at me for doing nothing.

 Looking back a few days later I kind of realized that most of my roles in research were basically programming (despite the fact that was not what I really signed up for) and almost all of the physical work (by that I simply mean work that required any kind of walking standing or just DOING really) was divided between Jack and my coworker, and only bits were given to me, if at all, as if someone just looked at me before I started working and crossed off most of the work because they thought I couldn't do it. When in reality if anyone had bothered to ask I would have jumped at the chance to do a lot of that work, but any time I did I was told ""that's ok person X is handling that"". All because no one wants to have a fucking conversation. I would consider complaining, but seeing as the department was small it would have done nothing but stirred up shit, and I was still taking classes so I just swallowed my rage and continued on helping where I was allowed.


What can I do to prevent shit like this from happening to me in the future?"

A short story by Sean Le Rats

(1)

Joan walked out into the dark parking lot.
She rooted frantically in her purse for her car keys as she walked (at a rather brisk pace) to her dilapidated canary-yellow Volkswagon Beetle, unlocked it, and with a last furtive glance over her shoulder she got in, keyed the engine and sped off towards home.

Joan was paranoid. Having been diagnosed with acute anxiety disorder long ago, she lived in a perpetual state of fear of basically everything, because *anything* could set off an anxiety attack; and if you know anything about such things, you know that it is nearly impossible for you to tell the difference between such a thing and a heart attack. Her condition made it hard, indeed sometimes impossible, to work, but she was determined to keep her job. She had no intention of allowing *anyone* to declare her unfit to work. She refused to go on disability as her Employer had suggested (in tones one usually reserves for children and the feeble-minded, thought Joan), and fortunately the law firm she worked for decided it was worth the occasional suprise sick day to avoid a potentially embarrasing and possibly litigious situation. There was even a rumor circulating in the office that the higher-ups liked her guts.

Her only real comfort in life was also her only real friend, a purebred German Shepherd named Toby. A gift from her police chief father 2 years before his death from a massive brain hemmhorage, Toby had been a candidate for a particularly notorious K-9 unit out of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but had proven to be simply too non-lethal for the job. Oh, he had guts this dog, he certainly would do all the right things; piss all over the place when near drugs (it took 3 carpets sacrificed out of her security deposit for Joan to realise not to smoke joints around him), strain at the leash to go after a suspect, chase them down....and he had a really ingenious way of catching up to them and causing them to trip by literally diving between their legs while they were running! But when it came to actually sinking his teeth into a suspect, he just would not do it. Months and months of training and field work had no effect; the dog was all bark and no bite. Realising that he now had a 4-legged burglar alarm on his hands that was officially doomed to be euthanized, and having become rather attached to this tree-hugging antibite hippie dog, Joan's father somehow bribed his superior officer (the rumor floating around the station was that he fucking BLEW the guy, but that is another story for another time....perhaps for Porntube) and brought the dog home to Joan. She was infatuated with him immediately, and the two of them lived a happy little life in a happy little bubble...and at night, whenever the anxiety would kick in and she would wake from some unknown noise, she would put her hand down to her side, and Toby's furry warmth would be there, and he would lick her hand, and she would be comforted knowing he was on guard, and drift off to sleep again.

On this particular night she had stayed late at work, on the insistence of her Supervisor (a big fat burly 400 pound prick bastard named King Kong by her co-workers...oh nobody ever called him that to his face, but everyone in the building called the fat bastard that behind his insipid back), to catch up on the paperwork from her previous sick day, and she came speeding into the driveway as if the very hounds of hell were chasing her; she absolutely hated being out after dark. Amidst a cloud of pungent exhaust and screaming burning rubber she came, roaring into the driveway and screeching to a halt with inches to spare before ending up in her downstairs cat-obsessed Landlady's living room, fighting off the *motherfucker* of all anxiety attacks; and who should she see sitting on the porch, pinned in her headlights like a deer, coughing and fanning the smoke in the air around her with the latest copy of the fucking wretched Watchtower magazine she had been reading!

Despite this obviously unwelcome suprise, Joan sighed with relief...she was home, and nothing had gotten her. She turned off the Volkswagon and took a moment to calm herself and slow her breathing and her heart rate down as she had been taught by her therapist, which basically consisted of breathing deeply while lighting the unfinished MORNING JOINT from the Bug's ashtray. She smoked the half-joint in three massive puffs, and relished it; all the while eyeing the hacking old lady with amusement...what insipid complaint would she have for her this evening, she wondered. Waiting up for her because she knew once Joan was inside she wasn't opening the door for anyone! What imaginary infraction to what imaginary rule would the biddy invoke? Muttering to herself, she stuffed her keys into her purse and got out of the car, quite prepared for an argument.

""HACK! *HAAAAAK*! Dear LORD young Lady!"" Said the Landlady, still fanning the air with her ridiculous magazine. ""You certainly know how to make a grand entrance! COUGH! HACK!""

""Ok Elizabeth,"" said Joan, ""you caught me fair and square. What is it this time that's so important that you would wait up for me on your porch until nine thirty at night?""

The landlady, being aged a fucking hundred years for all Joan knew, was not quite all there up top...she imagined things. But she was basically a good soul, so we shall pardon her infirmity for the purpouses of this story. Indeed, one could say that both Joan and the Landlady were afllicted with the same ailment, just producing different results for each afflicted woman. This thought never once crossed Joan's mind as the landlady leaned forward with a twinkle in her eye and said ""Toby's been up to dickens.""

Dickens? Thought Joan. What the hell is a Dickens? To the Landlady she said, ""Ummm...I dont think I follow you. Could you be a little more specific?""

""Well..."" Said the Landlady, ""Shortly after Noon I was opening cans to feed my cats, as I am accustomed to doing at the same time each day...."" And Joan interrupted her and said, ""You feed those fucking cats ALL the time!"" which sent the old woman into gales of laughter, and she collapsed back into her lawnchair. ""Ahhahahahahaah! Oh my g...guh-godness, you caught me off guard with that one! Hehehehe oh yes, i do give them treats all the time as you well know. Ha ha!""
""Yes Ma'am, you sure do. Thats why the grey one is so FAT!"" Joan began to be suckered in by the Landlady's uncharacteristic mirth...she felt the last vestiges of her panic-ridden drive leaving her as she contemplated how many meds the woman had taken that evening..

The fat cat joke got her going again. ""POUHAHAHAHAHAAAH!"" She rocked in her chair, convulsing with laughter. ""Oh YES dear, plenty of treats! But meals are meals, and snacks are snacks, and as you well know the sound of that can opener is like a dog whistle for my cats. But I had opened all 8 cans, and not a single cat had come. And just when I was beginning to think they had all gotten outside somehow and I should go and look for them, i heard a peculiar sound from upstairs. As if someone were dragging something heavy across the floor.""

Joan was puzzled. Toby had never been the kind of dog to get mischevious and get into things when unsupervised. Indeed, being a K-9 dropout he was actually quite a lot more disciplined than many other droupouts of another species of Earthling which we will not mention here.

Dismissing it, she said with a smirk ""Did you take your medication this evening, Dear?""
""Oh yes DEAR!"" Roared the Landlady. ""I took em my DEAR, I TOOK EM ALL!"" And the Landlady got up and danced a little shuffling jig on the porch, and they both cackled wildly into the night!

The medication gag had been a running joke between the two of them since the Landlady had threatened to purposefully overdose on her most excellently narcotic pill prescription last year during a fugue; it was that and the cat jokes they shared between them that made the animosity Joan felt for her melt like butter that night. She supposed, right then and there, that she loved the old lady in a way, and the thought took her by suprise, and she hugged the Landlady and kissed her cheek and bade her goodnight while petting her thinning hair, climbed the stairs chortling to herself and entered into her apartment above, feeling in considerably better spirits but also feeling extremely exhausted. She stripped off her work clothes, showered, changed into her night clothes and snuggled into bed, and was asleep almost instantly.

She was awake suddenly at three in the morning. *Wide* awake. She rolled over in the darkness, wondering what had awakened her. She listened intently.

A steady DRIP DRIP DRIP was coming from somewhere inside the house.

Leaky faucet rrgghh She thought, and rolled over again, putting her hand by her side...and the dog licked it, and she was comforted, knowing that he was on guard. And she drifted off back into blissful sleep again.

(2)

Joan awoke the next morning to absolutely no dripping sounds, late by a full half hour thanks to her shitty clock radio which sometimes would choose NOT to go off for some reason...and so, with the sun streaming rays onto her directly from the bedroom window, she dressed frantically, scrambling into her coat and, fumbling her purse around with keys jingling and flying all over, determined not to be late, *determined* that they would *not* declare her unfit, left the apartment in a confused half-dressed fumbling mess, adjusting things as she went. By the time she reached the Bug she was completely dressed and composed (albeit with her hair not quite under control...this she would fix later, while ripping down the highway steering with her knee) and hell-bent on getting to work on time. In a blur of movement that an observer could have called preternatural, she zipped into the car, keyed the engine and burned rubber, laying many clouds of stinking smog behind her.

She worked overtime once again, until she could stand it no longer; watching the sun go down from her hi-rise office window, bit by bit; watching as that cunt intern Gloria kept putting shit in her inbox; and when the bitch put in the envelope clearly marked ""Goldstein""in big red letters she had HAD it; that motherfucker was always an hour or longer, and it had already gone past 8 pm on the wall clock. She got up, eyeing the envelope protruding from the inbox with the kind of hatred one would usually reserve for rapists, put on her coat and left with no warning and not even a look back over her shoulder. She burned the proverbial rubber all the way home (no beloved biddy on the porch, thank the Gods), climbed the stairs, let herself in, and dropped into bed fully clothed, exhausted beyond belief.

She was awakened at 2 am. She sat up and listened.

A steady DRIP DRIP DRIP was coming from somewhere inside the house.

This had been the second night of this mysterious dripping, and how come she did not hear it during the day? Leaky pipes and faucets leaked *all* the time, not just at night; would not the Landlady have told her if there had been any leakage through the floors? She began to get irrationally scared, and put a trembling hand down to her side, where Toby's furry warmth was waiting, and the dog licked her hand, and she was comforted, knowing he was on guard as always, and she was soon sound asleep again.

(3)

She awoke the next morning a full hour late, and stopped in the middle of her usual fumbling mess and race to be gone, thinking of Toby. The dog has to eat, she thought. She started towards the kitchen, pulling shoes on and adjusting her bra as she went, tripping over the carpet. Dropping her car keys and cursing like a truck driver, she snatched a can of Alpo out of the cupboard and opened it with the electric opener (and was that a chorus of meows she heard through the floor?), dumped the food into his bowl and left the house in a flurry of jingling keys and uncombed hair, screeching off into the morning in a cloud of burning rubber.

She came home that evening, not in a hurry at all, not having an anxiety attack even though it was well past ten at night. For the first time in she couldn't remember HOW long, she was driving at night and she wasn't scared at all. King Kong had not given a flying fuck that she was late; a litigation which Joan had tabled at the last board meeting, and which the company originally didn't want to touch with a ten-foot pole (but Joan had been quite persistent), had in fact netted the team a cool 4 million; and suddenly Joan was promoted, and they had thrown a huge party, and everyone in the building had gotten drunk and stoned! She had no precedent for it really, and she couldn't remember *ever* feeling as good about anything!

She came purring into the driveway, feeling like she was driving on a cloud...and then the feeling evaporated.

The Landlady was there on her porch, pinned in the bug's headlights as before. But this time there was no Watchtower in her hand, no lawnchair behind her; she stood, glowering at Joan, her hands folded across her chest.

Joan got out of the car wondering what could have upset her Landlady so much that she looked at Joan with tombstones in her eyes, when just the other night they had been laughing together like old friends. She closed the bug's door and asked ""What's wrong? What's happened?""

The Landlady uncrossed her arms, placed her hands on her hips and said, ""I don't mind including the Hydro with the rent you pay, and I also do not mind you keeping guests. but I cannot and I WILL not stand for anyone wasting electricity.""

Now joan was completely confused. ""What the hell are you talking about?""

""The light in your guestroom. It was on all night.""

""But I don't have any guests! I haven't been in that room in months!""

The landlady gave her a look as if she smelled something bad, and the next words she spoke were as cold as ice. ""I might be old, and I might be infirm, and I might be on medication. But don't you EVER take me for a fucking fool."" And with that, she turned and disappeared into her apartment, slamming the door behind her.

Joan went up the back stairs to the back door, and entered her dark apartment through the kitchen, turning on the light as she closed the door behind her.

Toby's food was untouched.

She listened intently.

A steady DRIP DRIP DRIP was coming from somewhere inside the house.

Joan began a slow and fearful search of her home, turning lights on as she went. She checked every faucet, every fixture, every single pipe she could find that was exposed.

No loose or leaky pipes.

And no sign of her dog.

But there was one last room which she had not checked.

The guest room.

She approached it, trembling like a leaf, calling her dog's name, the dripping sound somehow seeming to get louder as she approached. She opened the door.

The room was pitch black.

She fumbled along the wall for the light switch and flicked it on.

The light still worked, even though it had been torn from the ceiling and now hung halfway between the ceiling and the floor. Toby's decomposing carcass hung, tangled in the wires. His throat had been cut from ear to ear. He had also been disembowled, and his entrails hung from him in fly-covered glistening ropes. A pool of putrid coagulating blood teeming with squirming maggots had formed underneath him, and a steady DRIP DRIP DRIP came now to Joan's ears as her dead dog dripped blood.

Toby had been dead for days.

Which made Joan ask herself a question. And suddenly her heart began to triphammer in her chest, and a putrid sweat broke out all over her body as she backed out of the room on wobbly legs, turning the question over and over in her mind like a death sentence.

*What had licked her hand?*

2hihcn,50,2014-09-26,A story about woman on man bullying when I was a preteen.,LunarianAngel,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2hihcn/a_story_about_woman_on_man_bullying_when_i_was_a/,"When I was ten, I started my first year of middle school, and took the bus every day with student my age through to 13. Now, I was the typical nerdy kid. I played video games, was shy and very introverted, and was bullied on a constant basis. But the most constant was was with these two girls on my bus who lived just to streets down from me.

They were 13 and much larger than me, both in size and weight. I was the scrawny, didn't do sports, and hadn't had my growth alert yet and these girls towered over me.

Every single day, I was subject to their bullying. On the morning bus and the afternoon bus, and literally every single day. Throwing my belongings, calling me names, threatening me, and physically assaulting me even on some occasions. What frightened me the most was that, unlike the other kids at school, they were on my bus and knew my street, and could easily learn where I live. 

Yes, I tried seeking help. I went out to my family, but until I reached my teens, they did very little outside of a few comforting words here and there. I couldn't go to my friends, they lived in the same neighborhood and we're even on good terms with the girls, laughing and sharing jokes, letting them torment me. I went to the school finally, and they thought nothing of it. Them being girls, the school thought ""how bad could it be"" and ignored it.

This was the final incident with them. It was a few days before the end of school, and the kids on the bus had a paper ball fight, which I took part in because I thought it was funny. The driver got mad and forced me and a friend of mine to clean up before we reached the stops, so me and her were piling them into plastic bags. The larger of the two girls reached over to the bag I had and tore it open, shredding the bag and forcing me to start all over. This happened twice and we were reaching my stop. After the mess was clean I turn quiet with my head down, and the same larger girl got into the seat behind me and began screaming at me. Getting in my face, shouting obscenities, threatening me that the next thing she ripped wouldn't be the bag.

That's when something inside me snapped. All of the pent up anger over the past 176 days had built up and I lost it. I screamed ""LEAVE ME ALONE!"" And I turned around and smacked her in the side with my clothed math book.

She began crying.

The bus went into a panic. ""What happened?"" ""Why did you do that to her!?"" ""How could you!?"" Were heard as I reach my stop. I stepped off and started walking as I realized what I had done, and I broke into tears. That's when I hear her friend, the other girl who bullied me, got off the bus, and shouted for me to wait. I panicked and quickened my pace, but she was larger and caught up to me. I was terrified and covered in tears when she turned me to face her.

But then she hugged me. She understood how I felt and apologized and was very comforting about the whole thing which amazed me. But it didn't end there, sadly. Silence was on the bus the next day, and me and her never even glanced at each other. I walked in my first class that day only to be told to go to the principals office. I was expelled for the remainder of the year (which admittedly was only four days.) my mother picked me up in tears for not having helped sooner.

But that's when we found out her parents called the cops on me. A terrified me and my father were brought to the police station where I spent hours being told by officers about what I did and how wrong it was, and was forced by the police to apologize to her in person. This was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.

I am now 23 and am trying to find a job, and am in fear that this somehow is on a criminal record. I worked years at a very bad retail job where I was underpaid and poorly treated, and spent 6 months doing a College internship with Disney, but I have applied to and called into every job three towns around and have yet to find employment and I am scared that I may have a violent criminals record, all because my bullying was ignored and nobody stepped in until the day that 10 year old male me hit 13 year old female her."

2hihul,2,2014-09-26,Single father and dysfunctional family,question4red,MaleGroupTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaleGroupTherapy/comments/2hihul/single_father_and_dysfunctional_family/,"I guess I'm looking for advice, but also just want to write these things down and it helps knowing that it's visible to others.

.

I'm a 30 year old single white male with an 8 year old daughter. Aside from my daughter, my family consists of just me, my brother and parents, no other relatives are alive or in the area that we talk to. I have a decent job and I’ve been living either with friends or alone for about 12 years, and I’ve had weekend custody of my daughter her whole life, but that's about to change to full custody. My brother (34) has been living primarily with my dad for the majority of his adult life. Living off my dad, I should say, as my dad has been paying for all of his, often lavish, living expenses. I think the best way to get this down might be to break my family up into groups.

.

**My daughter and her mother:** My daughter and I are close, she is the highlight of my life and she is smart, sweet, and wonderful. I met her mother at my job when I was 19, and aside from ending up with a daughter that I love, getting involved with the mother was a huge mistake. I was young and naive. She's what a lot of people would call a ""ghetto hood rat."" She has a great personality in a lot of ways, but more than anything she is chaotic, prone to losing her temper, and prone to making bad decisions. My daughter was living with her mother for the first 7 years of her life, and the two moved in with my daughter's mother's mother about four years ago. I had a verbal agreement of getting my daughter on the weekends (her mother and I couldn't make the relationship work, having tried and failed several times). Daughter's mother was mostly unemployed, living off child support and welfare, but had also gotten involved with someone who made money through a fake charity fraud, and was living off that as well.

.

Perhaps no surprise, she had also become an addict. She took Norcos, a high strength form of Vicodin, at first for back problems but soon recreationally. She was open about taking them for her back, but soon it became obvious that she was taking more and more. She would create ""emergencies"" and use my daughter as a way of getting me to give her much more than the $600 per month I paid in child support, saying things like we're out of food, I need gas money/ bus money or I’ll miss this job interview, ect. These emergencies became increasingly frequent and her behavior was getting increasing erratic and hostile, and she was already a pretty erratic and hostile person, with me at least. 

.

After discussing the situation with people and putting some thought into it, I decided that I should stop giving her additional money, as I was clearly just enabling her drug habit. Meanwhile, I was saving to eventually hire a lawyer to attempt to get increased or full custody, though I was beginning to realize that a father getting full custody is extremely difficult in California, not to mention extremely expensive. Part of my plan, honestly, was also to wait for her to make a huge mistake and end up in jail or something, likely by getting into a fight with a friend or boyfriend. Despite her chaos, she was always pretty good with our daughter though. She was warm and nurturing with her, hadn’t lost her temper or hit her or anything, and hadn't yet put her in any risk or danger through negligence. 

.

Then one day she called me with one of her typical emergency situations. It was on a Saturday evening during my daughter’s winter break from school. I had my daughter and was scheduled to bring her back that night and then go to work (I work graveyard shift). It was 11th hour and she told me that she needed $100 for food for the week, otherwise I would need to keep my daughter for the rest of the week, knowing that that would be really hard to manage on short notice. I went back and forth with her for a while about it (I make sure my daughter doesn’t overhear these conversations), and eventually called the grandmother and told her about the situation. She told me to just bring my daughter there, said there was plenty of food in the house and she could look after her. The grandmother’s a lot more reasonable and knows all about her daughter’s tendencies. 

.

A little while after bringing my daughter there, I got a call from my daughter’s mother, who was furious. She told me that she had picked my daughter up and brought her to her friend’s house down the street (where she was now crashing at about half the time). She said her mother couldn’t watch her, and said that if I didn’t wire her money or pick my daughter up immediately she was going to drive my daughter to a park somewhere and leave her there. She told me this on the phone and via text messages, and at this point I had installed a call recording app as means to get more evidence for custody, so I decided to call in sick to work and go there and get the police involved. Immediately after emailing work I got a text from her saying that she’d just kicked my daughter out of the house and sent her walking. I called the grandmother who was already on the phone with the police. My daughter had run to her house screaming and crying. I drove there immediately and picked my daughter up. 

.

Her grandmother and I then went through the long process of getting CPS involved, who took about a month to even get the ball rolling on anything. I told the grandmother that I didn’t want to bring my daughter back to her school until it was illegal for her mother to come get her, so I worked it out with my parents to keep her with me over at their places for about a month. This actually proved to be a pretty wise decision, because the principal later told me that my daughter’s mother had been going there almost daily looking for her, and legally they would have had to let her take her.  

.

After many meetings with CPS, they decided to place my daughter into temporary foster care custody with her grandmother, and would give re-unification programs to both me and her mother, though mine would be much easier and have many less requirements. I was OK with temporary custody for the grandmother, as I was living with roommates and needed a little time to move out, not to mention change my shift at work, but CPS’s justification for not giving me immediate full custody was that they believed that I didn’t do enough to protect my daughter from her mother and try to contact authorities or get custody. I strongly disagree with that decision, as before this incident I didn’t have any hard proof that she was on drugs, I had no smoking guns for a custody case, and any attempt to gain custody would have likely backfired and resulted in minimal custody (weekends, which I already had) and caused retaliation from the mother. 

.

This is getting to be an incredibly long post, so to finalize this part, I’ve now moved out and I am in the process of moving in with my dad, as it’s the only way to make full custody work immediately with my graveyard schedule and CPS’s requirements. I currently take my daughter there about 4 days a week and should be getting full custody within 6 months. My brother is moving out of my dad’s and into my mom’s garage, and right now the two of us are sort of living at both parent’s houses.

.

**My brother and dad:** My brother is 34, he’s an art major and has a degree, but has mostly been unemployed his entire adult life and has mostly been living at my dad’s. He and my dad have a codependent relationship, they are both pretty socially isolated and in some ways socially inept. My dad is 73 and is still working, mainly just to support my brother. Neither my dad, nor my brother really have any friends, and it’s me and my mom’s suspicion that my dad wants my brother to remain dependent on him out of fear of being alone. I see my dad about once a week, bringing my daughter there, though now it’s gone up to 3 or 4 days a week. My mom sees him about once a week, though the two of them are divorced and get into fights on a pretty regular basis, mainly due to my mom’s personality issues really. My brother’s pretty immature for a 34 year old, and he’s also obsessive about a lot of things. He spends a ton of time looking in the mirror and obsessing about his appearance. He had a nose job when he was younger and he tells me, on and off, that he’s going to get another one because they didn’t make it small enough. More than anything, he’s extremely scattered. He loses things all the time, misses appointments, and can’t manage bills. 

.

He started taking Adderall for his ADHD a few years ago, and it was around that time that he decided that he was going to launch his own startup company and make an a children’s storybook app. This involved renting out an office by my dad’s house (while unemployed), taking questionably legal advantage of free interns via craigslist ads, and for over a year costing my dad at least twice of what he normally costs him, which is a lot. My brother has since stopped taking the Adderall and the startup company has since mostly fallen apart, though he’s still saying that he’s going to release this app soon. 

.

The app, like many other aspects of my brother’s life, reminds me of that door in the Shining that kept getting further away the more the woman ran towards it. It’s been “just about finished” for maybe two years now, and before the app even, my brother had been telling me for years that he’s just going to work on (fill in the blank) for a little while longer, and if that doesn’t work out he’s going to just get a job and work on a career. 

.

One reason I think moving into my dad’s will be good is that it might break the codependency that he and my brother have. My brother has been staying in my mom’s garage pretty much since I moved out. I have been there a lot because it is closer to my job than my dad’s, and because I am fixing up the garage, trying to entice my brother into staying there. I have made the garage extremely comfortable, having moved in my 70 inch TV, a mini-fridge, internet, etc, and my brother found himself a full time job at minimum wage about 5 minutes away from my mom’s. My mom is on board with having her garage taken over and wants my brother to live there for the same reasons I do. 

.

But as I’m seeing my dad and brother more, I have realized the crazy extent of my brother’s mooching. In the past week, I’ve seen that my brother has called my dad at least five times, each time asking him to wire at least $100 into his account for one reason or another, and each time my dad’s done it. I would probably estimate that my brother costs my dad at least $2,000 dollars a month. I’ve talked to my dad before about the possibility of cutting my brother off or least having a small set amount that he gives him each month. My dad says that he’s planning to eventually do that but won’t simply cut him off immediately, because he thinks that my brother would end up homeless. He’s also told me that if it weren’t for my brother’s costs he would be retired now. This is frustrating to know, especially seeing the way my brother frivolously spends. He wastes tons of gas, buys tons of trivial toys that he clearly doesn’t need, he’s even adopting a child in some third world country at $80 a month. Don’t get me wrong, that’s a great thing to do, but not when it’s someone else’s money you’re spending. My dad often talks about his own budget concerns and I doubt he would do that himself. The other day my brother was over and couldn’t find his pen for his Wacom tablet, and after looking around for it for about 15 minutes he decided that the dog must have gotten it and so he called my dad saying that he needed $100 to buy a new one, and my dad wired him money for it. 15 minutes tops he looked around for that thing and I’m willing to bet the dog didn’t take it.

.

**My mother:** My mother is smart and has several very good qualities, but she has some odd emotional issues and a definite drinking problem. She can get high strung, often has very low patience, and at certain times is pretty much impossible to avoid getting into an argument with. I have a much better, or at least calmer relationship with her than my brother does, and don’t argue much with her these days, but I think that’s partly because I’ve learned how to deal with her. She doesn’t really get outright hostile, but often is very passive aggressive and talks to people in a very insulting, sarcastic tone of voice. She was adopted into a family that neglected her, and she can’t really seem to get along with anybody for a long period of time without fighting with them and thinking that they’re being abusive or manipulative in some way, when usually that person is simply responding to her defensiveness. She’s pretty quick to get very, very defensive over nothing. She’s also pretty intrusive and controlling. It’s hard to fully relax in her presence because she’s always liable to start commanding you around in a very bossy tone. She also has a tendency to over worry, and she treats her children like children, often referring to me or my brother as “my little baby” or something along those lines, talking to us in the tone that a mother would be talking to her infant child, and I think that’s kind of weird

.

Anyway, that’s about all I have to say about all that."
2hivdp,103,2014-09-26,"(29/m) makes about 5/8 the amount of money (29/f) makes, can't keep up with her relationship demands",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2hivdp/29m_makes_about_58_the_amount_of_money_29f_makes/,"I have been in a relationship for about 2 years with a woman who has made significantly more money than me throughout our relationship.  She works as a teacher in a high paying district and is now in a principal internship where she is making about $80k this year, and if she chooses to pursue being a principal after this she will be making over $100k a year.  She is pursuing a doctorate degree that she will have in a few years.

I work as a teacher as well, but as a band director.  I had a job last year that involved working as an assistant band director for 2 1/2 years at a poor music school (something she frequently put me down for), and I recently received my own middle school band program where I will be making a bit more, at just under $50k a year.  I am also pursuing a master's degree in my field.

We are currently living together in a condo that she decided to purchase.  She put the down payment down on it (she has money saved up, while I'm paying for student loans), and I pay half of the rent along with utilities and all that.

The big issue is that she is the breadwinner, and she frequently points that out to me, even claiming that it is my fault that she is forced to do all of this work, since she cannot rely on me.  She blames me for this every time she has any issue with her work or schooling.  I never told her I wanted her to pursue this work, I just want her to do what makes her happy.

So now, she tells me that the only way this relationship can work is if I ""do my share"", compensating for the extra money and work that she does.  I say that's fine I understand.  So it is my job to make sure that dinner is ready for her every night when she comes home, I need to make sure that I keep the house clean at all times, including cleaning up messes that she makes, and doing the odd random task every now and then (a few nights ago she came home and told me I needed to fill up her car with gas since she doesn't like filling up her own car).

Well it was difficult with my old job to do this, since I would usually get home at 4-5pm and I could do this stuff while keeping up with my school work and work work alright.  With this new job, however, I will be working longer hours and it is an hour commute each way.  There will be plenty of nights I will either get home at the same time as her or even later, but it doesn't matter to her.  I am already having trouble keeping up with her demands.  The other night she got extremely upset because, after working all day, making her dinner, cleaning up dinner, going out to an RCIA meeting, coming home, doing some laundry and doing my own work (I am starting a band program, after all), she blew up, locking me out of the bedroom and refusing to talk to me because I didn't take out the garbage, put away the few pairs of shoes near the door, and organize the front room.  She was threatening to break up with me, claiming that ""this wasn't the first time I've done this"", and ""I don't do my share"".  I didn't even really get defensive about it, I just said ""I'm sorry, I have been really busy tonight, I will take care of it now"", but she didn't care and kept up the hostility.  That next morning she said I needed to move out immediately because she was going to call a locksmith while at work, locking me away from important belongings, and saying I'd have to go through court to get them.

This morning she left for work saying that she wants me out by the time she gets home from work at about 6.  She's mad now because I took offense to how she keeps talking to me.  She says I'm a mean, horrible person and she doesn't like me in a playful voice.  But she does it extremely frequently, and while she says she's joking, when I hear it usually multiple times a day it just makes me want to stop caring, because apparently it doesn't matter what I do.  Anyways, I was hurt by this, then she made another ""breadwinner"" jab at me, and then I said I'm gonna have trouble in the coming weeks keeping up with all this stuff because I'll be working so much.  She said that she wants me to ""figure it out"", having a dinner ready for her every night anyways because its what we agreed to.  (Note: In my perspective, this agreement was reached based on, ""guy, you need to do this stuff or I'm breaking up with you"".

So I start getting ready for work, I'm getting dressed, she said something else demeaning about me (I think it was a fat thing), and then she starts using my phone when her's is right next to her.  This really, really, really made me feel like I was just there as a punching bag and to be taken advantage of.  So I asked for my phone and left the room.  She accused me of having something on there I didn't want her to see and I said no I just wanted my phone (I have let her use my phone several times in the past to just look at my messages and stuff and I didn't care).  I then told her that I felt taken advantage of, how that even though she is making more money I feel that I can't keep up with her list of demands very effectively, and that I would like to be treated a bit more nicely (I tell her I love her, she says ""No I don't"" or ""Then show it"" when I feel I show it at least in small ways pretty frequently.  She sometimes says she loves me so so so so much, but then her mood can change on a dime or she'll go on about how I'm a horrible person).

Well she couldn't handle what I said, and she told me that I was making excuses for not being able to contribute equally to her, and that I needed to move out tonight.  I said thanks for listening to my feelings (something she throws at me very frequently), and she stormed out.

I do think that she does love me to an extent, or maybe even a whole lot, because she did make a down payment on a condo that I'm only paying rent on and living with her on, and she is taking me on a trip to an area near Cancun for my 30th birthday (I've never been on a beach vacation, while she has been on quite a few, but it's still exciting), but when she gets upset about something, she goes pretty nuclear most of the time.  This has been a constant problem in our relationship.  So she does do some nice things for me, but the mean, although joking comments, and absolute lack of compassion or consideration from her is becoming too much.

Anyway TL;DR:  My girlfriend makes more money than me, and wants me to do nearly all of the work around the house, chores, errands, cooking, etc., when I have a job that will be working on many days even more hours than her.  I fall behind just a little bit when I have loads of work to do and she threatens to break up with me, change the locks with all of my possessions inside.  I voice my frustration and she demands I move out by the evening.  I tell her I need to stay up late each night to ensure I keep up with everything and she says that's fine, but is frustrated when I can't go to bed with her, making me fall behind in my work.  The fact that she makes more money than me is frequently brought up to me, how it is my fault she has to work so hard, and that I rarely keep up with contributing on her level.

So what should I do?  Try to talk to her about it again?  Keep submitting to this?  Rush up here after work and let her come home to a condo where I've moved out?  Am I an idiot for thinking that I'm being asked to do too much given the circumstances (I have no social life outside of her, and I struggle to keep up with my work responsibilities)?  When I bring this stuff up to her, she mocks me, calling me ""poor victim guy"".  And she has always gotten upset when I share anything about our relationship troubles with anyone, from friends, family, even strangers, since she essentially says ""what goes on in the relationship stays in the relationship, they are our problems to work out"".  I know there is her side to the story and everything but I just don't know what to do anymore.  Any comments about perhaps the idiot I've been or what I should do would be appreciated."

I've done a lot of technical interviews, and I usually do very well. I had three interviews with this company this week, and the one before and after that trainwreck went great.

Thankfully I have a return offer (this is for summer internships) from somewhere so I'm not really concerned. I'm just kind of frustrated because I thought I had made it past rookie mistakes like that."

The day I will lose my shit at work if I have even the slightest reason.

See, I was hired as a new associate 6 months ago. They hired me despite no open hire recs because they thought I was a good match. But the budget was not available for a new hire, so they hired me well below what others are paid in my position ($20K less at my company, $40K less at some competitors). But that was just until the end of the fiscal year, three months later! Big deal. Good company, good job.

So, three months came and no raise. Others were getting their annual raise. So I confronted the company. ""Oh well, we still don't have as much work as we thought so we can't pay you.""

On Monday, three new hires start. They were interns a few summers ago so you COULD argue they have 2-3 months experience, but if you are familiar with this work, you know that interns.. they don't do the job I've done the last six months, let alone my first 2-3 months here. And they are wined and dined and treated like gold. 

They start at the higher wage. No mention has been made of bringing my wage up. Trust me, the company has excuses and they seem to love me - all signs point to me being a damn good employee. ""Oh, they are in different departments"" Except, in our slow time in my division, I've been working in those divisions...

I'm desperately looking for a new job. But I'm highly specialized so it's tough. Add to that the fact that the two interviews I got so far I blew the question on ""Why have you only been at your job for five months (this was a few weeks ago)"". I was at my last (non-industry) job for 8 years. But... explaining this away is tough.

Right now I am angry. Tonight I will cry. Not for the first time about this. The level of disrespect, and the insulting placations they attempt, is too much. I worked damn hard to get here and trusted in them to make it right. They haven't. I'm out. Assuming I can find a new job..."
2hkpzz,10,2014-09-26,(23/F) Very Confused; Confessional. Concerning (24/M) boyfriend. Long Post,026574219,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2hkpzz/23f_very_confused_confessional_concerning_24m/,"As a preface, I suppose I'm creating this just so that someone else knows.  Pretty much all of my decisions have been shitty, and I'm not looking for someone to justify what I've done.

Around three years ago I met a great guy that I was very compatible  with.  We had similar interest, similar dreams, similar friends.  It seemed perfect, and for such a long time it was.  At the time, I was going into my junior year of college and he was going into his sophomore year.  We dealt with the distance that different colleges brought, basically with ease.  We were so in love.  After that year, we decided to move in together, and we did that for a year as well.  Still, everything going great.  We both got part time jobs to help support our little apartment and our cats.  I really thought I had everything figured out, and he thought the same.  Somewhere along the road I started to feel not so myself, and ended up seeking the help of a psychologist.  I was having anxiety problems, and the doctor told me to take some medication, and suggested I quit my job to ease the stress of college and work, so I did.  Money wasn't really an issue, so that wasn't a big deal.  I wasn't getting better though.  Some days I'd wake up and just want to lie in bed and cry.  I was experiencing a depressive state as well.. I ended up dropping out of school with around 24 credit hours left in finishing my bachelor's degree.  I guess this was major mistake number one..

After that, he was offered an internship in another state, and to be honest, I did not want to go, but I knew it would be better for him.  It was close to his family.  No where near mine, or my friends.. so I went with him.  Mistake number 2.  In leaving, I left my car at my mom's house, along with basically everything else.  I hated the move so much.  I became so disconnected with him and everything else around me.  I basically just sat in our.. I guess you could call it one bedroom apartment, but it wasn't even that.  It was basically just one large room that we both lived in.  He worked long hours, and I looked for work here and there, but nothing serious.  I honestly didn't want to work.  I just wanted to go home.  Eventually, he was offered a job in a state around an hour from my mom's house, so I was very thankful.  We ended up moving back towards my home time where I met this other guy... Things became sexual with this other guy quickly.  At this point, my boyfriend and I had not been sexually intimate in months.  I knew what I was doing was wrong, and I knew it wasn't anything serious... This was the third major mistake I guess.  I didn't want to be with the new guy, and at the same time I didn't want to be with my boyfriend, but I felt trapped... I didn't have anything else, so I knew I at least had to get back to my home vicinity. 
I broke it off with the other guy, and soon enough there is ANOTHER guy in my life.  We've not been sexually intimate, but Im sure if we were given the chance we would be.  

I guess now I just have no idea what to do.. Or I know what to do, I just don't know how to execute it.  Best case scenario, I would get a car and move out, but goddamn  it just isn't that easy.  I start a super shitty job next week (as a server) can people even make a living off of that? 

To make matters worse, the other guy in my life has no idea about ANY of this.  Like.. none of it.  

Well I guess that's it.  I don't know what I'm expecting to hear, or how anyone can offer me any advice that I've not already considered, but I somehow I feel better having it out there.

Cheers."
2hlbfp,193,2014-09-27,Update! So NMom saw my hair today...,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2hlbfp/update_so_nmom_saw_my_hair_today/,"Hello, lovelies! :)

[Last time I posted, I had recently got a haircut and dyed a streak of my hair red while I was at college]( http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2h8ra9/another_update_post_and_more_good_news/), without telling or getting permission from my parents. They're pretty strongly against this kind of stuff; they want my hair to be at least shoulder length and I'm not allowed to bleach, dye, or color it.

*Note: italics are just what I was thinking at the time. I barely spoke to NMom today because I was too tired, but I was internally sassing it up in my mind.*


**Well, ""Hair"" We Are**


EDad picked me up for the weekend, because my mom wanted to bring me to [event]. EDad didn't even notice my hair when he picked me up, I had to stand in front of him and say, ""look, my hair is red now."" Surprisingly, he took it well, and he said he liked it. Thank you, EDad. I like it, too. :D


We got home, and I was exhausted, so I went straight to sleep (but not before locking my door). NMom was out, and only got home around midnight. Of course, she heard I was back from college, and just HAD to see me. Sleep could wait, because NMom is always more important (/sarcasm)!


Anyway, I'm fast asleep when suddenly I hear somebody thumping on the door. *Now who could that be? Good morning, NMom; how are you this fine evening?* I drag myself out of bed, turn on the light, and open the door.


You guys, she literally screamed when I opened that door and she saw me. Screamed. Out. Loud.


... yes! :D


Kittens: 1, NMom: 0.


Anyway, NMom forgot she was going to yell at me for sleeping with my door locked, and started yelling about my hair instead. I think she was kind of panicked, astounded, and confused.


I was standing there in the doorway grinning from ear to ear, which didn't help me any. Heh, whoops.


Anywho, NMom's rant went something like this:


&gt; ""What will so-and-so say?!"" *Do I look like I care?*

&gt; ""When did you dye your hair?!"" *When you weren't there to tell me I couldn't.*

&gt; ""Why is it so short?!"" *It's just above my shoulder, so it's really medium length... because that's how I like it.*

&gt; ""How much did this cost?!"" *Cheap enough for me to afford even after you took all my money.*

&gt; ""Why is it red?!"" *I wanted red, and screw you, that's why.*


At this point, I got tired again, so I quietly locked and closed my door on her, turned out my lights and climbed back into bed. And she kept yelling. Through the door. At the door, rather. She actually just stood there yelling at the door:


&gt; ""What?! WHAT?!"" *what, what. &gt;_&gt;*

&gt; ""Who told you to do this?! Who did this to you?!"" *Nobody, and... the nice haircut lady did it for me?*

&gt; ""You look like a punk!"" *I see you're upset.*


And at this point her rant took a bit of a weird turn:


&gt; ""You know, I was with my friend today and our other friend works at [company I interned at this summer], and she said she saw you in the cafeteria every single day but she never said hi to you because you always looked so small and meek and you always kept your head down and she thought she would scare you if she talked to you."" *Um... so NMom's random friend that I don't know was watching (read: stalking) me every day at lunch over the summer, did I get that right? All right, go on.*

&gt; ""And she's going to be at [event we're going to] tomorrow, and now how am I going to talk to her?! What will she think?!"" *She'll think your daughter has red hair... ? I mean, that's what I'd imagine.*

&gt; ""[creeper friend] is going to be at [event] tomorrow, and she wants to know how you managed to get an internship at [company]. She works there and she hasn't been able to get her niece and nephew internships there, so you have to tell her who your manager was so she can go talk to him and tell him to hire them for the summer!"" *So, 1: not doing that. 2: that's not even how internships work, you have to do multiple applications, interviews, and reviews before you get an offer. 3: if she works there, why can't she get them internships on her own? 4: I'd like to go back next summer, so I'm not going to be an idiot and let them take over my position. 5: this is really the niece and nephew's problems; if they want internships, they have to apply. Stop being lazy. 6: they're probably not getting internships because they're probably bad at interviewing, have crappy applications, or just don't know about the positions.*

&gt; ""[creeper friend] is going to talk to you tomorrow at [event], but you can't talk to her now because your hair is red! What is she going to think of me?! Okay, pretend like you don't know me tomorrow! *... what? Hell yes, you got it.*


So NMom told me to pretend like I don't know her. Because she's embarrassed by me and my single streak of discolored hair. So I have to stop associating with her in public now, lest I embarrass her and drag her pristine image down.


**Conclusion**

NMom saw my streak of colored hair and told me not to associate with her in public. I've been waiting for this day my whole life. :')


**Edit:** somebody gave me reddit gold?! Thank you, kind stranger! I'm feeling the love! :D


**Edit 2 (Post-Event Update):** I got tons of compliments on my hair, NMom was/is still pretty sore about it even though most of her friends gushed over it, EDad has taken to calling me his ""bird-of-paradise,"" (I'm not sure what this is, but okay), I did indeed see/talk to NMom's creeper friend, and some people I talked to are actually planning to get something similar done to their hair now.

So now I'm a trendsetter - watch out, Louis Vuitton; I'm coming for your job (kidding, because then everyone would perpetually be wearing sweats). Everyone have a wonderful weekend! ;D"
2hleau,2,2014-09-27,"I (22F) tried to do a favour for my brother (25M) and something went wrong, now he is blaming me and involving our mother.",Eleventeen132,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hleau/i_22f_tried_to_do_a_favour_for_my_brother_25m_and/,"Sorry about the wall of text, I'm a bit frazzled and I'm on a mobile. 

A month ago my brother who I am not close with asked me to look at his laptop. I have been trying to be nicer to him so I said I would see what I could do. 

He said screen was not working and I said I could ask to a friend who runs a computer repair business I used to work at to fix it. They told me they'd charge me parts and labour with no mark up which I relayed to my brother, I also gave him ballpark figures $300 - $500 for the parts. He dropped the laptop off at my house, it was much bigger than I had been led to believe and I told him it may cost more than I originally estimated. He just sort of dismissed me,(which i should have picked up on, I should have really emphasised this). 


From the start there were problems, the friend is one town over. I tried to arrange to get it to him whenever friends were driving there, and it fell through a few times until it had been at my house for 2 weeks, i contacted my brother and told him I was having trouble getting it to my friend, would he like the laptop back to use in the meantime with a monitor to hook it up to. He said no and when I reminded him of how much it may cost he balked and said I promised to do it for $300. I know a lot of people think I may have been unclear with him, but I have a Facebook message that says 

""it's going to cost labour and parts they charge $150 an hour and the screen could be between $300 - $500 maybe more depending on the laptop. ""

I don't think that means $300. So I said if he couldn't afford it I could just return it to him and he could find someone cheaper. He said no just do it. So I sent it with a different friend 2 days later. 

I found out my brother called the business and screamed at the intern who answered the phone about the laptop taking 3 weeks the day after they received it. They had to confirm he wanted the work done before they ordered in anything so they tried emailing him and calling but he didn't get back to them for a while. Today the laptop was finished and he picked it up, it ended up being $650.


He then went to our mother to complain and I got a call 40 minutes ago at work from my mother asking why this happened. 

Now the thing you have to understand about my mother is, she believes anything her children tell her and she sides with them, also she's not really let go of us as kids, the story she heard was my dodgy friend ripped off my brother and I need to fix this. I told my side of the story and said I was sorry it took so long that was my fault, but my brother was made aware of how much this was going to cost. 

I asked did he want money from me (he usually does, which is why we aren't close) He was sitting next to her on the phone, she said no (which I don't believe) and kept trying to go over what happened like she could somehow call someone's mommy and fix it. I got a bit mad and said I'm sorry it turned out this way, but what do they want me to do now? Because if it will make it go away I will pay him money. I got a bunch of illogical nonsense, "" next time something like this comes up you should let me know"" and things like that. Really what both of them wanted was to take out their anger on me and maybe be vindicated that I did bad and they did good. My father and my sister are normal reasonable people, but my my mother and my brother are the kind of people who come home from a rough day and scream at you for little imaginary offences to make themselves feel better. 

I am meant to be going to see my mother tonight, I offered to last week because my father is away and she needs help with yard work. She wants to discuss this further. I have not mentioned my brothers bad behaviour, screaming at the intern, hanging up on me when I tried to discuss this with him and not being willing to answer calls from the person repairing his laptop to her. And I don't think I will. It won't fix anything, I don't want her on my side I just want to move past this as fast as possible. I'm very embarrassed by what he did to someone who I asked to do this for him. I get the feeling when I said ""a friend"" could fix it he thought I meant some under the table dodgy deal to save money when I really meant "" this is what I can do, do you want it. ""


 I just need advice, any advice at all. How do I make this stop? What should I do in the future? Am I really at fault here?


TL;DR Got my brothers laptop fixed for him, he didn't like how much it cost so he got our mother to yell at me for it. I have to see her tonight, what the f@#k should I do?"

Pour yourself a drink - unsweetened ice tea or sparkling water if you abstain from drinking like I do - and settle in for another ominous tale of woe from your good friend, the endorsed contributor /u/trudatness.  As per usual I will give you yet another **TRUE** tale of female fuckery and beta dumbassery for you to digest and learn a life lesson from.

Bob was your average techie beta.  A technical writer by trade, a product from a divorced family living with his mother and sister and serving as the primary source of support for both.  Not very tall or that good looking, by anyone's standards the epitome of average in terms of looks.  Bob was one of those Super Nice Guys^TM.  He was bout 30 years old.  He wasn't overly masculine or assertive.  He was kind, gentle and perhaps a little shy. 

Mary was very bright girl.  She was smart, engaging, charismatic, petite, feminine and certainly attractive.  She had a history of chasing after alphas.  Not the worst carousel rider of all time, but she definitely had a list of past boyfriends, perhaps a dozen or so with ONS's sprinkled in-between who all had similar alpha traits.  The list was highlighted with your usual personas - the bad boy rebel without a cause, an air force fighter pilot, a player attorney, etc...  You get the picture.  All tall, well put together men.  All of whom, as you would figure, treated Mary poorly.  Some of them were downright abusive.  The last of which ripped earrings from her ears while she was wearing them *gasp!*  They all led Mary on.  A couple even got engaged to Mary (at her insistence).  None of them could be true to her, however.  It seems everyone Mary dated cheated on her or dumped her in some spectacularly bad way.  Things were getting bad for Mary.  She had just turned 30 years old, working as a math teacher and now was alone.

Then Mary met Bob and it was true love at first sight (for Bob).  Mary gushed about how Bob cooked a meal for her on one of their dates and arranged some of the food into a cute heart and the words *I Love You* on a plate.  Bob was thoughtful and sweet like that.  Finally a guy that *really* loved Mary and was truly *devoted* to Mary.  Mary was no longer afraid of ending up alone.  That sense of panic was eased.  Bob and Mary got married and had a little girl.  Aww...

Bob got a job with the school board so he could share hours with Mary.  He got into media and productions at the school and started teaching kids about video production.  Bob's father offered to pay for his master's degree, which he completed.  Bob's father also offered to pay for *Mary's* masters degree, which she completed.  

Things seem to be going pretty well, except that teacher's salaries, even ones with master's degrees, don't pay all that great.  Bob got the idea *Hey I know video editing and production...  Why don't we start filming weddings on the side to make extra money?*  So Bob spent a small portion of the family's savings and invested in some decent video equipment and began running ads.  Bob got a few jobs, kept getting better and better, and before he knew it he was working every weekend with weddings booked months in advance.

Money had started to get better now.  During this time Bob and Mary decided to save some of that money and buy a very nice house.  They stayed at Mary's parents for a short while - about 6 months - that's all it would really take to get into the house they wanted.  That's where the first sign of trouble for Bob and Mary surfaced.  Mary's mother caught Bob masturbating in the restroom.  Apparently Bob thought nobody was home.  Bob cited some sexual frustrations he was going through.  It was probably just because they were staying at Mary's mother's house.

But Bob's sexual frustrations continued after they moved into the new house.  Both before and after having their only child, Mary had a few miscarriages.  After seeing a few doctors, it became pretty obvious that having another child was probably not possible.  Upon hearing this news, Mary lost all interest in sex.  You see Bob was not like any of the men Mary traditionally dated.  Mary was never really all that physically attracted to Bob.  Bob was safe and liked to serve Mary and Mary liked that, but Mary never really had all that much passion for Bob.  

One day /u/trudatness overheard Mary let out a wicked cackle and say *Sex?  Bob never gets sex!*  Like it was the funniest thing ever.  *Uh-oh* /u/trudatness thought.  *There's trouble in paradise!*

After Bob and Mary moved into the new house, they decided to quit their jobs as teachers and focus on the business full time.  The business was growing and expanded beyond weddings and into other commercial forms of video production.  They were now netting over $250K annually.  Mary handled sales and marketing, Bob did the editing and technical work.  They both worked events and shot videos.  Still Bob was getting no sex.  As a matter of fact, months were turning into years.  Their marriage had a bad /r/DeadBedrooms type of feel to it.  

Bob was getting bitter.  Bob was getting angry.  He had a beautiful wife who wouldn't let him touch her.  So Bob stopped kissing Mary's ass all the time.  Bob started being a dick.  Bob was in a loveless marriage and he was smart enough to realize it.

By this point the business had grown large enough to require additional help with video editing.  Bob and Mary hired Sean - a newly graduated intern with a video productions degree.  Sean was 22, Bob and Mary are into their 40s at this point.  

The hiring of Sean coincided with the breakdown of the marriage (not that the two events were connected).  Bob was pretty much done.  Everyone thought Bob was an asshole for wanting out of what seemed to be a successful marriage - everyone except /u/trudatness and /u/trudatness's father.  We knew after several years of being incel, Bob had to get out of the marriage to salvage his pride and sanity.  

In the divorce, Bob got the business and Mary got the house and custody was 50-50.  Bob was ordered to pay child support and 2 years of alimony to make up for getting the business.  Mary convinced Sean the Intern to stay with her in her new business.  3 months after the divorce Mary started telling all their contacts and partners about the divorce and how much of an asshole Bob was for leaving her.  Bob's business cratered.  Mary's new business grew.

3 years later Mary and Sean, now a couple - he at 25 years old and her at 47 years old - just bought a $400K house in a gated community together.  Bob?  He's not doing that well.  He's still in business, if you want to call it that, but he's definitely not driving a Mercedes like Mary is.  I heard his kid hates him too.  I did hear that he's got a girlfriend now who has sex with him - so I guess he's got that going for him.

**TL;DR  Mary hits wall, marries Beta Bob.  A couple of years into the marriage stops putting out.  Marriage breaks down.  Mary steals business from Bob and starts fucking the intern**

I really don’t know where to post. First i went to /r/sex, then to /r/tifu but neither sub seems to be the right. /r/sex claims that it is a ""quite possibly the most commonly asked question"", while i don’t deny it, I don't want to spend 1h writing only to see my post deleted/ignored, as english isn't my first language.  /r/tifu is more focused on 'today', and has a overwhelmingly sexual content, ie my post would be trivial. So its /r/offmychest 

Lets start with some overall background. I never had any problems with getting erections. Im 23, understood what masturbation was at 10, started to use pornography at 11~13, and stumbled upon hentai at 18(i think). I was the typical computer nerd, had problems understanding social interactions, harbored the romantic idea of love, wrote poetry and was(?) ugly, like a 4/10. My parents were hardcore religious to the point my mother successfully converted half of the family. Meaning: no pre-marital sex, no dating people off the religious circle.  

My mother died of cancer when i was 17~18, and in the same year i got my first kiss. In the next year i left my parents home to college(computer science) in the next town, but still financially supported by my father. I had a new found freedom, but none of the discipline required to succeed at study, as i had gone through school/highschool with mostly intelligence(only a little bit of studying). I discovered that my father couldn't not support me financially(at least not entirely) as the year went by, so i landed a scholarship that helped cover half of my expenses. I was failing in college, as i immersed myself on mangas.  

I read, i read and i read. It was an addiction. At first i read the mangas in my native language. Then i started to read in english because of the availability. It was at least ~110 mangas between complete/ongoing, until i looked for professional help. Yes, i still read, but not with the frequency i used  to. 2 years lost, and my scholarship ended. As my scholarship was ending I, with knowledge that i couldn't rely on my father, I enrolled in a paid internship. Now this was sweet, because its pay covered 90% of my expenses. I was free of the clutches that relying on my father put into me. Still no recovery on the studying part of college. I was failing.  

In the internship. a friend introduced me reddit[...]

Sorry. I'm writing this a quite bit of time, already. I don’t like talking about my problems. While writing this has lifted a burden from my chest, I just cant go on talking about my life anymore. Its fucking depressing. I had my chances, i know it. I failed. I know it. I see that I'm whining, people have it harder. I'll keep it short.  

I'm thankful for what reddit did for me; i lost my virginity, got a girlfriend, thanks to what I learned from reddit. I had suicide thoughts when i was a teen, it persisted until i was 20, but only once i was really close. I can recognize that i have an addictive personality, because it was games-&gt;porn-&gt;animes-&gt;mangas-&gt;9gag-&gt;reddit. No, i do not want to face someone to tell those things above, its embarrassing and my problem dwells a little more than what im telling you, and if i dont want to share under anonimity, no fucking way that Im telling to someone face to face. 

I was sad. Now Im angry. I just wanted to get some advice because i cant get up with porn, i cant  maintain an erection with my girlfriend. I thought that you would need some background.  
I dont know why i cant get up. I have to let go of porn, and that's a given.  

I clearly have bigger issues, i know. Thanks for reading. I'm feeling better now.

2hlmfh,4,2014-09-27,[UK] How can I help out my not-so-wealthy lodger?,bananaphophesy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2hlmfh/uk_how_can_i_help_out_my_notsowealthy_lodger/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm a homeowner living in London, I live in a 2 bed flat and rent out a room. I'm looking for some advice for how I can help out my lodger, and also how I can navigate a delicate situation.

She is a 30-something year old immigrant who works in a coffee shop, but she just got a voluntary position at a research library which is her chosen career path.

She's been hinting that she's going to have to apply for a tax credit, because she's going to be working fewer hours. The alternative is that she may need to borrow money from her parents to pay the rent.

Now I'm tempted to offer another reduction, because it's great that she's doing the internship to help her move into work that she cares about. However I already reduced her rent a couple of months ago to a lower amount. This was basically because renting sucks and landlords are assholes - I wanted to get a friendlty housemate who makes a reasonable contribution to the mortgage, but who I'm not fleecing.

Also I'm reticent to take responsibility for her finances. She's said herself that she struggles with motivation, so if I make things easy for her she may just sit back and not really do anything with the volunteering opportunity...

So I'm not sure what to do. A few options that came to mind include:

* Don't say anything, but drop some hints that I might be flexible, forcing her to take responsibility for asking for help
* Look into her options for benefits, as an EU immigrant
* Be direct about it, and tell her I'm concerned that she may not be able to pay the rent level we agreed

Any ideas appreciated.

**TL;DR: Lodger has volunteering opportunity in preferred career path, but she may not be able to pay the rent. Should I help, or stay out of it?**

I'm a senior Finance/Accounting major and Computer Science minor.  I'm currently a trading intern, and I'm applying to some M.S. Financial Engineering / Computer Science programs for Fall 2015 admission. I hope to become a trader/developer for a proprietary trading firm or a hedge fund.  

I added my computer science minor just last semester, and the first language I learned was Haskell.  It took a while to start thinking more like a programmer, but eventually it clicked - Haskell made sense, and I genuinely enjoyed using it.  

I'm currently taking Data Structures, a course required for my minor, and it's taught using Java.  I don't know what it is - maybe it's just the fact that I started with a functional program and now I'm trying to learn object -oriented, but I can't seem to fully grasp the concepts as well as I did with Haskell.

For those of you with experience in the field, is Java heavily used?  I know R/C++/Matlab/Python are more common, but does anyone use Java at all in algo?  If not, I'm going to just get my A and not worry about getting too deep into detail, and I'll allocate my time towards learning a more relevant language.  "
2hmnew,223,2014-09-27,"I (43 F) messed up; I tried to introduce a co-worker (21 F) to my son (22 M), she's now in a relationship with my younger son (17 M), turns 18 in a month).",dumbmom13,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hmnew/i_43_f_messed_up_i_tried_to_introduce_a_coworker/,"I met ""Julie"" at my office, she interned for the summer. She seemed like a good girl.  She worked hard, was kind, and was also a very pretty girl.  We talked a lot, and I think we became friends.

My older son is ""Matt"", and my younger son is ""Lucas.""  They're polar opposites.  Matt's very introverted, while my Lucas is, while not being loud, very confident.  Matt had a girlfriend since he was 18 that he recently broke up with at the start of Summer, and Lucas has had multiple ""girlfriends"" that have lasted anywhere from a few days to a month.

Close to the end of her internship, Julie made a joke about setting her up with my son when she saw the picture I had of the two of them.  I ""jokingly"" went along with it, and invited her to dinner at my house with a few other co-workers.  I thought maybe Matt would be interested in her since he broke up with his longtime girlfriend at the beginning of the summer.  Matt seemed a little interested in her when I told him about the dinner.

When the dinner did come along, Matt was too shy, and he didn't manage to say too much to her.  Lucas, on the other hand, made everybody laugh, and I could tell he might have been interested in Julie because he was starting to focus in on her.  I didn't think she would reciprocate because of the age difference.  I was wrong.

It's been a  month and a half since that dinner, Julie's internship ended and I hadn't seen her until last night, at my son's football game (my son plays receiver, defense, and kick returner).  I asked what she was doing there and she says that my son invited her.  At first I got excited, because I thought Matt had impressed her enough for her to go on a date with him after all, but then I remembered that Matt wasn't there.  I didn't assume they were in a relationship right away because of the age gap, but I thought it could be a possibility.

I was sitting with a few of my friends with boys on the team, so I returned to my seat and checked my son's phone (he has me hold it during games because one time someone broke into the locker room and stole a lot of phones).  I hate to admit it but I decided to snoop, I knew his password was his birthday.

The texts confirmed my suspicions, they were in a relationship, and had been seeing each other since that night.  They had texted flirty things to each other, she even sent two pictures of her in panties and a bra asking which one he liked better,  I then got on my facebook, and saw that that Julie's public page said that they were in a relationship.

What do I do now?  Matt's been acting weird around Lucas, and hasn't been coming over as much.  Now that I know the two are dating, it's pretty obvious that he's jealous or upset.

I'm not really sure how I feel about Lucas and Julie's relationship, the age difference is weird to me.  However, this is my son's longest relationship ever as of now.  I talked to their dad about it and he doesn't have a problem with it.  Am I overreacting?  If I'm not, I can't give him the ultimatum of leaving her or else I'll kick him out because he'll move in with his dad and I really don't want that.

I haven't talked to Lucas yet.

Thanks for any help.

Tl;dr-I tried to setup an intern at my office with my older son, she's now in a relationship with my younger son.  Need advice/perspective on the situation.

Edit- I want to clarify that Matt definitely isn't anti-social, he's had a few dates after his relationship ended and has a good number of friends.  He also played football in school.  I don't think he really needs help with it."
2hmrtr,36,2014-09-27,I[28m] just wanted to surprise my LDR GF[23f] and it went horribly wrong.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hmrtr/i28m_just_wanted_to_surprise_my_ldr_gf23f_and_it/,"*Stacy*'s still in college, I'm a guy with a job. I attended a seminar at her college and we struck up a conversation. I asked her out soon and we started dating. We dated for 8 months. The relationship was great. Simply awesome. Then, she went for a semester + internship abroad. She'd be there for 6 months. 6 months is a lot of time and I decided that I'd give her the biggest surprise of her life.

Now, I was in love with her, and I wanted to marry her and be with her forever. I was slightly overweight guy working with a decent pay check - dating this sexy, beautiful, intelligent college girl. I wanted to change myself for her.

I worked very hard on changing myself completely. I started working out. I started making more connections at work. I was looking for a better apartment. I basically wanted to improve myself for her.

I wanted it all to be a surprise for her. So I mostly stuck to voice calls rather than Skype. When we did Skype I made sure that I was in a darker place so my physical changes wouldn't be apparent to her, although she did notice a little difference, but I told that off on my medication.

It took me six of the toughest months of my life. I had one goal in her mind, to be the perfect man for her. I sweated, I slogged, I killed myself working towards my goals. I went from a 92 kg slab of fat to a 74 kg ripped hunk. I had the body I had always dreamt of. Slick biceps, abs, leg muscles, and my skin was glowing. I felt 100x better. I went from a 5 figure to a salary to a 6 figure salary. I basically got a promotion at work, then because of that promotion I got noticed at another firm and started there with an even better pay check. I had a lot of money saved up. I upgraded to a Tesla (she's nuts about electric cars). I switched from a shabby apartment to the best penthouse I could've ever dreamt of (I dipped into my savings quite a bit there). 3 BHK with awesome views. For the first time, I felt like I was living life and not just scraping along.

When I went out with my friends to social gatherings, I felt the change. Girls who would ignore the fat guy sitting by the bar alone, now literally slobbered over me. I felt so fucking great. But I politely declined every advance, threw away every number. I did this for Stacy and I loved her.

But I still felt alone. I missed her a lot. We talked a lot. We kept the romance going. We cried on the phone many times.
 
Her flight arrived 3 days ago. I told her I was sick and that my brother will pick her up at the airport. She was a little worried when his car pulled up at a different building. I had instructed him to leave at the elevator and give her the directions to my place.

I was so excited, nervous and giddy at the same time. She opened the door and her eyes just widened. I mean they opened up BIIIG. She saw me standing there, she saw the penthouse, and she just stood there with her mouth gaping open. Then a little cry came from her throat. A little note of exclamation.

I moved in to hug her and kiss her, but she did nothing back. She just said - What the fuck ? softly. I asked her to come in and sit down so we could talk. She just stood there. She looked at me for a minute in disbelief, or that's what I'm calling it.

She then just kind of broke down and said in a stuttering voice ""This is too much"". She just kind of slammed the door shut and went out. I followed her, shocked. I asked her what was wrong. She just stood there in the elevator, tears running down her face. She pushed me out of the elevator.
I assume she hailed a cab back to her folks'.

Its been 3 days. I've called a trillion times, I've texted a trillion times. All I've gotten is a text ""Give me time"".

I did everything I could to give her a great surprise. Aren't people in relationships always strive to improve themselves for the other person ? I'm pissed. I'm sad. This is the hardest I've ever worked, and all for nothing.

Where to go from here ?

I've finished removing Cryptowall, done system restore, and 50% through restoring over 100GB of important data through W7 previous versions when I give the client a call with a progress update. ""Sounds great!"" she says. ""Don't worry about the cost!"" she says. ""Hey, did you manage to get $this picture from $that folder?""

""uhm, lemme look."" I click on the folder and the restore flips out. ""Hmm, it looks like it's still trying to restore that folder so I'm not sure I want to poke it too much right now."" ""OK just let me know"" I hang up and try again. There's no restore dates available, where it had previously had a few months worth. ShadowExplorer only shows three dates, all from today. Looks like Previous Versions is confused. Is there any way to get it straight again? Are there any utilities (windows or otherwise) that I could use to make this restore process quicker and more painless? Side note, I'm already restoring from a backup I made the minute she handed it to me.

----

Story time: I'm a sysadmin/Citrix engineer by day so I don't really do a lot with viruses anymore. Last I heard, without a backup the concensus was to pay up and hope they send the right encryption key. Later I realized that was CryptoLocker. I proceeded to bash her hopes and expectations into the ground (better to be pleasantly surprised than surprisingly disappointed) saying that this could get expensive. She heads over to OfficeMax because reasons and the topic comes up in conversation. The kid wants her to call me and let me know that under no circumstances should I pay it and he'd be happy to look at it. This is the equivalent of going to a surgeon, then getting a second opinion from a pharmacy intern. She's concerned about her data and he's trying to make a sale, I get it. I let it slide; not worth getting upset about. But here's the thing: He's *convinced* that Cryptowall is a hoax. ""It doesn't actually encrypt the files. It encrypts the firewall, keeping the data from getting out."" I'm going to paraphrase the rest since his sentences didn't actually parse but essentially Cryptowall is exactly the same as the FBI virus and that it just changes the file extensions and their default programs so that windows doesn't know how to open it anymore.

I didn't react since not only was I busy but my arguments based on experience would not have made it through to the other side. Also because I remember saying most of those things way back when.

Good luck, kid, but you might want to get a little more experince."

I am not a social person, have been depressed for over 2 years, and been using antidepressants for 1 year. I recently graduated from school and got  an internship. It's been going decent. I can't say I've been having fun, but I didn't expect to either. Anyway, the department was having a party, and it was one of the best nights in my life, with lots of laughing, drinking and smiling.

People were so supportive and accepting of me, and I was so happy. One of the female co-workers danced with me when everyone had left, and gave me advice on how to dance. Before the two of us went to the nachspiel hotel room, she stopped me and said I didn't need to be afraid of asking for advice or questions, because I seemed so shy. It was a very ""personal moment"", which I don't have a lot of. 

The evening was great, I didn't know I am actually working with so many fantastic and fun people before last night. 

Now that it's over, I'm just sitting here, sad, thinking: ""Why can't it be like this all the time? Why do I need to go to a party where everyone accepts just to have fun, and feel? It can't be like this all the time. When I go to work on Monday I will be the same quiet person. But I don't want it to be like that. I want everything to be like it was that night, everyone was so accepting of each other, talkative, kind and personal. It was great. Now I'm sad.

I don't really know what I'm feeling. This is the first time I've cried so much since I was a kid. I'm having a lot of mixed feelings right now, and I don't know if the crying is because I'm sad or happy. I dont know.  

I'm really sorry if you feel that this post is pointless, or you don't understand it. I will probably delete it if you feel so, I'm just having an emotional rollercoaster at the moment.

The reasons are generally due to a feeling of non-direction in life, not feeling successful compared to those around me, and just not really having close friends or feeling loved.

When I was studying in Korea last year, I met a girl and when I went back to America we decided to have a long distance relationship.  Since being with her, I've only had one day of being severely depressed in 2 months.  However, now the depression is starting to kick in again.  

It just feels like nothing is going right for me, I'm in Senior year of university, I've never had an internship or proper job, however I plan on teaching in Korea to save some money and be with my gf again.  However, now I'm worried I might not even be able to graduate..my grades are starting to suck horribly, and this is even while I'm trying.  I hate feeling stupid compared to those around me, I used to always be the smart one who made high grades, but now suddenly after coming back from exchange program, I've made a 64/100 on a CALC 1 EXAM, calc 1...should be easy right..? Made a C- on the most basic Macroeconomics, made a C on an exam for a class related to my major, and am completely failing Literature because i just don't understand it.  

On top of all of this, I actually did manage to get interviewed for an internship, but as soon as that happens, my car completely dies, and i don't have money to fix it, this leaves me unable to actually go to my job which means i'm probably forced to decline it.

Through all of this, waiting till 8-9pm or so to talk to my girlfriend when she wakes up is probably the one thing I look forward to everyday..and I don't want her to know I'm depressed, I've always been happy towards her and she thinks im a happy person, I don't want to ruin her image of me.

Part of the reason I absolutely love Wendell is because of his personality. He is not boastful about his skills, unlike some of the other. He is very kind hearted and down to Earth. He more than just his brain. What I mean is he has other interests besides bones and his jobs. He is very humble. He doesn't come from a lot and I believe this has humbled him. I also find him very attractive.

Fisher reminds me a little of myself. He finds something negative to say about anything! I am exactly like that. I also love how he does not care that his negativity bothers those around him. he knows who he is and he rolls with it!

Dr. Nigel-Murray is by far the most adorable intern of all. He is cute in a totally different way than Wendell. The way he gets excited about knowledge and it is so cute. I love that he spouts off random facts that has nothing to do with anything going on with the case. Even though it annoys people he still does it because that is how he copes with things. 

So tell me, who is your favorite intern (or interns)."
2hnxuy,0,2014-09-27,19[F4F] Anywhere - Shy Nerdy Girl Looking for Someone Perfect for a LDR,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/2hnxuy/19f4f_anywhere_shy_nerdy_girl_looking_for_someone/,"Hi,

Before I say anything I must make it clear that I have a boyfriend. I'm looking for a girl who is OK with that and willing to be a part of MY open relationship. He isn't going to be involved, but you must be OK with my man knowing and being in the same room with me when we voice chat or something. We are in an open relationship and 
hes OK with me having someone of my own. So please don't try to take him away from me or down talk him.

I found out that I was newly bisexual after posting lurking on Reddit and loving what other woman look like or say to me. I decided it was a good idea to just go ahead and do it! :D You will be my first girl! I have no experience online dating or being the leader when it comes to dating. I have never experienced anything sexual or romantic with a female either. 

I'm an avid PC gamer, and I would love it if you were too. I love to play games like WoW and LoL, but I have a bunch of other titles and I'm always willing to try other things. I love shooter and any games with zombies. I LOVE zombie games. My boyfriend is very close to me when I game, so if we get to playing and you hear him yell or laugh and if your OK with it we can play with him too. I'm a nerd at heart and I love to read as well. Since I was a little girl I have always loved Harry Potter and other fantasy stories. Right now I love the Hunger Games and anything with vampires or zombies, I also love post apocalyptic stores and films.

I LOVE music. I absolutely love heavy metal. I go to concerts when ever I can. I love numerous bands with Machine Head, In Flames, Trivium, and Rammstein when it comes to metal. I also enjoy EDM and dubstep. I also like acoustic rock, and love songs.

Appearance wise I am a caucasian blonde curly haired cutie. I'm fairly chubby and short with large breasts and a big butt :D (I was told that I should include that ?) I've been told that I'm super sweet and kind. I have strong opinions, but I accept other peoples ideas. I'm very intelligent and would love for you to be too. I'm currently
a college student studying finance and have a internship in a finance department. I love numbers and real life problem solving. (Nerd alert) Sometimes I can be pretty boring and spacey, just pick my brain to find something fun! I LOVE to chat. I'm super shy and not a horndog, but open sexually if it comes to that. I'm not a prude either. I 
have my own cute little dog and cat and love kids. 

I live on the border between Iowa and Nebraska in the US and my timezone is Central US (CST). I'm available sometimes when I'm at work to chat occasionally, but I don't get home from class and work until 9PM and many nights I will be doing homework late into the night, so don't be supprised if I disappear :/ I would LOVE for you
to be available on the weekends, especially the evenings so we can chat or play games or something. Please don't be one of those woman who are scared to talk to me or that disappear and don't make me feel like I'm not around.

For what I am looking in a woman is similar to me. Intelligent, a gamer who is willing to go out of the way to play with me once in awhile :D, a nerd or geek, and open sexually. I'm looking for someone who isn't super skinny, because I am not. :D Preferably white or Asian. And you need to be feminine like me. I LOVE long hair. I also love boobies and butts :P I want you to be OK with my man. Please be clean and drug free or at least don't talk to me about them. (They gross me out.) I don't need a single woman, but I don't want you to have tons of online relationships either, I want to feel special.Please be between the ages of ( 19-25). I'd love to laugh with you and discuss anything. I'm very open sexually and I hope you are too. I don't mind much personality wise, just don't be pushy and please be interested. I just want a cute girl to be romantic with
and maybe someday love. I want someone who I can send pictures to of clothes, outfits and dorky faces too. I love to be told I'm
cute, beautiful, dorky, or even sexy. 

I really want a new best friend, a girlfriend, and someone fun!

Sorry for the long read its just everything I need to say! PM me if interested. I'm OK with trading pics and I'll trade chat info and name after we get talking. Serious offers only. NO MEN!

2ho0i1,14,2014-09-27,My mom [55] is controlling and possessive and is driving me [20] the direction of wanting to leave my home and venture out on my own,tiredaf369,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2ho0i1/my_mom_55_is_controlling_and_possessive_and_is/,"To start off, I am from a family of 6, my mom, dad [56], and three sisters [24,21,16].  Seeing as I am 19, I fall third in line.  Growing up, I became accustomed to my mom getting mad at me for no reason, ignoring me if I did something to make her mad, and always apologizing for things that weren’t necessarily my fault because she made me feel guilty. During these times of her anger, whoever it was directed at (even my dad) all of us would follow in her lead and treat the person like they did not exist.  It was basically 5 against 1 until that person apologized. A lot of the time, I didn’t know why I was supposed to be angry, but I just followed suit.  

 However, being a child, I did not recognize that this was wrong. It was not until I got to college and met my boyfriend [19] that I realized this behavior because I mirrored a lot of it, and it in turn upset him.  He was confused as to why I acted this way until my mom started to show her true colors the summer before my sophomore year of college (summer ’14).  

I am a biology major and received an awesome paid internship this summer.  I was making way more than my normal summer job that both my younger sister and I worked.  When I told my mom I got it, the first thing she said was, “how is [sister 4] going to get to work?” I felt guilty about it and tried figuring out ways to get both myself and my sister to our places of work and keep everyone happy. However, for that, I would need a car. I only had about 4,000 dollars in the bank, so I would have had to invest in a cheap used car. So I went on Craigslist to look for a car because my boyfriend and his brother had an awesome experience finding theirs.  I went to my dad who was all for it…. Until he talked to my mom, at which point that was a no go. But I pushed on and got one at a used car dealership. And my mom actually admitted that I made a good choice. After all that fighting, I finally got some approval.

Now the next dilemma was the one that caused everything to go downhill. Every summer, I go to my aunt’s farm. So I made the plans the start of summer. In the beginning of August, I had a chance to go to Virginia to see Motley Crue (one of my favorites!) play in Virginia and we would have VIP tickets. I would be going with my boyfriend’s family.  The only problem is that I would have to come home from my aunt’s two days earlier. My mom said I could go, but since I already made plans, I couldn’t.  I told her I would take the train and come back in time for the concert. She laughed and when I continued to push, she said I’m a grown up and can make a decision.  

So I made a decision to go with the reason being I go to my aunts every year, and sitting VIP watching the Crue was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Cue the yelling, calling me a jerk, and ignoring me. The same day, I went downstairs to stand up for myself. I said that I don’t get a lot of support from her and so on. She SCREAMED. SO MUCH. She told me that I don’t support her and I make her look like a fool and so on.  She also said that when I move back into school, she won’t worry about me and I won’t worry about her. That was the last time we had a full blown conversation other than “hello” and “good-bye.” I tried being an adult like she said and she did not support me. I know she did not have to like my decision, but the fact I was exiled for it is ridiculous. 

It’s been over a month and my oldest sister now feels she has a say in it. She said she wants to “help” me. Only her “help” is telling me that I am wrong, everyone thinks so, I am stubborn, and no one likes me anymore. And to have a happy life with my boyfriend who I don’t even know (we’ve been together over a year).  

I’m looking for advice on my situation.  I am at a loss of what to do. I want to leave and get an apartment for summers and be on my own if it is going to go this way. There are a plethora of situations that have occurred but I only choose to list a few. There are hundreds more. 

TL;DR: My mom is psycho.

2hofwv,2,2014-09-28,Am I the only one who doesn't have everything figured out at this point in my life (23M)? Because it definitely seems everyone else does...,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2hofwv/am_i_the_only_one_who_doesnt_have_everything/,"23M, graduated college from a top university a year ago. I know the title screams contrivance and exaggeration, but when literally every single one of my friends seems to have it all ""figured"" out, it's hard to rationalize to myself why I am still completely and utterly unsure as to what it is I really want to do.

For the past 4-5 years as an undergrad and recent graduate, I've gotten experience in the field that I thought I was interested and passionate about -- I worked internships in school and then moved my way up upon graduating by getting full time offers at various firms, but I am slowly realizing that the people in it are miserable and this is not a field I can see myself lasting in for a sustainable amount of time.

Every.single.one.of my close friends seem to have it all figured out. Three of my best friends from undergrad took the EE/CS route and are making 100k+ jobs in silicon valley (think: google, amazon, etc.) -- they earned their degrees and worked hard and are justifiably reaping the benefits. My other two close friends are pursuing incredibly well-regarded law schools and med schools, respectively. I know not all of them have it completely figured it out, but at least they are either establishing a financial basis to pursue their own interests and side projects on the side without worrying about money (eg the three who landed the mecca gigs in sv), or are on a respectable path and actually pursuing something (eg the latter two going to graduate school in very good programs).

""Don't compare yourself to your peers"" -- As much as I would like to believe this, it's kind of hard when the only ""peers"" and closest friends you have are all doing amazing things. I don't feel entitled to anything -- I simply worked hard in a field I thought I was interested in, but one that ultimate did not work out for me. I realize this is only temporary, but damn if I don't envy at least having some semblance of a plan in life...I know objectively there are tons of others out there (older, even) who feel this way, but it's hard to remain optimistic about the future when ""everyone else"" that I care about is on the up and up and I feel back on broke, directionless, square one."
2hpj9l,2,2014-09-28,GF(22F) and I (24M) broke up because I moved away. Worried I'll have trouble moving on because I'm going to be moving frequently.,throw4949,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hpj9l/gf22f_and_i_24m_broke_up_because_i_moved_away/,"GF (22F) of ~2.5 years and I (24M) broke up a week ago because I moved 8 hours away for school.  We had a generally healthy relationship but mutually decided before I moved that we'd break up once I moved due to the long distance and the fact she didn't want to live where I was moving to.  We ended the relationship under good terms and even talked about the possibility of maybe getting back together someday if we ever ended up living nearby each other again (which is very unlikely).

I've been having a really rough time dealing with the breakup and think I'm probably going to have trouble moving on.  The problem is, due to my school and internship schedule I'm likely going to be moving to different places 4 times over the next year and a half or so.  I feel like don't really want to try to start another relationship now, knowing any relationship would probably end pretty quickly when I start moving all over the place.  I think talking to other girls and going on dates would help me move on, but I don't want a relationship that will almost certainly end like my last one, and I'm not really interested in super casual dating or hook ups or anything like that.

I'm worried I'm going to hung up for a long time on her and the possibility of somehow getting back together even though I know it's extremely unlikely/next to impossible (there's virtually no jobs in my field where she lives).  I don't want to be stuck thinking about her for months, but don't really feel interested in trying to date again until I stop moving around so much.  I also think I'll have trouble just enjoying being single for the time being as I don't know anyone here and it takes me a long time to make friends, and I think even with friends I'll have trouble with this.  How can I move on with my life and stop thinking about her so much?

TLDR: GF and I broke up because I moved away.  I'm going to move 4 times over the next year a half, so I don't really want to try to start dating again until thats over, worried I'll have trouble moving on from my past relationship."
2hpk9f,4,2014-09-28,"Me (23F) and boyfriend (28M) together 4 years, breakup because relationship is stifling him",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hpk9f/me_23f_and_boyfriend_28m_together_4_years_breakup/,"My boyfriend, well ex I guess, would have been together for nearly 4 years this November. We've had our ups and downs, the most notable downs being we've broken up for about a week nearly every spring due to his issues with me (these mostly are to do with me making him feel guilty about things). I am going to try and give as much background as I can but I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense; I'm really torn up by this situation and its fresh.

We started dating shortly before I turned 20 and he turned 25. I was a year and a half short of getting my undergrad in psychology. He was working a couple part time jobs while he decided to figure out what to do with his life. I moved into his moms with him, moved out a couple months later and into my own place, and he moved in with me. 

At this point I encourage him to finish his undergrad in business, what he had originally wanted to do. He gets in and out of school, gets his degree, but is unable to find a job. Is unemployed for almost a year before doing code training. He is now in a decent amount of debt from schooling, old credit cards, old medical bills, etc. During this time he has also had problems with alcohol and pot abuse. After finishing code training a couple months ago he gets a very well paying job at a local company and has begun paying off his debt. He is still living with his mom but she is moving out and the house will now be his.

During this time I graduated, decided I didn't want to pursue my master's in psych, worked as a front end web developer, and started up a very rigorous local design program so that I can do front-end development and user experience design. Over the summer I got a very well paying internship and worked full time. I am financially independent. I still have no debt and am on track to graduate top of my class. 

I have my issues (mostly emotional stuff from childhood parental death and sexual abuse), but I have worked hard to become successful. I know I am a good girlfriend. I have a lot going for me—I am smart, funny, talented, attractive... I can't name many people that don't like me or that I don't get along with. 

Last night my boyfriend broke up with me because he wants to be alone. He says now that he finally has a job he wants to get his life sorted out. I understand this logically. He is almost 29 and is just now going out into the real world. For me, emotionally, it is hard to come to terms with. I think what have we been doing all these years of not helping each other become who we are today. I have made many sacrifices to make sure he is okay. I am hurt that he thinks our relationship is the reason that he isn't growing as a person (instead of the more obvious alcohol and pot abuse) and I am hurt he doesn't want me there. 

He says he still loves me, that it's not me, that I'm a good girlfriend. And I know it's stupid and wrong but I just feel like if I could be a better girlfriend he wouldn't break up with me. He acknowledges that he doesn't treat me right and so that is good to hear. He told me he doesn't want me to wait around for him, but the thought of me with other people doesn't make him happy either.

I am happy to wait around for him though. I've got my friends and family and work. I don't need a guy to make me happy, it's just this particular guy that I love to pieces. I don't want to be without him. I don't know what to do. I need advice on what to do. Has anyone been in a situation like this before? Did it turn out okay?

TL;DR Boyfriend's life is finally starting to come together, he says he now needs to be alone. I'm hurt this is the case when we have stuck together through thick and thin but I understand. I just want him to come back. Not right now but when he is ready. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Am I waiting on a lost cause?"
2hpnsa,3,2014-09-28,Need some advice on buying a used A4.,ezkirb,Audi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Audi/comments/2hpnsa/need_some_advice_on_buying_a_used_a4/,"I'm in the market for a used car to get between school, work and an internship, a friend of mine contacted me about his B6 A4. The car is a 2002 A4 quattro 1.8t with 124k on the odo. My friend is the second owner and a certified VW/Audi mechanic and has done all the maintenance. He has replaced the timing belt, clutch and water pump all in the last 5,000 miles. There's few minor mods including coilovers, a front mount intercooler, 710n diverter valve, snub mounts, 3"" catalyst delete, 2.5"" downpipe and 17"" alloy rial wheels. Before he let's it go he needs to replace one of the rear control arms which he already has the parts for, repair the emergency brake which jams, and re-seal and charge the A/C which isn't currently working. He's asking $4,000 and will include the stock wheels with tires. Being a long time friend of mine he said he would help me out with any future maintenance it needs.

I've never been a ""car guy"" but would be interested in getting a nicer car I can learn about and add little things to so it seems like a good deal to me, but I am wondering if any of you audi pros have any tips on what I should check out on the vehicle or any maintenance I should ask him about.

A friend of mine recommended this subreddit and I've been looking at this subreddit for a few weeks and I've found it helpful already. I'm looking for support and advice because I've been at a breaking point for a very long time and as I gain more independence my dad seems to be getting meaner and meaner. I really just need a place to rant and hopefully get some advice and I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong or that's not allowed. Anyway.
I don't even really know where to start because there's just so much. 
I guess I should explain why I want to get my mom out, because she's my first priority. 
My mom has MS and is tetraplegic (meaning paralyzed from the neck down). She requires a ventilator and 24 Hour care. She is still mentally functioning. 
My dad has been cheating on my mom for two years. He has total control of my moms finances and has been spending her money on said girlfriend(s). My mom has no idea. 
My dad calls himself sole caregiver but he's not. She has a PSW from 7-5, a different PSW from 5-11 and a night nurse. Even before that help he wasn't really her sole caregiver, I arguably was more of a caregiver than he was.
I was taught to catheterize her when I was 10, most nights it was my job to put food in her mouth when she had no use of her hands and I would eat after everyone else had left the table. I did all kinds of little things like put on her audiobook, reposition her, etc. He put her to bed at night sometimes and that was it. I'm not going to pretend like I never lost my patience with her because when I was 14 there were times (and I still feel bad about this) that I gave her attitude about helping her and made her feel bad but I stopped doing that a long time ago when I learnt methods of calming myself. It was a great relief when we started getting nurses.   
My dad has said multiple times that ""his girlfriends help him forgive his wife (my mom)"" and he goes into detail about how my mom wronged him by having a career and leaving him at home with me and then getting sick, even though my moms disability and my minimum wage job plus whatever work I can get from the classifieds in my spare time is our only income. My dad has not had a job the entirety of my lifetime despite having a law degree (his law degree is no longer valid). 
My dad waited 8 years for a kidney at which time he did nocturnal dialysis. This meant he was attached to a machine at night and very tired during the day. He's had a kidney for 2 years and I thought that would make him nicer but it really didn't. It just gave him the courage to go out and cheat on my mom. 
He's asked me to get him viagra/cealis by essentially asking my doctor to commit insurance fraud, subsequently risking my moms insurance which pays for whatever care she needs that OHIP doesn't cover. He got mad at me when I told him I wouldn't. He'll only take me places if his girlfriend happens to be going the same place (sidenote: I don't think his girlfriend knows the extent of any of what he does because he took my guitar without my permission to give to her because she wanted to learn and as soon as she found out it was mine and he hadn't asked she gave it back. She's not evil and doesn't hold any blame for any of this. I just want to make that clear). For example, I had to get a test on my lower intestine because I have digestion issues and he would only drive me home afterwards because his gf wanted to go to a nearby mall. 
My digestion issues make it very hard for me to eat. I can't eat meat because I can't digest it. Everything that's quick to make in this house has meat in it because my dad won't buy vegetarian stuff even if I ask. I also passed out from pain in the 11th grade at school because my dad had told me my stomach pain wasn't as bad as I was making it out to be. It turned out my appendix was rupturing. It exploded on the operating table. Anyway.
My dad has never shown up to any of my bands shows, any of my graduations, anything really that meant something to me. On top of that he always blames his not showing up on me. This was especially hurtful when it came to my high school graduation because I paid for his ticket and he said he would come. He didn't show up because he wanted to have lunch with his friends.
All through out my childhood CPS would check in because he hit me in the face with a textbook when I was 8 and it gave me a black eye. He also used to drag me across the carpet by my feet until I had rugburn. This ended when CPS stepped in. The CPS visits stopped when I was 16 and he tried to kill my dog. I left and I spent one semester of the tenth grade homeless. He found me because I had been staying at an Occupy camp. He came down and verbally accosted me and told me I was a bad daughter because I didn't know my mom was in hospital. I was told if I wanted my mom to come home I would have to move back in with my parents. 
On top of all this, I have PTSD from a rape which occurred when I was 15. He constantly gaslights me and then won't leave me alone. I used to cut as a coping method but he told me if I cut he was going to cut himself. It's been a little less than a month since I've cut and it's been very hard.
He always puts me down. He takes my food and then criticizes it. He told me I couldn't be an urban planner and would only let me take my second choice which was journalism. That was the only way he'd pay for school. Just this morning he stopped me from playing my ukelele because he was sleeping (it was 12:30PM on Sunday morning on my only day off). When I come home from work the first thing he asks me is where is my paycheck. He made me take down a lot of my YouTube videos of me singing because my face was not in focus and he also made me take down my ALSIcebucket challenge video because he thought I was showing too much skin. 
I moved out from April-August (if you can call it moving out. It really didn't matter where my address was because I worked an internship from 9-5 and a job from 6-3 and really only got 3 hours of sleep on average). and he told me that I was a liar and that I had manipulated my best friend at the time because she wanted me to move in with her. But the reality of the situation was 1) he had cut off the in internet in Feb and I needed internet because my internship was at a website and 2) she invited me to live in her apartment because her boyfriend left her and no one was using the apartment because her mom had moved her out due to a substance abuse problem.     
My dad has put me down and controlled me to the point where I don't even fight back anymore. I just nod and cry silently when I go to bed. When I was a kid he used to make me ask before I ate anything and if he said yes he would sit over me and tell me how bad whatever I was eating (he still guilts me while I'm eating). Even if it's a salad he'll tell me it doesn't have enough substance. He'll find something wrong with everything. As a result whenever I'm with friends I feel the need to ask to eat and if there's no one around who I'm close enough with to ask, I'll skip meals. I'm getting better about that though. Now if my friends are eating I take that as a cue that I can eat without asking.  
He has 3 closets and entire couch and a basement and a garage but I'm only allowed to store my stuff in my room which used to be a walk in closet and he constantly tells me how cluttered it is. 
If I'm sad he'll tell me I'm too emotional or I'm on my period. During a panic attack I made the bad decision telling him I was raped and his literal reaction was ""why didn't you tell me 5 years ago""
It's like I'm not allowed to do what I love, I'm not allowed to eat, I'm not allowed to have things, I'm not allowed to come home from work unless I have a paycheck in my hand, I'm not allowed to have feelings. There is nothing I can do that isn't free of criticism. I've tried to bring up asking him to loosen his grip a bit but he always shuts me down. 
And meanwhile I feel guilty because idk how I can get my mom away from this without telling her. I know she's at the end and I want her last days to be worry free and for the most part I think I've done the best job I can doing that (I kiss her cheek every morning, I watch movies with her, I go outside with her, I make sure her friends know when the best time to visit is.). I see her smile a lot and I know if she knew about what my dad does it'd hurt her and make her feel worse than she does (she's told me she thinks shes a bad mom) and I really want to get out of here.

My first bachelors I was fortunate to not have to use any loans so I am currently not in any debt.

I have ~$17k saved up and my plan for the next three years is outlined below. I am currently living with parents so living expenses is minimal. Misc expenses will have to be food + gas.

2016 community college tuition + misc expenses = $8k

2017 university tuition $15k + misc $6k = $21k

2018 university tuition $15k + misc $6k = $21k

Total spent = $50k
Total savings = $17k

Total loans needed = $33k

A few questions.

1. Do my numbers add up?

2. I won't need loans until I enter the university, however do I need to start pulling loans now since the federal loans are limited to ~$6 - 7k a year?

Ideally, I would like to find a paid internship that would help offset the costs of school, so the $33k in loans would be worst case scenario.

In addition, I am currently working and going to school right now, making $17/hr however I will have to quit either within a few weeks or when next semester starts. The full time work is negatively impacting my school work. On the other hand, having income is nice."

I am currently a junior in computer science at a university and have pretty good proficiency in Java, C, C#, and Python. I recently attended a career fair and so many employers want Javascript. I talked to my advisor about this and unfortunately my university doesn't offer anything directly on Javascript, we don't focus on learning languages as much as we do the concepts as most languages follow the same concepts but not the same syntax. He did point me in the right direction though (I hope). I am currently reading through a book he gave me called ""Secrets of the Javascript Ninja"" by John Resig and Bear Bibeault and I am walking through the Code Academy and Khan Academy tutorials currently. I hope to have a website up and running within a few weeks if possible just to show at least basic knowledge with my larger goal of having a pretty good base in javascript by the end of winter so I can try to land some web development internships. 

So my question is, what other resources would you recommend? I'm enjoying the book so far the Code Academy course is rather basic so far ( I presume it will pick up the farther I get into it). Is my time frame of a website in a few weeks and a decent proficiency level by winter reasonable? Thanks for any help, I'll go ahead and sub to this subreddit so I can try to get up to date on news with Javascript."

2hreby,1,2014-09-29,This is hard to figure out...,ogcm,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/2hreby/this_is_hard_to_figure_out/,"I smoke everyday. Even when I have no weed I still manage to get high. When I have no weed, I scour, quite pathetically, my own and my roommate's room. I take weed from my roommate when he isn't around. I am disgusted with my behavior. I've never stolen anything, except a few legos from class when I was in kindergarten and food left too long in the fridge, and I've started making this behavior a habit.

I feel like I need to smoke so much because I have no motivation or creativity when I am not high. I never used to feel this way until I started using smoking as my muse. My life is dedicated to being creative (I am in school for design, recently acquired a pretty intense internship at a studio, and I make music on the side) and for about a year and a half I have been smoking nearly every day to help me do as much good work as I can.

However, the side effects of being high all the time include being late to class often, having a horrible sleeping schedule, wasting a lot of my time just trying to make sure I can get high when I really have no means to, putting smoking before productivity, and most recently, feeling like a degenerate with my behavior. And so in reality, I'm not really doing a lot of work, let alone good work. 

(e:last minute addition) I do fine in school grade wise, I'm even holding down a decent scholarship. I don't suffer socially, and even when I am stoned out of my mind barely anyone would be able to tell. I am a fully functioning stoner. But that's about all I function as, just someone doing a little above average things while completely blitzed, and I don't like it. I can be so much more. I feel held back by weed, but weed helps me be more comfortable which helps me achieve things, but then I really don't achieve as much as I could, and this is just a vicious circle. I can't tell what is really beneficial. Ugh, my mind is all over.

I just began a great relationship with an amazing girl within the past two months, I'm in the process of quitting smoking cigarettes, and I feel like weed should be next on the list. But god damn does it seem impossible. I honestly think my addiction to weed is worse than nicotine. Quitting cigarettes is like ""eh,"" but quitting weed makes me think, ""what the fuck am I going to do?"" It scares me.

I know exactly why I shouldn't do all this. Because I know I can be as creative as I need to be or want to be without weed, but being high is instantly gratifying and even when I don't get the inspiration I am looking for I am still satisfied. Pretty much I can't deal with the possibility that I will fuck up, even though my potential is evident and I have proven to myself I have what it takes to really love my work and love myself on my own. I know I need to fuck up to move forward, but I'd rather be high and fucking up than taking it like any regular ambitious person with a clear mind and making my mistakes a part of me.

I can nitpick myself and objectively point out every obvious negative thing about my situation all day, but at the end of the day I can't apply what I know I need to do. It really hurts to not be able to listen to myself.

Thanks for reading."
2hrsfh,30,2014-09-29,Looking for someone who has gone through the same as me (F21) Please help. BF is M21,whatcanido43,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hrsfh/looking_for_someone_who_has_gone_through_the_same/,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year, and it was the most exciting and fun relationship ever. I’ve only been in one relationship before him, which was completely different compared to this. 


Me and my current boyfriend did the craziest and most memorable things together, we had amazing nights and amazing sex. My favorite memories were in my previous apartment that I lived in for 3 months. Unfortunately I had to move out, but I now live in another apartment with him. 


For the past 3-4 months I’ve been really depressed, because I remember the memories and adventures we had, that we don’t have anymore. Whenever I listen to music he introduced me to back then, or music we discovered together I just break down and cry. I can’t explain to you guys how much I miss it. Every single thing. 


My boyfriend hasn’t changed. We just don’t do as memorable stuff, because he is currently interning. I know I am being unfair. But it’s really making me sad. The thing is though, I’ve had this depression on/off for a long time. I miss the past, and I feel like I spend my whole day missing the past. Not only my past with him, but just simple memories and feelings I had with friends  and so on. 


I’ve tried talking to him about it, but I don’t think he can relate. He loves me a lot and I try and support him as much as I can because I know he is stressed with the internship. 


I definitely believe there is something wrong with my brain and not the relationship, because I can’t believe anyone can just break down and cry for hours after listening to a song just because it brings back happy memories.


Does anyone know what’s wrong with me? Has anyone tried something similar? What should I do? 



**TL;DR: I live in the past, and I can’t seem to enjoy the present.**

2hs6ia,64,2014-09-29,I [24/F] am homesick and got a great job offer in my home country. But my bf [30/M] is not thrilled.,movingrelationship,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hs6ia/i_24f_am_homesick_and_got_a_great_job_offer_in_my/,"I am an American living in Europe for the past four years. I started out in Germany as an Au Pair, got an internship at a great company in my field, and was finishing up my degree when I met my boyfriend over a video game. He is from another EU country. We hit it off instantly. I absolutely LOVED living in Germany. I love the Germans, the culture, the food, everything. I speak the language fluently and had a lot of friends there.

Well, a few months into our dating (about 7 months in) my internship suddenly dissolved and I was facing the chance of being deported back to the US. This wasn't something I wanted. I was only a few months out of finishing my BFA and didn't want to leave the country I loved, or the man I loved behind. We had been flying to one another at least once a month to visit for the 7 months we were dating. My boyfriend then asked me to move in with him in his home country because I could easily gain a visa there. I thought it was great. I'd get to experience another country, see my bf every day, finish my degree, and we'd take it from there. Well.. no.

His country has a program where you sign up to be on a government subsidized housing plan. The list is about 7 years long and he finally got a house. It ended up being in a very, very, very small and remote village in the middle of nowhere. It is a few towns from his hometown and where he worked, so he accepted it (before asking me to move in with him).

It's been over a year and a half since I've been here, I've been unable to find work, and have no friends. When I say this town is remote I mean it's fucking remote. There's no one around. I have no social life other than our dog and him and I'm miserable.

But good things come to those who wait!

I finished my BFA and started applying to companies all over the world (mainly Germany and America since there are no companies in his country that are in my field). This is something he's known about and has supported from the beginning. I'm very independent and really love my work.

Well.. I got an offer at a dream job! It's back in the United States, only a few states away from my parents and a few hours away from my brother (same state) and sister (next state over). They are even offering me an incredible relocation package and a house for a few weeks. The pay is amazing! It's better than I could ever hope for over here, and I'll be able to make solid payments on my loans.

My boyfriend, however, is not pleased. At first he was super supportive and happy about the application process, but when I kept getting closer and closer to possibly getting hired he seemed less thrilled.

For months we've talked about living in the US. We'll make more money, be able to live more comfortably, and have a bigger house/yard (which is important to us as we love dogs and our yard here is smaller than my bedroom growing up). All of a sudden he's pretty much done a complete 180 and says things like, ""I really fear a terrorist nuclear attack on the US. I don't think it's safe for us to live there."" Or: ""I don't know, I just hate American politics.""

This has all culminated in a discussion we had the other day where he basically said he didn't want to go. He asked why we couldn't just move to Germany or another nearby country instead. I told him it isn't possible because I got the best job offer in the US. I didn't even get any in the EU.

I just don't know what to do. Every time I try to talk to him about it he sort of just shuts down the conversation. He was always so receptive and excited about the idea of living in the US before, but now that it's really an imminent possibility his views have shifted entirely.

**TL;DR: I moved to Europe to work, then moved in with my bf to another country. I hate it here and am homesick. Got a great job offer in America. He was super thrilled at first, but now doesn't want to go. He won't talk to me about it at all.**"

also is VPN an option for this? i am still searching for how it works exactly. I justhad read that someone with  a something similair problem, but in that case the mechanics had to upload instead of stream/download.

2hsmpl,6,2014-09-29,Medicine (the career) is ruining my life,damn_if_only,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hsmpl/medicine_the_career_is_ruining_my_life/,"There's probably like a hundred posts on this already but I need to do this. I am so  fucking everything as I write this. Angry, confused, frustrated so forgive any typos and ambiguity and such.

I went into Medicine about 12 years ago. It was the typical story. I had good grades, my parents wanted a doctor child to brag about. At 17 I didn't really know what I wanted to do. In my country you can get into med school right out of high school. A few of my close high school friends were doing it so I just jumped right in. I must say I didn't really think about it. The fact that I'd be doing this all my life didn't really sink in. I just went with the flow.

The first year was very hard. The hardest fucking thing I'd done in my life so far. I was one of those minimal effort kids. I didn't really know how to study hard. If I didn't get things right away I couldn't be bothered to read after class. That's how midway into my first year, I had gone from an A student to a C student. At that time it didn't faze me. I was dating a guy who I thought was amazing (he was so not but that's another story) and I started to skip class a lot. Reality hit when finals came around that year and I was sure I'd fail. Through some weird luck, I didn't fail. My boyfriend did. We broke up.

I managed to clean up my act the following years and learned to apply myself a little. Still every year, once or twice, I'd get this intense feeling that I had made the wrong choice with my life and that I should quit. But every year I kept passing finals so I ignored my inner voice and just stuck with it.

Internship came around and that was even harder. Somehow though, I actually became an OK doctor. The long hours, shifts of over 40 hours, working on less than 3 hours of sleep, partying, everything, I knew I was killing myself slowly. That year I wanted to quit almost every month. Again, the big chicken I am I didn't. I just kept right on and got through that too.

The next year was the worst. A newly qualified medical officer, I was posted to some far flung dusty town that was ill-equipped. I was bored literally to tears. I smoked too much pot (the pot was amazing though, must've been the altitude). I became resigned to my life sucking forever. I lost empathy quickly and stopped seeing patients as human beings, a lot of the times I felt like they were a nuisance. To make it worse, the other nurses and doctors at that hospital were equally if not more jaded, they'd been in it for longer than me. Patient care was bad. Basically, if you were seriously ill, you would probably die. I got transferred to another equally bad hospital in my home town. I moved back home and that helped a bit. But the work was intensive, with hazing of new doctors by way of piling on work. I got depressed to the point I'd pray to be run over as I crossed the road to the hospital just so I didn't have to do my shift. One morning after a particularly bad hazing episode, I tendered my resignation. I wanted to quit medicine altogether but my family was in bad financial times. I took on a locum job that gave me freedom but it was at a busy casualty, the work was shit but I didn't have to spend so much time there. I would just do my shift and leave. Some time after that I saw an ad for postgraduate training in medicine. I eenie-meenie-miny-moed my way down the list and picked the thing with the least patient contact: Pathology.

Little did I know I had signed myself up for another four years of misery. I stumbled through it and even after it seemed I would never finish, I graduated. I did not want to continue work with the university hospital I trained. In my journey through medicine, the state of healthcare in my country, the lack of prioritisation of healthcare by the government, the amount of people without access to good healthcare, the greed of private healthcare that is dominant in my country, it all broke me. I find myself despising myself and others in this system because we're its fuel.

After my postgraduate degree qualification which was a year ago, I was unemployed for a while and then I found work with this private organisation. It's the same story here, greed for money. Because of this marketing promises doctors and patients that we can do our work ridiculously fast. We can't. This just piles the pressure on the pathologists. Similar hazing, with work being piled on the most junior (me), goes on here. The first week I worked here I had a paralyzing panic attack (my first ever, but sadly not my last while on this job) one night about the work, the pressure, impossible deadlines, the high possibility of making a fatal misdiagnosis that would be disastrous to the patient. It was all too much. I talked to my boss about it and he just gave me a stiff upper lip talk and said I'd get used to it. I reduced my work hours. That was a few months ago. In between I managed to get long periods off to travel which honestly is the only reason I'm still at this job. The vacay time is unpaid though which I don't mind. The breaks are what have enabled me to stay at this job. If I had to do this work continuously, I'd lose it. I find that the stress on the days I'm at work is the same, still very intense. The pressure is very high, the work is a lot and the chances of making a mistake in my work because of this haunts me and stresses me to no end.

To make all this worse, I found out that I am a highly sensitive person a few weeks ago and although it does explain why the work situation (open office, constant interruption, pressure, bad smells from being in the polluted city centre, traffic) has always made me feel horrible and uncomfortable here, all these wrong things are now so noticeable to me to the point of being unbearable.

I have no other real skills. I toyed with writing and even did a few magazine articles back in med school but I didn't follow it up and now I can't seem to get any paying gigs for that. I don't have enough savings to quit even for a little while so I'm stuck working this job that is slowly killing my soul.

I am jaded, my neck is in knots constantly cuz of the long hours trying to finish the work piled upon me plus I hardly get any exercise done. I don't want to seem like a wuss but I really cannot handle this job. I can't quit because I need the money, I know this is a dumb reason but seriously, rent, food, I wouldn't be able to afford any of that if I quit. My parents are not in any position to help me, my siblings either. The future just looks so completely bleak.

And the worst thing, I used to be cool and creative and now, I can't even write a paragraph of prose.

Anyway, I guess I mostly just needed to vent. Let me get back to work. Thanks reddit for this space. I actually feel slightly better.

TL;DR: I've dedicated 12 years to my medical career and after ignoring constant inner voice calls to quit, I find that I am stuck in it.

My brother has huge social anxiety and it's making his life quite difficult. He missed many days of school because he didn't feel capable of going there and facing other people.

We have narcissists parents and I can handle it better than him. I often have big arguments with them because they tend to push him down. My mom gets hysterical, and my dad is a bit lost, sometimes agreeing, sometimes going along with mom.

They never let us do anything ourselves and are very infantilizing. They are also stressful to live with, as they tend to criticize and complain about everything, and shift problems on our shoulders. They are also not profoundly encouraging. The typical conversation goes like: ""we have to do everything at home, so of course we are stressed! you do nothing!"" Or ""yeah, that's good, but why are you always staying in your room?! why you don't have friends?! why you never talk?!"" repeated 10 times (and after the 10th time you just want to burn them alive).

At the moment he has his own flat in another town but he comes home on weekends. I told him to try to stay away as much as he can, but he's very lonely at school. He sees a psychologist but I'm not sure it's doing much. He's planning to go to theater, but he's still struggling to actually do it. He also has to find a place for an internship in two weeks but I don't think he will make it. He has to call the companies but he's struggling a lot to do it. I don't know if doing it for him would help. During the last internship he abandoned it.

I do my best to support him and relieve some of his anxiety, but I need advises on how to properly handle the situation. I thought of staying with him, but he refused the offer. Actually he tends to reject help (probably due to parents not letting us do anything ourselves).

I'm not sure how much I should help. If I try to much he surely notices it and rejects it. But I don't think acting like everything is ok is good neither.

2htape,6,2014-09-29,My boyfriend (21/M) of three years is having a hell of a time with school and home...I'm (18/F) having a hell of a time helping him.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2htape/my_boyfriend_21m_of_three_years_is_having_a_hell/,"We've been together for three years, and I'm a month into college. He has been in college for 3 years for an electrical engineering degree. He's been on academic probation now for a while, and has taken time off because of that (which the college required) and even though he worked his ass off last semester, they decided he didn't make enough progress and have dismissed him from the university. He is planning on taking some online classes and then trying to get back in. This is at least the third time he's had major problems at the school, though this is by far the most severe (being dismissed from the university). I have asked him on several different occasions if engineering is really what he wants to do. He says ""it is as far as I know"" so I'm really not convinced. I know his parents have a really high bar for him, especially considering he's the only child. I understand their frustration...they are paying for him to go to this great school, and he's flunking out. They are furious that he's been dismissed from the school. Part of me thinks he's only trying to be an engineer because he knows that's what his parents want. He and my mom have talked several times about it (they are really close, even calls her Mom. haha) and she and I, and I think him, know that he has so many interests and honestly has no clue about what he wants to do. 

While I don't want to assume too much, I don't think he wants to be an engineer. But the school is engineering specific, so he can't just switch majors, and he says he doesn't have the GPA to transfer. He is incredibly smart...but I don't think he puts the book time in because he has so many other interests.

Personally, I think he should just utilize the ""suspension time"" to explore what he really wants to do. For example, he is incredible with animals, and absolutely adores them. Everyone who sees him quietly asks me, ""What the heck is he doing as an engineer? He should do something with animals!"" Maybe part of me is biased because I'm getting a horse-related degree, so I'll be around animals inevitably. But he just lights up when he's around animals, turns into a giddy little kid, and he's so great with them. I think, as much as he would love a job like that, his parents wouldn't be too keen on it. I try to gently tell him that he's his own person, he needs to do what HE wants to do, not his parents. I know they adore him and just want the best, but I think it's to the point where they are almost perpetuating his downfall. 

The issue with exploring his options with this suspension time is that he has an internship right now. It is based on the degree he's supposed to be getting, with opportunities for permanent employment after he graduates. It's a great company, very successful, but this obviously won't be a thing if he doesn't get through college. They know about the situation and said they'll keep him around for now, but if something doesn't give he'll be fired. He can't exactly do his own thing if he's still employed there, but it's such a great company that it's really in his best interests to stay there for now.

Part of me wants him to just give up on college because it makes him feel so miserable and inadequate, and this has been three years of his life on that emotional roller coaster. But I don't want to encourage him to essentially admit defeat and give up. I know he'll be successful no matter what he does...he just needs to find something he loves to do. That being said, his family would not be pleased. And when his family is not happy with him, he is miserable.

He has gone to counseling, and was put on some medication for ADHD, but apparently the medication was prescribed as an ""as needed"" dosage since he gets some side effects from it. I can't say that I think that is his number one issue. It seems that when he enjoys doing something, he has no problems getting it done and doing it well. 

I'm just sort of looking for input on what I can do from my end, and the general impression you get from all of this. I know at the end of the day he has to help himself. I've asked him if us taking a break would help, if I am a distraction in any way, and he insists that it isn't that (we're pretty long distance anyway, so it isn't like we hang out instead of him studying or doing homework). I love this man with everything I have and absolutely want to stay with him no matter what, but I know this is a big obstacle. Any input is awesome, but I'm not breaking up with him, so the obligatory reddit ""he's cheating on you""/""break up with him""/""tree fiddy"" is not going to be considered!

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of three years is having a hell of time getting through college and is currently excused from the university. I don't want to tell him to give up and stop trying for the degree, but at the same time this is not anything new and it's making him miserable...definitely seems that he doesn't even want this degree but is trying to please his parents/family. I want some input on how I can help and what you think are some good options for him that we could talk about."

2hthfe,5,2014-09-29,"First ""real"" career",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2hthfe/first_real_career/,"So, I graduated college 3 months ago, and right after graduation was hired as an intern at an IT company. I busted my hump and worked for only $10 an hour, and was rewarded at the end with a job offer. I accepted the offer, which is $70,000 a year with 3 month probationary. After that period I get a $2000 pay bump. At 6 months if I complete a certification, I get another $2000 bump. I then get 5% yearly raises.

 I am used to being very very poor, and worked a lot of crappy jobs until college. My parents were very poor and I'm frankly a bit intimidated to be earning $75k at my first job. I realize that I'm not suddenly a mega-rich guy but Ill definitely be comfortable.

So, I have a couple questions. 
First of all, if anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear how you handled it.

Secondly, What kind of guidelines should I follow? I'm trying to follow guidelines such as 'Don't spend more than 30% of your monthly income on housing' and such.

I'm sure I'll think of more questions. I'm using a throwaway because my workmates may shit if they see my pay (I was told 5 times in my negotiation that nobody here gets paid that and he needs it to stay hush hush)

2htmkj,9,2014-09-29,Thoughts on line cook working for direct competitor?,[deleted],KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/2htmkj/thoughts_on_line_cook_working_for_direct/,"Hi guys, I always appreciate your honest advice, so here's the latest scenario I'd like feedback on.  Sorry for the length.

A new competitor has opened in our medium-sized town. We're (owner-operators) fine with competition, and they're across town, so not a big deal.   We're a wine bar with small plates that's been open a year, and they're a wine bar with small plates that opened this month.  We heard from many of our customers that the investors who opened the new place had come into our place many times to get ideas.  The group of investors had zero restaurant/bar/industry experience, so they're relying on their staff to do everything for them.

The potential issue is that they hired our main line cook to be their sous chef.  We had initially hired the guy while in culinary school as an intern.  When he graduated, we hired him full time (about 6 mos ago).  We recently gave him a small raise because he's been doing a good job.  He works mostly lunches (our peak hours are during dinner), and he does a good enough job that our chef or sous chef can focus on other things while he runs the kitchen.  He definitely can't handle running the kitchen during busy hours, but when it's slower, he does it no problem.  He's not the creative type, knows nothing about COGs, or dealing with vendors, but he does what he's told and can follow instructions.  I say this to explain that he'd never move up with us beyond what he is doing now.

The main negative thing I can say about the guy is that he somewhat regularly (once every month or two) calls in sick at the last minute for his lunch shifts.  However, we give him the benefit of the doubt, and choose to believe that he is actually sick.  Chef usually ends up covering his shifts as needed.  

Most recently, the guy called in sick for three days straight -- the first day ten minutes before his shift (Chef lives 25 minutes away and has a young child).  He said he hurt his back.  On the 4th day, he comes back into work with a chiropractor's note, and tells us that he hurt his back at work.  He says he was reaching for a plate on a lower shelf, and twisted it funny, and that he intends to file a worker's comp claim.  I immediately start stalking his social media to try and figure out what he was up to on his days off, because there's no way in hell he hurt himself at work.  Everyone in the kitchen agreed.  

A few days later, he tells us he can no longer work past 3pm, as he's the new sous chef at our newest competitor.  We have two other line cooks that work at other places, but they work at the local country club and a sandwich place/cafe.  As owners we're somewhat uncomfortable with this guy working for these people.

This weekend, we had several customers come in who had also tried out the new place.  Not only did they tell us negative things about the food/service (which is to be expected during opening week), but we were told that the investor-owners who were present were telling people that they intend to ""shut us down"" because they're ""so much better than us.""  

We've heard through the grapevine that these people are so inexperienced that they didn't even know they needed a POS system.  They're basically wealthier professionals who liked drinking wine, and thought it'd be cool to open their own place.  Other industry people in town don't think they'll last long, but you never know.  

Their new chef was a former culinary school instructor who has only operated a catering business.  Our line cook was one of his students (as was our former young/cocky chef we fired several months ago for not tracking COGs).

We've already put ads out to hire because the busy season is approaching.  We're weighing whether to fire the line cook.

**TLDR**: our main line cook accepted a 2nd job as sous with our (new) direct competitor. The owner-investors of the new place are talking smack about us in the community.  Do we fire the line cook?

After ovulation or at first BFP?,littleblueowl,TryingForABaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/2hto5r/question_about_starting_progesterone/,"My Dr. is playing phone tag with me and never clarified exactly when I should start the suppositories, though briefly mentioned starting them at the first BFP... However, I have no reason to trust this woman and believe she is negligent towards her pts (and am waiting to get in to see a different one in the meantime)... My question is, in all my reading, the general consensus is to start them 2-4 DPO (I've had 2 CP's in 4 mo's)... I really REALLY don't want another CP or MC but at the same time, don't want to waste $90 worth of suppositories if I'm not pregnant, especially since I'm extremely sensitive to drugs (and am terrified of the side effects... Started a new internship with kids this week and don't want to be a psychotic, emotional bitch!) 

Long story short, (and I will definitely follow up with the Dr even more)   is it better start them right after ovulation (I'm at 4DPO) than waiting until a bfp? THANKS!"
2hto87,1,2014-09-29,Looking for work. Feeling dejected.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hto87/looking_for_work_feeling_dejected/,"I'm a college senior looking for work. It's hard man. I feel so completely dejected. I've applied to around 30 firms in the last month. 

I've been rejected for interviews from 18 companies, am waiting to hear back from 11, and got an interview with 1. I don't have high hopes for the other 11.

I used to think that if I could just get a shot at an interview, I'd be OK, but I'm not so sure anymore. My last interview, which I thought went great, hasn't resulted in anything. It's nearing the 1-week mark and I'm getting nervous that I haven't heard from them yet.

I think what makes the rejections sting a lot more is while I'm struggling to get my foot in the door my roommate and close friends are landing interviews with very good companies left and right.

All I hear from them lately is how busy they are with interviews. ""The beginning of this semester is so rough with classes, clubs, and all these interviews,"" is something I hear fairly often now.

I kind of just nod along meekly and quietly agree, not wanting to say much in terms of my situation. And I feel so envious it makes me disappointed in myself that I don't feel happy for them as a friend.

It would just feel nice to have someone close to me in the same boat instead of feeling like I'm going through this alone. Yes, it's a problem that millions of others face but in my own little bubble it feels like I'm toughing it out by myself.

I used to think I was a decent candidate. I've been involved with and a leader in numerous campus extracurricular activities. I've had professional internship experience before at a major multinational company in San Francisco. My GPA is a bit low (3.3) but my major GPA is a 3.6, which I thought spoke my ability to some degree.

I've went to the university career center for counseling and advice on how to write resumes and cover letters. They all say it looks great.

I just don't know what it is that I'm doing wrong. Surely I'm doing something wrong.

I'm just sad and confused. I needed this off my chest. I'm going to keep applying to jobs every day but as every day goes by, less and less of the companies I want to work for pop up in the listings and more and more of the companies I don't care about emerge.

Finding work is hard.

I interned (think:  worked for a small stipend) over the summer for a startup. I did this for a few reasons. I was adding experience to my resume, and it allowed me to work remote.

Well after my internship had officially ended, I asked if I could stay on in a similar capacity without any expectation of compensation for three reasons. I really enjoyed the work, I wanted to be a first choice for a job when it became a paying one, and it'd help my resume because they would give me a stellar recommendation. 

Recently, one of the co-founders asked me if I could come on full-time.  She said I had two options. I could continue on in the smaller role until it became a paying job, then I could come on board with a salary and stock options. Or, I could come on full-time without pay, quit my temp job, but get equity in the company. So it's greater risk but a greater reward. 

Before you ask, I do think this company will make it. They have only grown while I have worked for them. I have confidence in their business model. I also recognize I should set a date for when it no longer becomes feasible to continue without pay. 

Also, in terms of my situation, my husband has a wonderful job that moves often hence making remote or temp jobs necessary, and because of his job, I have had several gaps in employment that can discourage employers. 

As far as my question, what in the world do I need to know? What should I be asking the company? This is a crazy opportunity that could really help my career and financial situation long term, but what risks, other than the obvious one, do I run? I know I should probably talk to a lawyer when they draw up papers to give me equity but what other preparations should I make?

Thanks for reading."

But what if she did? how would i react? what would i say? how would the conversation go down? how would she reply? what would i reply to that? i run through these conversations in my head and they all pertain to me proving myself to someone. proving that i can be a caring and thoughtful person. proving that i'm not an asshole deep down, and that i do care for people.

what if J [old friend] texted me and said she was sorry? what would i say? what would she reply? what would happen? would we make up?

what if I still had G [another old friend] in my life? how would things be different? what if I texted her that I missed her? would she reply? if so, how?

and most importantly, what would people do if I killed myself? what would their conversations be like? would people avoid the topic? would people rejoice that i'm gone? would they mourn the loss? how would C [best friend] react? would she cry? how would my teachers react?

another thing is that i'm a really lazy person, and when i cant be bothered to do something and/or something pisses me off to a great extent, i just think: ""can i just put a gun to my mouth and blow my fucking brains out already?""

i don't have possession of a gun or fatal drugs or anything. i wouldn't ever act on these thoughts. but... they're there. they always have been. i've never, ever wanted to act on them. but they're powerful and influential. sometimes i can't sleep or i have panic attacks because i think i might hurt myself. i don't want to, deep down. but something inside me says ""just do it"".

i'm just scared to tell my therapist these things. i don't know how she'd react. i don't know if i'd be sent to the hospital again. but i can't go back. it wouldn't help me in this situation, and i have an internship and several AP classes that I can't fall behind on.

2hukww,0,2014-09-29,Another Opinion on the Brady Hoke Situation,[deleted],CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2hukww/another_opinion_on_the_brady_hoke_situation/,"Please bear with me and read this in its entirety. I welcome dissension and counter arguments, but phrase your argument logically and politely. That's the only way we can have legitimate discourse.

Firstly, I realize this has been all over our top posts the past few days, but in light of the majority of these posts being negative and revolving around firing Hoke I want to provide another viewpoint, especially for those who might be inclined to see the way I am and have no forum to do so.

To establish my credibility in this area: I grew up near Ann Arbor. My father attended the school and works there. My parents have had season tickets for 25 years, and I haven't known a year of my life without Michigan football. I played high school football and was recruited to play in college, but decided to attend the University of Michigan to focus on getting a good education and solid career opportunities. My father was my high school's offensive coordinator for eight years. I grew up with football, Michigan football, schemes &amp; techniques, play calls, you name it. I understand this sport. I'm majoring in Sport Management, and have an internship with the athletic department (though I cannot and will not share any private information I know).

I believe Hoke is struggling with the team. I don't think it's entirely his fault. Far be it from me to study each individual play call, but when I do I notice offensive line struggles (for three years), no receive separation (for three years), tentative running from our first stringer, players that are injured quickly/get tackled easily, decent to great quarterback play from a clear five-star athlete, and wonderful defensive schemes that take the most from a defense not necessarily loaded with talent. I think this can point to a lot of things.

An analogy: I built my own PC, and encountered something that wouldn't POST (show the BIOS screen, let alone boot to Windows, the OS). I believed this to be my motherboard, and sent it back. When I received my new one, my PC started up, but only on occasion, and it would take several times to start it once again. I sent back this motherboard and got a new one - didn't work either. I took it to a PC store to be diagnosed, and it turned out to be my PSU (power supply).

I bring up that analogy because it's clear that there is something wrong with the program. I don't believe that is Hoke, but it certainly might be. This is not a situation where we cut off our nose to spite our face. We need to identify the problem, which can be difficult at points. The problem areas I've brought up show an issue with the offensive line, the receivers, the strength and conditioning program, and our running backs (not all of them, as we'll discuss).

I'm confident I know a good coach when I meet him. Fred Jackson is not a good coach, does not know potential/talent, and has a lot of difficulty in identifying and playing the correct players. Aside from my personal association with him, Darrell Funk may very well be the focal point of our offensive line's woes. Jeff Hecklinski could have a hand in the problems our receiving corps has. Aaron Wellman clearly hasn't prepared our players in the past two years for games. Consider the possibility that Hoke isn't what is holding us back - I'm not saying that's what is happening, but consider it.

If you read his press interview today, you'd see a coach that shared everything. We have had increasing efforts by the press to find out injury information in the past few weeks - that's a player privacy issue, and you cannot blame Hoke for not sharing that info. You'd also see interviewers that countered everything he said, asked him the same questions multiple times, and **back-talked the fuck out of him**. I bolded this and swore because it's **fucking bullshit** that they think they know better than him just because they don't get all the answers they want. 

Hoke's decision to not wear a headset isn't because he doesn't know football - why wouldn't a good manager trust the people he hires to direct his offense and defense, make medical decisions, and provide the correct instruction to his team? The medical staff cleared Shane, and will give us a statement (when they do so is their prerogative - perhaps one should have been out already, but it has been confirmed to come out and we'll get our answer then). He could play with a sprained ankle - I was in high school and played with busted up limbs constantly. Sure he looked concussed, and I agree with that; I thought he had a concussion after that hit. *But he was cleared by a University of Michigan medical staff* - their professionalism prevents them from giving a fuck about whether Michigan loses or wins. If you've ever sprained your ankle, you can struggle standing - though I understand that he didn't hurt it further on that play, that doesn't mean it still didn't bother him immensely. I choose to trust the medical staff who cleared him of concussion symptoms, and believe that the entire University would not lie to the nation that he was not concussed (though one of my friends does, and many of you might believe a conspiracy as well - a notion I find utterly incomprehensible and ridiculous).

The fact that my fellow fans are questioning Hoke's dedication, loyalty, love for his players, and that he has their best interests at heart is also fucked up. One mistake (if it even is that) does not make a man. Everything from this man has been dedication to his team and players - look at his team's graduation rates. This man clearly cares for his team; I doubt he'd take a serious injury lightly.

His answers to questions under duress may not be the best. Maybe he's not the best public speaker, and we see that with his verbal ticks. When he can prepare we will see the man he is, and he is an honest, loving man who knows football. I think the issue lies with some of his staff and, clearly, our athletic director, who has gouged our fan base with price increases and ridiculous marketing efforts. Brandon has made this football team about something other than football. He's the one who should be fired immediately, and in my opinion Hoke should be given the entire year before a decision is made regarding his future.

To address MGoBlog.com: I think Brian is a ridiculous, holier-than-thou, Michigan traditionalist who believes he knows better just because he breaks down game film (his assistant writers. I believe, are much more understanding and logical regarding Michigan football). I can hardly stand the site because of the attacking tone it consistently has; certainly I've no idea why I still go to the site. Please don't take his heavily biased posts as fact and try to form opinions yourselves.

This is all I have. I poured my thoughts out without any editing, so any errors or missed points will most likely be discussed further in the comments section if anyone reads and replies to this."

2hv0e3,3,2014-09-30,My [19F] boyfriend [21M] of 5 years cheated on me twice this summer while studying abroad. I have no clue what I'm doing.,droppthegame,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hv0e3/my_19f_boyfriend_21m_of_5_years_cheated_on_me/,"I've been dating this guy since I was 14. He's the only boyfriend I've ever had (and vice versa), and our relationship has been incredibly healthy and fantastic, before this summer came around. 

From March to September this year, he participated in an extended summer abroad in Europe. At first we were unsure whether we could make it for that length of time, but dove into the challenge after deciding that we had too much history and love for each other not to give it a shot.

6 months is a long time, but I was blessed with an internship in a different country in Europe for two months that summer, so we ended up seeing each other twice. This broke up the time that we spent apart into three two-month periods. Tough, but very do-able when compared to what we would have had to endure initially.

The first incident occurred after the second visit (so in the final third of his abroad program), only two weeks after we had seen each other and so painfully close to him coming home. He drunkenly, intentionally flirted and made out with some girl he tells me he is not attracted to in any way, but snapped out of it and ended the whole incident. After mulling it over a few days, he came out and told me. I was hurt, but touched by his honesty and that he had the self-control to stop it from going further. It was puzzling because the cheating came absolutely out of nowhere, but I forgave him pretty quickly when he swore it would never happen again. 

Regardless, I couldn't help but feel those nagging insecurities that come along with any sort of infidelity. There was this one girl (different from the one above) that he was obviously spending a lot of time with, and who he considered his best friend there. I asked him a few times over the next month and a half to be honest with me and tell me if anything else was going on with her, and he denied it all. I decided to 100% trust him after the third time asking. I thought I knew him better than anyone and though he had cheated, he had also proved his honesty.

He came home at the beginning of September, and we fell in love all over again (or so I thought). Everything seemed perfect. Three days ago, however, he finally came out and told me that girl #2 (his ""best friend"" there) and he had developed feelings for each other within *the last three weeks* of his time there. They cuddled, held hands, and hooked up multiple times (but no sex) throughout that period, and upon his return, he continued skyping and facebook messaging her romantically. Towards the end of this month, however, his guilt finally  became too much and their attraction faded away with distance (she is living back in Europe). He couldn't keep it a secret from me any longer.

Now, I'm devastated. It's one thing to drunkenly hook up with someone, and quite another to develop a crush and *act on it* **repeatedly**. Sober. He hid it from me until now, and I genuinely had no clue.

He has shown incredible remorse over these past three days. He claims he will do anything to make it up to me, but would completely understand if I were to end it. He has cut off contact with this girl. He says he loves me more than anything.

He's the only guy that I've ever had a physical, emotional, or sexual relationship with. I'm really lost and overwhelmed and simply don't know what to do because I've never experienced a breakup before... I would truly appreciate any advice you guys can give me. I love him more than anything, and he is beyond remorseful right now, but can I give him another chance? 

What do you think is the best course of action?

**tl;dr**: Long-time boyfriend cheated twice in two months. First time was a drunken hookup, the second time was practically a relationship (different girls). I don't know what to do. "
2hv1v8,12,2014-09-30,One year post!,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2hv1v8/one_year_post/,"An original topic on this sub, I know. :)

Anyway, I recently passed the one year sober mark, and figured I would write something about my story. Maybe it will help someone.

I became a full blown alcoholic while in a doctoral program. I was overloaded on classes and would get loaded every night to relieve my stress. I always had vodka. I started blacking out once a week or so. Oddly enough, I maintained straight As. That probably helped feed into the delusion that what I was doing to myself was OK. In reality, I gained 30 pounds and had an anxiety problem that was growing out of control. I started experiencing regular panic attacks.

I decided to take a ""detox"" break after blacking out and waking up with bruises all over my body from who knows what. I told my fiance and he was supportive. I had done these detoxes before, and it was always slight withdrawal symptoms, then back to normal. This time....was not like that. I blacked out Thursday night, felt OK Friday, but from Saturday morning through Sunday night I had what I would describe as one long panic attack. I did everything to feel better save drink alcohol. Finally I tried to go for a run on Sunday night, and that made the panic even worse. It felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest. I thought I was dying. My fiance drove me to an urgent care, and I told them the truth. They initially said that they don't prescribe benzos at their clinic, but they made an exception for me after my appointment. 

I knew to be careful about benzos. I was prescribed 20 pills and only took 9 of them total over the course of the first two weeks. I hated how they made me feel. But I needed them to stave off the horrible withdrawal. I still have the other 11 pills a year later.

The first few months sober for me were hell. My anxiety did not subside. It was ALWAYS there. I read stories on this subreddit about people feeling so wonderful at one month sober and it made me feel like I was broken permanently. I got married with two months sobriety, and had a full on nervous breakdown a month after that. The stress of grad school+the stress of a wedding+neurotransmitters all out of whack was an awful combination. I can't begin to accurately describe what that felt like. I was acutely aware of every sensation in my body, and every sensation made me believe I was dying. I had a choking sensation around my neck for three weeks. My limbs would involuntarily twitch, my ear would get red hot, I felt like I had the flu..just the weirdest mix of bodily symptoms in the world. I was afraid to leave my apartment, and holed up for two weeks until my husband told me to go see my family. 

I finally went to a doctor at the insistence of my parents. She talked to me for 5 minutes and prescribed me Zoloft. I was too anxious to take a pill. I threw them out.

I realize that up to this point it seems like I'm saying sobriety made everything 100 times worse for me. And it did, for the first three months. At six months, my anxiety was there, but it was a dull roar. I started exercising daily-yoga and cardio. I also took up some hobbies. The number of panic attacks I experienced was dropping slowly but surely. 

I know I'm not really saying much about how I stayed sober in this, and I'm afraid I won't be much help here. My withdrawal was so acutely horrifying that the sight/smell/taste of alcohol literally repulsed me. I was tempted maybe twice all year, and I'm not at all anymore.

Anyway, long story short, my anxiety is virtually gone. I took my candidacy exam last week and barely had any nerves going in. I've lost 30 pounds. My face is clear. My marriage is wonderful. I landed an internship. 

Sobriety is worth it. But it may take time to feel better, especially if you've been drinking heavily for a long time. I'm a much stronger person for what I've gone through, but I've seen what alcohol does to my brain now and I am never going back there. Good luck to all of you in achieving your goals.

tl;dr: Bad withdrawal, anxiety, no anxiety, doing great. Sobriety is wonderful."
2hv64s,2,2014-09-30,20 [F4F] Anywhere - Shy Girl Looking for A Cutie and Best Friend XD,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/2hv64s/20_f4f_anywhere_shy_girl_looking_for_a_cutie_and/,"Hi,

I need a cool girl to be my bestfriend and girlfriend!

Before I say anything I must make it clear that I have a boyfriend. I'm looking for a girl who is OK with that and willing to be a part of MY open relationship. He isn't going to be involved, but you must be OK with my man knowing and being in the same room with me when we voice chat or something. We are in an open relationship and hes OK with me having someone of my own. So please don't try to take him away from me or down talk him. :D

I found out that I was newly bisexual after posting and lurking on Reddit and loving what other woman look like or say to me. I decided it was a good idea to just go ahead and do it! :D You will be my first girl! I have no experience online dating or being the leader when it comes to dating. I have never experienced anything sexual or romantic with a female either. I have little to no female friends at the moment so it really sucks. BLEH. I have little to no contact with females, so I really want to have a connection with a girl my age or older. :P

I'm an avid PC gamer, (WOOO) and I would love it if you were too. I love to play games like WoW and LoL, but I have a bunch of other titles and I'm always willing to try other things. I love shooter and any games with zombies. I LOVE zombie games. My boyfriend is very close to me when I game, so if we get to playing and you hear him yell or laugh and if your OK with it we can play with him too. I'm a nerd at heart and I love to read as well. Since I was a little girl I have always loved Harry Potter and other fantasy stories. Right now I love the Hunger Games and anything with vampires or zombies, I also love post apocalyptic stores and films.

I LOVE music. I absolutely love heavy metal. XD I go to concerts when ever I can. I love numerous bands with Machine Head, In Flames, Trivium, and Rammstein when it comes to metal. I also enjoy EDM and dubstep. I also like acoustic rock, and love songs and the occasional pop or hip hop music.

Appearance wise I am a Caucasian blonde curly haired cutie. I'm fairly chubby and short with large breasts and a big butt :D (I was told that I should include that ?) I've been told that I'm super sweet and kind. I have strong opinions, but I accept other peoples ideas. I'm very intelligent and would love for you to be too. I'm currently a college student studying finance and have a internship in a finance department. I love numbers and real life problem solving. (Nerd alert) Sometimes I can be pretty boring and spacey, just pick my brain to find something fun! I LOVE to chat. I'm super shy and not a horndog, but open sexually if it comes to that. I'm not a prude either. I have my own cute little dog and cat and love kids.

I live on the border between Iowa and Nebraska in the US and my timezone is Central US (CST). I'm available sometimes when I'm at work to chat occasionally, but I don't get home from class and work until 9PM and many nights I will be doing homework late into the night, so don't be supprised if I disappear :/ I would LOVE for you to be available on the weekends, especially the evenings so we can chat or play games or something. Please don't be one of those woman who are scared to talk to me or that disappear and don't make me feel like I'm not around.

For what I am looking in a woman is similar to me. Intelligent, a gamer who is willing to go out of the way to play with me once in awhile :D, a nerd or geek, and open sexually. I'm looking for someone who isn't super skinny, because I am not. :D Preferably white or Asian. And you need to be feminine like me. I LOVE long hair. I also love boobies and butts :P I want you to be OK with my man. Please be clean and drug free or at least don't talk to me about them. (They gross me out.) I don't need a single woman, but I don't want you to have tons of online relationships either, I want to feel special.Please be between the ages of ( 19-25). I'd love to laugh with you and discuss anything. I'm very open sexually and I hope you are too. I don't mind much personality wise, just don't be pushy and please be interested. I just want a cute girl to be romantic with and maybe someday love. I want someone who I can send pictures to of clothes, outfits and dorky faces too. I love to be told I'm cute, beautiful, dorky, or even sexy.

I really want a new best friend, a girlfriend, and someone fun! I'll be your cutie!

Sorry for the long dry read its just everything I need to say! PM me if interested. I'm OK with trading pics and I'll trade chat info and name after we get talking. Serious offers only. NO MEN!

2hvi81,1,2014-09-30,Vacation during internship?,CountyCourt,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/2hvi81/vacation_during_internship/,"Next week is when Big4 interviews happen and I hope to not only be interviewed but also get offered an internship, but...

At the beginning of August I have a week long trip that I had planned for two years.

Is this a situation where I just have to suck it up and choose one or the other? Will an internship be understanding to a pre planned trip? If they will understand would it still create negative feelings about me in their eyes?"
2hvkau,1,2014-09-30,I [26F] need some perspective on my 2.5 year relationship with [22M]. Is it over or am I overreacting?,boyfriendexboyfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2hvkau/i_26f_need_some_perspective_on_my_25_year/,"So my BF is a pretty great person. He's funny, kind, generous, etc. We met in the second year of college and became best friends, and a few months later started dating. Everything was sunshine and roses until May of this year when college ended. He works a full-time job in a DIY store and so he often has shifts that run until 10pm. I also work part-time 3 days per week and have an internship 2 days per week but the latest I'm finished is 8pm. 


We went from seeing each other 3-4 days a week in college, with him staying at my place 2-3 nights a week, to seeing each other 1-2 times a week. Mostly it's just the once per week, and often for only a couple of hours. He maintains that he's looking for a new job - preferably in the area he just graduated in - because he desperately wants his evenings and weekends free.


My BF is an avid sports lover. He's mad for soccer (we live in Ireland so it's quite huge here), loves American Football, does fantasy leagues for both, plays in video game leagues for both FIFA and Madden, plays soccer once a week with his friends, used to play flag football when in college and ardently wishes to take up contact American Football when he has the time. He also recently signed on to play competitive badminton twice per week. It takes up a lot of the free time he does have. 


That's the background. Back in early August, my BF was asked to be the date to a girls debs (basically the prom). He's known her for 10 years from the holiday park where his family goes every summer. BF doesn't see her often but had just been there with his family for the bank holiday weekend for 4 days. He hadn't mentioned seeing her until he was asked over the phone when we were hanging out would he be her date. BF said he'd 'check with his two bosses' - one of them being me. I've never met the girl. I said I wasn't comfortable with the idea of him being someone else's date, was frankly a bit peeved that he even asked me to consider it, and that I didn't want to be made out as the evil GF. I think it was reasonable of me to say I wasn't ok with it. He asked me to think about it, but then eventually settled on not going because I wasn't comfortable. 


I texted him the next day and said I was caught off guard and didn't understand why a girl he sees once per year thought to ask him to be her date, and right after he had been away. Was I missing something? He replied no and explained that she just thought of him as a safe option who 'wouldn't try anything'. We hung out a couple days later and I asked him how she took it when he told her no. He said he hadn't told her. I got upset that he hadn't sorted it, he said he didn't want to put either of us out (me or the girl who invited him to her debs). 


We went back to his house, I was clearly upset, we started to talk. BF said he was annoyed that I was telling him what he couldn't do, and over the course of 2 hours he got progressively more upset about lots of stuff. He said he felt frustrated that he couldn't find a new job so that he had free time, that he felt like I was being overly jealous, and that he wanted to play more sports without feeling like a bad boyfriend (eg. By playing sports instead of hanging out with me). 


Then he broke up with me, totally distraught, saying he didn't know if he could be in a relationship right now. I was quiet most of the time and just let him say everything (he's not usually very emotional) and then I got up and started leaving. I was absolutely devastated. I thought this relationship was it. He was crying and saying how much he loved me all the while. I got home, fell apart. The next day I went out with my family for a walk, got a call around 2pm from BF saying he didn't want to break up. 2 hours of talking later, he says actually he still didn't want a relationship. Breakup take two. 3 hours later, BF calls and says he can't be without me. Utterly mindfucked, I tell him I can't talk for a while. 


A week later he calls, says he wants to be with me but wants to do sports as well. I explain how I don't trust him anymore and it'll take time and effort to rebuild it. He agreed. Fast forward to today and we just returned from a city break to London that had been planned since Christmas. I feel completely discombobulated with everything. 


We still only see each other once a week. We text a few times a day. There have been no grand gestures or any effort out of the ordinary to make me feel secure. I haven't been happy since he first broke up with me and I can't seem to get past feeling like he doesn't love me anymore. He told me the other day that he had just signed up to play competitive badminton two nights per week. I don't feel I'm a priority despite his claims of same. 


I suppose what I need advice on is this: what the hell am I meant to do? He's a great person and I love him, but I don't feel loved. I need a lot of attention and affection right now. Random texts of 'I love you' or surprise phone calls just to chat do it for me. It's not happening and yes, I've explained to him a few times exactly how vulnerable I'm feeling. He always says the right things in response but then time passes and I feel like I'm back at square one. 


Am I just holding on to something that's already over? I ask myself whether it's a temporary thing because of work, but then he keeps taking on commitments that don't leave much time for our relationship. Or am I just being impatient and letting my insecurities create a self-fulfilling prophecy? Any advice is greatly appreciated, I'm so deep into it that I can't really see out anymore. 


TL;DR: BF broke up with me 6 weeks ago but changed his mind within 24 hours. I feel insecure about the relationship as a result and it's made worse by the fact that he hasn't made any extra effort to repair it. I don't know if my relationship is doomed or if I'm being overly sensitive and unsupportive? 


P.S. When we got back together he added me on snapchat and the debs girl was his top best friend. Can't say it helped.

2hvre0,2,2014-09-30,"I'm tired of being average, and other stuff.",Koonetz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2hvre0/im_tired_of_being_average_and_other_stuff/,"This will probably be a lengthy post, mostly just telling the story of how I became to be what I am right now...which is kinda shitty.


**Anyway, let's begin:**


I had a pretty normal childhood, born in El Salvador, I was lucky to have a relatively wealthy family, enough to live in a secure zone of the capital. As a kid I loved martial arts movies, watching Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan movies hyped me up to no end and I always wanted to learn a martial art (Judo, Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Kung Fu, Muay Thai, you name it, I would have been happy with anything). Sadly, my parents were never receptive to the idea of me fighting, I understood and I wasn't mad, I had my fair share of fun playing Street Fighter with friends.


I decided to turn into other thing I love, soccer, I got registered into a small ""football school"" every weekend where I learned everything there is to know about the sport. I was very talented for a kid of my age (8 yr old back then) and my coached pushed me pretty hard, but he told me I would go places if I keep this up. This was awesome for me, I watched football everyday on tv and it was my dream to play in those huge stadiums in Europe and to represent my country in the World Cup someday.


**Fast forward some time**


During all my childhood I lived with my mom, my parents divorced when I was 1 yr old due to them having different plans for the future, they didn't end in bad terms and I remained in contact with my dad throughout the years, my parents are now really good friends and they both have eachother's backs.


When I was 11 my mom met a French guy, they got married and she went to live in France with him, I had the choice to go or to stay. The future wasn't very bright in El Salvador,  my dad told me that he would love if I stayed but he wanted me to be successful, so I left. 


**Here's where it starts getting shitty**


Holy shit France! Paris is beautiful and for a year I was enjoying everything, I even got into a club to play soccer every sunday in the ""little leagues""! I was on my way to become a proffessional soccer player and and man, I was hyped, living the dream. 


Later that year I began school and then it began...Around a week after school started I was playing Battlefield 2, blowing people up with my helicopter, shit was fun...until I started to feel the single most horrible chest pain I've ever had, it was terrible, I thought I was going to die right there, I called my mom and told her what has happening, she rushed back home only to find me in tears. At this moment I wanted to die, pain was unberable.


Next day in the morning, what do I see? half my chest had sunk, it looked hideous, I was completely in shock, I had no fucking idea what that was and I hit it from everybody until the day I got a random cold.
While my doctor was checking me he noticed the left side of my chest was sunken, he then told my parents to take me to a specialist to see what it was. That same day we went to the hospital, got X-Rays done and it was fairly obvious I had a pretty mean scoliosis, double scoliosis for that matter, my back resembled a ""S"".

Atleast I could still play soccer.


**It gets worse**


I've always had shitty eyesight, I was tired of having to struggle seeing anythingin class, so I asked my mom if we could go to get my eyes checked. A couple of days later we're off! Time to finally be able to see something. Little did I know he was gonna say something that would change everything in my life...for the worst.


Doctor notices the lens inside both of my eyes was out of place, he suggested that we should do test to see if it wasn't marfans. I honestly thought he was fucking crazy, how can displaced lenses and a scoliosis be even related? It was totally far fetched. So offI went next week to spend a day doing the most unconfortable test ever imaginable.


A couple of weeks later the bad news arrived, I had marfans syndrome and a dilatated aorta. Doctor told me right there that competitive soccer was out of question, or any sport that requires a lot of effort for that matter.
I was totally shocked, angry, sad, so many weird ass emotions I had never felt before. I feel into a depression that lasted until I was 20 (I am 21, I was announced I had marfans at 14). Depression knocks on the door every now and then, just to remind me he's still around, it sucks tbh.

I sheltered myself, I was in panic, I had no idea what to do in life, all I did was play WoW to escape reality and in a way it worked, I have good memories from playing The Burning Crusade. Hell, I am still playing.

As time went by I became more and more reserved, I barely talked to anybody and I was feeling like shit daily, was constantly trying to find something I could be proud of, tried music production,video editing, photography, drawing...I ended up being average at all of those and since I was alone I barely had friends, and nobody ever gave me support for what I was doing, I had a feeling I was doing stuff and nobody ever cared. I just wanted to share stuff with people and be proud of it. 


**School's Over**


So school ended and I finally can go to uni, decided I wanted to be a programmer, I always found that incredibly interesting and I thought it could be a good career path, I wanted (and still want) to be able to work at a game studio and help make something awesome. Sadly, just as everything before, I am totally average at it, even below average, I'm currently in an internship feeling like shit, doing webpages and wanting to die.



By now I am probably rambling, I dunno where to even take this now, I am sitting her at work writing this huge ass post while feeling terrible, completely lost. Every single day I am pissed off and I can't even enjoy the only hobby this stupid fucking syndrome hasn't taken away from me (video games). I have been trying to get better at Street Fighter but I only seem to get worse, as usual, I am average.


Also remember martial arts? that is out of question for me aswell, fuck everything.


If you have any other questions or advice feel free to ask/share.


Thanks for taking your time reading this.



**EDIT**

I noticed I barely talked about being average lol.

Basically this feeling began during highschool, everybody seemed to have something going for them. Amazing dancers, artists, muscicians and then there was me, the jack of all trades master of none, trying to find something to be proud of. I think the only thing I ever got close to being good at was music production, I enjoyed it but I found no motivation after seeing nobody ever giving me criticism or advice or feedback of any kind, I was learning everything by myself and it was extremely time consuming and tiring. I dunno what might have caused this, I have a feeling that I am constantly frustrated with everything in my life and it drives me insane. There are weeks where I feel I have a constant ""call of the void"", thinking how easy it would be to jump off a bridge or to jump infront of a train. I am lost and I don't want to be average anymore. 

I have been trying to get better at programming and street fighter (I would like to reach a skill level where I can play in tournaments without getting blown up) but they are both becoming something that gets tougher as you learn it. I need ways to atleast keep my mind off negative thoughts and to push forward...Well I'm rambling again now. This post started organized but now it's a mess. I got pretty angry as I was writing everything, remembering all those shitty memories. Atleast it feels better to vent.

2hw0m6,2,2014-09-30,Feeling defeated,secret_throwaway26,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2hw0m6/feeling_defeated/,"Hello,
It’s been a while since I have written something on reddit, but I’ve been meaning to write this for a while in this judgement free environment. 
As the title suggests I feel defeated. I think this will be long because I have been meaning to write for a while and I might get lost. I wrote two different stories that are happening in my life, but the major focus is on story 2.

Story 1. 

I had girl problems (a years’ worth), but I think I’m getting over it due to the recent texts I had with her. I needed an answer as to why she was being distant. Got my answer and I explained my side as well. It sucks when you don’t know if they believe you or not when you are being a hundred percent truthful. Don’t think we will be speaking for a while, but I hope she remains a friend. I think I want it more, which hurts, but after saying what I had to say thru text I felt unburdened.  

I still think about her. Not in the I like her way, but I wonder how she is doing in a friend only way. Even when I got things off my chest it brought out new thoughts and questions like “Damn, I didn’t really get an answer if we are still friends or not”. Kind of messed up by texting her a week later after she mentioned she needs space. When she told me she wanted to just be friends and mentioned that she needs to make sure I don’t like her. I think I got my answer that nothing will ever happen past friendship. 

It is kind of funny how things worked out. I haven’t texted her for 2 months. I was getting nervous and not knowing if we are friends or not was eating at me. I still liked her more than a friend, but I wanted friendship even if it meant my feelings had to die. Suddenly, September comes and just 364 days after I started liking her more than a friend. I go to downtown to merchandise at a store around the general area where she works. I finish around the general time the business people come out of work. I wondered to myself “what are the chances I see her? What will I even say if I did?” I walk to my car feeling nervous at how its making me feel. Then I look across the street and yup. It was her walking with a coworker to union station. I kept looking to try to confirm at how unbelievable this all is. I thought this was a sign from the big guy upstairs. 

I then went to my last store for the day to merchandise then called up a friend to hangout because I was feeling uneasy by it all. I explained and he believed me, because something similar happened to him too. I wonder if it happens to a lot of people. The next day I texted her back and forth for a bit and the next day after that I asked her if she wanted to hangout but got no response but got asked a different question. Then a day or two later is when I ask if something is wrong and I unburdened myself a little bit. I still think about her as I mentioned above. I hope we can become normal friends again even if it might be tough. I think I want this more. Kind of hard for me to get rid of someone out of my life because I never did it before (intentionally of course). Well that’s one story!

Story 2. I wanted to post this in /jobs but I think here is better. 

I’m lost big time. Graduated last year in commerce with a major in finance and I can’t really find a decent job I’d be happy to have. Found it hard to find something in the greater Toronto area so I left in December to Saudi Arabia to find something. Was dealing with a quarter life crisis. Got an internship through my dad at an ad agency and I decided I’m interested in Marketing and Advertising more. 

Decided to come back to Canada in June because my dreams and what not are here(to work in downtown Toronto). Felt good and more confident when I came back, but now I’m back to square one. I was getting desperate.  I got a merchandiser job with coca cola and within a week I wanted to quit. Told this to my career coach and advisors at this government job agency and I was told to hold on for while. Got help with interview prep, cover letter and resume writing.

Eventually coca cola gave me another part time job because I mentioned I wanted to work less due to not wanting to hurt my back. Now I have 2 part time jobs with coca cola. 
I’m tolerating with it better, but at the same time I still think every day about finding a REAL professional job which actually requires a degree because I can’t stop thinking about how I wasted 4 years to not find a good job. I work alone at both of my jobs. It’s very lonely and a total opposite of the “communicative and team environment” that I want. 
I’m hoping that with hard work I can move up fast in a year if I don’t find another job. I haven't even updated my linkedin account cause of being ashamed.

I’ve joined a rotaract club, a free entrepreneurship course at the MaRS discovery district, going to start volunteering with marketing for a non-profit and hopefully soon at a toastmaster group to stay occupied and build some skills. 

Even considering doing a post graduate certificate in marketing at a college, but I’m not sure about how that schedule will fit with everything I’m doing and I get scared of what if I do it yet the result is still the same? 

I feel defeated due to this. I want to start a professional career and be happy with myself and be a role model to my brothers and sister that are all still in university/college. 
I want to stop thinking about this… any advice?

2hwl2r,3,2014-09-30,"Should I quit my internship because of my anxiety/depression? I'm sinking, I need help.",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2hwl2r/should_i_quit_my_internship_because_of_my/,"I'm a 24 yo female who just finished college. I've always been an anxious person. Some things were worse than others (being late, knowing about organization if I'm doing something or going somewhere) but never prevented me from living a completely normal life. 


I moved to a completely different country very far from mine when I was only 20 for a year to work in one of the biggest international organizations in the world. No problem. I'm usually mildly social, as in I love staying home and watching tv, but also enjoy going out with people and talking to people/making friends was never an issue.


I've had panic attacks in the past, for which I was given Lexomil. It worked fine. I also took Ads (Zoloft) about 5 years ago when I left for college and had a hard time adjusting. Everything went back to normal quickly and I enjoyed my college years.


College is now over and I have a happy life. I share a home with my amazing bf, I get along great with my family and friends, and I got my final internship. That's when all hell broke loose. 


So I got this internship, 1000km away from home. No biggie, it's going to be hard, I'm going to miss my boyfriend, but hey, it's a really good experience, in the (very restricted) field I love, and it's only 3 months, right ? RIGHT?  Well, turns out this internship is driving me crazy and ruining my life. A month before leaving, I started having panic attacks again. It had been YEARS. Wanna go to the movies with bf? Nope. Wanna go to a restaurant? Once again, nope nope nope half way. Can't breathe, wanna throw up, GI fuck up (I feel like i'm really going to crap my pants, I can actually feel it in my bowels, sorry about that), cold sweats, dizziness, I turn white as a ghost, we're going home. I see a doctor, they give me lexomil again, I can go to the supermarket without feeling like I'm going to die. And now it's time to go. I take my pill, my boyfriend drops me to the train station, and I'm off to my fantastic internship.


I've been here a month. It's be awful. My tummy hurts ALL THE TIME, I'm scared 24/7, can't eat, always tired, cry all the time (this is very unusual for me). Everything is ok when I'm in the office or in my studio. Once I'm out, it's a fucking pain. On the bus to and from work: anxiety, angry belly, so scared to crap my pants. EVERYDAY. TWICE. I thought visiting my boyfriend would make it better. Bus to go to the train station: fucking horrible. Drive to get home: I'm sure I'm going to crap my pants (in case you haven't noticed, I tend to have horrible diarrhea when anxiety kicks in). Get home: I can't go back there it's fucking awful, I hate it, I'm miserable. To the point I don't even want to visit anymore because the trips are so stressful but I miss him so much. 


I finally decide to see my doctor again. Depression + anxiety (I might have cried like a baby). He tells me to keep taking the lexomil whenever the attack is here, puts me on 25mg of Zoloft, and sends me to a psychiatrist. That was last night. I took the zoloft this morning along with an anti-spasmodic and ¼ lexomil before going to work. An hour later, I'm supposed to attend a conference I really wanted to go to. I was stopped on my way by an explosive case of diarrhea, I shit you not (ahah). It was absolutely horrible. The pain, the anxiety. Telling my coworker I wasn't going to be able to go because the pain is so intense. Nausea on top of that. I manage to stay at my desk the whole day after a couple imodiums. It's 5pm, time to go home, yay! Not before a quick stop to the bathroom, diarrhea again, that quick stop lasted 15 minutes, where does all this shit come from anyway, I have barely eaten in days, I'm not gonna make it home. I did make it home in the end and called my doctor, who said it's not clear whether my GI problems are due to Zoloft (since it's one of the side effects) or still the result of my anxiety. Just keep taking it for a few days and we'll see. 


Well too bad, I have 2 appointments I CAN NOT MISS tomorrow. How the fuck am I supposed to live through this? Imodiums are not even really working anymore. I'm supposed to visit my bf next weekend, I don't think I can make it either. 


Now here is where I need your help: With 2 months left and this internship clearly ruining my life, do I suck it up and stay while trusting my sphincters, even though I'm miserable, or do I get the fuck out of dodge and go home and take time for myself? I feel like I can't stay here like this for 2 more months. I feel like I can't even work properly tomorrow right now. But I'm afraid leaving will just make it even harder to do anything in the future. That if I escape and hide, I fail and let it all get the best of me. That after that, I won't be able to do anything until I'm stuck in my house, alone with my cats because frankly, no one wants to be with someone who can't even leave the house. I'm really scared. What should I do?

2hx2dm,221,2014-09-30,The BookHam PART 1: Gym adventures,ValdrickVile,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/2hx2dm/the_bookham_part_1_gym_adventures/,"So this is a tale of a person that I've lived with for only a month or so, yet has somehow been able to push every button imaginable in record time.  I'm trying to condense a lot of information here as she seems to give me more material everyday but it's still a lot so I'll do my best to not have it drag on too much.

To set the scene, I go to a pretty medium sized University in Missouri and this is my second semester in the dorms.  It's an upperclassmen floor, so the people are typically more mature and I generally really enjoy it.  Last semester was great and I got to pal around with two agriculture students who were your typical ""country chicks"".  We were lucky in that we shared a six girl suite between three girls and all could have our own space.

This semester however I was lumped in with the full six and I was pretty nervous.  I facebook stalked them and they seemed like alright people.  One seemed really into Ren Faire, which got me excited because I'm really into cosplay and costume making could be something we could do together.  The other one, which we will call BookHam, seemed really into reading so I figured we might have some stuff in common as well.  How wrong I was.

&gt;I'll run through our characters.  First is me, which we'll call Valdrick ( because I'm a dork and that's my main WoW character) 5""4 and around 145 pounds but trying to drop and have been dieting/working out routinely with my boyfriend to turn it around.  A little chub but still striving towards shitlord status.

&gt;My boyfriend, which we'll call Jay at his request.  5""8 and 205.  Has some MUSCULAR LEGS and has lost a ton more than me working out.  Looks pretty fiiiine.  Met the guy while we were both working at Disney World on an internship.  Stuck like glue evah since and is my partner in crime.

&gt;Sharer-of-Rooms with BookHam, RenLegs.  Called so because she loves Ren Faire and has some sick legs. maybe 5""2 and about 145 as well from what I'd guess.  Sweet as can be and very tolerant.

&gt;Suitemates Curly Blond and Tall Blond, who share a room in between myself and BookHam.  Curly blond is short and the picture of one of those southern belle types, also a bit crazy but in a good way. Tall Blond is super pretty and has a hot military boyfriend.  Both are also into losing weight ( and have regularly joined me and Jay on workouts)

&gt;There is a sixth girl who is gone half the week I'll call Jeans, but her interaction with BookHam is minimal.  Very innocent.  Heavy but owns up to it and doesn't exist in the same delusional space as BookHam.

&gt;There is FilmSnob, friend of ours who is a serious militant guy at the gym and kinda pushes me and Jay to be healthier. 5""11 I'd guess and 150 pounds. We argue with him a lot over stuff but we get along. Lover of movies, hater of hams.

&gt;And finally there is Book Ham.  About 5""9 and about 240 pounds.  Not HUGE but a lot bigger than the rest of us, which is apparent to everyone else but her.  Can be seen in one of two outfits she wears.  Is on disability and spends almost all of it on books and junk food.  Seeks attention and a huge narcissist. 

So I moved in middle of August, and BookHam was the first roommate I got to meet.  I popped my head in the door and introduced myself, but her interaction with me was kind of awkward.  I don't remember exactly what was said, but she didn't crack a smile or welcome me back.  I felt like I might have seemed a bit weird wheeling in my insane amounts of costumes and wigs, so I didn't think much of her reaction to me.  I'm not your stereotypical weeaboo, I dress and act pretty ""mundane"", but if you went into my room it's a neon mess of Hot Pink and Sailor Moon with wigs hanging everywhere.

I met the rest of the gang and they seemed great.  We all got to talking and there seemed to be a really good balance of personalities in the room.  I invited my roommates to use me whenever they liked as a workout buddy, as I'm the kind of person who finds it easier when you have a pal and I generally like most people, I'm the type to invite as many people as possible with me.  RenLegs and BookHam volunteer to accompany me.

Now we come to the gym later that day.  Our University has a GREAT gym, three floors of equipment, a rock climbing wall, a sauna, swimming pool, and hot tub.  Not the mention the building is very new with a slick modern style and is next door to my dorm.  We hurry over and start my routine.  Now, I'm going to go through each individual step because BookHam managed to do some strange stuff on each.  

First we used the elliptical.  RenLegs and I were kinda in the zone with our music on when we hear a wail,

&gt;BookHam: This thing won't come on!

&gt;Valdrick: Well, you have to move to turn it on.  Just start going and it'll work.

Bookham begrudingly lurches forward on it and it springs to life!  Voila!  I go back to focusing on my self and absentmindedly staring at the TV screens.  It's not long before I hear her again.

&gt;BookHam:  It's turned off again!  This thing is broken...

&gt;Valdrick: You have to move!  You're standing still again.

I'm beginning to get frustrated.  I have a VERY short tempter and no patience at all, and I can snap sometimes for admittedly stupid reasons.  I watch BookHam start to move again but at a snail's pace.  I didn't think it was possible, but she was moving so slow that the machine couldn't even turn on.  At this point I was fed up and left her to figure it out herself.

&gt;BookHam: I'm going to go walk around the track, I'm done with this.

&gt;RenLegs: Let's all run together, we've only got about three minutes more.  Can you wait?

I didn't really care whether BookHam did it or not at this point, but she waited begrudgingly beside us if only because RenLegs has a way of being too sweet to deny. We finished on the elliptical and walked to the indoor track.  I suggested we run one lap and alternate walking.  I like to run but I was trying to be easy on BookHam since she seemed to be struggling earlier.  BookHam was having none of it.

&gt;BookHam: I just want to WALK!

&gt;Valdrick: When I first started running I could barely run a minute without feeling like I wanted to die, but the more I ran the easier it was.  It's really not that bad, I don't care how long you can run but you should at least run a little.  You didn't really do anything on our last workout.

I felt a little like I was tooting my own horn but I really do want to help people better themselves.  I remember how I felt when I first started working out and how hard and intimidating everything was and how beautiful it felt when those challenges got easier and easier to face.  I wanted other people to be able to feel that way, especially when I saw shades of my past self in others.  Apparently it was the right thing to say because for the first section she ran with us.  I was ahead of the pack because I had a lot more experience, but I'd look over my shoulder now and again to be sure I wasn't losing the two.  Eventually I looked back and saw RenLegs...but no BookHam!  I stopped and stepped off the side of the track to wait for her just in case.  No BookHam.  I got curious and ran another lap.   Nothing!  I was beginning to wonder if she just went home when I happened to look back over my shoulder by the window to the pool area...and there she was!  BookHam was tucked into an alcove, twiddling away with her phone.

&gt;Valdrick: Bookham!  Why are you here?  I was looking for you.

If she wanted to rest there were plenty of benches and it seemed bizarre she would tuck herself into that corner.  It kind of made it seem like she was hiding.

&gt;Bookham:  I got a text.

&gt;Valdrick: Okay, but you should finish with us.  There's only one more lap.

&gt;BookHam: Don't wait for me!  Just go ahead, don't worry about it.

My rage meter was filling up again so I let it go and finished the lap.  She eventually trod over to us and we moved on to get on some bikes.  This is where some of the weird stuff with BookHam and her obsessions with appearance started

&gt;BookHam:  Am I sweaty?  Do I have sweat on me, did it stain my shirt?  I hope not...

She turned around so I could look at her back, a bit rolly and indeed saturated in sweat.

&gt;Valdrick: Everyone sweats at the gym, it's normal.  No one's judging you.

I've been a major chubster before and know how self conscious you can feel sometimes, so I tried to reassure her thinking maybe she was insecure.  NOPE.

&gt;BookHam:  Well, you guys are SUPER sweaty!  You're going to smell.  I hope you guys SHOWER.  How can you sweat so much?

I was pretty taken aback by this.  She said it in this snide, superior tone and suddenly I didn't feel so bad for her anymore.  This was to become a regular thing with BookHam, her favorite hobby was to insult somebody based on their appearance.  

I said nothing and we got on the bikes.  BookHam did it, albeit she did it on no resistance and again at a snail's pace, but I was glad she was keeping the machine on and she was at least MOVING.

Skip forward to our last event, the stair machine.  I always save it for last because I struggle with it and it pretty much wipes me out every time.  We all get on and start moving.  It's not long before I hear BookHam again.

&gt;Bookham:  Look at how heavy you're breathing!  Haha!  Jeeeeez!

I don't even want to comment about it at this point, I'm exhausted and really trying to finish strong on the stairs.

&gt;Bookham:  You climbed so many stairs?  How?  Are you trying to show off?   You look like you're killing yourself.

Now, mind you I was climbing at a very mild pace because it's still a workout I'm not used to.  We've been climbing for a good few minutes and I've done maybe 29 flights.  For the amount of time we've climbed it's not very impressive.  Out of curiosity I look at how many flights she's climbed....SIX.  I didn't even think it was possible.  She would have had to be climbing literally under a flight a minute.  I hadn't been really paying that much attention to her as I'm the kind of person to stare straight forward to keep myself concentrated.  Granted, she was climbing on the LOWEST setting but it still just seemed like an accomplishment in laziness.

We finish our stairs and we're done.  RenLegs tries to offer encouragement, and she clearly enjoyed the experience

&gt;RenLegs: Don't you feel great?  

&gt;BookHam: Maybe YOU people feel great but that's exhausting!  What part of that is supposed to be GREAT?  I don't think I want to do that again with you, you're kind of a nazi at the gym Valdrick.  I'm gonna go with CurlyBlond next time!

I'm a little frustrated because I really didn't see her do anything.  She was sweaty as all get out, but she really slacked everywhere she could.  At this point I was still trying to be friends so I withheld any comments and we went back to the dorm.  We pulled out some movies.  Me and RenLegs really wanted to watch Ferngully for nostalgia's sake and see Robin Williams as Batty again since he'd so recently passed.  BookHam insisted we watch one of her X-men films.  We tried to argue with her but she was totally abrasive about it and went on and on about how it was HER television and she didn't want to watch any stupid cartoon movies.  It was the television she brought, so we relinquished it to her.

She started to groan about how single she was, how everyone else in the dorm had boyfriends and she had never so much as kissed a boy.  At this point I still had some sympathy for her and offered to take her to Gaming Club with me

&gt;Valdrick:  You should come with me to Gaming Club!  Tons of single guys there, and they're all pretty dorky.

&gt;Bookham: Eeewww.  Like I'd want to get with one of those geeky guys.  They're usually pretty ugly.

Now mind you, my boyfriend was one of those ""pretty ugly"" guys from Gaming Club and I felt a little offended.

&gt;Valdrick: They're not all bad, and besides you share some interests with them.  You're really into Percy Jackson and Harry Potter, right?

&gt;Bookham: Well, if one of them likes Harry Potter get back to me.  But only if he's hot.

I ask her what her definition of 'hot' is and she shows me a picture off her phone.  I swear it's a male model glossed up with washboard abs and a caramel tan.  Now I'm not about to argue with her on preference because everyone's free to be attracted to what they like, but damn this girl had some high standards.

We eventually went to bed.  A strange day, but a cakewalk compared to the reign of terror BookHam was soon to rope me and the other roommates into.  Our dorm was about to become a prison of condishuns and Salt and Vinegar Pringles.  Where BookHam will drown out all speaking in the living room with 'All About that Bass' on repeat and hope is dead.

Hope it wasn't too long, but this girl literally just does SO MUCH in a day it's hard to edit out what's not totally weird.  I'll post the rest soon and try to get up to date so I can cover her more recent antics and the hole she has dug herself."

A few months after being put on partner-track by the firm owner, a much older gentlemen was brought on as partner as he was formerly in independent practice and brought a moderately-sized book of business to the table. As it was explained to me, the old man (age 70) will be retiring in a few years and I am slowly taking over his book of business which will allow a smooth transition to partnership upon his retirement.

Prior to this, the firm was 100% female other than student interns, and so I'd avoided many of the issues women have to deal with in this male-dominated industry. The Old Man is a nice guy and other than the fact that he's lazy and slow to adapt our technology, he's been easy to work with, EXCEPT for one nasty little habit of his: boob-gazing. 

I've noticed that he regularly looks at my chest, whether I'm showing any skin or not (I'm usually a very modest dresser) and, of course, I hate it. I'm not sure how to handle this situation as I do not want to do anything to jeopardize my partnership in the firm. My boss, the firm owner, generally avoids all confrontation like the plague and so I'm hesitant to discuss the subject with her. We do not have an HR department, though we have an external HR liaison who helps the firm owner with paperwork and performance reviews and I'm not sure if this would fall within the liaison's duties.

I really don't want to put my career here at risk, but I also really want to tell this gross old man that he needs to stop staring at my chest. Do you all have any suggestions or experience with this sort of thing? I'm just not sure how best to proceed.

Thank you in advance for your help.

2hx803,1,2014-09-30,Getting second thoughts,binnist,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/2hx803/getting_second_thoughts/,"Hey guys
I guess this must have been discussed here before but I just wanted to get this off my chest.

I'm getting second thought about this business and if it's worth it to be in it.
The reason I feel this way is because it is a lot of struggle making ends meet which I kinda knew when I started in this at the start but I didn't expect something like this. Then again it might just my situation.

I've always had a passion for filmmaking and I really enjoyed it when I was just filming for the fun of it and as a hobby.
I got lucky enough to get a internship at a pretty huge company that produces online video content that many millions watch (Don't wanna name the company if I decide to stick to it and don't wanna get into some problems later on)
After my internship I got offered a part time job as I was finishing school at the same time and things were pretty good, the wages was a nice income while I was finishing my education.

I finished my education and they talked to me about getting me some more work and I was happy about that and didn't even think of applying for some more education since I thought I was getting more work. 

And of course they backed out of it and hired instead 2 other interns in to do the work I couldn't do since they didn't have money to pay me (which is btw still the ""maximum"" wage a student can earn by some rules, and it's not much... it's about 20$ an hour, no extra money for overtime)

So now I'm ""stuck"" with this crappy deal of 80 hours a month and it's really making me thing twice if I really want to be in the low-paid, sometime stressful job. I've lost all passion for filmmaking as soon as I don't feel like my work is being appreciated enough to get a decent wage.

I know I'm being buttfucked by the company, but are there anyone here that had similar experience and what did you end up doing? "
2hxc8v,1,2014-09-30,Should I quit my internship because of my anxiety/depression? I need help,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2hxc8v/should_i_quit_my_internship_because_of_my/,"I'm a 24 yo female who just finished college. I've always been an anxious person. Some things were worse than others (being late, knowing about organization if I'm doing something or going somewhere) but never prevented me from living a completely normal life.


I moved to a completely different country very far from mine when I was only 20 for a year to work in one of the biggest international organizations in the world. No problem. I'm usually mildly social, as in I love staying home and watching tv, but also enjoy going out with people and talking to people/making friends was never an issue.
I've had panic attacks in the past, for which I was given Lexomil. It worked fine. I also took Ads (Zoloft) about 5 years ago when I left for college and had a hard time adjusting. Everything went back to normal quickly and I enjoyed my college years.


College is now over and I have a happy life. I share a home with my amazing bf, I get along great with my family and friends, and I got my final internship. That's when all hell broke loose.


So I got this internship, 1000km away from home. No biggie, it's going to be hard, I'm going to miss my boyfriend, but hey, it's a really good experience, in the (very restricted) field I love, and it's only 3 months, right ? RIGHT? Well, turns out this internship is driving me crazy and ruining my life. A month before leaving, I started having panic attacks again. It had been YEARS. Wanna go to the movies with bf? Nope. Wanna go to a restaurant? Once again, nope nope nope half way. Can't breathe, wanna throw up, GI fuck up (I feel like i'm really going to crap my pants, I can actually feel it in my bowels, sorry about that), cold sweats, dizziness, I turn white as a ghost, we're going home. I see a doctor, they give me lexomil again, I can go to the supermarket without feeling like I'm going to die. And now it's time to go. I take my pill, my boyfriend drops me to the train station, and I'm off to my fantastic internship.


I've been here a month. It's be awful. My tummy hurts ALL THE TIME, I'm scared 24/7, can't eat, always tired, cry all the time (this is very unusual for me). Everything is ok when I'm in the office or in my studio. Once I'm out, it's a fucking pain. On the bus to and from work: anxiety, angry belly, so scared to crap my pants. EVERYDAY. TWICE. I thought visiting my boyfriend would make it better. Bus to go to the train station: fucking horrible. Drive to get home: I'm sure I'm going to crap my pants (in case you haven't noticed, I tend to have horrible diarrhea when anxiety kicks in). Get home: I can't go back there it's fucking awful, I hate it, I'm miserable. To the point I don't even want to visit anymore because the trips are so stressful but I miss him so much.


I finally decide to see my doctor again. Depression + anxiety (I might have cried like a baby). He tells me to keep taking the lexomil whenever the attack is here, puts me on 25mg of Zoloft, and sends me to a psychiatrist. That was last night. I took the zoloft this morning along with an anti-spasmodic and ¼ lexomil before going to work. An hour later, I'm supposed to attend a conference I really wanted to go to. I was stopped on my way by an explosive case of diarrhea, I shit you not (ahah). It was absolutely horrible. The pain, the anxiety. Telling my coworker I wasn't going to be able to go because the pain is so intense. Nausea on top of that. I manage to stay at my desk the whole day after a couple imodiums. It's 5pm, time to go home, yay! Not before a quick stop to the bathroom, diarrhea again, that quick stop lasted 15 minutes, where does all this shit come from anyway, I have barely eaten in days, I'm not gonna make it home. I did make it home in the end and called my doctor, who said it's not clear whether my GI problems are due to Zoloft (since it's one of the side effects) or still the result of my anxiety. Just keep taking it for a few days and we'll see.


Well too bad, I have 2 appointments I CAN NOT MISS tomorrow. How the fuck am I supposed to live through this? Imodiums are not even really working anymore. I'm supposed to visit my bf next weekend, I don't think I can make it either.


Now here is where I need your help: With 2 months left and this internship clearly ruining my life, do I suck it up and stay while trusting my sphincters, even though I'm miserable, or do I get the fuck out of dodge and go home and take time for myself? I feel like I can't stay here like this for 2 more months. I feel like I can't even work properly tomorrow right now. But I'm afraid leaving will just make it even harder to do anything in the future. That if I escape and hide, I fail and let it all get the best of me. That after that, I won't be able to do anything until I'm stuck in my house, alone with my cats because frankly, no one wants to be with someone who can't even leave the house. I'm really scared. What should I do?"

It's a long time since my first post, but it took time to have an actual update. But now I have very happy updates and would like to share it with you. First I would like to thank for the support and valuable advice about my mother. You were completely right in all you said.

At August/2013 I started a new college course in computer science, to seek for another career that could give me a decent payment. I was very keen to find an internship so after only two weeks I found one and a part-time job, and then started with a crazy routine: part-time job on the morning, internship at afternoon and college at night. It was completely exhausting but made me feel useful.

My mother was seeing my effort to get away from home as much as I could, and she surprisingly supported me all the time. She would even prepare food for me, what is *very* rare. When this happened I remembered what some of you said, that maybe she was actively competing with me because of my father, and once I was out of my house almost 100% of the time, she didn't see me as a threat anymore.

The weekends were the worst part of my week, when I had to stay at home all day with her. Most of the times we just ignore each other peacefully, but sometimes she would freak out with little things and start a fight. My dad just watched, and supported her in everything she would rant with him about me.

Fast forward to last December, I met a very nice guy on Okcupid and started long-distance dating. The first three months were a bit awkward but we set the things right. We were 600 km apart, so it was very difficult to see each other, on the best case scenario 2 times/month. But we were handling fine with that.I would share everything of my life with him, including my issues with my family. He gave me all support and care, shared some bad stuff that happened with his family too. I was relieved to have him with me.

It turns out that I always wanted to be a college professor (because of my master's degree) and never stopped looking for job positions, even while working on other area. My boyfriend supported me very much on this, and we used to search for positions together. We would constantly look into the universities websites and keep updated with what was being offered.

Time passed and this August we finally saw a position to teach my master's expertise area on a city 20 km away from where he lives! We were so excited and I didn't think twice: applied for it and... I passed!!! I was so happy!!!

Suddenly my life changed upside down: quit both jobs, quit college, left behind friends and family and moved to a completely new city. My boyfriend was so happy and helping me with everything. Because of the sudden move, I had to stay at his house for 3 weeks until finding a room for me near the university, and it was great! 

My mom just changed from water to wine since then. She respects me, listens to what I have to say, helps me with everything. Now I can say that we recovered the nice relationship we had when I was a kid. Now have a decent job, a nice payment, I pay my own expenses, I'm living near my boyfriend and I feel that I have my mom back :) I'm very happy!

**tl;dr**: after one year everything changed in my life, now I have a decent job, moved out from my home, have a great and supportive boyfriend, and my mom completely changed -- now we're friends again."

This is my dream job. The interview's in about 2 weeks.

And I'm scared to death.

I'm shutting everything else down to cram for their rigorous interview process.

When I pick the thread back up, I'm debating abandoning C++ in favor of Python and some awesome data science projects/tutorials/lectures. Part of the reason I've taken so long on the C++ side is that I've literally spent months trying to make it as interesting/exciting/fun as Java and it's much more difficult than I had anticipated. I don't do anything half-assed and I've got a couple really poor recorded lectures that will never see the light of day. I was hoping to jump the gun and help put together stuff for COP3503, but the class'll be half done by the time the first video goes up that it might just be best to start anew with something truly interesting not motivated by the UF course structure. Ah well, that's a discussion for another time. I've gone off on too much of a tangent already.

Wish me luck with Google!"
