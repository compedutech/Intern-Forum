Feel free to AMA.  This is the introduction to the insanity that was living with crack cocaine addicts in a rental house in an up and coming ghetto of Toledo, OH. I'm trying to make this similar to the multipart stories found in /r/talesfromtechsupport. 

One night, my depressive self-medicating tendencies finally caught up to me.  I was sitting in my living room with my roommates enjoying a bong and some Netflix like usual.  My roommate whose parents own the house said ""Dan, we need to talk"".  This is never a good sign, so I agree because what the hell else is a man to do.  Apparently his scumbag oversheltering mom was not too fond of walking in, unannounced i might add, one day to me sitting on the couch stoned as all hell with a giant bong in between my legs. (It was her son's bong, note mine btw.) She had also found out about my recent drunken trip to Chipotle one night that culminated with me being hospitalized. Bottom line: she wanted me out.  

So my night just did a 180 right into shitville.  I had already signed a lease and my friend and his mom didn't want to evict me.  I didn't want an eviction on my record either.  So I was to just leave the next day, without any time to prepare.  The only bright spot was that the month's rent that I had already paid would be refunded. I didn't know what to do, so like many other crazy ass stories, I hopped on craigslist.  I didn't know where else I could find a place that I could afford as I had been paying $300 a month which included all utilities. 

Even in a shitty Rustbelt city, you're not gonna find rent that cheap many places, not even in the hood.  At the time, $300 was about all I could afford. I was studying for my bachelor's degree and I got barely any support from my family. I had an internship with an OEM auto parts company that manufactures transmissions, drive shafts, axles, etc., so I was down but not out.  I stumbled upon some ads that seemed promising, but they were all already taken, or too far away from school and my internship.  Then I came across a very poorly written ""roommate wanted"" ad.

This house was in an area I was completely unfamiliar with, so I hit up google streetview to see what was up.  Didn't look too bad so I gave the guy a call on his home phone number that was listed on the ad.  It was shut off, red flag number one.  I finally got him on his cell and he sounded like a normal enough guy, definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed, but normal.  His name was mike but he went by ""red"", he said he already had one roommate who was a year younger than me and that made it sound more normal.  Red was around 50, but he seemed cool enough, I specifically asked him if he had a problem with a little drinkin and weed smoking, and that was cool.  Later I would wish that he had mentioned what was also cool in his house: crack smoking.  I made arrangements to go see the house that afternoon.  Red wasn't going to be home. but Steve, the other guy who was around my age would.

On the way to the house I noticed the neighborhood getting progressively worse.  I figured what the hell, I can live in the hood as long as the people I'm livin with aren't too bad.  I got to the house and right next door was an abandoned house that was burned out and boarded up, red flag number 2.  I stupidly keep pursuing this, because I was in a bind and didn't want to have to go to a hotel.  I met Steve and he was a bit off, but he showed me around and told me what was up.  They had shitty furniture, a shitty TV, and a shitty computer, but the house was in surprisingly good condition.  The carpet was still white, things were generally tidy, not too much clutter, seemed decent.

Steve was pretty quiet and didn't say much, he seemed a bit off.  I've known some pretty socially awkward and shy people in my day so fine, whatever.  Then Red makes his way home, and introduces himself.  He seems a bit skeptical of me and protective over Steve.  He said it was cool if I moved in but was really worried about the rent.  He wanted it in cash and told me: ""money talks, bullshit walks"". We made arrangements that it would be month to month, no lease, and that my rent would be due on the 16th of every month because that would be best for him as Steve paid his on the 1st. It was kind of funny to me, I wanted to prorate it and then pay full rent on the 1st of Oct.  This was unacceptable because he didn't even understand the math.  I just said fuck it and plowed ahead with the deal, went to the atm, got the cash, and paid him. I didn't get a receipt and he gave me shit about even askin and told me he doesn't do that.  I realized I wasn't gonna get my money back now so I started moving in.

Moving went quickly as Red and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Holly helped. When I met Holly, it was obvious she was a hard partier; she had the biker girl look and was in her 40s.  Plot twist: Holly is Steve's mom. When they saw how much nicer my stuff was compared to theirs, they warned me not to leave it lying around.  If I did, it might get stolen by ""the people coming in and out"".  That also seemed odd, but whatever, I never leave my stuff out in a shared living situation anyway.  The first night was all good, normal enough, Red was friendly and even gave me a nickname: ""college boy"". Seemed like I could make this work.  I had no idea of the horrors to come..."
1445l9,3,2012-12-01,I just want to feel like I'm good enough.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1445l9/i_just_want_to_feel_like_im_good_enough/,"For once, just once, in my life, I would like to feel good enough. I want to BE good enough, rather than always missing the mark or just being average.

Every day I wake up and briefly imagine a world where things are different. Where I'm the pretty girl that guys are interested in for more than a week. The straight-A student. The successful marketing major, with the charisma, resourcefulness, and creativity needed to succeed in the real world. 

Then reality sits in. I look in the mirror and see that I am ugly, not curvy enough, but not skinny enough either. I can't focus on my schoolwork. I worry that I'm in the wrong major because I'm not as extroverted or creative or innovative as my peers. I slowly watch as everything slips away from me: my grades, my weight, my best friends, my family, my opportunities for internships and to exceed in my field. 

I wonder what will happen when I completely lose everything. I can't handle being 100 percent alone, without a stable career or any support system. If I fail at school, or getting a job, I have nothing to fall back on. I'm not even close to being good at anything else besides marketing. What career path would I take? In social situations and to men I am invisible. What will I do if I end up ""forever alone""?

What do you do when, no matter how hard you try, all you are is painfully average and often overlooked? All I wish for, every day when I wake up, is that someone will see me and think I am worth their time --be it in a romantic, friendship, or career setting. I just want to feel worth it. That's all."
1431xc,164,2012-11-30,"To anyone thinking about copping out on their giftee, please read my secret santa story. ",linds360,secretsanta,https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/1431xc/to_anyone_thinking_about_copping_out_on_their/,"Yeah it's long. I'm not brief, but it's the story of a girl who grew up and dealt with humiliation. That shit hurts.

I'd actually forgotten this memory for a while because it happened when I was 15 (31 now,) but for some reason it came back to me today while I was sitting in Friday traffic on the way home from work, so I thought I'd share. Here goes...

I grew up being a huge Superman fan and ever since I can remember I always wanted to be the next Lois Lane. While I loved Superman, I didn't want him to save me, but I sure as hell wanted to write like Lois did. I loved writing about anything and everything. 

As a kid I would document my mom's moves in the kitchen minute by minute or report on which bird feeder was favored by our winged guests that day. I always had a pad of paper in hand and a pen tucked behind my ambitious ear. I was addicted to writing - news especially. It made sense to me. 

When my parents finally told me the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy were a lie, I wasn't surprised. Not because those ideas are far fetched, but because if it was *really* news, I'd had heard about it long before my parents made this report to a me. I just figured it was old news and certainly not worth reporting. Not on my memo pad at least. 

(Sorry, I may be providing too much background...moving on.)

Fast forward to high school. I grew up and never lost my Lois Lane ambition. I bounded into high school ready to write up a storm because this was the first time I would have an opportunity to write for a *real* paper. The High School had its own paper and I couldn't wait to run into the newsroom and write. 

Turns out only Sophomores were eligible to be in the Newspaper class, so I was turned away. However I was tenacious (read: annoying) and wouldn't take no for an answer, so the administration agreed to let me be a newspaper ""intern"" during that class period if I agreed to also do homework for an 8th period class that I was not part of but would be given all the notes for. That class was Health Education. I am happy to report that I have never had an STD or been pregnant, but I digress...

I said YES YES YES in so many ways. I remember jumping up and down because I was so damn happy. I told my mom when I got home from school that day that I had made it! 

I waltzed into that room during 8th period the next day thinking I'd be asked to write a BIG story. I had my pens and paper ready to go. 

Not one single person looked at me. Oh they looked, but turned away almost immediately. I was defeated, but not broken.

Days and weeks went by. I was able to sit in on editor meetings and watch the writers turn facts into stories, but nobody looked at me. Nobody wanted to see me. 

I was ok with that, until December came along and the whole staff was involved in a Secret Santa exchange. 

I thought this is my chance. This is how I will show everyone that I can give a good gift and maybe then, they'll know me. So I made my mom take me to Bath and Body Works. I worked at TCBY at the time so I didn't have a lot of money, but I really wanted to WOW the newspaper team, so i spent a week's worth of my paycheck and bought my giftee lotions and body scrubs and lip balm - the whole nine yards. I was so excited to have her open it. 

And she LOVED it. She really did and I was so happy.

Then came the other gifts.

One after another and not one of them had my name. Again and again people opened their gifts and a knot welled up in my stomach. 

OH MY GOD... they are not going to call my name. There wasn't going to be a gift for me...

My Secret Santa had skipped class that day... 

I wanted to run and hide. ""You can't hide under the desk, silly. Fake sick, Just FAKE SICK.""

 I had no idea what to do. 

When the Newspaper Adviser realized what had happened, he went to his briefcase and pulled out a tool set (no doubt meant for some other purpose) and gave it to me. 

I held out my hands and took it while holding back 9th grade tears. My teacher was the only person who gave me a gift. Why on earth did nobody in this class understand how hard I've been trying to become a part of them and now, here I am, taking a tool set from my teacher. Do they not see how hard this hurts? Have they never been here? Why does it have to be me?

Why does it hurt so much just to be me?

I guess there's a reason I blocked this out - it was the saddest gift I've ever received in my entire life.

So I end this story here. If you're a giftee please give your person something. If you don't have any money send them a card - it might mean the world to them. 

*EDIT:* I should note that I became the Editor and Chief of that school newspaper and made sure that no one ever was meant to feel the way I did. Freshmen and Sophomores were welcome to submit stories and feel a part of the experience.

It was a great paper up until I left and I left it in great hands. That Advisor became Principal of the school - no joke. He's a great guy. 

I'll provide proof if needed. Oh and I became an Art Director... if you care :)

142x1e,38,2012-11-30,I have an idea that I think could change higher education. ,Natefil,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/142x1e/i_have_an_idea_that_i_think_could_change_higher/,"**Summary**
---
The goal is to create a system that utilizes competitive measures at every level of the education process, centers around individualized learning styles, allows for international learning and cheap education, and provides an aspect of job placement that is unmatched in any university. 

***

**The Problem**
---

Currently, the university system exhibits some dangerous symptoms that libertarians are all too familiar with.

* **Costs:** Student loan debt within the United States now sits at 1 trillion dollars. This is a massive number and, much like the home loan crisis, many economists believe that it will inevitably crash. The problem is that these loans are easily accessible. Because many of them are easily acquired colleges can raise their prices through offering more services to capitalize on the easily accessed finances. Even during times of economic crises the prices rise and the results are not great. More students are delinquent on payments now than before, more students drop out, and the field in which you receive your education is, more often than not, not the one in which you get your job.

* **Utility:** Colleges primarily serve as a means of ensuring a better paying job to their students. Sure, one can say that they are about higher learning but people are more interested in being able to utilize a degree for a better career. The problem is that the college degree doesn't say as much as it once did. A college degree is basically a stamp of approval that you have met their measures but what does that mean? Does that mean that they've weeded out all of the slackers? Not really. Does it mean that they've found the smartest students and all the dumb ones failed out? Not really. Does it even mean that if you don't succeed at college that you are unfit for jobs that require greater intellects. No! So the college, not giving you the necessary tools you need to find a job, have given you a ""stamp of approval"" that means less and less.

* **Learning Styles:** Currently, universities teach one learning style. If you don't learn best by sitting in class and listening to a professor then more often than not you are wasting your class time. There are people who are audio learners, visual learners, kinesthetic learners, and reading and writing learners (as broad categories, there are actually differentiations within these subsets). Would a student learn information better if instead of giving money for a professor they spent it on a tutor that is tailored to their specific learning style? I believe so. But such avenues are rarely utilized in higher education.

***

**My Solution**
---

**The Players**

* *""Contractor"":* This is where the difference begins and it's the last step of the education process but it is the greatest differentiator. Contractors are people with connections to companies in a specific market. Now the contractor can be an individual or a company; the point is that they are selling their services to students. The contractor goes to companies within the market and asks what the companies are looking for in a mathematician, accountant, economist, biologist, etc. They then offer their services to students who meet their criteria. I believe that this will develop to a point where contractors will have students enter into short programs similar to internships or work-study programs so that they can prove their capacities in the field and their work ethics. But the contractor needs a simple way to make sure that the student has learned much of the material. That's where the program comes in.

* *The Programs:* Using the website that is designed to facilitate all of this, companies, schools or individuals create programs formulated to teach students necessary information in any field. These programs all compete against each other in price and quality (and contractors that utilize the system). There will be amazing programs that are expensive, with fantastic contractors that teach a variety of learning styles. There will be brand new programs that haven't built a reputation but need to get started so they offer their services for free. Students will have the ability to pick any education out there that suits their budgets and their needs. Aiming to maintain a strong consumer base, these programs will be forced to teach people in their own way. I would predict programs using multiple ways of teaching (like Rosetta stone) and maintaining a strong tutor program that utilizes excellent testers. Which brings us to the next element.

* *The Testers:* This may exist or it may not. I believe it will come about as a necessity for programs. Currently, the only way to test if someone knows information is to set them down in front of a piece of paper with many questions and let them have at it. But this just proves someone's short term memory and recall. Someone may be fantastic with a great working knowledge but not be a good test taker. Testers are specialized in accessing whether an individual knows a program's information. So some may offer tests you can take (similar to how they are given now), others may have options where you enter into a one on one session with a tester or tutor and they engage you in the process, another option would be to force students to go to a facility for a week where they get ""hands on experience"" that demonstrates their working knowledge. I don't know what direction it will go, the market will sort that out.

* *Tutors:* This is where the idea originated. If you have a program that has many different things that you need to master, a competitive tutor market would make learning these things much easier. You have tutors that argue that they have certain specializations. Some may be good at teaching audio learners, others visual learners, some may be able to teach several different types, and some may be multilinguists adept at crossing linguistic barriers. The competitive market means that there will be some great tutors that are expensive, some cheap tutors that can get the job done, and some affordable or even free tutors that need to build a reputation before they demand more money. This system would also allow students to be tutors and some programs may demand that a student needs to log a certain amount of tutor hours in order to prove their knowledge (teaching a subject helps you learn it).

***

**Addendums** 
---

* **Constraints:** I'm limited by my lack of computer knowledge and space to show how programs could look and how the differentiation could be seen. If someone is willing to help me come up with templates I would love them forever.

* **Questions:** I'll be willing to answer any questions about how this could operate, if I don't get any right away I'll post some of the most common problems people have lobbed. 

* **Bonuses:** What I think could be incredible about this idea is how it is self-correcting for market fluctuations. Currently, if one industry goes down, people don't realize it for a long time after and they can't compensate. If an industry starts to be less viable, or if too many people are entering the industry then the costs of the contractors will go up and people will move to alternatives.

**tl;dr:** Free markets can fix education. We create a website built on competition to solve the problems."

She was in an abusive relationship (hitting, verbal abuse, possible cheating) with a guy for the entire time I'd known her prior to us dating.  I was there for her every time, every fight, every crying spell until she'd had enough.  

We started dating about a month or so after she finally broke it off with him, and continued to date for 8 months.  One day, she called me out of the blue wanting to break it off.  As I was telling a friend what had just happened, he told me he'd heard she had been messing around with some other guy [24/25] for a little over a month.  I called her out immediately, she confessed, and that was pretty well that. 

Turns out this guy lives in a run-down apartment, has no car, no schooling, has few friends, works as a waiter, and spends most of his time smoking pot and watching TV.  Conversely, I'm successful, have a large group of friends who respect me, am fairly good looking (not a GQ model, but you get it), and will be graduating with a degree next year after my internship is up.   

And now, less than a month after the break-up, she's started seeing this guy.

Luckily I'm on the other side of the coast until early March doing my internship, and won't have to see either of them until I come back home, but once there, it's inevitable I will.  How should I react to all of this?  I've been to hell and back with this girl - for this girl - and still care about her despite all the wrong she's done to me.  We've grown too close for me to simply shut her out.

TL;DR
Girl dumps me, I find out she's been cheating, and we stop talking.  I see her in about 3 months.  Where do I go from there, if anywhere?

So my on again, off again romance with my significant other (20f) has been thrown for a huge loop this weekend. On Friday she called me and wished to let me know how much she missed me, and how much she loved me. We hugged, we cried, we kissed, all of the usual. However in stating these feelings for me, she also made a horrifying statement to me: that she may have feelings for her boss at her internship (31m). Now first of all RED FLAG ALL OVER, A) because I have been telling her consistently for 3 months to tell this man off as I did not like how much he texted her, and how he talked to her, and B) because as soon as the opportunity arises to actually see him, she goes on a date + a meet up. All of this after swearing to me the reason she broke up with me in the first place was because she couldn't date anyone; she needed time to just be alone, and herself. She told me that she is not sure whether she is actually interested in him, or if she is merely using him to fill a void in her heart from me. Now this weekend she said she would reconsider dating me, and I admittedly made a fool of myself by texting her and calling her while she asked for space. But the mere idea she could be seeing/texting/calling him drove me absolutely crazy.

Her internship is over this week (Thursday), afterwards it gets tricky. This man is literally her only professional reference, so I cannot ask her to cut communication with him entirely. At the same time, I told her yesterday that I refuse to date her again unless she tells him point blank she is going to try and patch things up with me.

I feel incredibly betrayed. After months of working to make things better, and feeling better about our chances, it was like a dagger to my heart.
She has said she does not love him, she loves me, and she has consistently stated how she hates the idea of me being with anyone else, too (the whole conversation started after seeing a picture of myself and a friend on Instagram at a bar).

I don't know what to do Reddit. This is such a messed up situation. How can I compete with a guy nearly a third my age, with money and power??? Should this betrayal be considered unforgivable?

TL;DR: Significant other may want to start dating again, but has revealed she is currently seeing her internship boss that she swore for months she did not have feelings for. What should I do???"

Style -- A Guide to Getting Lit and Staying Fit in the Next 30 Days",SlimMcGinn,insanityworkout,https://www.reddit.com/r/insanityworkout/comments/146xcg/holiday_partying_insanity_style_a_guide_to/,"So it's that time of year again.  Office holiday parties, college kids home from school, and your local tavern decked out in romantic holiday lights.  And between the spiked eggnog and the fact that you have never looked better, it's time to get weird.  Good.  You deserve it.  

After countless hours of Shaun T screaming at you and Tanya's wooooing duck face, you owe it to yourself to knock back a half dozen Hot Toddies and see if some clothes come off with that cute dude or chick from Human Resources/sophomore Trig/the end of the bar.  Right on.  Get after it.

Now trust me, I am no nutritionist.  I hold no degrees in physiology or biology, and everything I know about dieting I read (skimmed) in the Insanity Fitness Guide.  

I am, however, a bartender.  A bartender in the best shape of his life, currently pounding away at Insanity! Round Two.  

So unless you want to be ski-abbing through an extra 10 pounds *on top* of a pile-driving hangover come the new year, heed the following:

**Beer**

Put away your doppelbocks and milk stouts for the season, boys.  Even the limited edition Christmas ale has got to go...  Because you're doing 12 oz curls, Insanity! style.  

The gold standard here is Miller 64 or Bud Select 55.  No reason to waver.  Both are terribly named and will prompt double takes when ordered at a bar.  Who cares?  They taste close enough to a normal light beer, and you know exactly how many calories you're getting (a third less than a normal light while only losing 1% ABV).  Guys, yeah, your pretend-beer-snob buddies are going to trash you unmercifully.  But they'll be doing it while their dates eye-bang you from across the room.  

If you're at a bar and you are uncomfortable publicly drinking a low-cal beer, A. grow up, B. ask for a glass.  Same goes at house parties.  Bring a bottle of good booze for the host and a twelve pack of Miller 64 for you. Throw it in the fridge and find a pint glass in the cabinet or a red cup by the keg.  Fill from your stash, don't be a jackass if someone wants one, and nobody will know the difference.  Office parties are harder, especially if they are not held at a bar.  Your best bet in terms of what will most likely be served is Amstel Light (95 cals), Miller Lite (96 cals), or Coors Light (102 cals per bottle).

For further reference on beer calories check out: http://www.beertutor.com/beers/index.php?t=lowest_cal

**Wine**

Because of the numerous varietals and the myriad makers, pinning down exactly how many calories are in the glass of whatever bottle your match.com date is currently sniffing the cork of (idiot) is harder.  Generally speaking, the drier the wine, the fewer the calories.  The accepted thinking is that on average, a 4oz glass of red has about 95 calories and a 4oz glass of white has about 90.  

That's fine, but this is the holidays.  You will not be drinking 4 ounces of wine, you will be drinking 40.  So plan accordingly and just know you're gonna have to get serious with the globe jumps.  It's worth noting that they do make low-cal wine (Skinnygirl, So Light, Brightlight).  They clock in around 70 calories (more for the Housewife's brand).  They are relatively hard to find.  And they are garbage.  That is, don't show up to a party flashing low-cal wine as your contribution.  Bring a nice bottle of red for everybody and if you must, stash the low-cal bottle inconspicuously somewhere in the house (upstairs bathroom under the sink generally works).  Sneak away and refill accordingly.  

If you are hosting, it's easier.  Before your guests arrive, fill a decanter with a decent red.  Then fill the empty bottle with your garbage low-cal red.  Serve from the decanter, fill your own glass from the bottle.  But keep an eye on it!  The last thing you want is one of your friends or some dude you are trying to hook up with refilling his glass from the garbage bottle.  Even a Two-Buck-Chucker will know the difference.

**Cocktails**

When it's all said and done and the place is drank dry, alcohol is sugar.  No getting around it.  The key is not being an idiot about your mixers.  Bacardi, Bombay, Cuervo, Kettle, and Jack all come in around 40% ABV and 100 calories a shot (1.5oz).  Any of their equivalents generally do too.  It's not mixing it with nonsense that will save you the extra power jacks.  

If you must mix, make the smart (obvious) choices.  Stick to two ingredient drinks and go diet not regular, soda not tonic.  Avoid sour mix like poison.  Use extra fruit for flavor.  You know what you like, just modify it to cut out the excess calories.  If you drink brown:  Jack and soda, buncha limes.  Order it just like that.  If you drink clear:  Kettle, soda, splash of cran, with a lime.  Boom, now you're properly lubricated to charmingly deflect the jailbait intern's compliments on your shoulders.

As with wine, specifically made low-cal booze is out there (most notably, again, the Housewife's).  Let's be real honest here.  Ladies, stocking Skinnygirl in your home bar is probably acceptable.  Gentlemen, get real.  Save face, grab an empty Absolut bottle and pull the switch.  Also, if you plan on making cocktails with low-cal booze at someone else's holiday house party, you're flasking it.  And be discreet, otherwise you will look like you're spiking the punch at a 50's dance.

Now then, it's snowing, the fire is roaring, and you look great... 

The stockings are hung by the chimney with care.  B-Boy Jeff has almost kicked Arielle in the face.  And somewhere Akil is probably giving up on power jumps.   

It's time to get hammered and make some questionable choices.

**Drink up, Dig Deeper, &amp; Happy Holidays**

146wau,8,2012-12-03,"Lessons I learned from ocean swimming apply to a breakup...long-winded, but hear me out. (32/m)",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/146wau/lessons_i_learned_from_ocean_swimming_apply_to_a/,"We all know we should take care of ourselves during the intense post-breakup period, and here's a long-winded, weird-ass explanation of why...


So, since getting dumped by a woman I loved, I've turned back to healthy living to try to rise above letting this experience hijack my brain, my heart, my grades, my hospital internship, my life.  But, like everyone else, I have my ups and downs, in days and weeks.  Most of it is natural to the process, and I've been mindful to *face* the intense emotions and work *through* them, and not drown them out or numb them, but how did I contribute to the intensity?


All of us here in the trenches are gonna cycle from exhilarated to be free, to feeling absolutely nothing, to nausea, insomnia, and body-convulsing, uncontrollable sobbing sessions.  In no particular order.  But taking care of yourself *will* take the edge off.  And that care just might keep you from crossing various personal thresholds.


When I was ocean swimming regularly enough that I could occasionally bang out two-milers, it took commitment.  Beyond the obvious time-in-the-water three-times-a-week part of it, I had to make sure that I ate enough and slept enough *every day*.  Also, I had to make sure I kept the alcohol to minimum as well.  Cigarettes, too (I know, I know; I'm an idiot when it comes to this).


Beyond all that, when I was actually in the water, it was often *tough*.  And I was usually alone.  The ocean isn't the lap pool--often it's cold, crappy visibility, current, chop, swell, wind, *wildlife* (PM me if you wanna hear how much I hate sea lions).  But sometimes I had fantastic sessions when the conditions were awful, and sometimes when everything was ideal I still just couldn't find my rhythm.


And sometimes, I'd just get scared of sharks.  It's irrational.  It's just fear from discomfort.  By the way, the bike ride to the beach is waaaaay more likely to kill you than any shark.  When I'd start fixating on fear, I'd then analyze the situation:  ""Ok, I'm clearly uncomfortable, and I can't get my rhythm.""  I'd then focus solely on maintaining a good stroke with a rhythm, and a regular breathing cadence.  Soon enough, I wouldn't be thinking about sharks, and I'd be enjoying my swim.


I had a bad day today.  Cool.  Not the first over the last couple months.  Let's troubleshoot.  Not enough sleep last night, or the night before?  Check.  Alcohol involved?  Check.  Did I work out really hard surfing and working friday and running yesterday?  Check.  Does it feel like I haven't eaten enough over the last few days?  Fucking dammit, check!


I couldn't find my rhythm cuz I hadn't covered all the basics!


When I'm not feeling my best, I feel like it's *then* that this breakup gets the best of me, and that's not fair to me; I've been through enough.


Look, during the breakup transition, shit is gonna get murky, and cold, and windy, and we're gonna be scared of sharks.  On top of that, we're gonna be involuntarily dealing with less sleep from emotional stress, and lack of appetite, sorrow, and hangovers from impulsive nights out.


All that is fine, but I know for me, I wanna come out of this stronger and better.  I need to remind myself to catch my breath and find my rhythm in all this murk and cold...and be ok doing most of it alone, like I did when I used to swim.  But it's a decision I have to stick to...and commit."

So, I have published a story on Amazon.doc, you can find the links at the end of this post if'd you like to check it out ($0.99 to read), sorry for the shameless self promotion, but on the other hand I've pasted part of the first chapter of this book, it's quite long but I hope you have a chance to read and give me some HONEST critique, i.e. if ya hate let me know! :) Happy reading :)

	
	Time had no longer become something measured on a watch or clock, but had migrated into the amount of booze my body could cuddle up next to. I did check my watch every now and again just to make sure I still had enough time to suffer the security check, which I always had. There is always time for a free beer regardless of impending deadlines, so I read her prompt again with an ounce of focus and gave her my advice about how to go about writing her essay. I wrote her a bare-boned outline, told her some tips about how to organize her thoughts and prepare a comprehensive thesis that would not only distinguish a clearly presented argument but also strangle the reader into the motivation to continue.
	“Even if the reader wants to say no, you must make ‘em say yes, understand? If you don’t accomplish at least that, there is no point in presenting your evidence to support your thesis.” I wasn’t accepted into the journalism school, so I studied politics and history instead, but she didn’t need this to be emphasized.
	“That deserves two drinks, want a shot of whiskey?” she asked turning around.
	“The best you got.”
	“Jameson?”
	“The Daniels. A double.”
	“The what?”
	“Jack Daniels.”
	She poured me a full glass of Jameson whiskey with ice and we continued our chat about how exactly she should format her argument. Suddenly, in the midst of our conversation, this girl with a big and colourful rucksack, probably about 65L or so, came up to the bar to join the prospector, the Dutch bartending writer, and drunken me; I called her the redemptionist. 
The redemptionist strolled into the bar with slow and anxious steps, her rucksack looked heavy and full, and it was immediately apparent that she wasn’t going on an adventure, but returning from an adventure of her own. However, at the same time it looked as if she was on her way to a new adventure, which she was, but I didn’t find this out until later. Her adventure was much different than my own, but for the time being we were having the same inherent problem – liquid consumption. There were just not enough brain cells to compensate for the wealth of liquids we wanted to consume. 
Before even sitting down on the high bar stools between the prospector and myself, she spoke with stern tone to my new Dutch friend. Her voice wafted with sincerity like a lawyer with dirty teeth.
	“Give me whatever you got.”
	“Well, what would you like?” said the bartender turning away from me.
	“I don’t care, whatever you got.”
	“Jack Daniels?” the bartender asked, raising my attention away from my glass of Jameson.
	“Yea, I guess, and a beer to wash it down,” redemptionist said looking ashamed, taking off her rucksack and setting in on the ground.
	“What beer would you like?” the bartender asked.
	“I don’t care, whatever you got!” she responded, this time slightly annoyed.
	“Well, what goes good with Jameson?”
	“I don’t know! Cola? Soda? What goes good with Jack Daniels?”
	“I dunno.”
	“You’re the bartender! Just make me a drink!”
	“Well, what would you like?”
	I think the bartender was either incompetent at her job or a genius, and had dealt with this type of customer many times before.
	“Have you ever had an Irish car bomb?” I piped up reclusively, hoping to end to the back n’ forth nonsense between them.
	She looked at me with a glaze of surprise, as if she was a type of person that didn’t expect someone to talk to her; however, she didn’t seem intruded. Her eyes remained calm and rather curious to my suggestion.
	“Um, well, no I have not. What is that?” she asked taking a seat. 
	“Well it’s a shot of whiskey and Baileys dropped into a glass of Guinness. It’s quite good, and it solves the whole beer and whiskey problem at the same time.”
	“Yea, whatever. I don’t care what it is, I just need a drink,” she responded as-matter-of-factly, “Excuse me Miss? Can I have an Irish car crash?”
	“What is that?” the bartender asked glancing in my direction. 
	“Well it’s a shot of whiskey and Baileys dropped into a glass of Guinness. It’s quite good, and it solves the whole beer and whiskey problem at the same time. I will have one too.” I repeated. 
	The bartender brought us our drinks, which the redemptionist gulped down heavily and heartily.
	“I’ll have another! And a beer!” she called out while I coughed in surprise inside of my own half-full Irish Car Bomb.
	Christ, she can drink, I thought suspiciously.
	Less than a couple minutes later I heard, “And another!”
	My God, I thought as I coughed inside of my drink again. I was still on reaching the last sips of my own drink, and she was already on her third.
	“And a shot of Jack for me and my friend!” she called out referring to me.
	Good Heavens, but I wasn’t even mad, just impressed. 
	The alcohol was already starting to feel heavy in my head. I wasn’t very sure what was happening at the moment; there was the tennis game of conversations between the three of us, my new internship as an English teacher in Indonesia with less than $400 in my wallet for a year ahead of me, and my pens with no ink (writer’s block). Nothing seemed clear.  Nonetheless, the more I drank the more the quiet airport bar became an exotic place where just the four of us had come together from obscure circumstances and all gathered here at this very watering hole, feeling alive and worthy like roman candles burning on Christmas Eve. The dim lights reflected off the half empty liquor bottles and the impatient people scurrying in the security lines no longer existed with their dull vibes and anxious foot tapping. 
	“This is the last drink of my life,” the redemptionist mumbled quietly as she got up from her seat and left the bar with her bags behind, “Can you watch this? Going to the bathroom.”
	It was a rather bold statement really. How could she, or anybody for that matter, say that they will never do something again? 
	Perhaps she has willpower? I thought bleakly. 
	Anything is possible, I steamed tragically.
	Then the prospector, who finally found the gold that he had been so desperately searching for, spoke up.
	“Did she just say that this is her last time drinking?” he said with a curiously flat smirk.
	“I dunno!” I became excited. The man has said nothing thus far but I already felt like we were friends, “Is that what you heard?”
	“I thought so,” said the Dutch bartender.
	“Is she an alcoholic?” prospector asked.
	“Sounds like it! Did you see how much she was drinking?” I exclaimed.
	“Sure did, she really does love her booze doesn’t she?” 
	“Maybe she is going to rehab?” the Dutch bartender inserted.
	“That’s what people usually say on their last bender.”
	“Oh my God! You are absolutely right! Could this really be her last bender? Her final trip!”
	“Her last hurrah?”
	“Could she be doing something terribly wrong?”
	“The last straw!”
	“The final frontier!”
	“She’s working hard to gain her salvation!”
	“But she’ll starve away her haste!”
	“Burn, burn, burn!”
	“Never fade away!”
	“It was sure nice knowing her.”
	“She’s coming back.”
	“Maybe she’ll find her own redemption on the other side of the door,” the prospector fumed with drunken eloquence. 
	“She’s coming back,” the bartender observed again.
	Like a flash, the three of us went back to looking as normal as possible, yet normality was now impossible. No longer was the prospector sifting for gold within his thoughts, as he had now found what he needed. He kept giving me sideways glances as we tried to maintain a rigid appearance where our conversation never existed, and we pretended to know nothing about her final day, her redemption in this world or the other. She was on quite a different adventure than myself. The air was heavy with used words that were heavier than the dim light and airport anxiety. Perhaps she noticed something as well, as when she sat back in her chair and ordered another shot and a beer, she glanced to her left at me, and to her right towards the quiet man. The gig was up. 
	“Good whiskey, huh?” the prospector said, raising his glass.
	“Yea, it’s alright. It’s my last time drinking though,” her words were getting sloppy, and her inhibitions were finally gone. Her demeanour wasn’t so freckly and she was no longer waiting for something.
	I was relieved that I wasn’t the person who would have to bring this up with her. It was quite a personal topic, but one that needed elaboration. We were three intrepid drinkers in an international airport, and therefore these types of things cannot be left for the wind.
	“Are you going to rehab or something?” I asked.
	“Yea,” she said quietly, without looking at me, “right after here I am getting on a train and going right into rehab. I’ve been travelling around for a while now, and all the partying just has to stop. Just way too much. All I’ve been doing is drinking. I’ve been to so many places, and just drinking wherever I went. Too much. My friend is waiting for me when I get off the train, and then that’s it. I’m going to stop drinking.”
	I didn’t try and contribute much else, because she was right, it did look like she has had way too much, whatever that meant. I felt sad for her, and as I chugged my own booze I thought that I could see a little bit of myself in her; at the same time this was her last hurrah, her final frontier. So despite the terrors, hardships, and whatever life she had in front and behind her, it looked like she needed a drink. I looked at the prospector, who already knew what I was thinking and therefore nodded his head. The quiet man then looked at the bartender, who already knew what both of us were thinking, and conjured up yet another Irish Car Bomb for the three of us. We gave a toast for the redemptionist, who was on an adventure all on her own. We were all on an adventure.
	Drinks went around and conversation continued about drinking, our travels, and our thoughts about her whole situation. We wanted her to have a fun time, and it did certainly look like she was having fun. The more she drank the more sober she looked, while the prospector and myself were laughing wildly and truly enjoying our time and our own futures ahead. Our words were sloppy and convoluted while hers were directed and sombre. Nonetheless, it was wonderful to experience this major event in this woman’s life. Whether or not it really was her last drinking session, she certainly made us believe that it was so. She drank her whiskey with dire confidence and with a strong knack for redemption: she had to drink to free herself, and to free herself she couldn’t drink. It was all beautifully tragic.
	Eventually, when the quiet man and myself were thoroughly drunk with the Dutch bartender now ignoring me and working on her essay, the redemptionist slammed one more shot of whiskey, drained her beer, got up from her stool, and left grabbing her backpack.
	“See you later,” was all she said after sharing this intricate moment with us hapless drunks.
	“Good luck,” I said sincerely.
	“You can do it,” the quiet man said quietly.
	And then she was gone. Somewhere there was a train waiting to take a freckled woman boasting with alcohol to the one place where she didn’t want to go, but regardless she had to go, and we wished her well.
	“Well, that was interesting!” the prospector said loudly with a slap on the bar, “Let’s go have a smoke!”
	“Well I’ll be! A smoke for the redemptionist,” I said.
	I left the bar with the prospector for another smoke, only this time the winter wasn’t cold at all. All previous excitements that I contained about my new adventure were rolled up into one cohesive thought: what a good cigarette. 
	The next thing I knew I was sloppily opening my eyes to a poor excuse of a chicken dinner with Caesar salad on the side and a glass of whiskey on my table. This whirr outside was confusing me, and I had no clue where in the world I was. I looked around and realized that I was on a plane, but to where? The booze was still swimming heavily in my head and I wasn’t sure what had happened. I remembered smoking a cigarette with the prospector, but there wasn’t much else; while sleeping I dreamt of the prospector and me running through the airport madly laughing like rambunctious children while a speaker was calling my name, but suddenly I couldn’t discern whether it was real or not. 
	I checked the in-flight television on the back of the chair in front of me and found that I was gliding over the Pacific Ocean, about six hours into the flight. Additionally, the whiskey on my desk signified that I mustn’t have been too much of an obvious drunk, for who in their right mind would give a blacked out passenger more whiskey with his chicken dinner? It was my big pacific wake up; one moment I’m smoking a cigarette outside of Chicago and the next I’m somewhere in the Pacific Ocean 30,000 feet in the air. Searching through my bags I sighed in relief to find my passport and my wallet, but when I checked my receipt from the bar I realized that I had spent about $80, and I paid my tab at 1:47; my flight was at 2:20. Therefore, the mad running through the airport wasn’t a dream, but I had made it. I had made my international flight blacked out on Irish Car Bombs in 33 minutes.
 The prospector was creating havoc and joy somewhere else in the world, the bartender was dealing with countless others like myself, the redemptionist was going through alcohol withdrawals, and I was going to Indonesia to teach English as a second language for a year with only $320 in my wallet. 
	What the hell is wrong with us? I asked myself.
EDIT: Terrible at formatting though, sorry

149ehi,6,2012-12-04,"[21/M] I just recently broke off a long-term relationship. I'm not ready for another relationship, but things are developing with another girl (19/F) and I'm not sure what to do.",mkel32,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/149ehi/21m_i_just_recently_broke_off_a_longterm/,"TL;DR: I'm just out of a long-term relationship and things are developing with a girl, but I'm not seeking a new relationship. I really like being with her and spending time with her and I realize she's probably expecting this to advance at some point, so I have no idea what to do. Any advice is appreciated.


Longer version: About five weeks ago I ended a close to four-year relationship with a great girl (21/F). My reasons were because I simply didn't have the time to commit to a healthy relationship. With school, work, and an internship I was finding myself stressed even more by the relationship. My schedule isn't going to change anytime soon, so I decided it was best to end the relationship as I wasn't being fair to her.

As this is all unfolding, I'm meeting a girl (19/F) and starting to spend time with her. Fast forward five weeks and we're hanging out a lot. We're talking all the time and it's obvious we both really like each other.

I want to keep spending time with her and stuff, but I'm not ready to get into a new relationship. I'm under the impression that she expects things to advance at some point and I don't want to like drag her along, but I have no idea what to do.

She knows I just got out of a long-term relationship so I'm sure she understands somewhat. But is it my responsibility to bring it up?

What would I say besides that I'm not ready for another relationship?

I appreciate any advice."
1499lp,3,2012-12-04,A few questions regarding (prescription) suboxone and other meds. Thanks in advance for any insight.,subqsthrowaway,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1499lp/a_few_questions_regarding_prescription_suboxone/,"Hey people of r/opiates. I am a fairly regular contributor to this sub but for confidentiality reasons (I know a lot of ""br/opiates"" IRL) I am using a throwaway for this post. I apologize in advance for the length and offer thanks in advance to anyone who gets through the whole thing, especially if they can offer some insight into my situation. Here's the necessary background:

My opiate habit: been dabbling for 4-5 years, oxy/opana use became semi-regular (i.e. a few times a month) ~2 years ago, been using daily for ~18 months, turned mostly to H due to price and it being the only thing easily acquirable ~3 months ago, and started IVing *very* recently, as in 3 days ago

I go to school in Pennsylvania, but I'm from New York. I have been prescribed adderall and klonopin for legitimate medical conditions by a psychiatrist in NY for around 2.5 years. I have a good relationship with this doctor, he's helped me through a lot of tough times. Unfortunately, I have never felt that I had the freedom to be honest with him about my opiate use, and later, addiction, because a) I was concerned he would stop prescribing me the adderall and klonopin, which I very much need, because they have potential for abuse, b) while opiate use is almost always due to an underlying problem, those very problems (depression, etc.) are what I discuss with him anyway, so I do/did not feel it necessary to tell him that very specific piece of the puzzle, c) I do not want to lose the trust we've built up, although, admittedly, maybe that's what I deserve, and d) I do not want a drug seeker stamp in my medical records that would follow me for the rest of my life. I've heard some real horror stories on this front. 

It should be noted that I have *never* abused the adderall or klonopin. I take it more or less as prescribed. Frankly, I hate taking the addy because I associate it with work/studying in a Pavlovian way. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the kpins, but I would rather enjoy/appreciate their medical benefits as prescribed every day than binge and run out early. I've rarely if ever felt the desire to take more than my 2 mg dose. In general I am meant to take it either before going to bed (lying in the dark staring at the ceiling is when my mind starts racing and I get anxious the most, my insomnia was even worse before klonopin) or when I experience a panic attack. I have rarely if ever used it in any other situation. I do not subscribe to the NA theory that an addict is an addict is an addict and that using any psychoactive substance inevitably leads back to your DOC. My problem is with opiates and opiates alone. This is not to say I have a problem with AA/NA, it works for a lot of people, and more power to them, but it's just not for me. It will become clear why all this is relevant, I promise. 

Meanwhile, I am considering getting into a suboxone maintenance program here in PA. I am a highly functioning addict - part time job, internship, 3.7 GPA, so I would not say that my life has become unmanageable... yet. I want to get on subs to prevent getting to that ""yet"" and because my habit is obviously a huge financial burden. Plus I will be graduating in the spring, and I would like to have this monkey off my back (for lack of a better cliche) before I go into the real world and need to be 100% independent. 

I do not want my family to know about my opiate addiction or if I get on suboxone. I know they would be supportive as they always have been, but despite my many successes I have felt that I've failed or disappointed them in the past and I don't want to put them to through it again. They love me unconditionally, which is why them finding out what a secret fuck up I am would be even more painful/guilt wreaking. Likewise I would not want my shrink to know for all the reasons I outlined earlier. As such, I wouldn't use my insurance (still on my family plan) if I got on suboxone. Straight cash, homie. 

The sub clinic was recommended to me by the head honcho of my local needle exchange, who said you go once a week and get your scrip for that week, in and out in 15 minutes. Based on that they seem pretty laid back, but I won't know for sure until I call in the morning. When I'm talking to them about the program I could ask if they do drug testing. If they don't, should I not tell them about my adderall/klonopin prescriptions or just be upfront regardless? I'm leaning towards the latter. And If they do test, I will have no choice but to be honest, which means I have to hope they are cool with my taking those medication. Because at this point if they aren't I would rather continue down the path I'm on until I find another/the right way to quit. Both because keeping those scrips is more important to me than getting on sub maintenance right this minute and because even if I did want to choose the subs over the others, it would mean my psychiatrist finding out since he's not going to just let me stop taking those meds without giving a reason. Lies of omission are enough, I don't want to get into flat out lies. Backtracking a little bit, is it a bad idea to ask about drug testing at all? Would that give them the impression that I am going to try to keep using or pull a fast one? And if so, would that impression stick even after I explain why I asked (my prescription meds)? I guess I could just bring up the meds first since I've pretty much decided on honesty, nothing really to lose by being straight up with them. If they say they don't allow patients to take meds like that I say thanks anyway and hang up. 

So my main question is this: if the sub clinic will allow me to keep taking my addy/kpin and I get involved in their program, will my psychiatrist be able to find out I am taking suboxone? Again, I'll be paying for both the sub appointments and prescriptions with cash, keeping the insurance company completely uninvolved and I'd fill it at a small mom and pop pharmacy that I've never used before and thus doesn't have any of my info on record. If he *can* find out, what is the likelihood of him actually doing so given that it's two different states, I'm not using insurance, I'm using a new pharmacy, and he's an old dude with questionable aptitude for technology? If he can't, would the clinic tell him/would I be doing anything illegal? I don't think it's doctor shopping or anything, since I'm not getting multiple scrips for the same/similar drugs. I'm just not sure if doctor patient confidentiality applies to other doctors, especially given all these electronic prescription databases that have become the norm of late. Furthermore, would my parents have any way of finding out even though I'll eschew their insurance? 

I know the easy answer to all this is just be honest with everyone, make quitting opiates/getting on subs my first priority, etc. But as I said I've managed to maintain a high degree of success/functionality despite my heavy opiate use. So at the same time it would be kind of backwards and silly to risk both my grades and mental health slipping (absent the adderall and klonopin) in my last semester of college and into the job search because I *quit* heroin. The point may come where the necessity of getting clean outweighs potentially losing my meds, the shame I'd feel from having my family find out, etc. But I'm not there yet, so it'll either be this or continuing to use until I either reach that point or find some other way to quit independently of any program/maintenance. One of the many ironies here is that my shrink is actually licensed to prescribe suboxone. So I won't have much trouble finding a sub doc if the time comes that I need to put my cards on the table. 

To those who made it all the way through and especially those who leave helpful comments, thank you very much in advance.

TL;DR: If I started seeing a suboxone doctor in Pennsylvania, pay for it out of pocket (no insurance involved whatsoever), and get my prescriptions filled at a mom and pop pharmacy with no previous record of any kind on me, would my psychiatrist and/or family in New York find out somehow?

1494mv,1,2012-12-04,"Something insignificant hit me pretty hard emotionally. Just want to talk about it. [long, family issues]",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1494mv/something_insignificant_hit_me_pretty_hard/,"I'm 22 and I've dropped out of college and I've been living back at home with my mom since August. She's definitely not the easiest person to live with. She'll argue and assert control over everyone else in the home over just about everything, even though she isn't capable of doing it well herself. Needless to say, we haven't been getting along. There's a major argument at least once every week/other week. She's an abysmal arguer. These ""arguments"" just turn into portals where she can complain about her life and voice anything she has against me. It ALWAYS turns very personal and never goes anywhere. She just wants to ""win"" these ""arguments"" by throwing cheap tactics and I help fuel it by pushing the limit of terrible things to say. An ""argument"" over dishes left unclean for 3 days will turn into a heated brawl eventually resulting in her saying things not having anything to do with dishes. (Like, she'll scream at me for being unhappy that my dad left her, then vent about any hardships or difficulties she's having at work or home, and then purposely start crying to make me feel like a horrible son.) This brawl will go on for hours each week until I either push things too far or have had enough and walk away and shake her off my trail. She does this with everyone who lives/ had lived with her. Those dishes in the sink? They're just catalysts for her to jump from one angry complaint to another unconnected angry complaint. Nothing ever gets properly resolved or dealt with because she will switch topics so rapidly it's impossible to stay focused on one for longer than 2 minutes before it changes into something else. They're never actually about dishes. They're about *everything* all at once. 

It's at the point where everything she does bothers me now, even if it's reasonable. And I'm like that with her. After these ""arguments"" I need at least 2 days to collect myself before my tension around her dissipates. However, she's good to go for round 2 sometimes even 30 minutes after a fight. It's so tiring and hurts my self esteem so terribly. Last night was another fight. The faucet was leaking and I asked how to turn off the main water to fix it and then BAM, fight. During this, both of us said extremely hurtful things to one another. The ones I remember were her saying she was going to hit me, and I told her I would hit her right back (I'm 22, not 6). At one point, she asked me why I continue living here (I have no where else to go) and made me feel completely unwanted. Then at some later point, I looked at her straight in the eye and screamed ""because I can't fucking stand you,"" in response to something she said (I forget). 

I need to insert an aside here. Now, one of my biggest complaints about growing up with my parents is that I felt I was taken care of (fed, washed, etc.) but I never felt like I was *raised* (taught morals, learned skills, developed attachment to family, etc.) by either of my parents. I pretty much developed my own way of handling things/doing things and my own moral code. I was left to just figure out the world all on my own, for the most part. Everyone has their share of good advice their parents told them or a skill they attained from being pushed by them to work hard, but I have none. It disagreed with whatever their ""life code"" (I don't even know what it is). They're immigrants living in this country enough just to get by. My mom herself has never accelerated or pushed herself to advance in anything or do something extraordinary. She's a maid and a factory worker who can't speak English, and that's her best achievement. However, she does go out of her way and sacrifice a lot for me without asking for help when she needs it (a lot of arguments come from that alone). If I need 50$ to pay medical bills, she'll work overtime for it. It isn't like she doesn't care.

Anyway, I spent the day out of the house studying for final exams I plan to make up, and when I came home she was asleep. I had just studied linear algebra for 8 solid hours, so I took a break by playing The Walking Dead game.

I was playing through the game for about an hour before I became overly emotional for an unknown reason and had to close it. The main character, Lee, is someone who I deeply admire. Fair, just, capable, collected, a leader, charismatic, knows what to do, etc. I realized that he was pretty much like my perfect view of a parent I never had. Here's someone that can be brave in a time of crisis and keep a team together and makes sure everyone has a vital role. (I fucking hate starting a sentence like this, but) if a zombie apocalypse ever happened (ugggh), my mom would be someone to just tell me to sit in a corner somewhere, then yell at me for being useless, then instead of being assertive and getting what she needs to survive she'd stay inside and make a wish that everything will be handled on its own and then lay down in her bed to worry. If I try to, say, head to a pharmacy to pilfer some medication we need, I'd get extreme heat for it and told to stop trying to be useful. It's disappointing and embarrassing. I took a lot of emotion from the character Lee and I'm trying to take his best traits and make them my own. This made me realize that I never had anyone to ever look up to. Ever. I never had any heroes growing up; no sports superstar, no comfortably successful adult, no celebrity I wanted to be like, and my parents were just...absent. I had to shape myself out of nothing. 

Then I realized what I've become, and how all that has worked against me (no self discipline, insensitive, and extreme difficulty expressing emotions and feelings). I can't find a girlfriend for the life of me (only had a month long relationship in high school). Every girl either dislikes me or I push her away because for some reason I can't stand the thought that there's someone out there that actually loves me, and I hate the attention. I'm a college drop out with a horrible GPA (medical issues, mental issues, lack of responsibility/no self discipline). It'll be another year before I'm able to go back. I have to bring myself to work hard to go back and finish these finals just to get a few more Cs. I have no job, no real work or internship experience (never even tried to get one), I'm flat broke and have to rely on my mom for 100% of my expenses now. I also have no car, the only one of my friends who doesn't have one. I have to be driven around by friends or mom for the slightest thing. I have a few close friendships, but I noticed that I'm usually just someone else's shadow. I have huge difficulty in making and keeping my own close friends. If 4 or 5 of my friends stopped talking to me, then these decently large social circles will just collapse. I sort of rely on one or two people to keep me connected to a dozen. I also have absolutely no goals at the moment. My life has no direction whatsoever. I do plan on going back to school, but that wont be for a while. I'm basically just occupying space and draining others' resources and depending on them for everything. My 10 year old self would be horribly disappointed.

I'm pretty much a leech. The one person who's helping me out the most is the one I fight with every week and say extremely hurtful things to. My mom tells me she loves me, but I could never say it in return. I just can't say ""I love you too"" to someone and mean it (or even just SAY it). It's probably because no one ever taught me how to love or be loved. Even my dad abandoned our family when I was in college. He left to another country and didn't even say goodbye because I'm just not important to him. He didn't even tell me he was leaving or why. I can't stand developing strong bonds with anyone. Deeply caring about others is something I can't do, and my mom is finally catching on. I'm so ungrateful to everything my parents did to keep me alive. I responded with nothing but neutrality or hate. Hell, my dad and I went 8 months without speaking to each in my teens even though we lived in the same house. I just feel like I'm such a problem to everyone including myself. Just a problem, nothing more. Any sort of compensation, love, or appreciation will have to get an IOU from me.

So here's what really got to me. I'm overwhelmed with emotion now. I thought that telling my mom I couldn't stand her was one of the most horrible things I've ever said to her. She really didn't deserve it. For the first time ever, I was going to apologize to her. She's asleep, and I don't have the balls to actually be emotional in front of someone else, so I figured I'd do the best I can do and just leave a note with breakfast already made for when she wakes up. Once I went downstairs to do so, I realized all I really want is someone who I can look up to and feel close to. I just never got that, and it doesn't look like it's going to appear anytime soon. obtaining that is now more important to me than anything else. Just someone who can guide me and I can by myself around without feeling this need to repress feelings or make sure the bond hits a plateau.

I was searching around my kitchen for things I could make in advance that would be ok if served cold. There was a bright red brochure on my kitchen table. In the dim light, I could see that it was Christmas-colored. On it, in large, elegant, golden letters were the words, ""HERE'S SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED...*fantastic savings at the county mall!*""

**ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME**

THAT'S what I've always wanted? Some new smartphone? A new jacket? You fucking want me to just spend money to be happy? Who the fuck thought of such a thing? Dumb piece of fuck. Here I am, completely emotionally hurt, just having realized all I ever wanted was for someone to just care about me and me to reciprocate in return. BUT HERE'S A FUCKING SALE ON MOTHERFUCKING **HATS!!!** HOPE THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY!! JUST KEEP SENDING IN THAT GREEN AND WE'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING YOUR HEART EVER DESIRED! LIKE A PS3!!

148zot,2,2012-12-04,My depression just hit me like a pile of bricks.,riccarjo,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/148zot/my_depression_just_hit_me_like_a_pile_of_bricks/,"I'm not going to go into an in-depth history of my depression.  I've had it in waves all my life.  It seemed to be getting worse due to very serious relationships ending and sending me skyrocketing south.

Well I moved, for a semester.  Down here I met a wonderful girl and fell in love with her.  As we were in the relationship, I thought I was happy, I had bouts of anger and sadness, but I thought it was normal; and it was *nothing* compared to what I had back home.

I'm very busy, stressed, not sleeping alot, etc.  I'm working a 40 hour internship on top of a class and a seminar series with side work, so of course I'm going to be like that.

A few weeks ago I brought my girlfriend home, and had the most amazing time.  However, since I've come back (and even to some extent before we left)  I've been different.  I've been fighting with my girlfriend alot lately, which almost never happened.  I'd get mad at her for things I shouldn't, she'd sit me down, and I'd feel like complete shit without a few instants.  Then I wouldn't be able to talk, and my mind would go blank.

Today, I was in a good mood, or so I thought.  I had finished a big presentation and was ready to go eat dinner with my girlfriend.  Dinner was nice, but I drank a bit too much and got sleepy (add in the fact that I hadn't slept well) and I took a nap on their couch; because my girlfriend had alot of homework to do and I wanted to give her space to do it.

When I woke up, my girlfriend was in her bedroom with her roommates, talking and laughing..and I became furious.  I stormed in, told her I was ""rethinking the whole relationship"" that she was ignoring me and treating me like shit...when she started crying and I realized that I didn't mean any of what I said...and I had no idea why I said any of it.

She sat me down and we talked for a long time, and I ended up crying while she told me that everyone close to me is worried; I do nothing but sleep and eat, I'm mean, I push everyone away...and here I am thinking that I've never been happier.  She told me that it's only been in the last few weeks, and that I'm ""nothing like the man I used to be"", and she's scared for me.

I don't get it...what could have happened?  Usually I have a reason for being depressed, like my dad losing his job, or my girlfriend and I breaking up.

Could something have caused this...or am I really just someone who needs to go on medication just to be himself?  What is going on with me...I'm so lost, and on the verge of tears."

148mu2,2,2012-12-03,Where to get started with PIC microcontroller?,tjlusco,AskElectronics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/148mu2/where_to_get_started_with_pic_microcontroller/,"Hi guys,
I'm starting an internship at an mining engineering firm next week and apparently they use PIC microcontrollers exclusively (everyone in house is knowledgable with them). I come from a Atmel background, Arduino, AVRStudio, atmega assembly/gcc background. Thanks for the diversification *unsaid* university!

Where should I get started? They are use MPLab for in house development (currently migrating to MPLabX) with the GCC tool chain, a bit of a shock as last time I looked into PIC's you could only use PIC BASIC, that's how far out of the loop I am.

Important info:

* What are the typical/common chips you would use for different applications? I'm familiar with the Atmega range so analogies would be handy. What I will be working on will not need a PC interface so no need for USB controller. Serial ports, robust timing, and external counters are a must, also accurate ADCs would be a plus but strictly necessary.
* What sort of ISP programmers are available? And can you do in-situ debugging of the controller with them? I have plenty of Atmel tools so if there was the possibility of reusing them that would be handy. Pretty sure I even have a bitbanger lying around somewhere.
* Good sites/books for reference material for C PIC programming?

Thanks for any help :)"
148l5n,0,2012-12-03,[22/m] and I need help on managing my jealousy.,btanonymous,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/148l5n/22m_and_i_need_help_on_managing_my_jealousy/,"So some background information. I'm a university student and I met my gf through some friends online. I really liked her and wanted to make things more than just an online relationship. I ended up driving 3 hours regularly to go meet her and spend time with her and tried really hard to make things work out despite the distance. I landed internships in the city in which she resides primarily so I could be with her and make things work out. 

Back then she was actually really troubled. She has had many online relationships with other people before. She felt lonely and didn't have friends. I talked to her a lot through IM and text and got to know her and saw that she thought the same way as I did. That being, she appreciates family a lot, really wanted a serious relationship and someone to be with. I kind of rushed into the relationship but I haven't truly regretted it. I wanted to be the one that she wanted and was willing to give her everything I could. In the two years that we've been together we've basically dedicated ourselves to each other. We were really clingy and I was happy with how things were. I stopped talking and hanging out with a lot of friends just to be with her and it didn't bother me that much because I was happy that I had her and didn't think I needed anything else. We were both really obsessive and clingy at that time. 

Now let's fast forward to present time. We've been together for 2 years now. But things are different now. The current semester she started to make some friends. I thought I would be really happy for her because she's always been lonely but at the same time I felt kind of sad. I encouraged her to do more stuff with them but I'm becoming overly jealous. I have become really obsessive and somewhat controlling. It turns out that what she really wanted doesn't seem to be just me but she wanted friends. I am okay with this but because for two years we've dedicated all our time to each other it feels weird and kind of hurts since things are so different. 

For the past month I've noticed that she has been texting this one guy all the time. This guy is in the same classes as her and she spends her breaks a lot with him during school. But when they got home they would text each other non-stop. On the weekends they would text from when we wake up to when we sleep a lot throughout the day. She told me they talk just about random things such as ""What are you up to?"", ""Have you eaten yet?"", calling each other names and stuff. They text so much that they say goodnight to each other every day. This reminded me of how we used to be when we first started out and made me really or maybe it felt more like betrayed? In my eyes it seemed like they were flirting all the time and that I wasn't enough for her. I have talked to her about it and she told me I'm really obsessive and overly jealous and that I don't trust her. I really don't think I mind if she texts him every now and then maybe for a reason but it really is all the time and it makes me worry and I'm sure it's kind of flirty. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here. But anyways, I have tried to just trust her with it but it still hurts inside.

Another thing is she started talking to me differently. I browsed the texts we had a year from now and they're fairly different. She rarely tells me she loves me anymore and doesn't say she misses me at all, even when we're far apart and I am away from school. Even only 2 weeks ago when I visited things seemed different. When I was over she we would have a good time, she wouldn't text as much and had fun just going out and shopping. She still told me she loved quite a bit then but not as much anymore. I feel rather lonely now that she doesn't dedicate as much time to me as she did before. I'm trying to be understanding but my jealousy I think is really out of control. I don't know how to control it. I have put her as my priority over everything for the past 2 years and she has done the same. It just feels really weird now that she doesn't pay that much attention to me anymore. 

I'd also like to mention that all her friends are guys. She has trouble making friends with girls for some reason. And I also seem to have a trust issue with other people. I have never trusted guys before (I guess I'm kind of sexist). All the people I've grown up with have always wanted to get with a girl to ""fuck"" her. I've been betrayed a lot of times by my ""friends"" so I have trouble trusting people. She's a really unique individual (kind of like a tomboy) so I can see a lot of other guys attracted to her and trying to hit on her and I hate thinking about it. 

I would be happy with a life with just the two of us where we would occasionally hang out with other friends but now that she's gotten friends she says the life I want is too boring. It might be true but that is what would make me happy. She seems to have changed now and wants to always do things with friends instead. To cope the distance when I'm away, we would Skype a lot and play games. But recently she's had no interest. I'm really stressed out recently with all the assignments and exams coming up and this is really bothering me. I don't like how obsessive I've become and how jealous I get. I don't want to restrict her freedom and be so controlling but it seems that's what is happening. I truly love her and still do and I'm afraid that if I keep acting like I do I will push her away instead. 

I know I have issues and that's why I'm asking what I can do to help with it? Any advice would be appreciated. I know it's wrong for me to try and restrict her. Now that she's finally made friends I should be happy for her. I want to change what I've become, be able to put my complete trust in her and give her space. She's finally gotten what she seems to truly want and I don't want to ruin it for her. 

**TL;DR: GF and I have spent 2 years dedicating all our time to each other. She has finally made friends and spending a lot of time with them and I have become overly obsessive and jealous. Can anyone give me advice on how to fix myself? What can I do to calm myself down?**"
14c4ld,5,2012-12-05,I got fucked by a drug test.,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/14c4ld/i_got_fucked_by_a_drug_test/,"So, I recently was offered a year long internship as an engineer for this medium sized company. I was going to be making 20 dollars an hour and was really psyched. They mentioned nothing of drug policy and I received a letter on Friday (a week after I was informed of the job) telling me I had 3 business days (5 real days) to pass a drug test. They didn't mention the type of test anywhere, so I assumed I could only prepare for a urine test in that time. I ran 5-10 miles a day, drank gallons of water, restricted my diet, drank more detox tea than I could shake a stick at. The night before I took a home test and passed. I even strapped a clean sample from a friend to my leg straight from the bladder before I ran out the door.

I get there, wait an hour, and when they bring me back for the test they tell me it's a hair test. Now not only will my potential employer know I smoke, they'll know I smoke every day. The funny part is I wasn't going to be smoking while working this job because my friends would all be 3 hours away and I had a lot of plans to use the time for self improvement. I have no clue what to tell my friends and family. Does anyone know the probability of a false negative?"

I'm currently weening my self off subs right now guys day 8 of my low low dose.. The stress of my life is so overwhelming right now. (I'm pretty sure stress is why I started using in the first place).

So my ex (we'll call her ""Alice"") moved here to the States for a full-time job back in March. I had already kinda known her from her internship a year prior, but started developing a real friendship with her this time (as she was looking for friends to lay down roots). In May, I asked her out, but she declined, saying she wasn't yet over the ex of 4.5 years she left behind in Australia (we'll call him ""Bob"" [m~24]).

After a brief fling with another woman over the summer, I decided to instead focus on Alice, being a good friend, and not looking elsewhere until she was ready for a relationship or made it clear she wasn't interested in me that way. After a couple weeks of this, she ended up asking me out in August.

At first, things went really well. We have a lot in common, and get along really well. She needed more personal time/space than I was used to in a relationship, but I recognized that as something I needed to adjust to, and would like to think I did.  However, after a few months, the relationship lost almost all intimacy; we were still going out and doing stuff together, and having a good time, but moreso as friends than as a couple. When I came to this realization, and vocalized it to her about a month ago, she agreed. Moreover, she admitted that she realized she wasn't entirely over Bob yet, that she wanted to do her own thing for a while, and suggested that we break it off.

I very briefly (and kind of half-heartedly) looked elsewhere for another relationship, but eventually decided I wanted to try and make things with Alice work out if possible.  We've continued to be good friends since we broke up; she even took me clothes shopping this past weekend, basically playing dress-up doll with me. 

She knows I'd like to try again when she's ready (I'm not terribly subtle). And while she's setting down roots here, Bob is setting down roots back in Australia, applying to a 3-year program. I'm just not sure where I stand. She definitely hasn't said no to my stated hope of getting back together, but she hasn't made any clear indications otherwise, either.

To make things more confusing and complicated, we're going up to a bed &amp; breakfast in a secluded mountain town for their festival of lights this weekend, a trip we had planned before breaking up. I'm not sure if she didn't want to cancel the trip just because she wants to see the town, or if there's anything still there."

I'm a middle class homeowner and parent and here's what will happen to me.",paulrpotts,PoliticalDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/14bzg9/what_will_happen_to_you_if_your_payroll_taxes_go/,"I'm a software engineer who works from home. My wife is a stay-at-home mom and community activist.

I probably won't be able to hire a local contractor to get the house repainted next spring, although it really needs it, if only to cover up the masonry patches on the chimneys that we had done by another local small business owner this fall. We might be unable to put my wife into an internship in a local small business, a Montessori school, so that she can get her Montessori teaching certification -- something we considered an investment in getting her better able to home-school our kids _and_ better able to get back into the work force eventually - because we will be less able to afford the necessary local babysitter and getting her 17-year-old car fixed up, at a locally owned and operated small business repair shop to the point where it is usable.

We'll have less money to put into our gardening and landscaping projects, less to spend at area stores, less to buy or build bookcases, install insulation, hire our local electrician to install better light fixtures in the family room, hire a local carpenter to fix cabinetry and doors the kids have broken, less to spend on school supplies and setting up the homeschool classroom, and less to spend on a couple of beds so the older kids can move into a different bedroom and will no longer sleep on the floor in our bedroom.

I will have to put off more car repairs at the locally owned car repair businesses. We'll have to cut back further on buying from Ted's Meats, another locally owned business, although they have great food and we want to support them. We'll probably have to stop our pizza or nacho nights from local businesses, that we do every other week before payday, and that the kids get so excited about. I probably won't be able to take my wife out to eat at the local Thai place that just recently opened near our home, the place we're trying to support because it is locally owned and operated, not even once a month. Multiply that by our whole neighborhood, and they will likely go under.

Forget savings or retirements or stocks or bonds; that's long-gone for me. It will be $2,000 that I'll be unable to put back into our local community or invest in our own home and children. Because the GOP doesn't want to invest in _me_ -- an _actual_ job creator."

",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/14bn0b/three_months_in_flight_book_proposed_online_ring/,"So 1 month ago I made this post (http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/119vqw/i26m_have_the_best_so23f_i_can_wish_for/) and now we are closing in on 3 months together. And some crazy stuff has happened. 

I booked my flight, I am taking a huge financial risk doing this by doing this but I really dont care. I'm graduating this year any way so all of that will be washed away when i start to work full time. I will be with her in February for 9 days right before my graduating internship starts. And that will be the time where I will get on one knee to make the proposal I did online official. 

A little background story, I ordered a ring for her birthday but the more I was writing the letter I attached to it, the more I felt she is the one. We have so much in common, so in love with each other, with the odd fight here and there because of the distance. Some are more severe than others but we worked them out. However as I was writing the letter it became more of a promise that I would propose to her when I would be with her. But then she said it her self **Are you proposing to me?** And I got on one knee in front of my camera and asked **Will you marry me?** and she said yes! It all happened so fast, we were 2 months in and we got engaged, without anyone knowing beside some friends whom we both told to keep it a secret. 

Now I am flying to her in february to meet each other for the first time and to propose. The ring that is being made at the moment (https://ny-image2.etsy.com/000/0/5578846/il_570xN.321259694.jpg). It will make some parents upset, but we dont care. We both know we are made for each other and felt it from the first time we spoke with each other. 

Everything went so quick, she said yes, we will be together in february and we will make it official and announce it to friends and family. I cannot wait for that day to call my parents over skype and have her hold up the ring and see the face on my moms face. First it will be pissed as hell but that will change really quick because ever since I met my girl my mood has changed 100%. I smile, I laugh, I even make jokes again. Used to be very down, sad and wanted to hide myself. 
But since 3 months, I started to lose weight, looked out for myself, I smile every single day I talk with her or text with her and I see her on skype every day. It feels like im with her. 

&gt;Something I tell her, I will be with you soon, but I am on a business trip and it will end anytime soon. Just hold out a bit longer, honey. 

I cannot believe, in February we will be in each other arms, kissing, smelling, touching and a whole lot of love making! By that time we will be together for 6 months but it feels like a life time! Ever since the first moment we spoke it feels like we have known each other forever. 

We are so in love and I love her so freaking much! I feel like a 14 year old boy falling in love for the first time. And I never had a real relationship before, so this makes me really feel like that 14 year old kid! 

Just keep going, communicate a lot with each other and have a lot of patience! "

Sitter i ett mörkare rum mer än 30 våningar ovan gatorna i downtown Houston, USA, en BP vindkraft aktör är kunna berätta besökare exakt hur mycket makt genereras på en vindkraftspark så långt bort som California – och vad vädret vill det.
Detta är fjärråtgärder centrum (ROC), där vissa 800 miljoner enskilda datapunkter från BP: s 13 vindkraftverk i sju stater lagras varje månad. Massan av information gör det fjärråtgärder laget att hålla ett öga på kritiska och rörliga faktorer, såsom turbin tillgänglighet, power generation kapacitet, marknadens prissättning och vind hastighet.
Program samlar in data på varje enskild vindkraftspark, samt från nationella elektriska systemansvariga som den elektriska tillförlitlighet rådet i Texas (ERCOT), som överförs sedan till Houston och väder tjänster. Mycket av informationen visas i form av cirkel-diagram eller stapeldiagram på centrumets fem av 18 meter lång (1,5 av 5 meter lång) ljust färgade skärmar – känd som ""muren"". Det flimrar regelbundet, som nummer justera i realtid.

""Vi kan titta på prestanda för en enskild turbin och jämför det med andra från samma tillverkare på en specifik vindkraftspark eller hela flottan, Vi kan känna igen om utrustning börjar bedriva verksamhet utanför en normal parameter och reagera.""

14axjj,6,2012-12-04,How do I (24/f) confront my coworker (25/m) about his laziness and attempts to sabotage my work in front of our bosses?,thisisathrowa2way,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14axjj/how_do_i_24f_confront_my_coworker_25m_about_his/,"So I just started this job in October. It is my first ""real"" job and I have learned a lot while working here. I have had countless internships and jobs in the past, and never had any issues with a coworker before, so i am not quite sure how to approach this.

Basically, my coworker, Dan, and I are on the same team, at the same level, but we each handle two different halves of the business. He has been working there five months longer then me.

A couple of weeks ago, our boss assigned Dan an intricate task to do for both halves of the business. He did part of the project, and passed the other part along to an intern, instead of me.

Dan told me the entire project was completed, but when I went to check, I discovered that the intern had messed it up completely. I went back in and spent 3 days re-doing the part that she did. I corrected all the parts pertaining to my side of the business, and told Dan that the intern had messed up on his parts as well. I offered to fix his portion as well, but he said he would handle it. I said fine.

Fast forward to today. I need to compile this project into a print out for a meeting. My boss points out that Dan neglected to complete a significant portion of his part, and asked me to do it. I had about half an hour to do his part, and compile all of the information into a presentation. The entire time I did this, the interns were coming up to me and asking me questions about an unrelated project. Dan sat and texted his boyfriend while I did this.

Finally, i finish. I print it out, where it sits on the desk that Dan and I share for 10 minutes. I show it to our boss, who makes a couple of edits. I did the edits. I showed her again, she says great. I print the presentation, and we go into a meeting with the financial guy, our boss, the department head, me and Dan. 

As we are talking about my portion of the business, Dan interrupts and goes to me ""QUESTION: Why did you put this category as zero?"" While pointing at a portion of the spread sheet. I told him that I had pulled it from the part that he had corrected, and I would show him back at our desks.

We discuss my portion of the business for about 45 minutes, and Dan disappears for 20 minutes of that time. When we are done, I sit down at my desk to try and figure out the error. I realized that I had accidentally copied and pasted the wrong tab of his portion, making ONE mistake in a huge, and very complicated report. A report that I was doing for the first time, that my boss had approved, that was based on a part of the business that I have nothing to do with. All because he was lazy.

I showed him what happened and he immediately went in on me about why didn't i notice or ask him. I said ""Dan, I'm sorry but I was in the middle of doing 10 different tasks on a time crunch, everything else is perfect. You could have taken a look without me asking you know"" and he goes ""Yes don't worry I know it can be hard to do when you have a lot on your plate. Just in the future show me next time.""

I am beyond furious that he called me out on this in front of the department head, especially because it never would have happened if he a) had not delegated our work to the intern. b) did ALL of his work completely instead of half assing it and leaving me to do the rest c) Had taken the time to review the work as well, especially since it pertained to his portion of the company.

So reddit, how do I talk to him about this? This kid thinks he knows everything, but actually makes the same mistakes over and over again, and I try to cover for him whenever possible, because I want us to have each other's backs. 

In addition to the above, he also is cold and rude to me, but chatty and friendly to everyone else in the office. He makes me not want to come to work.

  I have an awesome opportunity to move with my employer to San Francisco in May. I will be able to live with them and work for them in conjunction with my internship for my final semester for a Master's in Public Health. I have started contacting different agencies for summer internship opportunities but I worry that they may take too long ( I need clearance with my school and the agency in the next few months). 

   Do any of you work for a health and human services organization in SF? Do you have summer internship programs for graduate students? If not, do you know of any agencies that I should consider contacting?

   I am open to various types of internships but would love the opportunity to work with teens and young adults. (Maybe with homelessness/drug use prevention/teen pregnancy/STD  prevention efforts)


Thank you for any information or advice you may provide. "

With a full course load, an internship, and undergraduate research, he's been really busy and stressed out this semester.  He apparently couldn't handle the stress of our relationship on top of the stress he was already going through, so at 4:00 this morning, while I was staying over at his apartment, he broke up with me.  I was really sad and I cried, but I eventually went home and that was that.

Then two hours later he sends me a wall of texts, saying that he knows I'll be ok and that I have my whole life ahead of me, how bad he feels about having to do this to me and accepts the fact that I may end up hating him.  Now we've been texting all day like nothing happened.

Guys of /r/breakups, what is he doing?  What does this mean?  Does he want to get back together?  Is he just feeling guilty about hurting me?  I can't figure out what his motive for talking to me after breaking up with me is.

Because he's so stressed, I feel less stressed while not being around him, so it's not really bothering me or making me sad that we're just texting, but should I be texting him?  I definitely DON'T want to be anything serious with him right now, it's too much, but I wouldn't mind getting back together again in the future.

I do want to mention though that he's done this before.  He broke up with me a few months ago, I went home and he immediately started texting me.  He called me and I told him that I couldn't speak to him after just going through a break-up and we got off the phone.  About 30 minutes later he shows up at my house crying and saying that he couldn't do this, that he needed me back.  Fast forward to now and it seems like the same thing, except he didn't show up at my house this time.

And I'd also like to mention that he has anger issues and suffers from depression and anxiety.  He was taking anti-depression and anti-anxiety meds when we first started dating and then randomly stopped for some reason, and now he's willing to take them again AFTER breaking up with me.  I have no idea what's going on with him."

**History**

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 9 months now. We met in college and we both live on campus. When we first met, we moved pretty quickly and ended up spending a *lot* of time with each other that semester. After about a month, she was spending the night frequently and we spent most of our days together as well; point being, we spent almost every second together from nearly the beginning. 

Over the summer, we both had an out of state internship and decided to live together (over the summer) to save money. She also went on birth control a week or two before we moved for the summer. Over the summer, things were somewhat stressful due to less than ideal living situation, being in a strange city, etc. but we managed well for the most part. However, we did have a few squabbles and one or two decent sized fights while we were there.

Once the summer was over, we moved back to our college and she moved back in with her parents. She immediately hated living at home and within a week was spending every night at my apartment on campus. This is when the major/frequent fighting started.

**Problems**

I noticed once we got back that my friends weren't really inviting me to anything anymore or making much of an effort to include me in hang outs and I realized this was because I made the decision to spend almost all of my free time with my gf. I wanted to address that and re-include my friends in my life. 

My girlfriend seems to look for the worst in every situation and the first few times I would try to go do something without her she got extremely upset. She said it felt like I was choosing them over her and that she felt abandoned/kicked out. To me, this seemed ridiculous and I expressed that. This spiraled downhill all semester to the point where we seemed to be fighting about everything. We fought about dirty dishes, we fought about sex, we fought about homework, we fought about what to do with our free time, we fought about what to eat. The common thing in almost every single fight was that something had happened that she *perceived* as insulting or offensive and then she got very negative and started lashing out.

During this time, there were about four different instance where she would (while angry and during a fight) begin packing up all of her stuff that was at my house (clothes, school supplies, bathroom stuff, etc.) and ""move out"". I always let her go and that seemed to make her even more upset and she'd later tell me something like ""If you really wanted me here then you would have tried to stop me from leaving and by not doing so that just tells me that you don't really care"". 

It got to the point where I was extremely unhappy, we had been fighting every day for about 2 weeks straight (with maybe one or two happy days in between) and I was just so tired of it. I broke up with her, citing that I didn't think we were right for each other and both needed to work on ourselves, while single, for a while before we tried to be in a relationship with anyone. She initially accepted it but a few hours later told me that she wasn't ready to give up and wanted to get back together and keep trying. After talking it out for a few hours, I agreed.

That was about 2.5 months ago. Some things have gotten better but some things haven't. Our relationship is still very much an emotional roller coaster. We have a major fight about once a week, usually about something small and silly. I'm not used to this kind of a confrontational relationship and it's very stressful and frustrating for me. I'm much more of a smooth sailing kind of person. All of our fights usually end in a 4+ hour conversation where we rationally (sometimes not so much) get our feelings out and try to understand where the other person was coming from. 

I'm just exhausted and I don't know what to do anymore. I love this girl and I want things to work out but sometimes I feel like I'm dating a 14 year old. To give an example, this is the fight we had last night:

I spent the previous night at her apartment (she now lives by herself on campus in the building next to mine, about a 30 sec walk from my place) and I had been at her apartment all day. We actually had a really great day! Mostly we just hung out and then later in the night she started working on some school work. Around 11:45 pm, I was falling asleep and told her that I was going to head home and go to sleep. I told her that I wanted her to come too. This is where things started going south. 

She got a little upset that I wasn't spending the night at her place and said so. I told her I wanted to sleep in my own bed tonight (I don't sleep well in hers) and that I wanted her to come over to my house. She said that she wasn't ready yet and had some stuff to finish up with her school work. I told her that I was going to head on over to my house and I'd leave the door unlocked so she could join me when she was finished. Then, she started getting really upset and told me that she wanted me to wait here, at her house, while she finished her assignment, brushed her teeth, washed her face, etc and then we would walk to my house together. I told her I was tired and wanted to just go ahead over to my house and wait for her there and then it just spiraled out of control. It ended in a 2.5 hour fight and is still continuing today.

This morning, I woke up and asked her if I could stop by her place and see her for a few minutes before heading to my job on campus. She got really confrontational and started questioning how I had time to come see her and accused me of not wanting to see her and just wanting to kill time. I reassured her that that wasn't the case and she continued with asking me why I had time now when I ""made such a big deal about just getting up and going to work"". All I wanted to do was see her for a few minutes before I started my day =(. Finally, I told her that I didn't have time anymore and had to go and that I would see her later. Then she got quite upset and again accused me of being a liar and not really wanting to see her... A few hours later I stopped by and she told me that it was partly because she was still mad from last night and partly because she doesn't know how to express herself and comes across as offensive the first time. 

We have blowouts like this once every 3-5 days. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. She says she knows that she's immature and she just wants someone who will help her ""grow up"" in a nice way. She's even asked me to point out when she does things that are silly or immature. I **REALLY** am trying, I am beyond patient, but every time I try to bring something up she just gets really emotional and tells me that I'm not giving her/us a chance and that I'm being mean or picking a fight or something. It's almost like she looks for the worst possible case in every situation, expects it even, and then reads that into anything that happens. It's like a self fulfilling prophecy. I just want to be happy and she seems determined to be miserable every couple of days.

In case it helps, here are some other things she says that upset her:

* She doesn't want to come to my house or come with me to events with my friends because she thinks my friends all hate her and/or judge her
* She is frustrated because all of her female friends have graduated and she hasn't really found any new ones 
* She gets frequently upset by my ""tone"" and says the way I speak to her is insulting, especially when I'm trying to explain homework/school stuff
* She makes everything a competition, *especially* academics, and gets very upset when I do something better than her (If I make a 93 on a test and she makes a 92, she gets upset)
* She constantly finds faults with herself and then complains about them and in general needs a LOT of emotional support. She frequently accuses me of noticing/thinking of these faults and I'm guessing wants complements? (""You think I'm ugly"", ""You think I'm stupid"", ""You think I'm fat"", etc.)

I'm kind of rambling now so I'll wrap it up. I do care about her tremendously but I'm having trouble dealing with these issues. Nothing I try seems to work and just talking about it often times results in a fight. How can I fix this?

14e5gu,4,2012-12-06,[20/m] Just broke up with my fiancée [21/f] but I don't want it to end.,miss_my_fiancee,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14e5gu/20m_just_broke_up_with_my_fiancée_21f_but_i_dont/,"Basically, I've been in love with her since middle school. I got her to fall in love with me in high school and then we were inseparable. Then we went to two separate colleges.

It was rough the entire time. I kind of wanted to sleep around (although I didn't) and I had a crush on a girl. On top of that, my school (engineering school) is very difficult and I was frequently stressed out. I ended up taking it out on her a lot. Whenever we were together, I felt like we were very good together. We were caring, we helped each other out, made each other meals.

Well over time, our relationship got more and more strained. Eventually, she stopped feeling attracted to me, making sex harder. I feel like I could tell she was becoming less attracted to me and it made me hold on to her tighter and tighter. When discussing it we determined that she became less attracted to me because she had built up a subconscious association between me and stress.

In the summer, when I was even farther away, working at an internship, I had asked if we could do an open relationship so we could get the sex we wanted. Initially she was very opposed to the idea and I seriously regret trying to push it on her when she didn't want that.

Well this school semester, she changed her mind and said she wanted an open relationship. I agreed, although I was a little hesitant. I immediately began trying to start online dating but then I realized I didn't really want this anymore. She, however, did so I did her a favor and hooked her up with one of my friends who drove past her college semi regularly. That was a mistake. I was uncomfortable the whole time and she became more and more attracted to my friend. Whereas before I was the one pushing for an open relationship, now it was her. Every time I'd tell her that this guy was making me uncomfortable she convinced me to let her go with him again.

After a few weeks, we were talking at her house and she said she didn't think she felt the same way about me as I did about her. I was crushed, although it wasn't really unexpected. Whereas before we were together she never found other men attractive, now she was finding other men attractive and I had put her through a lot of stress that I really shouldn't have. I tried to take off her ring but she was initially reluctant to take it off. Throughout the coming days, we discussed it, talked about where we went wrong, and tried to determine what our real feelings were.

Then, although we had broken up, I asked both of them not to have sex anymore, or at least for a while because it was hurting my relationship with my friend and I didn't need things to be anymore difficult than they were now. Well right after we talked, hugged, even kissed, he drove her back to school (a 5 hour drive) and they flirted the whole ride there and then fucked. I know this because I asked.

She and I had such a deep relationship and she has made it clear that she still considers me one of her closest friends. We lost our virginities together, went to our first raves together, did various psychedelics and MDMA for the first time together. We know each other's deepest, darkest secrets and fantasies. She doesn't want to lose contact with me and she still cares about me.

She says that what she feels for my friend is strictly physical and I believe her. He actually goes to my school (but they hook up because he drives past her school semi regularly) and she doesn't want a long-distance relationship. He's also a little strange and hard to talk to so she has no real emotional connection. However, she likes him because she finds him attractive and he made her feel better dealing with the stress I put her through.

Upon talking to her more, she said that it's been difficult to sort through her feelings but we seemed to figure it out. Even before we got engaged, she says she's always been hesitant to marry me. I don't think that it's because she didn't want to marry me, however, but because she wasn't sure she wanted to marry so soon. She told me she had always been a little overwhelmed by my feelings for her, especially because I said ""I love you"" really soon after we first started going together. I think that if she really could not imagine being with me for the rest of her life, she wouldn't have said yes to me, even though she wasn't sure she wanted to get married yet.

I also asked if she ever loved me and found me attractive and she said yes, definitely, especially when we spent 3 years in high school together. We were inseparable. Now, she says that this whole ordeal has made her realize again that she's not sure that she wants to get married yet. She told me that she wishes that we had decided to get serious perhaps after college after we had time to be our own people and explore others.

We realized that we had depended a lot on each other, perhaps stifling our personal growth. I tended to want her to talk to me online much longer than we really had time for. We couldn't date other people and our relationship was going to effect where I went after school.

I agree that we should be able to date other people for now and that we need to learn to be our own people for a while. I just can't but feel absolutely terrible that I seem to have brought the relationship to this point. It was my actions that made her feel less attracted to me. However, she was very passive and did was not assertive whenever I made her feel bad. I feel like if she was, we could have talked through things or maybe it wouldn't have reached this point.

I'm not sure. All I know is right now I feel terrible for pushing her away, terrible that she's now fucking my friend, and I want her to come back to me but I really don't know what will happen. I'm not sure what I'm asking for, besides maybe help letting go of her for a while. I want someone to reassure me that it will workout again but I know that's not possible."
14e23x,6,2012-12-06,"Thanks, mom.",saturdaynightriot,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14e23x/thanks_mom/,"I pretty much just bombed a health economics exam that I thought I'd do fine on, thanks to goddamn microeconomics and my mom being a bitch.

I am taking forever to get through school, I fully admit (and hate it), and for the most part I'm paying for this myself with student loans. I really don't care that they're a lot because I actually have the confidence in myself that I can pay them off. I'm studying economics and political science and my goal is to work in some capacity in the Department of the Treasury. I have a great credit score, but this past academic year I needed a cosigner, and got my mom to do it. 

So I told my mom yesterday that I would rather go into next spring to finish rather than take summer classes again because I can't get as much help paying for them. She tells me then she won't cosign again because if I don't get a job she's on the line....which isn't even remotely true. It seriously fucking hurt that she has zero confidence in me that I'd be responsible enough to pay them back all while my parents pay my brother's rent and utilities. 

My mom thinks a) that your GPA is as important for a job as it is for getting into college from high school and b) that my brother's friends are an example of the economy. One has a sports marketing degree, and the other a history degree, although I'm pretty sure he could have the most useful degree in the world and he'd still sit in his parents' basement playing video games.

So she thinks everything is like the prospects for these two and I don't even live in the same area as them. I already know what I want to do, to the point my goal for next summer is an internship instead. Though the last time I bothered to tell her what I wanted to do with my degree, she said but do you have the GPA for it. Fun fact: all that's required is a four year degree in a certain program. WOW RIGHT? 

So, I had an exam this morning at 9. I couldn't fall asleep because I was so pissed and hurt by her. The problem is, I didn't take out the most money I could, and my rent went up a lot this year. So I actually don't have enough money to be able to pay my rent come January, as I'm sure the school won't give me the rest of my money until after January 3. I'm actually to the point of considering overdrawing my account with the check to pay rent so I don't have to ask her for money, if she's going to be that way about cosigning.

Needless to say I did HORRIBLY on the exam and I probably won't get the passing C needed for it to count towards my major.

I struggle a lot with the concepts of microeconomics. My interest is definitely more in macro, but I thought health economics was a very interesting class to take. For the life of me I cannot comprehend utility, and so between that and the anxiety now of not having money, it was destined to fail.

So I'm probably going to end up with a C- in this class, which means it won't count towards my major. Meanwhile, in the other econ class I had this semester, International Finance (macro based at that), I'm going to get an A. 

Every single econ class I've taken with a micro prerequisite, I don't pass it. I tried my hardest especially this semester, because this was probably the least mathy one, but holy crap I swear that it was not only the anxiety and stress...I am not kidding that it also felt like I studied everything BUT what ended up on the test because he just gave an all encompassing study guide which ""yeah it's just some of this."" 

Of course, that was not the only thing to go absolutely wrong today. I have a parakeet and he's super timid...well this morning he had a little fluffy feather covering half his face. I had just woken up so I reached in to get it off, only after getting it out do I realize it was still attached to him. So I pulled the feather out and then hit him in the head with his own toy. 

And on the way home from the exam, I discovered that my super fancy gift travel mug isn't actually leakproof. I only figured this out after it leaked through my bag onto my pants, and didn't realize it was on both legs until I got up to get off the train. It definitely looked like I wet my pants. And of course it also got on the stupid health econ book I need to sell back for money.

Now that I have finally complained enough about all of this, I don't feel the need to crawl back into bed for the rest of the day. If you got all the way down here, congratulations and thanks for reading."
14duev,8,2012-12-06,A few questions on an actuarial career.,Xyykon,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/14duev/a_few_questions_on_an_actuarial_career/,"I understand that many of you are extremely smart people. Degrees in mathematics and actuarial exams are no simple matter. There is no doubt a lot of time and effort that must go in to this career.

Do you think that the work you put in towards this career are worth it?
Is the job market really as saturated as everyone says?

I ask these questions because I am really stressed out about this decision in my life. I've done a fair amount of research on the whole profession. 8 exams, 2 before I graduate, hopefully an internship as well, $40,000/year entry level, ~$100,000/year by the time I'm 30, 300 hours of studying starting about 3 months before each exam, 40-45 hours/week, saturated and competitive job market.

I understand this is an extremely hard career to ACTUALLY get in to. I don't want to come off as one of those freshmen pre-med majors that inevitably switch to communications. I'd rather be excited and worried and working hard towards a challenging goal than coasting through college being bored. I am prepared to put in the time and effort, I'm just worried about doing all of this work and ending up not being able to find a job.

I'm not sure exactly why I'm posting this, I guess I am looking for a bit of encouragement. I have a full tuition scholarship so it's not the debt I'm worried about, it's just the wasted time/opportunity that worries me.

Från BP vindkraft fjärråtgärder centrum i Houston kontrolleras alla 13 i dess gårdar över sju oss stater är nära 24/7. Den information som förmedlas tillbaka hjälper dem att producera mer effektivt, ekonomiskt och säkert sätt
Sitter i ett mörkare rum mer än 30 våningar ovan gatorna i downtown Houston, USA, en BP vindkraft aktör är kunna berätta besökare exakt hur mycket makt genereras på en vindkraftspark så långt bort som California – och vad vädret vill det.
Detta är fjärråtgärder centrum (ROC), där vissa 800 miljoner enskilda datapunkter från BP: s 13 vindkraftverk i sju stater lagras varje månad. Massan av information gör det fjärråtgärder laget att hålla ett öga på kritiska och rörliga faktorer, såsom turbin tillgänglighet, power generation kapacitet, marknadens prissättning och vind hastighet.
Program samlar in data på varje enskild vindkraftspark, samt från nationella elektriska systemansvariga som den elektriska tillförlitlighet rådet i Texas (ERCOT), som överförs sedan till Houston och väder tjänster. Mycket av informationen visas i form av cirkel-diagram eller stapeldiagram på centrumets fem av 18 meter lång (1,5 av 5 meter lång) ljust färgade skärmar – känd som ""muren"". Det flimrar regelbundet, som nummer justera i realtid.
""Väggen ger operatörer synlighet av vad som händer vid varje wind farm, säger David Grant, chef för fjärråtgärder och SCADA (övervakande kontroll och data förvärv) teknik för BP vindkraft. ""Vi kan titta på prestanda för en enskild turbin och jämför det med andra från samma tillverkare på en specifik vindkraftspark eller hela flottan, Vi kan känna igen om utrustning börjar bedriva verksamhet utanför en normal parameter och reagera.""
Tack vare ett larmsystem som konfigurerats intern, aktörer i ROC vet nästan omedelbart av eventuella problem i fältet. ""Om vi har en maskinvaruenhet som resor ute på en gård – om det är en individuell turbin, nätverkskomponent, omformare eller meteorologiska torn – vi är aviserad av larm, vanligtvis inom fem till tio sekunder av denna händelse äger rum,"" förklarar Tony Tousha, vind operationer specialist...

14dam7,3,2012-12-06,Haven't felt so alone and worthless as I do tonight.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14dam7/havent_felt_so_alone_and_worthless_as_i_do_tonight/,"Basically I fucked up my life again. Not sure I want to do anything else anymore. Keep telling myself there is still something left and find I lose more and more.

It wasn't so bad of a month. Secret Santa, reddit, and the idea of the end of the semester was helping and I was actually having a good time. I hate my school/teachers at this community college, but I was glad to be able to graduate so I can take the boards and be a certified vet tech and feel like I actually accomplished something and can actually do something with my life for once.

Now it's all my fault that I'm no longer going to do that. After being sat down and told by the program director/teacher, who we mutually hate each other, that I failed my last internship and I was too stupid/unenthusiastic. She even told me how she wished she failed me in my last classes too, because she wanted to and told me she gave me a ""C minus minus minus just barely passing'. 

I shouldn't have taken the internship with this one lady but I had no choice. I was stuck. I didn't want to commute over an hour to go someplace after the one clinic fell through, I wanted to move on with my life and take a job I was being offereed and have a short commute around where I lived. Not to mention the clinics over an hour away might take months to get back to me to even start and I wanted to graduate now. It was all because this one clinic kept saying yes, they'd take me as soon as the other interns finished. Then out of the blue one of the doctors quit and they were never accepting interns again.

The doctor at the end I went with disliked me. She wrote some really negative stuff about me and said even worse. Told my teacher she ""had no idea why (clinic name) hired me"". My teacher seemed to agree, and told me I'm not cut out for anything, that I couldn't actually ""perform"" as a technician and therefore she wishes she never passed me.

These two women share a mutual adoration and respect for one of the worst veterinarians at the clinic I work with, who would let dogs die because he's too lazy to do his job. I hate these people so much, and I just sit there and take it. The teacher said I'd just have to re-do my hours (two different classes). Told me for the other class I'd have to re-do them somewhere else, spoke to me about an agreement form I was supposed to sign-- funny, I asked her often about what I needed for this class since I signed up for it a year ago, I doubt anyone actually gets these ""agreements"" she speaks of, since it was the first I ever heard of it. But for the internship she would select a specific site/doctor only she wants and communicate with them all the time, basically keep me under strict watch and one bad note will fail me. And it's another mobile vet, not a stable clinic with more flexible hours.

I'm done. I won't return to that program but I wasted 3 years getting to where I was thinking I'd be able to do something with my life. Even if I graduated, I wouldn't make money to support myself, even if people would hire me. I'm emotionally stunted and it prevents me from even having friends anyway. The whole point of graduating now was because I had been planning to get out of this state and start over elsewhere. I hate it here so much that it makes everything several times more miserable, and I have no ties anywhere (no long-distance friends or close family).

And all the time I kept wishing I'd crash since I was crying too hard on the hour and a half ride home so I didn't have to get home and be alone. I have no friends, still hurting so bad from being left by the only guy I really liked, and just no one around. 

I'm sure I've felt equally worse, but I have no one else to turn to but strangers on reddit. Even my pets have a bad habit of hiding when I'm crying, so much for cats and man's best friend.

14d7cp,1,2012-12-05,m(21) crazy about f(21) who is not so crazy about me,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14d7cp/m21_crazy_about_f21_who_is_not_so_crazy_about_me/,"Been dating a little shy of a year(m(21) f(21)), been split up for a few months.

I started university a few years ago and got into to sports in a big way. Here I met, among others, the girl who I am dearly in love
with now.

Me, this girl and another girl who would finish and leave at the end of the year became good friends over the first year and spent a lot of time together. Ironically, I was much closer friends to the girl who would leave at the end of the first year and spent a happy few occasions getting very drunk with just her and getting completely humiliated at pool; the much quieter girl who I happened to think was stunningly beautiful and would go on to date wouldn't get ignored 
as such, but her voice often got lost between the other two of us because she was so much quieter. 

My relationship with the quiet girl with whom I am in love started to heat up to a little bit more than just friends toward the end of the year, but then the year actually ended and she went back to her family several thousand miles away. I asked if I could visit her, but our relationship wasn't really at that point yet - and even if she personally wanted me to visit her family wouldn't have accepted it, and would have killed the idea entirely.

I wasn't a paragon of dedication to keeping in touch over the summer and we lost touch a little. I tried to talk to her for a few hours every couple of days but i'd often forget or just not be in the mood to spend a few hours talking after whatever i'd done that day. The end result was that when summer ended and we ended up in roughly the same place in the same country again, I basically had to get to know her again. I've always wondered if my lack of attention hurt her a bit over summer, I can barely recall a time that she wasn't around when I wanted to talk but I'd go for quite a long time without talking to her. On the other hand I seem to recall basically had nothing to do that summer because most of her friends had moved to different countries; but I digress.

It didn't actually take very long for us to become close friends again, or for me to fall in love with her. After a few months I built up the gall to tell her and she reciprocated my feelings. I was the first boyfriend she'd ever had and she was extremely nervous about being physically close to me. She was a little better when I would give her a hug as ""just friends"" before our relationship started, but it was something she struggled with throughout; through the whole relationship I never got closer to her than a short kiss. Another problem is that her parents enforced a curfew and she couldn't or wouldn't disobey it, every evening at around 6:30 they'd call her and check she was home. As you can imagine, this made spending time with her rather difficult. I persevered though because I really did feel that I loved her. Perhaps I'm just an idiot though. 

This whole thing continued until we broke up for summer again. I didn't want to lose contact with her like I had last summer so I suggested we visit one another again. She nearly had a heart attack at the prospect of me visiting her, but said she'd talk to her parents about it. As for visiting me here, she mentioned that she'd be coming down for a week for her graduation. I get the feeling that she didn't actually want me to come and see her and once again even if she had, her parents wouldn't have let her.

This summer I landed with an internship relevant to my subject at a great university, I was pleased but it was hella hard work. I was working 45 hour weeks pretty much solidly through and trying to keep up around 10 hours a week of strength training and conditioning at the same time. I made a huge effort to keep in contact with her but our positions almost ended up being reversed from last summer. When I actually had free time I'd always be around to talk with her, but she was almost never around to talk to me. After a while ended up telling her something along the lines of ""If you want this relationship, you have to make an effort to talk to me"", at which point she fairly bluntly told me she didn't love me. 

I stayed optimistic and told myself that it was her parents putting some kind of pressure on her. I told her that even if she didn't love me she was still my best friend and I didn't want to lose touch with her. We pretty much continued that way until we got back. I should mention that coming back to this term, we are together running teaching for the sports club that we originally met up at, so I have to see her and work with her on a regular basis no matter what.

I spent some time getting to know her again, and then told her that I still loved her. She was confused, and rejected me and told me that she liked our relationship where it was and didn't want to go any further. I had the very uncomfortable job of confronting the comforting lie I had been telling myself. 

From this point, I start to look a little stupider. I started becoming obsessive about the problem, though I was smart enough to see that that was what was happening. I started going truly out of my way to spend time with her, though she seemed more flattered (or at least did a very good job of pretending and she is a shitty liar) by the attention than anything else. I became a little jealous of her spending time with other people, particularly guys. I saw what was happening and didn't say or do anything, but that didn't make me FEEL much better. This continued for about a month and a half, with me progressively feeling my grip on sanity loosening. After a while I gave up trying to hold the status quo, and told her everything.

We had quite a long talk and she told me that she just didn't feel mature enough to have a relationship, and even if she did she loved me much more as a brother than anything else. She said that she had originally started going out with me to get to know me better instead of anything more serious, which is why she pushed back so hard
when I made any attempts to escalate it. I'm pretty sure this is either an outright lie or a very small portion of the story, but it is what she SAID anyway. She told me to tell her if there was anything she could do to help me, and on my suggestion I spent a week completely without seeing her.

So that leaves me at a month ago. A  weeks break really helped me get my head right, and we're still spend a lot of time together; but even if I wanted to avoid her as much as I could, I'd still be spending quite a lot of time working with her. Frankly, after almost a year of throwing a lot of my energy into the problem I'm out of ideas.

I absolutely adore her and after all the has gone on in the last few months, we seem to be able to share anything. My questions to you now /r/relationships are:


1) Can I have a hug?

2) Did I fuck up, if so, where?

3) Can I still turn this out how I want? If the answer is yes, any suggestions?

4) If the answer is likely no, then what do I do to keep her as a close friend (or at least somebody who I can work on good terms with) and still keep my sanity?

5) If you have any other advice or comments, I'd love to hear them

Growing up, I've come to think for myself and have been leaning atheist. I occasionally go to church to make my parents happy. One of my friends there is a pastoral intern and I had come to trust him as a friend. Tonight I told him the truth about what I believe and asked him to keep it just between him and myself. He refused and said he couldn't do that and plans on telling another intern who in turn will go and spill it everywhere. I'd rather not have people know what I believe as it will turn into a mess of harassing phone calls, texts, and emails about how I'm wrong and how I need to change my thinking.

14cu90,1,2012-12-05,post-college blues,adelaideanne,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14cu90/postcollege_blues/,"I graduated from college in May and I really haven't gone anywhere. Things were supposed to get easier after I finished school. My boyfriend and I have been LDR since we started dating (since July 2010) and we managed to make it through school relatively easily. We were able to see each other a few times a month and we were so occupied with school, friends, and extracurriculars that it wasn't so bad. The problem is that now that i have graduated, he's still in school. He's going to school, doing an internship, and working, leaving him absolutely no free time. I'm only working part time in a retail position so I have a lot of free time (and no money). We aren't even that far apart (&lt;100 miles) but the lack of money and incompatible schedules makes it impossible to see each other regularly. I know I just have to wait until May when he is finished and we can hopefully move in together, but life is being a bitch in more ways than just the relationship.

Obviously since I'm only working part time, I'm also living with my parents. They are miserable. My dad is retired and doesn't do anything, and my mom is only working a part time retail gig (she was working on her GED but IDK what happened there). They have no interests and no motivation to do anything. They question *everything* I do. Our schedules are incompatible so I can't cook or clean when I have the time/energy. They also don't respect my privacy. There is no knocking before entering my room. They also don't understand that job hunting is different, so when I'm ""just"" sitting at my computer, I'm not just screwing around. I'm trying to get actual work done, but they don't get it. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate what they're doing for me, but it feels like I have less freedom than I did in high school. 

On top of the parents, our landlord is just ridiculous. We get in trouble for stupid crap, and they are passive agressive about everything. We can only do laundry between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. We're not allowed to turn the cars around in the driveway ""because the tires leave marks on the ground."" I can't park on the street now that it's winter, so I had been parking in this little patch of grass that they told us I could use when we moved in. I came home one day to a ""No Parking"" sign in front of it. Instead of talking to us about the issue (it has rained a lot lately and my car was ruining the grass) they just put a sign up. They've left notes about leaving the door unlocked or leaving the garage door open when we're running to the store (and someone is still home). I had less rules living in a dorm.

The thing that's getting to me the most is my job. I hate it. I hate that I'm making less money now than I did before I went back to school. I hate that I can't find a full time job, that I'm sick and need to see a specialist but I don't have health insurance, that I can't afford to live on my own. I miss being able to live on my schedule and I miss being self reliant. I don't know how many more job applications I can fill out.

TL;DR Being poor sucks and it's nearly impossible to escape, even after going to college."
14grnr,1,2012-12-07,Bail Jumping.,chadjakes,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/14grnr/bail_jumping/,"Ok, so I live in this little tiny tourist area.   I am in the midst of fighting a DUI case that has a bail-jumping attached to it.  Now from the time I as charged with the DUI (Jan-12)  The same cop who gave me the DUI, came up to where I worked where me and co-workers were drinking after work.  I admit this was wrong, but the point was he ended up calling my boss, and I in-tern because I was the manager got fired to set an example.  Now he(the original arresting officer) saw me drinking then... and nothing was done (legally speaking).  Fast forward to 2 weeks before trial.  I was sitting outside of a bar, waiting for a ride.  you have to understand there is NO ONE in this town at this point.  So the same officer sees me,  comes over, calls me by name and says he you been drinking.  I admitted I had do to the fact that he didn't do anything the last time and I suspected being straight with him was the proper course of action.  He arrests me for bail jumping, caiming he can't ""just see a CRIME, and let it go""... And now I will have to deal with that I guess...



My issue is the fact that, he didn't do anything that one time... so he saw a crime at let that go,  and the fact that it was so close to the trial. and the ADA email my lawyer saying this crap about how this happend and they are looking into some other shit about me to scare him/or me I guess away from this trial, which is shit.  The whole legal system is corrupt here.  All I want to do is get this over with and leave the county.

TLDR; DUI, caught for drinking at work subsequently fired, and a bail jumping from all the same officer... is this harassment?  And even if I win the DUI jury trial (which I assume would negate the first Bail Jumping)  wont they just go and fuck my on this new bail jumping charge?

I guess I'll start with the backstory, I was dating a girl while in college that was very manipulative and quite possibly a pathological liar. She and I met through a mutual, and quickly hit it off. She actually went to a school upstate, but was in town for an internship. We started dating, and she moved into my apartment 3 months later. I paid for everything, as she ""never had any money"". After about a month, she started showing her true colors as the crazy bitch that she was. No physical abuse, but she did everything she could to mentally abuse and cut me off from all of my friends, etc. So, when her internship is up, I wait for her to get back upstate, and call her and split up. I know, big pussy, but Im tellin ya, she was nuts.

2 weeks go by, and she calls and tells me shes pregnant. Based on all the lies prior, I tell her never to call me again and hang up. Plus, it had been like 2 months since we had even had sex.

Fast forward 9 months or so, my brother sees her in a bar, and remarks to me how much weight shes gained. 5 yrs later, I run into the mutual that had introed us originally, and she starts trying to tell me about the ex. Im with my now-wife at the time, so I tell her I dont want to hear it. She says, ""Ex is right, you are a fucking asshole"" and walks off. 

I realised right then it wasnt a lie. She really was preg. I have tried for the last 10+ yrs to find out if I have a 16 yr old out there somewhere. I have no clue where the ex is. The mutual died in a car accident less than a yr after that night. I have nothing to go on, but I desperatly want to know if I have a kid out there.

Luk inspektion: en operator i bps laboratorier i Sunbury på Themsen, UK, overvåger trykket og temperaturen aflæsninger på en rig
Med søgning efter giant reservoirer stadig mere udfordrende, er muligheden for at feje mere olie og gas fra eksisterende reservoirer et uvurderligt værktøj til en virksomhed som BP. Enhanced olie gendannelse er ikke en ny idé, men resultaterne fra teknikker, som BP har brugt år på at udvikle beviser meget spændende. BP Magazine rapporter.
Hver eneste dag på sin Tjæreborg Bay oilﬁeld i Alaska, producerer BP gas, sammen med råolie, masser af gas. Det koeler det til ca 40 ° C under frysepunktet og re-injects i reservoiret næsten lige så meget gas som bruges i hele Det Forenede Kongerige hver dag.
Processen for køleapparater gassen muliggør BP til flydende kulbrinteproduktion, der kan blandes i den rå olien og solgt, men gør det også muligt for virksomheden at øge olie nyttiggørelse fra Tjæreborg.
BP fører an i kørsel op mængden olie, der kan gendannes fra hjemhavnen ﬁelds. De banebrydende ideer er knyttet til denne praksis, kendt som forbedret olie nyttiggørelse (EELLER), har fået olieindustrien opmærksomhed over hele verden. Hvad er så involveret i EELLER?
Hvad er et reservoir?
Til en ikke-specialist, måske et ""reservoir"" skaber billeder af en stor mængde af flydende rasler rundt på ét sted. Men det er faktisk rock med millioner af bittesmå huller – eller porer – at ﬁll med olie og gas. Disse porer fungere som opbevaring rum. Typen af rock i reservoiret, afgør den rock porøsitet og et reservoir kan ligne noget fra en del af lufthavnen landingsbanen, med andre ord meget komprimeret, med mikroskopiske porer, at grove sandsten, med porer, der er synlig med det blotte øje. Denne variation er forårsaget af korn størrelser inden for rock og den dybde, hvormed reservoir rock ligger begravet. Den dybere rock, jo højere temperatur og tryk, forårsager rock til at komprimere og cement til formular mellem kornene.
Arten af latente porer, eller, mere præcist, hvordan tilsluttede de – dens permeabilitet – er vigtig, når det kommer til fjernelse af carbonhydrider fra den subsurface. Størrelsen af porer bestemmer rock's evne til at lagre olie og gas, mens permeabiliteten bestemmer hastigheden hvormed olie og gas vil ﬂow fra rock til en wellbore.
Opretholde presset
I BP, en indsats for at øge olie nyttiggørelse ledes af sit skubber Reservoir grænser ™ (ENA) hold, en af en række teknologi ﬂagship programmer i BP. ENA forsknings- og manager Raymond Choo siger: ""i et typisk reservoir, omkring 10% af olien kan hentes ved blot at bore et hul, stikke en pipe i reservoiret og lade det fysiske pres tvinge olie op af brønd til overfladen. Da olien er produceret, så trykket falder i reservoiret, indtil det ikke længere kan understøtte en kolonne med olie på overfladen. På dette tidspunkt stopper godt ﬂowing.
""For at få mere olie ud, vi har til at opretholde pression, som regel ved indsprøjtning vand – et ' waterﬂood' – eller gas. I begge tilfælde det indsprøjtede ﬂuid ﬂows gennem porer i rock, tvinger olien foran. Men den indsprøjtede ﬂuid følger den nemmeste vej, så er gået glip af nogle porer. En anden faktor er, at nogle af olie stadig sidder fast på overfladen af sand kornene eller fanget i porer. Også fordelt den indsprøjtede ﬂuid ikke fuldt ud fra injektion godt at få adgang til alle rock. Disse faktorer kombineret verdensomspændende gennemsnitlige inddrivelse fra en oilﬁeld er ca. 35%.""
En oilﬁeld inddrivelse faktor beregnes ved at multiplicere sammen fire faktorer, kendt som ""fraktioner"": pore skala deplacement, feje, dræning og cut-off (se panelet på side 46 for en forklaring på hvert af disse).
Konventionelle EELLER
BPS forbedrede olie nyttiggørelse indsats er fokuseret på Jyllandsslaget skala porestørrelse og feje faktorer, som disse er den mindste af fire, og derfor har det største behov for forbedringer. I et stykke tid nu, forskellige teknologier har været til rådighed til at forbedre efﬁciency af waterﬂooding – eksempelvis stoffer kaldet overfladeaktive stoffer bruges til at forbedre pore skala forskydningen. Overfladeaktive stoffer ligner opvaskemiddel; de bidrager til at fjerne olie fra overfladen af sand korn og reducere det beløb, der bliver fanget i porer. Men de er dyre, og da de forbruges ved rock, du skal indsprøjtes en masse af dem. En anden metode er at bruge polymerer til Forstør vand, som kan bidrage til at øge inddrivelse.
Gas injektion-metoden anvendes på Tjæreborg Bay oilﬁeld i Alaska siden 1986, er en anden mulighed. Ved forarbejdning af naturgas for at ændre dens egenskaber, er BP genoprette meget mere olie end ellers ville være muligt. Nogle af denne gas bruges til at oprette såkaldte blandbart gas. Denne gas er meget god til pore skala deplacement og uddrager typisk op til 95% af olien fra rock det fejer. Tjæreborg Bay er verdens største kulbrinte blandbart gas projekt.
Lignende programmer er i drift i BP-drives ﬁelds i Nordsøen. EELLER på Norges Ula ﬁeld startede i 1999 og skønnes for at tegner sig for omkring 70% af den aktuelle olieproduktion. Magnus ﬁeld, EELLER startede i 2001 og er anslået til tegner sig for omkring 30% af den aktuelle produktion.
ENA og de nye teknologier
BPS førende teknologier er kommet på grund af et bevidst valg af bps ENA team. Snarere end blot fortsætte industriens fremskridt i trinvis udvikling af eksisterende teknologier, valgte holdet at fokusere på revolutionære billig EELLER teknikker.
Lavt saltindhold vand (LoSal ® EELLER)
Havvand er almindeligt anvendt i traditionelle waterﬂooding-teknikker, indsprøjtning reservoirer at fastholde presset. ENA holdet så bevis for, at lave saltholdighed vand indeholdende næsten som lidt salt som drikkevand kan frigive olie, der ellers ville være bundet til sand kornene. Holdet udført mange intern laboratorieundersøgelser ved hjælp af reelle reservoir klipper, efterfulgt af yderligere analyser i rock omkring faktiske brønde, før ﬁnally udførelse en altfavnende, multi-touch millioner dollar ﬁeld rettergang ved Endicott ﬁeld i Alaska. Her, teamet injiceres lavt saltindhold vand i en brønd og overvåges den resulterende olieproduktion fra hinanden.
Todd Buikema, leder af distributionsgruppen ENA, siger: ""udviklingen af LoSal EELLER teknologi har taget 20 år, med BP udgivelse talrige papirer rapportering om fremskridt, som det været banebrydende vejen frem. Denne indsats er blevet belønnet med verdens ﬁrst sanktioneret offshore lavt saltindhold projekt i Clair Ridge i Det Forenede Kongerige. Clair Ridge platforme vil være udstyret med afsaltning udstyr at reducere saltholdigheden på de 145.000 tønder pr. dag indsprøjtede vand, der er nødvendige.
""Det skal levere ca. 42 millioner tønder mere olie end en ﬂood med konventionelle havvand,"" siger Buikema. ""Det betyder, at omkring $3 pr. trinvis tønde, hvilket er temmelig imponerende i verden af EELLER.""
Teknologien er skal så effektiv, at BP har besluttet at lave saltholdighed waterﬂooding være standard for alle fremtidige sandsten waterﬂoods. Andre lavt saltindhold distributionsprojekter er på forskellige udviklingstrin, herunder planer om at medtage LoSal EELLER i anden fase af den Mexicanske Golfs gale hund ﬁeld.
Forbedre sweep med Bright vand ™ partikler
Egenskaberne for sandsten rock variere meget, afhængigt af størrelsen og sammensætningen af de sand grains det gøres fra og om andre funktioner er til stede. Sandstones tendens til formularen som en sekvens af lag, hvoraf nogle kan have lav permeabilitet og nogle høje. Der er ofte et par lag med meget højere permeabilitet end resten af ﬁeld. Væsker ﬂow lettest gennem de mere højgennemtrængelige lag, altså hvor vandet fra de godt injektion vil naturligvis gå og hurtigt push-out olien.
Men disse mere højgennemtrængelige lag hurtigt ﬁll med vand, som derefter begynder at blive udvist sammen med olien. Når dette sker, er mere vand ind dette lag er spildt så der lidt olie tilbage for at presse igennem, så vand cyklusser gennem ned indsprøjtning godt, kampen gennem vand-ﬁlled laget og op på godt produktion. Fordi disse lag har tendens til at ""stjæle"" en uforholdsmæssig stor mængde af det indsprøjtede vand, kaldes de «tyv zoner».
For at bekæmpe dette, BP havde tanken om en partikel, der kunne blokere deaktivere disse zoner dybt i reservoiret mellem godt indsprøjtning og produktion godt og udviklet teknologi kaldet Bright vand partikler. Paul Denyer, Bright vand partikel Installationsstyring, forklarer: ""partiklen er langkædede molekyle holdt i et stramt bundet bolden – lidt ligesom en kugle af uld. Disse kugler er så små, at de kan føjes til injektion vandet og passere uhindret gennem reservoir-rock. Når koldt havvand injiceres, er det varmes op i zonen tyv fra det varmere, unswept rock ovenfor og nedenunder. Dette bryder nogle af kæderne i Bright vand partiklen og stramt bundet bolden pop åbne til noget omkring 10 gange større.
""Disse større molekyler kamp at komme igennem eller bliver helt fast i strammere hullerne mellem de sand korn og vand ﬂow reduceres drastisk. Resultatet er, at det indsprøjtede vand er tvunget til at tage en ny sti og sweep nye rock, som derefter øger det olie opsving fra ﬁeld.""
BP har påvist udførelsen af partiklen Bright vand i ﬁelds i Alaska og dens argentinske joint venture-selskabet, Pan American energi og andre steder. Lyse vand partikel behandlinger udført hidtil af BP har yderligere kulbrinte ressourcer vurderes for at være mere end 20 millioner tønder ovenfor hvad måske ellers har generhvervet uden behandling, og en attraktiv EELLER omkostninger.
Vindende hold
Gruppen ENA, der fulgte med disse innovative løsninger er organiseret i fire hold der dækker forskning og udvikling, laboratorium, implementering og computation rock fysik – udvikle nye teknologier til reservoir karakterisering og ydeevne forudsigelse, der er vigtigt at optimere olie inddrivelse. Holdene er centraliseret i bps to vigtigste opstrøms teknologicentre Sunbury på Themsen, UK, og Houston, USA.
Verdensklasse laboratorierne de bruger indeholder udstyr som hel-krops medicinsk CT scannere for at se inde på klippeprøver. Med en vellykket track record oprettet, vokser ENA holdene at klare de nye teknologier og sikre, at BP uddrager det maksimale beneﬁt fra deres implementering.
ENA teknologi innovation leder Andrew Cockin siger: ""BP har været leder i EELLER i lang tid. Vi opererer verdens største kulbrinte blandbart gas projekt, samt flere andre signiﬁcant projekter, som på Magnus og Ula. Vi har oprettet roman, meget-cost-effektiv EELLER teknologier og har mere EELLER teknologier under udvikling til at revolutionere EELLER yderligere og øge recovery faktoren.""
EELLER er begyndt at vise, at det har potentiale til at yde et reelt bidrag til ressource erstatning. Cockin siger: ""historisk olie selskaber flyttede til nye ﬁelds når konventionelle olieproduktion faldt til uøkonomisk niveauer. Jagten på nye giant oilﬁelds får sværere, så ønsket om at inddrive mere fra eksisterende ﬁelds øges. Når nationale olieselskaber overvejer hvem der skal partner med, er evnen til at genoprette mere olie en kvalitet, de mere og mere værdi. ""Dette er et godt tidspunkt til at fungere i forbedrede olie nyttiggørelse og et værdifuldt område for BP at være førende i verden.""

14ifl2,2,2012-12-08,Fired because I could not perform something I couldn't do.,Icetime58,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14ifl2/fired_because_i_could_not_perform_something_i/,"I was recently discharged from my first job as a new graduate due to performance. I was assigned on a project to create websites. However, I have absolutely zero skill in that. I know nothing about the structure, the languages, or anything. Sure I can code C/C++, but that is another world from web development. To make matters even more difficult, there was no one to help or guide me. NO ONE at the company had prior web development experience. I was on my own having to be self-taught while management constantly demanded results. Thankfully, old contractors had already created the skeleton for the web app.

I worked my ass off. I was usually one of the last ones to leave, staying until as late as 7 or 8 while everyone was off by 5. I borrowed books, used tutorials, took online classes on my own time to try to play catch up. It would of been a lot easier if the languages were even remotely close to C/C++. Thankfully, at least Javascript/jQuery came close. But HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, and SQL? I didn't know squat about that stuff. I graduated with a BSEE, not BSCS. But I thought, ""this is the real world. Engineering isn't supposed to be easy. It's a field that requires constant learning.""

Fast forward a bit into the project, I was nearly done with my first page. It worked exactly how my boss wanted it. I was feeling proud of my work. Happy and filled with joy that I was starting to overcome this difficulty. I was making improvements and it felt good. After showing my boss, I told him I just had to put some finishing touches on it. Clean up my code and place comments in it. That's when I was hit right in the gut. 

My boss informs me that I was 3 weeks overdue on my task and that I needed to work harder. That high I was feeling earlier? Gone in a second. ""How am I so far behind?"", I asked myself. ""I didn't even know there was a hard deadline on this page. What the hell was 3 weeks ago?"" I go through my emails, sorted by time, and looked through the section that said ""3 weeks ago"". I found the email that contained my assigned task and authorization to work on this project. I was late by 3 weeks when the task was assigned 3 weeks ago. God damn, I was pissed. How the hell was I supposed to finish this task in a week when I had absolutely no experience or technical skill in web development? No where in my resume do I state these skills. Nor did I express it in my two interviews. Hell, web development didn't even come up in the interviews. I was on tilt for the rest of the week.

Now, I get handed my 2nd assignment. Another page of the web app. It's a lot less stressful and frustrating this time around because I had some experience. Things were going a little faster and things didn't seem so bad. I was starting to enjoy web development. I never would of touched it if not for my job. It was pretty fun making websites.

2 or 3 months go by since I was first put on this project and there was some great news! Two more new grads were hired and one of them was an expert in web development! He had done a couple internships doing web and had been learning since late high school/early college. ""Finally!"", I thought. ""Now I can ask for help around here."" The next couple weeks go by nicely. I had someone I could go to for help now as well as brainstorming ideas. Even though we were the same age, I was learning a lot from him. In turn, I was helping him get familiar with the project and Ruby on Rails, the latter being something he hasn't worked with yet. However, he was very quick to pick it up due to his prior experience. Then, I was asked to attend a meeting at the end of the week.

Throughout the whole week I wondered, ""what is the meeting for?"" End of the week comes and it was time for the meeting. An hour before close of business. I walk over to the room where I saw not only my boss, but HR has well. I was asked to take a seat and promptly told that my contract was being terminated, effective immediately. Performance was being an issue due to late tasks and despite being informed of this, I wasn't doing any better. I was told to pack up my things and turn in my badge. 

I didn't understand it. The web app was the 2nd project I was assigned on. The 1st one being C++ and database oriented. Sure I didn't know SQL, but I was able to pick it up quickly enough. My boss for that project even commended me for my work. He spoke of how quickly I was able to get things done while still retaining quality. 

It's been a month since I was discharged. I have signed up for unemployment and my claim is currently being processed. Thankfully, I was smart with my money and saved up enough to pay off all of my student loans and have a couple grand to live off of for the time being along with my parent's help. I don't know what to think. Part of me feels like it was my fault for being incompetent. Part of me feels that it was a mutual split. I was constantly angry and frustrated about work. It was not a happy place for me. Plus, they wanted a web developer, something that I wasn't. It took me a while to realize that the new grad that was hired was supposed to be my replacement. I'm glad that he was hired. The job certainly fits him and it's something he likes to do. He's a good guy. He deserves it. On the other hand, I feel betrayed by management as if this was something very underhanded. I have applied to what feels like 50+ jobs since. Not one callback. I feel like when hiring managers see that I've only been at a full-time job for 5 months it gives a bad impression.

Filing for unemployment really hit home. I feel like dirt. While the rest of my friends still have jobs and some really succeeding, here I am fucking applying for unemployment like some pathetic piece of garbage.  Things feel hopeless. The only jobs I can land right now is retail, but that's not what I want. I have a degree in engineering damn it. My old fears are starting to surface again. The fear of having to find a job that's just ""for now"". Only to end up becoming stagnant in life. To waste my degree and my life working dead end jobs for minimum wage. Yeah, that will definitely impress the ladies. To be such a fucking disappointment to my parents. My parents who worked so hard to raise me. Only to see their son fail at life. To grow up and be in my 30s or 40s and having old classmates from high school and college seeing what a loser I am. I don't want that, but no one even wants to consider me. Let alone hire me. I want to blame someone. Something. But all that's left here is myself. I feel like it was my fault. Like I could of done something better. I just don't know exactly what though. Too late for that now. All I can do now is live with the consequences of my actions. 

**TDLR:** I'm a recent graduate who lost his job due to performance. I was assigned a task that required several technical skills I did not have. Therefore, I had to be self-taught since no one at the company had the experience required to guide me. A few months into the task, management decided to let me go."
14iby9,7,2012-12-08,"[24/m] I can't stop thinking about ""the one that got away.""",DVNO,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14iby9/24m_i_cant_stop_thinking_about_the_one_that_got/,"Let me start off by saying that I'm a regular reader of /r/relationship_advice, so I know the general feelings on such topics. I know that most people don't believe in the idea of ""the one"" and that people usually break up for good reason. Maybe that all still applies to me, but hear me out.

I'm 24. Graduated from college a year ago. When I was a senior in high school, I met my GF. It was my first relationship, but it was wonderful. When I was with her, I was the happiest I had ever been. Everything was perfect. I guess you'd call that the honeymoon phase (or just teenage love), but others began to see how great we were for each other. All our friends joked that we were obviously going to get married one day.

Only one problem: I was a year older than her, which meant I was about to go off to college and she had another year of high school. After a wonderful summer together, we said our last goodbye before I went away to school out of state. It was emotional. And even though we had ""agreed"" to break up, it never really happened. We kept texting. Talking on the phone. And before I knew it, she was making plans to come visit me. Soon after we decided that breaking up was silly and we'd try our hand at a long distance relationship.

It was tough, but actually went pretty well. By the end of the year, she was making decisions about her own college plans. My school wasn't her first choice, but after she didn't get in to her top school, she decided on joining me. I was basically the reason for her decision. She had initially applied half jokingly, and only after some bad luck did it actually become a viable option.

Anyway, the next fall she started her freshman year. I was a sophomore. And then things began to fall apart. I hadn't made very many friends my freshman year. Going away to college was a tough transition for me. Add in that my GF was back home, which took a lot of my attention, and I just failed to establish a good social circle. So when she started school, I was eager to spend time with her. *A lot* of time with her. That wasn't good, because she had other ideas. She wanted to make friends. Spend time with people in her dorm. In her classes. She wanted to join a sorority. You know, things normal people do. Things I had missed out on. And it made me feel like she was ignoring me. Like I wasn't important to her.

I got angry. I demanded more and more time with her. But that slowly started to push her away. I was very stressed from my classes and without real friends of my own, I became dependent on her. I started to tag along to whatever she was doing. And when I couldn't do that, I sat in my room, alone, depressed. I was not in a good state. I needed her to be happy, and that wasn't fair.

To make a long story short, it led to the end of our relationship by the end of the year.  I was completely heartbroken. I had no support system. I didn't know what to do. I felt completely lost. I had to see a therapist for a while just get back on my feet. But I learned a lot about myself and ultimately came out stronger. I joined a few student organizations and made friends. Great friends. We still talk to this day. I started dating again and was involved with a few girls. I was even in a few semi-serious relationships. I moved on with my life.

But still, now that 3 years have passed, I still feel immense regret about this one girl. We've kept in touch. We're ""friends"" now. I know some people can't comprehend the idea of staying in touch with an ex, but we've made it work. We get lunch every so often. We wish each other happy birthday. It's always nice to hear from her. But more and more, I've been thinking about her. Even having dreams about her. And it's becoming unbearable. I don't know what to do. 

Of all the girls I've been with, this is the girl that has stuck in my mind. When I think of the perfect girl for me, the perfect relationship, she's who I think about. I just fail to see how anyone could top her. And in the years since, I haven't found anyone yet. But I don't know if that's just my mind playing tricks on me, only remembering the good times, or if it means something more. I desperately want to reach out to her and tell her this, but it would be completely out of the blue. And here's the real kicker: she's spending a year abroad on an internship. So I haven't even seen her lately, I won't see her again for a while, and who knows if we'll ever even have the opportunity to reconnect again? Ugh. Any advice?

**TL;DR**: I was in a 3 year relationship with the perfect girl for me. It fell apart, I moved on with my life, but now, 3 years after the breakup, I still think about her. Of all the girls I've dated, she's the one that sticks out in my mind. She's the one I want. And even though we're ""friends"" and on good terms, I just don't see a way to ever express these feelings to her."
14h7ro,8,2012-12-07,"Hey all. I know no one will read this, but I just need to share my story here. Things have been piling up and I just can't take it.",Expectation,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/14h7ro/hey_all_i_know_no_one_will_read_this_but_i_just/,"So... Where to begin?
Hi. I suppose that's a good start.

I am a 20 year old guy in the college of my choice. About 5'11"" and 175lbs. Dirty blonde hair. This is a throwaway account, so let's just say my name is Hope, for irony's sake. 

Anyway, I am posting here because I have been struggling with chronic depression for about 12-13 years. It seems very off and on. Some days are manageable, but a lot of the time I just try to keep my mind off it. 

It all started back in the day when I was a tyke. 4th grade was when the weekly thoughts of death came around. They have persisted throughout my life, and I havn't really told anyone because I don't want to be labelled as crazy or upset anyone. No one really seemed to like me, as my family moved around about 8 times as I was growing up. Middle school was really the first time I had an opportunity to make lasting ""friends."" But I wasn't very good at it, and many of the kids had already formed groups with peers. I found a group I enjoyed being around, but they hated me, and made it known on a daily basis. I remember getting death threats from other classmates. The bullying kind of climaxed when one of my friends decided that I was annoying and, after my cat Boots died of Feline Aids, started to spread rumors that I had sex with my cat and that's what killed him (obviously false). I tried to ignore them and focus on my schoolwork, and I ended up really ahead of most of the others in my year (I remember the teachers being shocked at a high school freshman taking AP calculus). I had one close friend left, and we made an agreement to be friends forever... that didn't work out so well, and we drifted apart after another move. 

In high school I went out of my way to be nice to people, but people didn't take very kindly to that. I remember being slammed up against the lockers a few times, punched in the face. My brother even held me down on the ground with everyone watching while he spat into my mouth until I choked. When I tried to run away he would chase me with one of my dad's hammers and hit me in the head with it. I always made it a point to never hit anyone though. I kind of suppressed my anger and to this day I don't get angry at anything other than myself.

I looked for solace from this bullying in relationships and classwork, but high school was simple, and there were only a few girls who I felt comfortable enough with to approach, generally friends. Every time I tried to approach though, I was either humiliated or permanently ignored. There was a girl going into high school who really liked me, but I didn't know how to handle a relationship and I was extremely uncomfortable around her as well as in intimate settings, so I broke it off quickly because I didn't want to hurt her feelings. 

Fast forward to the end of high school. I finally was getting surgery on my extremely flat feet done, so that I could run with all the other kids in gym class without my legs collapsing on me. I cared what other people thought, and I know they all thought I was lazy or unfit, but I really did want to run. I couldn't though. My brother had finally left the house for college and my dad had been working up in alaska for 4 years to support the family. So it was just my mom and I together. 

I still wasn't terribly comfortable around other people, but in class I would speak my mind and try to keep a 4.0 (we didn't weight our AP courses.). Other people seemed to care when I went in for the surgeries, but only for brief visits. I remember spending most of my recovery period alone. A girl who I had known for a long time had begun quarreling with me and it seemed as though i might lose my best friend. We fixed things tentatively though, and as college rolled around I was really optimistic.

Until my brother came home. He would tell me every chance he got that I was wasting my time going to a liberal arts school, and that engineering was the only thing that mattered. I didn't take him seriously, I had always been better than him at math, but as college came around I decided that I didn't want to major in math, despite my talent. He belittled me even more for this, and once I finally settled as a Psychology/pre-law major all hell broke lose as he told me how worthless I was at every chance.

Anyway, I felt pretty happy at my new school. I had gotten a full tuition scholarship and felt that I was doing pretty well. I said hello every time I saw anyone on campus (about 1000 people at the school), and made it a point to smile and wave every time. A few girls didn't like this, and they accused me of stalking them, even though I had no idea who they were. I retreated and stopped saying hi to people, because I thought it upset them.

I notice more and more every day people who are more intelligent than I am, and I have to wonder. Why me? Only 8 kids received a full tuition scholarship, why not any of these people? As I compared myself to them and my brother, who was working for the military at his college, developing explosives, and who later went on to intern for NASA on the Star Wars project, and to receive a full ride from carnegie mellon, I began to feel even more insignificant. This feeling has increased every year, and with it my ADHD has been getting worse and worse. Now, with my family moving yet again, my pets dying, and the pressure of graduation, I lose more and more focus every day. I find it more of a struggle to focus and motivate myself. I used to pride myself on my writing, but now I feel substandard compared to everyone around me.

I don't feel that I have any worth. I don't feel like people appreciate me for any of my talents. I dont appreciate myself for my own talents. I don't know what to do to stop this steady downward spiral. I don't like myself. I hate my body. I hate my mind. I hate it.

I see all these posts around about people being depressed, and I see legitimate reasons, catalysts, for these people to be upset. What I don't see are the stories of accumulated self depreciation.  

I don't know why I am posting this here, I just want to cry or yell or something, but as I have said I don't really get angry at anything ever anymore, and I havnt cried for years. Not that I havnt been torn up over things. I just havnt been able to cry. I want to. I see people around me dying, but that isn't as distressing as seeing all the people who succeed in life and knowing inside that will never be you.

There are posts on here about guy problems and girl problems, but it can always be worse. I've never been kissed, or hugged in any other way than a ""hi everyone. I'm going to hug all of you"" way by those kind of people. I am 20 years old and I don't think I have ever felt appreciated. 

I just want to know that I have something. I feel like a failure, and if the current trend holds, I will be.The thoughts of death and dying get stronger with every stressful situation. I havnt had any desire to act on them, but they are there and I often ponder what it would be like to kill yourself. And what would be the most painless way. Would I do it? I have no idea... it bother me. It haunts me. After spending an entire term working on a constitutional law paper which I felt was amazing, hunting down sources for age old history buried course cases, tracking down officers to get their opinion on the matter, taking it to the academic support center for professional editing, and proofreading it MULTIPLE times, I went up to the teacher and asked him how I did. He didn't remember mine. After talking the whole class about 7 good papers, he looks at me and says he cant remember. Curtains lift, and at the end of the day I get a C+. I know this wouldnt illicit the same reaction from anyone else but I literally just wanted to die. Everyone else in the class had done the paper overnight, and I spent a week on it. I wanted to die. I didn't want to go out of my way to die, but if some mugger asked me for his wallet, I think I'd let him shoot me.  

This isn't the most touching story on here, but I felt like I had to write it. I have a lot of love in my heart but I don't know how to give it. I don't feel like I can. I don't know how."
14h59i,2,2012-12-07,"At a breaking point in my life, just need to vent.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14h59i/at_a_breaking_point_in_my_life_just_need_to_vent/,"Hi, Reddit. I never thought I'd be posting on here, but I've been needing to vent.

I finished college a few years ago and landed a job doing what I had spent the last 2 years of my college life learning, web development/design. This job was more of a general IT helpdesk on the web end of things (help, I can't get logged in, forgot my password..I mean there's a forgot my password BUTTON right there to click..geez..) for a media company, and I was happy making more than I was at an internship I just got done with. So here I am, working on their new redesign for their website, other websites, and a few other projects, and I was fairly happy with the way things were going. I finally moved out on my own for the first time, found a decent place I could afford, and was able to save just a little bit each time I could. That was fine and dandy, until my car died and cost more than I had to fix. I had poured my entire life savings, a few hundred dollars, into fixing it. And then it finally stopped running for good, in the dead of winter and I had no way of getting to or from anywhere. My parents stepped in and helped me out, and I feel worthless for having to rely on my parents to help bail me out of a situation I knew was going to happen.

So back to the job stuff. After I was hired and did some work, my supervisor thought I was doing a good job and got me a raise and told me about it. It was the first and only raise I'd see in 3 years. So I got this little raise, it helped. I didn't have any real performance review, and still haven't yet. So my immediate supervisor leaves for another media company, and I'm basically left to hold it all together, manage the department, coordinate whatever, and deal with his boss. I got my second raise that day. I think it was a realization that ""oh shit, I think I need his knowledge."" We'd been talking about moving the department into a new office for months before it actually happened, and another 8 months of talking about getting new computers before we got them. 

I have the expertise to make things work so much better, but I don't know how to approach the situation and talk about it.

I'm working on my own business model, and that directly relates to what I do on a daily basis. I'm trying to get a web development company started, turnkey site solutions, which would be incredibly easy to use and maintain.

At work, I have to wait until someone has time to make the new development area, get everything configured on the servers. My system? 2 clicks, wait 5 minutes. There's almost no downtime, or waiting for things to get done. I go pee and it's done.

I'd rather be off on my own doing this, but my situation leaves me financially crippled for months. I'm behind on all my bills, my rent is late this month because I wanted to buy my girlfriend some Christmas presents (we were too broke last year for our own christmas, this is our first! =) ), I can't afford to put food on the table and heat the house at the same time, but I have to somehow.

I've been told my solution to making things easy won't/can't work - my boss ""doesn't understand how it works"". It uses a time tested script to create a webserver. You built it from source, and the script i use does everything you just did, but automated. So tell me why my solution won't work? Because you don't want to learn it? How did you learn anything? You didn't know it, you learned it. So why are you so against my idea? Is it a control issue? Are you too scared that I'm going to just make you irrelevant in this process, even though you have other roles you fulfill?

I research ideas for you. You shoot them down, and then 2 years later, want to implement them. Why? I don't get it. Almost a year before getting new computers? A joke. 

That tiny second raise I got was enough to start putting me on the right track again to start saving some money, paying my bills on time, but I'm still short each time. I'm slowly inching my way closer, but I can't dig my way out fast enough. 

I'm not your former programmer, nor will i ever be like him. I spent years learning and developing my own skills, and they're not appreciated. Sure, I'm no programmer, not now, maybe I will be once I get some real food on the table and have the energy to learn again.

I'm stuck without anything extra, or I'd pack my bags and leave, do this on my own. I could set my own hours, not this 8-5 job that just drags each day.

We're supposed to be this awesome shop that does web development, but our tools, processes, and understanding is so far behind that it won't go very far like you expect it to. Why don't you listen to me and just accept that things from 20 years ago are behind the times, and there's new, better ways of doing this same shit you spend hours doing. I got it to a process that takes minutes, but you won't hear me out or let me demonstrate my ability, you won't let me have any control or say.

I wonder if this is why your other programmers all left. Or if it was the terrible pay. Or something else. I know my reasons why I want to. 

But I can't just tell you all of this without throwing myself under the bus, exposing the fact that I want to go on my own, do my own thing, or show you how it's done with best practices for this application. If I show my cards, I'll likely be booted out that instant. But I want to take that risk, that challenge. I've worked on this for weeks, a few hours here, a few there, and I get more done in a single night on my setup than I do all week on yours.

I just don't get it. I'm beaten down, too scared to speak my mind and just say what I need to. I fear for my job, only because I know I'm right about all this and you're out of touch. You want to foster ideas and new creative thinking, but I'm stifled. I don't like it, and I don't understand it. I don't think I will.

Maybe I'll get my bills paid all on time once the new year rolls in. Maybe then, I'll get back on track and start my own things. But until I'm able to...I think I'm stuck, and I hate it every passing day. I spent 30 minutes in a meeting talking about how to do something, when I could have just done it on my setup in minutes. Why?!

There's so much time wasted, effort wasted. You pass a web project off to another company instead of giving it to us. Wasted your money there. And I was furious. Still am, since you had me fix their costly mistakes. 

I hate walking in each day knowing I'm leaving with less accomplished than if i worked from home, or on my own. It's ridiculous. I waste away in a cubicle, usually unspoken to unless someone needs something. I tune everything out, including the fact that I'm stuck in this place, with music. So if you see my headphones, I'm trying to escape. 

I'm not your buddy, I'm not your pal, so stop trying to talk to me like I am. And all you're doing is fucking your people over. Every day. We're supposed to be ""investing our time"" in this aspect of your business, but you don't invest any additional monies into the equation. 4 year old computers, outdated everything, slow network connection because of the company, and you expect me to work miracles? I don't think so...I'm hourly, so when people call me after 5pm? No thanks. We'll talk tomorrow, leave a message or email me.

I'm so miserable it got to a point where I drank every night, and told my supervisor, your old programmer. Someone had to know, I was ruining my life, and being completely worthless at my job. I got over it, sucked it up, and just let it go, immersing myself in video games, cutting myself off from the outside world.

I got over all that, and now I want more. I need more. I need to feel like I matter, like I mean something. I've done all this learning, development, deployment and other various things, but it doesn't matter to anyone but myself. I guess that's why I learned what I did, because it mattered to me. I wanted to do something with those skills, but they're not even utilized. 

My personal project could be implemented in your company, but if you're not wanting to hear it, I'll just take it and run it myself. It's the turnkey solution you were looking for, I just did it on my own time, on my own stuff, with my own control. I did it, because I had the access and tools to do it. That's why it's done right, on time, and hasn't had any problems. It's been running for 3 months now, completely stable. I'm just not to the point of taking the dive and parting ways, since I don't have anything to back me up, to pay the bills, until something comes my way on it. 

Ugh. Fuck this job. I'm 26, and jaded. It's not what I signed up for, and it's been nothing but a clusterfuck of wasted time and effort and energy and hope. My SO works 3rd shift, so I see her for all of a few hours a day at most, sometimes 2, sometimes 4. But to you, it doesn't matter. To me, it's my life and it makes me happy to see her. But you won't allow for flexible hours or working from home.

 All I want to do is break away, and do this, but you pay me so little I can't even afford to keep my car gassed up over the winter. Fuck this job, and fuck you.

Here are my two biggest accomplishments:

1. My iTunes. I went from having over 8 days worth of music to now only having less than 3.5 days. Seriously guys, do this. There was just so much music in there that I never listened to for whatever reason, the quality of my library is just so much better. 

2. Email. Between having a year's internship in politics, to working retail on the side, to being in school fulltime, this was a goal of mine. Not only did I finally get rid of all of the junk in there, but I also responded to all of the emails that I needed to. Then just to do it a bit better, I unsubscribed from a million different political crap that was in there. 

So I am curious to hear your experiences and thoughts on digital minimalism. "

14mpr7,3,2012-12-10,I did this to myself,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14mpr7/i_did_this_to_myself/,"What have I done? Oh yeah, I planned this and knew it would work out this way. 

I had a simple life, decent flexible job that I could have really put more effort into creating into a career, decent friends, living in a decent town, living a mediocre life.
So why the hell did I throw it all away? Why did I jump at the first chance to get the fuck out and start over? 

Because it was mediocre, I was unhappy and it was getting worse.

I’ve always been a dreamer and an adventurer. Self sufficient, risk taker, head strong and interested in participating in the fringe cultures of life, at least temporarily. When my last friend, someone who got me on a deep level, left town to pursue her dreams of adventure and career ambitions I realized I was the last of the group. Everyone of our friends had left, to go live their adventurous lives and strive to be something more than anyone could become in our tiny college town.

I was alone. I had friends, sure, but all they did was drink at the same pubs and gossip. Nothing wrong with that, but I missed being able to wax poetic about what could be, what we’d love to do, places we’d love to go and things we were currently learning about. I wanted mental stimulation, you know, exploring the world and who you are… learning. 

These people, the ones left were all boring and caught up in trite melodramas that made them feel relevant and exciting. I didn’t get off on the incestuous dog-eat-dog nature of the social scene and started going out less and less. Spending more time alone, musing over how that little excited ping in me telling me to leave and go do something with my life was turning into something painful and aching, keeping me up at night. My alienation really did cause me to become very much alone.

So I left. I got an offer to housesit for a few months in another state and jumped at it. Fuck it. My job was something I fell into and had done for ten years. So I quit. I’d finally graduated and finished my internship and exhausted any and all possible job opportunities in that tiny and unforgiving community and it was barren now. There is no industry there for the career I seek. My real friends gone, living situation deteriorating as was my state of mind. 

Moving all of my stuff into my sister’s basement she told me I could stay with her when I got back and look for a job.

I spent those two months evaluating what I wanted in life and what I was willing to do to get it. There was relaxing, reading, and generally I spent time thinking about life. Gung ho and ready to fight the good fight I came home. Then I met someone.

Haven’t met someone in years, and never anyone who was unequivocally worth trying for. All the other guys were just meh, sure, why not, nothing else around. This guy was something new, something real and it feels like something unknown, as if all the others were just practice. It doesn’t mean I am in love, it just illuminated how it can be, how it should be and showed me what I didn’t even know, but kind of felt, I was missing. 

I am broke, no job, living at my sister’s house, trying to get my foot in the door in an industry and town that are very unmoved and I like someone who seems to like me back, but I can’t be sure of his intensions. Horrible timing. I have nothing to stand on except the support of my family and friends. And it was enough for a while…

At first I was excited to try, to work really hard, hit the pavement and cold call, offer my services for free and research until my eyes bled. Now, I realize I am a mess and I feel like I am just lost. I am losing momentum with all the “maybes” I hear that float off into space leaving me wondering, waiting and unsure. I live in a world of uncertainty and it is making me lose my mind and heart. Can’t sleep, I have nightmares, I eat and feel sick, I am starting to questions things I know for sure because I am so unstable. Not sure how much longer I can take this before something in me snaps, or something in general snaps.

But maybe that’s what it is going to take before the balance shifts and something has to be done. I feel like I am losing it and I don’t know how much longer I can hold on with all this ambiguity in my life. I just need something to hold onto, something concrete, be it a job, a living situation or a relationship. I am floating into the void and my mind is starting to not be able to coop. Not sure how much longer I can hold it together before everyone around me start to see through to it. 

TLDR : Why didn't I just stay in my small, boring, predictable town. I am too old to be doing shit like this, I need some stability in my life.

1) With such a small student body, what is the social life like? 

2) Do you find it hard to find internships coming from a school with limited resources and almost no name recognition?

3) There seems to have been a bit of a kerfuffle a few years ago between the students and a few board members. Has that been resolved? I love the program but I don't want to go to Shimer only to have it close halfway through my fourth semester.

This place seems like a breath of fresh air.

Edit: Well, you Shimerians certainly enjoy writing. Thanks for all the wonderful information!  If only my parents were as stoked about Shimer as you guys, but I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too. Nevertheless, I will definitely be applying as soon as those recommendation letters are finished (wishful thinking).

First off I graduated in May with my MSW after a large break between receiving my B.S. in Counseling.  I also just finished my Play therapy Certification.  I have had two amazing internships through this process and the not so fun jobs in between as aids in MDS classrooms and as a TSS.  My internships helped me point out where I wanted to go with my degree and where absolutely amazing learning experiences.  I did a year a Schreiber Pediatric Rehabilitation Unit and a Year as a Play Therapist in a Creative arts and play therapy center.  Now that I am done with school I am faced with getting my license and getting a job.  That is where the Frustrations and Fears begin.
I studied hard with a colleague from my college for the LSW with both the NASW study guide and the bryn Mawr license prep study guide.  I was very nervous but felt confident as we both entered the room on exam day, only to end after 2 hours by failing by one question.  I felt defeated! But after my one day of moping I pushed passed and started the application phase all over for the exam again.  
In the mean time I began applying for jobs.  I can honestly say by this point I have applied for over 200 jobs and have had one interview.  Again the Frustration.  I HATE ONLINE APPLICATIONS.  There is no personal face to face anymore, which is ironic considering I am in the social work field.  
Sorry this is turning out to be quite long... TO get to the point.  Here are my questions and I would love any advice or help.
1.) I am facing my exam yet again in one month and am even more nervous than the first time.  Any additional advice anyone may have would be appreciated.
2.) I am desperately trying to get a job at the Children's hospital In philadelphia.  They have several social work positions open but I can not get past the online resume process.  I have all the qualification listed for the job requirement.  They do prefer LSW and Hospital experience but these are not required.  I have signed up to volunteer there and have my orientation in January as a hope to get my foot in the door.  I also hope that if I pass the exam this time that too may help my chances.  BUt my fear is that I will not make it past the denial of online submission. 
ANY ADVICE????"

I have a few friends left but no social life. I spend most of my time at home, just wasting away. The people I live with just get angry with me about it and while I understand I really don't know what else to do. I lost my last job because of poor performance (mostly due to depression) and I've quit all the activities that used to keep me out of of the house because I can no longer afford them. I'm reluctant to take another job because I just worry I'll either end up being fired or I'll get stuck doing a job I absolutely hate. I do mostly unpaid/volunteer work in another field that I do enjoy but I feel like it's going nowhere. I can't find another job in that field. I've been turned down for internships and I'm not experienced enough to get a paid job. I miss having someone I could really talk to about my problems who doesn't just avoid my questions or tell me to 'cheer up' (it's easier said then done!) anti depressants make me sick. Seeing a psychologist will cost too much money and I feel like I get treated like a child in those sessions. I've bought self help books but they don't seem to 'stick'. I had a friend who I could relate to but he's abandoned me. I hate myself, my life and what I've become. I just want to leave and go overseas where noone knows me but its extremely difficult when you're not earning enough money to save and it's actually been really difficult to find a job (I have been looking, despite my concerns about keeping the job)

I know I need to motivate myself but I just can't seem to do it. I don't even know what advice I want, I just wish someone would give me the answer on what I'm supposed to do with my life.

He doesn't play much since he's turning in his thesis at the end of this semester, so that could change.  He hates apple, loves Linux.  He's modest, never flashy.

What do I do?,mutuallybrokenheart,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14l848/my_boyfriend_m23_and_i_f22_just_broke_off_our/,"We started dating at the end of his senior year of college and have been dating for a year and a half. He moved back home after he graduated which is only an hour away. For most of our relationship we would take turns traveling to see one another every weekend. However, this being my senior year in college has turned out to be very demanding on me where I am required to do lab work on the weekends and cannot travel to see him as often. He has recently gotten a job in which he sometimes has to go in on the weekend and hasn't been able to visit me as often. 
Next semester is going to be even harder to see each other since I will be taking 23 credits (under special circumstances) and he will still be working at his job as well as going to school and captaining a team.

We mutually broke up this afternoon after talking about what trying to see one another will be like in the next few months. This made sense at the time because we are both run down and stressed in our own lives and trying to make time to talk on the phone/skype has caused us both to lose sleep and hence made doing our daily tasks harder.

Here's the kicker, I have been planning to move right by his town after I graduate independent of him living there (made these plans prior to dating him). This would be immediately after I graduate in order to do a summer internship that I have been dying to do. I would only be moving there for the summer and would then be moving home which is much further away. He knows of these plans and we were always excited about living in the same area again and getting to see one another more than on the weekends/ once every other week. We also discussed what would happen once I had moved home and agreed that would be too far of distance for either of us to extend our relationship financially and emotionally and would end in us breaking up.

I did feel at first that us breaking up would make life a little easier in the next coming months without having to dedicate time aside to talk to him and visit him but I can't help feeling now that we are giving up. I know we are not getting married or anything and that there is an expiration date on our relationship but I really feel as if we should fight through the next few months in order to get to the summer, where we will be a normal distance relationship and be able to exhaust for the day in each other's company for the first time since we just started dating.

We love each other so much and trust each other as well. We don't fight often and when we do it is usually stemmed from the fact that we miss each other and are just misplacing the stress of not seeing each other. What do you fellow redditors think I should do in this situation? Should I let him go, or convince him to fight through the next couple of months with me to live this ride out to it's fullest extent before it has to end?

Thanks in advance

It’s nice to be able to talk about this somewhere.   I don’t think there was any one moment for me. When I was in my late teens / early twenties the first several dozen times I had sex were awful because the band at the base of my dick would leave a black &amp; blue bruise around my shaft.  Sex was awful for me.  I couldn’t keep it up because it hurt and honestly felt like the life was being choked out of my dick.  To this day if I’m rock hard, and put a condom on, within one minute I’m going limp, those early experiences conditioned me to literally fear condoms.  I didn’t put two &amp; two together at that point though.   I knew the average dick was 5.5” or something like that, so I had measured it, and saw that I was average, 5.5” on the nose.  I didn’t realize the 5.5” average was for an erection until about 8 years later. Stop me if this sounds familiar, but as I hit my twenties I would watch porn, especially amateur, and read the comment sections of the videos and read comments about the guy in it being hung like a tripod, and to me it just looked like a normal dick.  

My moment, or moments, came in my mid-twenties when I started having sex with more girls and I kept hearing about how big it was.  I still never believed much of it though; I thought they were flattering me.  I was always feeling like I was one girl saying it was small from feeling like shit about it.   I mean, because I grew up with it, it’s not like I woke up one day and it was 3” bigger than it was the night before.  Then I had a friend of mine come visit me one day, and we ended up having sex.   When she saw my dick all she said was, “Whoah if I had known you had that we would’ve done this years ago”.  

After that I had a streak of three or four girls where I needed lubricant for it to be entirely comfortable for the girl, even with heavy foreplay. I had one girl tell me “You’d be horrible for a girls’ first time, you’re just too big”.  Great.   Tooth scrape was common.   I remember one time at an internship this very sexually ‘liberated’ girl was a fellow intern and we’d chat online at night.  She commented that she knew I must be thick because of how big the bulge in my khakis was, “That comes from girth, if you were long &amp; thin it wouldn’t be like that”.   I didn’t realize it was that obvious. I’m in very good shape as is, so I have a small waist, and a big ass, so it’s hard enough to find pants that fit, let alone looking for ones that fit with enough coverage in the front.   Still I don’t know if I entirely believe how big I am.  I measure it every now and then just to see if I made a mistake the last time, but it’s always the same.  The funny thing is, the few girls I’ve had sex with who didn’t think it was long/thick as fuck, I wonder about them. I wonder how many guys they’ve fucked, that what I have doesn’t seem above average.   

Over the last year I’ve really come to terms with it though.  I met my current girlfriend about 8 months ago, and the sex on a scale of 1-10 has been an 11.  She always comments that the girth is unlike anything she has had before and she can still feel me pulsing in her hours after we’re finished.  Plus the fact that we need lube of some sort every time, and she still bleeds on occasion really drives the point home.  She’s great though, she loves the girth, loves getting stretched, and I can go balls-deep in her.   We fuck for hours.   She even manages to not have any teeth scrape when going down on me, roughly 75% of the time, which is great because I love finishing in a girl’s mouth.  She comments that it gags her, but she just keeps going. I love that. There’s no doubt in my mind at this point that she’s telling the truth when she says it’s the biggest most satisfying cock she’s had.    

Anyway, sorry to ramble I just don’t know who else to talk about this with.   So when was your “aha!” moment, or moments?

14oj44,22,2012-12-11,Manic depressive bf is ruining my life,brokegimpyheart,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14oj44/manic_depressive_bf_is_ruining_my_life/,"**TL;DR at bottom**

I'm 25 years old. I've loved my bf (26) for two years and have stuck with him through thick and thin, through amazing times and rough low points. We moved to a different city together after dating for six months, and after a few more I noticed he would get really depressed and angry in what almost seemed like a pattern. He told me he thought he might be manic depressive and I said I'd support him in any way I could. We were still very happy and his episodes only made us closer as he was open to me helping him calm down.

Everything seemed fine until I got pregnant. We wanted to get married and have children, just not any time soon. We're still both in college and aren't financially ready. I also had a sever problem down there that would make pregnancy difficult and could endanger my life. Instead of being supportive, he got manic and it made the decision to terminate the pregnancy easier... in a sense. I had to wait a month after the abortion to have surgery to remove cancer down there as well, something I developed from a disease he gave me... he didn't know he was a carrier - or so he says. And I'll be at a higher risk of miscarriage if I become pregnant again in the future.

My body was depleted and I felt miserable, the only thing holding me together was that he was still by my side and hadn't been manic since the moment we first found out. I got us tickets to see one of our favorite bands and we went out for a while, even though I was recovering. We had a great night, oddly as I found something horrible out later.

A few days later I was signing us up for an event we wanted to go to and I needed to verify his email. I was using his computer, so I just logged in to accept the invitation when I noticed a suspicious email fresh in his inbox. It was forwarded to him from another email. It was the name of where we live and his favorite number so I new it was an alt account. Being a dectective, I logged into the other email with his known regular password, which confirmed it was his. I noticed replies to a craigslist ad which I traced to his original post on the site. He had posted a missed connection from the concert saying ""to the girl in the red hat: I was there with someone else, but it shouldve been you... let's fix that"".... I was shocked and heartbroken... I caught him red handed trying to cheat on me. He'd never shown any signs of anything like this and I spent almost every hour of everyday with him and we were always really happy unless he was manic. I couldn't believe he would do such a thing after everything we had just been through - through what he put me through. I told him I was leaving him and that he made a huge mistake, he felt awful and didn't know why he did it - he said he was in some sort of fantasy world where he thought he was leading a double life... he swore he'd never cheated and that he wasnt going to. I left out of town on a scheduled trip, and discussed it with him when I got back.

He cried and begged me to stay, he told me he was afraid of commitment and that our ordeal had scared him but that seeing me leave made him realize what he really wants - to be with me for the rest of his life. He swore he'd do anything to make it up to me, to work on himself and to never stray again. I was reluctant but I told him the only thing he could do is to seek help for his mental illness and to follow through with it. He promised and we worked it out, finding a counselor suitable for him and our wallets within a month. He went to two sessions with the counselor before I went to see her myself. We then had a joint session and we talked about the ordeal, his emotions and how it hurts me. I learned how to be more supportive of him when he was manic and he learned that it's not his fault he lashes out, but to try and remember that it's not real. He cried and felt terrible. I thought it really helped, but then he never went to see the counselor again. He would promise me he was going and I'd set up an appointment, then when the time came he'd curl up in a ball in bed and cry and say he didnt want to go. I felt bad for him, that he was having to confront this issue, but I went without him. I needed the support to deal with him. Eventually the counselor wasn't doing much more than being an ear to talk to since he wouldn't come to the meetings so I stopped going as well.

You would think I'd have left him then, but he wasn't that unbearable and he was trying to make changes without a counselor- so I stayed with him. 

I had an accident and hurt my ankle very badly and ended up being in a boot for several months. Being unable to work another job, it was frustrating when we found out my job at the college would no longer pay me and I would only get a small stipend at the end of the semester (which I'm still awaiting). I started looking for other jobs I could do from home or that wouldn't require me to be on my feet, but I was turned down or others were filled before I had a chance. He was not happy that I wasn't bringing in much money, but he promised to take care of me... until he was manic again.

When it was time to move, he became manic and argued with me over everything including but not limited to me microwaving a bowl of soup without covering it. Even when I apologized for things profusely (which I shouldn't have had to) he wouldn't accept it and would get even worse. He no longer was open to me resolving issues and wanted to continue the harassment and berating... it was almost as if he liked it or that he was bored. He would say horrible things and then apologize for them later. Sometimes he'd try to break up with me over something so insignificant and small, but I would try my hardest to calm him and bring him back to reality. Sometimes he'd cry and tell me I deserved much better than him, that he was broken but I told him I loved him no matter what. He told me when the lease was up that he was moving without me, and me being handicapped and without a paying job would be on on the street. I couldn't just shrug this off as I had other horrible things he'd say while angry and depressed... I was truly worried. I had to get his mom to calm him down. He finally did and apologized to me, saying he was never going to actually do it and that he loved me. We talked about me moving out when I could get back on my feet b/c it might be better for us. After a few weeks of things being happy and normal, I mentioned moving out again and he cried and said he wanted me to stay.

Fast forward to last month... it turns out I needed to have surgery on my ankle. This would take me completely off of my feet for at least a month and a half but it needed to be done. I got a really good job as an intern, but my first month is a trial period and I would start getting paid at the end. He said he was fine with that and excited for me and he promised he'd take care of me after the surgery.

A few days before the surgery we got into an argument over the phone and he broke up with me via text message. I gave him some space, but then we talked a few days later for a long time and resolved the issue. He cried and said he didn't want to have to worry about anyone else and that he need to be alone to work on himself. Nothing I was doing was stopping him from bettering himself or seeking therapy, and I explained that to him. He agreed that he acted rashly and that he still wants to be with me. We agreed we needed space, but that I would have to stay with him until I was back on my feet after the surgery. He still promised to take care of me.

The surgery came and went and he hardly took care of me. It was a week before I bathed because I couldnt get him to help me. He screamed and yelled at me for asking for a ride to work, which was something he promised to do, and berated me the entire hour long drive in traffic as i sat there silently taking it not knowing what to do or say. Later I told him I was upset with him for treating me like that and he was calm so he knew it was wrong and apologized, but the next day it got worse. He broke up with me again.... over a text message again .... and told me I had to be gone from the aparment when he got home that night. I couldnt drive so that was not an option. He is the only one on the lease since I was planning on moving, and he thought he could have the police remove me by force. I called them to find out the law and they said he can't do that since I have established residence. When he got home he was enraged that I was still there and said he was calling the cops, I did instead and they came and explained the laws to us. He was pissed at me, so after the left he kept slamming things and throwing my clothes everywhere. I locked myself in the bedroom to get away and he bodyslammed the door open throwing me across the room. We were on a family plan under his name so he shut off my cell phone and removed the router so I had no way of contacting anyone. He also cancelled my credit card to our account and took the food stamps card from my wallet. I have been in a physically abusive relationship before and he knew that, and being scared for my safety I called the police back again. They asked him to sleep on the couch for the night or try to stay at a friend's house and they asked him nicely to turn my phone back on.

He started packing his bag to leave, but looked for any excuse to stay and scream at me. He took trash bags and filled them with all of the food in our house in the fridge and pantry and planned on leaving me there stranded without communication or food. I begged him to leave some food and he left with it... later I found out he threw it away. He also took the books I needed to study for my finals and would not give them to me. He broke down and started crying while packing and said he wanted to talk. We talked and he said he wished things hadn't gone this way and that he wanted to see if we could act more civil. I said he need to turn my phone on and leave me some food and we could talk. We came to an agreement that we would no longer date at all - serious or having space - we would end it there but we needed to be amicable until I could move or at least walk.

I haven't left the apartment for almost two weeks now. I only had food from a friend coming over on her only day off to bring me groceries. I've been drugged up from meds and haven't had the books to study or complete my final assignments, not to mention the time taken up by every argument or fight. He has been friendly sometimes and is at least taking my dog out to go to the bathroom since I can't, but otherwise he's mostly not here. He goes out drinking at night or after work and comes home angry and raging at me. I try my hardest not to get involved, but I'm emotionally and physically vulnerable. I know I should just not talk to him, but it hurts so bad that this person I love is treating me so badly... especially when I need help to take care of myself. It's gotten to the point where I feel I have to record all of our conversation just in case he gets violent. When he found that out, he harassed me and demanded I give him the phone until I was scared and let him have it. He deleted everything and started to leave with it and the router and the cables to the computer.... I begged him to give it back and he started screaming and we argued so loud the neighbors called the cops.

This being the third time they were here, they asked if either of us could stay at a friend's house. I told them I couldn't drive and my only friend left works everyday and lives very far away - after he went out drinking with our small group of friends and lied about the entire situation. He decided he would leave, but after the cops left he didnt and only slept on the couch. I don't understand - if he really hated me and wants to be away from me like he says, then why would he stay home when he could easily drive anywhere else.

On Sunday, we argued again about when I would get out of here - even though he knows I'm doing everything I can - I just can't walk. He wrote up a paper asking me to vacate the premises within three days.... which is physically and financially impossible for me right now. I told him he had to file it with the justice of the peace and it had to be a 30 day notice as per what the police officers told us. He argued and said I had to be out, so I called the police again and discussed the law over the phone once more. While on speaker phone the lady explained to him he had to file it with the court and he began yelling and arguing with me again so she said she had no option but to send the police again. I said we didn't need them, but she insisted she had to. He was so upset with me after this he again took the router and computer cables and left for a friend's house.

A coworker picked me up on the way to work yesterday and it was nice getting out for a bit, but I had to stay home today b/c I have a doctors appt about my ankle. I had to do work from home, so my mom called and begged him to bring back the cables and the router. He finally did, but has been berating me all day. I don't have much help, but a friend of a friend offered to take me to the doctor today and I'm grateful. But I'm so worried about the rest of the week or two that I can't drive... my coworkers can pick me up from work only from here since its on the way, otherwise my friend that helps me lives way to far away and she works everyday and could not get me to work.

I don't think there's anything I can do to get him to calm down, and I just want to get out of here, but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I can't walk... I don't have a bank account b/c we shared one which now means I don't have any money. All of the furniture in the house is mine, except his computer and the tv and even when I can start to drive, I won't be able to move it (physically or financially). Once I leave here, I won't have a computer either and I use the computer to work (I'm a writer and work with social media). I'm scared to be here b/c he can come home and go crazy again at any minute but then I'm scared to leave b/c I won't be able to work or go into my job or work, nor do I have anywhere to go where people can help take care of me. I need help showering, I need someone to bring me food and I need help taking my dog out but I cant hire anyone either... I'm just stuck, miserable and heartbroken and I need a hug... but I'm all alone at home and there's nothing I can do about it now.


**TL;DR My manic depressive serious boyfriend/now exboyfriend hurts me emotionally/financially/indirectly physically (not violence... yet) at times when he should be more supportive. This time I'm handicapped from surgery and he's trying to kick me out of the aparment. I have no where to go, no money and can't walk... I'm stuck, scared and miserable.**


*****

**EDIT: My parents moved out of state and I don't have any family anywhere near me. Most of my friends live hours away since we moved to a different city together over a year ago and my only friend that isn't part of the small circle he's alienated me from works every day and can't take care of me/take me to work/etc. I'm in Austin, Tx for those who asked.

I had a doctor's appt yesterday and she said I shouldn't drive for another 2 weeks. For now he's staying at a friend's place and I'm staying at home, my coworkers pick me up for work almost every day but other than that I'm sort of trapped at home.

If I left and went to stay somewhere else, I wouldn't be able to get a ride to work (I live on the way right now for my coworkers &amp; my job is an hour away). I also wouldn't have a computer to work off of (unless I went to work) since he is keeping his PC. I'm trying to get together some money for one right now and I should start getting paid from my job next week. Once I can drive, I'm going to go stay at my friend's place but I don't know how or where I'm going to move my furniture to.

I'm supposed to start doing physical therapy 2x a week but I don't know how I'm going to get there for now

I was working as an unpaid intern at an IT place (let's call them ShitCompany). I worked in a team environment, and the team leader didn't seem to know what he was talking about 90% of the time (we'll call him Dick). I put in over 300 hours of free work for this company, with the promise of a job offer constantly being dangled in front of me to keep me working harder. Well Dick didn't like that I was starting to bond with some members of the support team (everyone on the team hated Dick), and constantly assigned me projects that went nowhere. Like an idiot, I didn't question what I was told to do, but just did it.

Now Dick has no business working in IT. The problems he struggled with are problems that any entry-level tech should be able to fix. For example when working at client sites, he constantly didn't set a static IP so the team was unable to remote in, requiring another tech to go onsite to fix Dick's mistakes.

Well Dick ends up giving me a task that was set up to fail from the start. When I consulted with the other team members, none of them understood what or why I was working on this project. So the first step on this project was to DBAN this entire rack of servers. I asked Dick and wanted to confirm with him that the servers didn't have important information on them. He confirmed and he ordered me to run DBAN and permanently erase all data on this rack of servers. I did. The next day when I come in the manager that hired me on for my internship told me that I had deleted one of their client's data, and that they will no longer need me. They took my badge and told me not to come back. I tried defending myself by telling him that Dick said it was fine, but apparently Dick can do no wrong and that I must have misunderstood.

Fine, I left and tried to brush it off. Now this place was the only real-world work experience I had in IT. I busted my ass for this company for 4 months with a job offer being dangled in front of me constantly, only for them to ""let me go"" without a second guess as to Dick's competency. Whatever, fine, I'll find another job that actually will pay me. So I go on a few interview, and absolutely NAIL this one interview for helpdesk. I know I nailed it since they wanted to hire me on asap. I had put my ShitCompany reference in my resume, which they then decided to follow up on.

So my previous manager was talking to one of my co-workers that I had befriended when he gets a phone call. She left, but decided to eavesdrop once she heard my name. As it turns out, Dick completely lied about my performance and told management that I was late every day and wasn't fit to work in IT, which led to a horrible reference for the job that I almost had! Needless to say, I didn't get it, and now I have an employment hole of 4 months on my resume since I can't use ShitCompany as a work history any more.

Help me get revenge on ShitCompany, and Dick. What can I do? The building is secured, and I can no longer get into the building. I don't know what kind of car Dick drives, or the management that screwed me over. The owner of the company makes fucking bank (drives a bentley), while running a ""non-profit"" company that provides tech support at $200 an hour to other ""non-profit"" organizations; and I can't even make enough money to pay back my student loans! Help me get revenge!

14oc05,7,2012-12-11,My [19f] boyfriend [20m] of 8 months asked another girl if she's interested in him.,throwaway2320384,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14oc05/my_19f_boyfriend_20m_of_8_months_asked_another/,"I'm using a throwaway because he diligently stalks my reddit account and while I mentioned that I've been considering posting here, I think I'd prefer to read through what everyone says before he gets to argue with people's responses.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 8 months, and it's been known to me prior to our relationship that when he drinks a lot he doesn't know when to stop and he can make some bad decisions. We've had a few problems in our relationship, but this weekend I kind of thought things were getting better. Once when we were having sex he told me something along the lines that I'm perfect and he doesn't deserve me. Also, we've been discussing the possibility of me following him to Germany for a semester while he does an internship. I'd be studying abroad and it's unlikely that we'd be in the same place, but the same country is still better than different countries.

Saturday was where the problems really began. We had plans to go on a ""date"" to a burger joint (we're a little too poor for really nice dates) and he went day drinking with his friends, I understood him spending time with his friends and I kind of figured that I'd drive us to go get food and that I'd deal with him being drunk, and then he would spend time with his friends again after our date. Instead, he asks me right before I was planning to go if we could reschedule, I agree though make it clear that I'm upset he stood me up. 

He asked if I was going out that night and I said ""idk"" and then keeps asking me if our friend is having a pregame party, I tell him that I don't know and then when I found out he was, I sent him a text saying as much. A friend of mine then comes to my room and says she's headed to said pregame party (J's) to find out a story from a friend of ours, so I said that I would go with her. 

I walk into J's house and immediately see my boyfriend hitting on two girls. He doesn't notice me for ten minutes and when I walk past him to go to the bathroom he stops talking to the girls and starts kind of spending time with me, and telling some people that I'm his ""girl"" (something he only does when he's drunk, like he's declaring me as his property) and isn't hiding the fact that we're in a relationship to the girls he had been flirting with either, so I figure it was harmless flirting. 

We go to a party, I'm completely sober because I was still hungover from the night before and my boyfriend is already completely wasted. We're standing outside the party while he smokes 4 cigarettes in a row crying about his grandfather who died back in March. Had we been at his apartment I would have been very supportive of this and spoken to him, but I'll be honest that I was really embarrassed to be standing with him outside of the party while he's telling strangers about how the man who practically raised him is dead. 

We finally go inside and he manages to get a free cup and basically goes straight to the keg and doesn't leave it. At this point his ignoring me is starting to bother me because when he's ignoring me for his friends, I understand, but I was standing around with his best friend really lost and abandoned in a basement full of strange drunk men hitting on me. I finally go to him and he tells me that since I'm not having a good time I should just go and hands me his keys, his best friend explains that he wants to go to the bars and that he'll walk me back, but my boyfriend refills his cup so I end up walking back alone. It's only two blocks from the party to his apartment, but he always makes a big deal about how he never wants me walking around alone. He does text me asking if I got back okay. I say yes. 

At 1am I text him reminding him that he has work at 10, he then immediately calls me to tell me he made out with S. S is our gay friend. My boyfriend made out with a guy. Behind my back. I get upset and tell him that even though he isn't gay, he made out with someone that wasn't me, and that it was cheating. Then he shows up a few minutes later, texting away and completely drunk out of his mind. He proceeds to puke and pass out. Because he broke my trust by making out with someone behind my back, I get the urge to go through his phone. I know that that isn't something I should do, but the trust was broken. And apparently rightfully so, because I found text messages to a girl, K. 

&gt;Boyfriend: Where did you go?

&gt;K: Home, I'm tired ):

&gt;Boyfriend: Are you interested in me?

&gt;K: Ur drunk!!!!

&gt;Boyfriend: Can I talk to you later?

K is a girl he had an interest in before our relationship, I think it's been almost a year since he first started being interested in her, and she lead him on back then before making it fairly clear she wasn't interested. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't know her very well either, they don't really talk outside of parties and she's one of those girls that gets outrageously drunk (like him, I guess) she's very pretty, but he also mentions about how fat she's gotten since last semester.

I'm hurt, for many reasons, and he and I have had a lot of discussions but I feel as though he must be more interested in her than he is in me otherwise, why would he ever try? I'm also convinced that if she had said yes, he either would have cheated or left me for her. He told me that none of this is true, that he was thinking about me the whole time (obviously, he was in the same room as me, and he clearly wasn't thinking about how hurt I'd be). He told me that I have every right to break up with him, and that if that's my choice he'd understand, but he said it'd be better if I didn't. 

He has a lot of problems with himself, and I think he wants me to direct him at how to be a better boyfriend, I told him to treat me like he thinks I deserve to be treated, but he doesn't seem to understand that. I think I'm good to him, he admits that I do too much for him when he doesn't really do anything for me.

I think I'm here mainly for guidance. Reddit, I need help!

**tl;dr** my boyfriend of 8 months got incredibly drunk, made out with another guy, and texted a girl he's been interested in for a year about whether or not she was interested in him. he claims he wants to fix things but doesn't know how."

I've got to say, you've all inspired me to change, to stop hating myself and to start becoming someone I love. So during the last 5 month, after I got cheated on by the girl I was with 6 1/2 years, I set myself some goals.
Until now I've:

-lost weight - check

-get in shape - 100 pushup every morning, gym every sunday, taekwondo every friday, so under way.

-got back in touch with some friends - check

-changed my wardrobe - nearly check

-started a web site to show case my photography - going slower and slower as it progress

-started a ""one picture a day"" project - lost track of it

-take improv class - missed two classes but I keep pushing myself

-took the habit of keeping my flat clean - un-check

-become charismatic - check, if my role model was a bit of dirt

-stop watching porn - I'm struggling with this (reason why my last relationship went down the shitter)

-meet girls - nope

-make new friends - niet

-be appreciated at my internship because I'm well integrated and work well - nada

-become good at drawing things - nope

-become good at playing the guitar - I try to pick it up every day, but I don't see that much progress

I find myself spending more and more evenings doing nothing in front of my computer, forgetting all the things I wanted to do during the work day.
Even if I note them down, I don't feel the same motivation I had during the day.

I feel as if I'm reverting to my old self, and even if I'm getting over my break-up, I feel worse as time goes by, because I'm nowhere near the person I would like to be.
I find it hard to organize myself to be productive without my personal projects feeling like a chore.

I know I'm trying to do a lot of things, But I was sleepwalking my life until now, and I want to make up for the time I wasted, I've got nothing to be proud of during the last 10 years of my life, nothing that would make me interesting, nothing that could have build my character.
How the hell do you turn your life around?"
14njcg,2,2012-12-11,Is it a bad idea for me [22f] to be good friends with my ex [21m]? ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14njcg/is_it_a_bad_idea_for_me_22f_to_be_good_friends/,"We dated for 2 years in college. I'm a year older. It was a very passionate relationship. We truly loved each other a lot and were inseparable for most of that time. He even payed to visit me for only 3 days when I was studying abroad in Europe. We talked about marriage, kids, living together, the whole shebang.

About 1 year into the relationship, my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. This affected me a lot. I became extremely moody, depressed, and lashed out at my friends and boyfriend. I would cry almost every time I got drunk, which I was doing a lot, and would often scream at my boyfriend. He put up with it for a while, but I could tell it was taking its toll. 

Then, miraculously, my mother got better (thanks to a rare clinical trial). However, the problems with my boyfriend did not. He was still bitter about the fights we used to have, and was still very immature. He was obsessed with his fraternity, quite flirtatious with other girls, and got mad at me when I didn't want to go to frat parties. I was working 2 internships and about to graduate college. Eventually, we decided it wasn't working and that we were just different people, in different places in our lives. It was a very mutual and calm breakup.  

We didn't talk at all for about a month after that. Then, he started texted me once every few weeks, then about once a week. The texts were friendly, mostly ""how is your mom"" and ""how are classes going"", stuff like that. We met for coffee to catch up, it was very normal and not weird at all.

This week, he asked to study with me, and I agreed because it's been a while since we've hung out. We get along really well as friends because the other issues don't matter. We studied for a few hours and chatted, and it was fun and friendly. He payed for my meals and took me to get ice cream after, but then we said our goodbyes and hugged goodnight. We are planning on meeting up again tomorrow.

 I like to be friends with him, but I'm worried that it's holding me back from moving on. I probably won't be dating any other guys as long as we are being friendly like this, because most would find it weird if I was still talking to my ex. However, there are a few new boys I have been talking to and I've definitely not been holding back when it comes to dating. 

So my question is, is it ok for me to be friends with my ex, or will it hold me back from exploring new relationships? 

tl;dr: Been hanging out with my ex of 2 years. We broke up on good terms. Is it wrong to hang out with him or is it holding me back? "

Just wrapping up my first semester with exams, classes are done for me. I have had an alright time here, I have met a decent number of people, most of whom I get along with. I am not a very outgoing person and I feel like I can be hard to get along with at times, on the rare occasion that I do go out to talk to people. I usually just keep to myself or talk to people that I already know. I have been doing very well my first semester, with all A's and B's.

The problem is, I am not happy here, and I am not sure if I would be happier anywhere else. I can't really pinpoint why, because I have no reason to be unhappy. I have lived a pretty easy life. Aside from my mom's alcoholism, my family has had few problems; we have never had financial problems, and my education is being paid with zero loans, which in itself should be motivation enough to stay in school. However, I feel like I am not accomplishing anything. I am in school now as a general education student and I am working to get into the Engineering program at my school, Mechanical specifically. I believe I can do it, I just didn't get in initially because I didn't do too well in high school due to my lack of effort. I'm taking decently hard classes right now, and frankly am kicking ass at them, which is good. However, about 6 weeks ago, I was thinking very seriously about killing myself. I had it all planned out how I would do it, and was very close to carrying it out, and I probably would have had several friends not called me immediately. What I think happened was a bunch of regrets from past relationships swarmed around my mind at once, and I felt terrible about it. I had several very meaningful relationships that I ended prematurely because I was bored, and I am an asshole.

I have always loved doing things with my hands; building stuff and working on cars. I fucking love working on my car, an old BMW. The happiest I have ever been was during senior year of high school, when I spent my spare time building sets for the theater department and restoring a car in my own time and budget for a senior project. I was just happy all the time and felt great about myself because of how well everything turned out that I had made myself. Second to that was the summer after senior year of high school, where I was working in IT as an intern making decent money with minimal work, working on my newly-purchased classic Bimmer on weeknights and weekends, and hanging out with my long-time, close friends on the weekends. 

Come college, I didn't know a single person upon arrival. I quickly befriended a few people I could get along with, so that made things better. I never really have had any trouble with classes or keeping my grades up, but despite my doing well academically, I have felt horrible pretty much all the time. I met with a counselor following my strong thoughts of suicide, and he is determined, and has convinced me that I have ""Pure-O"" OCD, which is OCD but without the weird physical compulsions like checking the door locks 10 times or whatever. It is purely mental, and basically consists of me getting extremely bothered by something that shouldn't bother me, locking on that subject and thinking about ridiculous scenarios until I am a mental wreck. This has been bothering me a lot, and the psychiatrist suggested that when I used to work on / build things all the time, this basically took my mind off of everything that was bothering me and made me feel a lot better all the time. Since I am unable to do anything like fix my car or build something here, I feel terrible, in a nutshell. 

So basically, would it be a horrible idea to drop out of college (perhaps temporarily) and pursue what actually makes me happy? I just love working on things and using my hands to build or fix things. I have been at my happiest when I am able to do so regularly, and I can't do that here. For starters, I have always wanted to buy a used school bus for cheap, gut it and create a mobile home, and travel the country. I love restoring and working on cars, but I went to school because I typically think of myself as smart, and I thought I would like engineering, and it would pay better than being a mechanic. My dream is to work for or found a car restoration shop. However, I really hate school, and I don't think I will ever like it. However, I have an opportunity now to go without loans, with my parents paying it in full and I feel like I am throwing away a massive opportunity by dropping out, even if it means being happy. Am I a fool for wanting to drop out of school and pursue my dreams, or is it the right thing to do?

TL;DR, I hate college, I don't think I will ever like it, and am seeking advice on what I should do."
14mxxk,1,2012-12-10,Can I sit for the CPA exam in a different state?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/14mxxk/can_i_sit_for_the_cpa_exam_in_a_different_state/,"Hey guys,

Right now I am a senior in college (US), planning to participate in an internship this Spring and begin grad school in the fall. 

What I would like to do is take one or two parts of the CPA exam over the summer (2013). The problem is that I will not be eligible to sit for the exam in North Carolina until the end of August 2013, which is where I go to school and will want to get licensed (Charlotte office).

My question is if I can sit for one or two parts in a different state, such as Tennessee (where I will be eligible), even though I do not plan to be licensed there? A quick google search doesn't bring up anything official, and before contacting any sort of government bodies I wanted to see if anyone on here had an idea. 

Thanks in advance!"
14mw4t,9,2012-12-10,[m/24]  Long list of things that I hated about her.  Helped me to cope after one month.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/14mw4t/m24_long_list_of_things_that_i_hated_about_her/,"This makes her look like a terrible person, which she is not, but it has helped...

You never completely trusted me.  Throughout our four years together, you proved over and over again that you didn't trust me in different ways.  Whether it was a simple trust fall, or to bring something of yours with me, you always acted like I wouldn't come through for you.  I can honestly say that when it comes to those who I love, I will move heaven and earth to keep a promise and to protect their livelihood.

You were terrible at communicating.  Any time you went out with friends, it was like I had to pry very minor details out of you.  I never suspected that you were cheating, but it's like you didn't understand that when you go out with a girl, her boyfriend, and another guy, that puts me a little on edge.  And when you add the fact that I had to ask at least twice just to find out who you were with, it not only made me feel like 'super jealous boyfriend,' but it proved that you don't understand how to put someone else's mind at ease.

You made virtually no effort to be in the same city as me.  After two years apart, you applied to just one school in New York.  That school also happened to be the best school in the country for classical music.  There are at least two other schools that you could have gotten into here, but you didn't even send a demo CD to try and get an audition.  I should have known then that your commitment to our relationship was nonexistent.

You sucked at making me feel better.  Whenever you had a bad day or a bad lesson, I would remind you that no one is as committed as you and that you rock.  Whenever I had a bad day, you would tell me what I did wrong and that I should fix it.  I told you several times that's not what I wanted to hear, and to just tell me it's ok, but you never listened.  I know that I should have done things differently, but sometimes people just want to hear something positive after a shitty day, especially from a loved one.

After you moved, you made a new best friend immediately.  I truly believe that she played a big role in your leaving me.  I may be wrong, but it seemed like she deliberately drove a wedge between you and me, and got you questioning us.  While it was ultimately your decision to leave and I blame you 100%, it just sucks that you listened to someone you had known for two months before your boyfriend of four years, plus a friendship between us for another year.  Remember what happened last time you made a BFF after a month?? She turned out to be a bitch and stole your shit.  I'd be lying if I said that I hope the outcome will be different this time.  Sidenote: real friends tell you things that are hard to hear because they care about you.  I get the impression that your new 'friend' is just telling you what you want to hear because it's easy, and that makes you happy because you feel good about yourself.

You never made an effort to see me on important days.  There was always some excuse.  'My parents won't let me come back from home just to see you on your birthday,' or, 'I have to meet my cousin in New York so I can't come to your graduation.'  Again, I should have seen that as a sign that you were not committed to us.  I still have never had a New Years kiss.

You hate dancing.  Who hates dancing? You just drink a few drinks and let yourself go.  No one gives a fuck how ridiculous you look.  My friends were kind enough to invite you to their wedding when they barely invited me and you just sat the whole time.  Who does that?

You assume that if things are meant to be, they will just happen.  Seriously?  What that is good in your life has just fallen into your lap? Me, I guess.  But when it came down to it, that's what you said to me.  Nothing that I have achieved that is worthwhile has 'just happened.'  I work my ass off, even though you don't think so, to put myself in the position to be where I want to be.

You are so naive about life, even though truth is right in front of you.  Do you think what I do is easy?  I'm sorry that at 24 years old I am not a master of my craft yet, but that is hard to do, especially when I work in a freelance field where there is no explanation of what I have to do to succeed.  In the past year I have started a business, worked my way up from intern to assistant manager, and started getting a good amount of returning clients who request me by name.  If that is not the definition of moving along in a career, then I don't know what is.  You, in the meantime, have continued school, still live off your parents with no job, and assume that once you graduate from music school you can find a good paying job at a reputable orchestra.  Do you know how rare those kind of gigs are with the state of the music industry today? I work with people who do orchestra gigs, and they have to maintain at least a few other consistent gigs just to pay rent.  I don't know if you are scared about finding a job or just don't think about it, but I do know you are going to be thrown into it when you graduate, so you better get your shit together and fast.

Lastly, you never even had a discussion with me about what was wrong.  One day we were fine, and the next day you left.  No 'here's why I am unhappy,' no, 'let's try to fix this.'  You were just gone.  After four years together, you decided I was of no more use to you and you left me.  Where was I when you were feeling depressed in your last school? I was on the phone with you or physically there with you because I hated seeing you like that.  Where were you when I needed someone to bring me out of my funk? Gone.  Probably off fucking some other guy who you deserve at this point.  I hope he breaks your heart, then maybe you can get a glimpse of what the past month has been like for me."
14qxoe,4,2012-12-12,"Looking for experience/advice moving abroad with partner after knowing partner for short time [21m (me), 25f]",Beorn_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14qxoe/looking_for_experienceadvice_moving_abroad_with/,"Me (21m) and my girlfriend (25f) have been dating for 3 months now, and it's absolutely going great. However, we're both going to go on an internship in about 1 year, and we both want to do it abroad. This would be for about 5-7 months.

We've been talking about going to the same country together. Luckily we already both have the same countries in mind, Australia or New Zealand. The problem is that, due to the time it costs to get a placement and VISA we need to decide fairly soon (within the next 2-3 months, maybe sooner) if we want to do this. 
The plan would be to find the same city, but different institutes to work at. The rest of the details (like living together, which we both think we won't do) we can think about after we figured this out. 

Now, I'm absolutely crazy about her and that part of me definitely says yes to this plan, but at the same time I'm very aware that we've known each other for a very short time and that there can be lots of difficulties with it. 

I'm not looking for advice if I should or shouldn't do it. Sometime soon, me and my gf are going to talk about it, and we're now both busy making our minds up about it. So I'm hoping that there are people here who were in the same situation, and can tell me what considerations they had, what problems they faced etc.

So, if you've been in a situation where you moved far away with your partner, what were your major points of consideration? Once you moved, where did you have problems? What should we consider beforehand when making our decision? 

**tl;dr** I'm thinking of moving to another country in 1 year for +/- half a year with my gf I've know for 3 months. Have to decide soon. What are your experiences with moving far away with your partner?

I've had some thyroid issues since I was about 18. I lost my mother's medicaid right before I was to find out what was wrong exactly. Fast forward four years, and I finally pay for my own schools health insurance through financial aid, leaving me behind on rent. I start going to the endocrinologist and they find a growth on my thyroid. They scheduled my next appointment to biopsy AFTER my insurance expires. I've asked them to reschedule, but they are booked the entire current month. I can't afford to do this again next semester as I'm behind on rent, and this time the insurance is more since it covers summer as well. I lost my job due to me gaining an internship over the summer, and they let me go. I've been searching like crazy, but have had no luck :( Even if I were to find a job, I would still be unable to pay all of this on my own. I'm just really worried and upset that I'm not going to get this solved. I'm asking you to please spread the word, and if you can't help just pass it along. Every dollar will help!

TL;DR: I took a high stress job to move in with my boyfriend. Now he wants me to accept a job with a 3 hour per day commute so that I can keep living with him. I am sick of the travel and want to have a life.

2 years ago, I took a new job a state away. The economy was bad and this was a good job with benefits in my field, and it was only about an hour away, so I took it as it really was the best thing. I got an apartment, etc.

I worked there for about 6 months, when an opportunity came up to move into a different field with better pay. I took a job in enterprise consulting (database software) for a 40% pay raise, and the ability to move in with him. I moved closer to my office temporarily, as my new job required 4 months in the office and then was a 100% travel/work from home job.

In January of this year, I moved out of my apartment and moved in with my boyfriend in a house that he (ostensibly we, but he paid the down payment and the mortgage) bought. I travel full time-- fly out monday morning, fly in thursday nights. This house is about 20 minutes from an airport. However, it is in an area that is basically dead for jobs in my field or that use my skills (heavy engineering and insurance area, for whatever reason.) There are a lot of jobs that utilize my skills, etc in the nearest metro area which is about an hour and a half away with no traffic.

I am not really happy with the travel or with my current job (high pressure consulting) and it is taking a toll on my health, so I am looking to make a change. I have a lot of interest from companies in the nearest metro area, but it would require me to commute 90 miles each way, 5 days a week.

Boyfriend wants me to take it and suck up the commute. When ""we"" bought the house, we had a very narrow geographic area in which to choose from, because he refused to have to drive more than half an hour to the office. Thus, we ended up 3 miles from the house he grew up in. He has been working for the same employer since he was an intern in college and living at home.

He wants me to take the job because he wants me to be home every night. I am very frustrated because I know how grinding a long commute is, and I am beginning to feel that he thinks I should grossly inconvenience myself in order to make sure that he is never uncomfortable. 

His case is that I will eventually stop working so we can have a family, so I should have to do the commute and we should live close to his job since he will keep working and I won't. I feel like that's very far away (at least a few years). I also feel that I am trapped between taking a 100% travel, high stress job or a lower stress job with a long commute, because there is no possibility of a local job for me that makes any reasonable amount of money.

I feel stuck and I'm starting to get resentful. I feel like I never get to have a life because I am either a) not home at all and living in a hotel or b)not getting home until 8pm because I sat in the car in traffic for 2 hours and I have to get up at 5am the next morning to do it again.

Am I wrong to want him to rent out our house and move to a place that splits the difference so that this is remotely fair?"
14pvnk,2,2012-12-12,I [21M] an unsure how to proceed with my [20F] girlfriend that claims is occupied.,throwawaypleases,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14pvnk/i_21m_an_unsure_how_to_proceed_with_my_20f/,"We've been together for about 3 months. Since she's been sheltered, it's her first real relationship. It's my first real relationship as well. 

The first two months have been great fun, we've decided to take things very slowly since neither of us really knows what we've gotten ourselves into. She initially made the first move on me, but since then it's been...cold turkey. Whenever we've hung out we had a good time. Laughed a lot. Talked a lot. We have a lot of things in common but also some stark differences. I've made some moves in return and it's been slow progress for both of us. She initially approached me romantically, then said we should progress as friends and see where things go from there as she wants us to know each other better. I told her I don't see a problem with that, because I also want to get to know her better, but in the end it's not really friendship.


Cue about a month ago, her internship at her company ends, I don't get to see her much (I would give her a ride home 2-3 days a week since the company was a ~10 minute drive from my place, and she lives roughly 40 minutes away and had to take public transportation to commute). Her life got super busy. Her mother quit her job to make an online business with her, she began working from home for a separate online company taking calls. 

She told me that she was very busy, and as a result, felt that maybe going out with me wasn't fair to me because she couldn't devote time. I told her I understood that, but didn't see that as a valid excuse for actually breaking up with me. I told her we could take it slow-er still, until the busy period goes away as she is contracted to work for a month at this online company, and it ends when she starts school again. 

For the past three weeks we've had almost no contact. I've been open minded and understanding because, if she was as busy as she claimed to be, I wanted to give her personal space and time to relax. 

But then, last week I checked her Facebook and Tumblr, and see her generously hanging out with her friends or attending events she doesn't mention to me. Now, that doesn't really bother me, except that I didn't have a Facebook account due to personal reasons, and ended up making one to see what she was up to. I have an account that lets me see some things she's doing, but she doesn't know it's me. And on it she makes it clear she isn't quite as busy as she tells me she is.

I feel terrible because it's like I'm entering stalker territory, but at the same time I feel like she's being disingenuous to me, because she claims she's busy, yet does all these other things in her free time, while not even bothering to send me a text once in a while. 


What do I do? I still quite like her and maybe that is clouding my ability to make a clear decision. We're going to see a movie with some of her friends next week. I feel like we're going to terminate soon, but I'd like to try and save the relationship somehow. 

**TL;DR**: Girlfriend isn't as busy as she claims to be. Don't know how to proceed. Would like to save relationship but feel that I'm headed for termination. "

",AdviceAppreciated_LA,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14pl0e/24m_falling_for_someone_21f_out_of_nowhere_though/,"Alright, It's been a while and I'm using a throwaway account for the reasons most people use them, but here it goes: I feel so fucking stupid right now.


I go to school with this girl, we have a job and an internship together (she introduced them to me), and we have a class together next quarter. We're very much ingrained into each others lives and up until just under 2 weeks ago it wasn't really a problem. Nothing has happened yet, but I've began falling for her with a great intensity I haven't felt in years, hell, greater than anything I've felt for anyone, even people I've actually been with. 


She's my same major, we usually have great chemistry, and we're always looking out for opportunities to help improve each other academically and professionally. She motivates me to do better. Two Sundays ago we went to go get lunch after an internship meeting, went for a long walk, and just sat around together for hours until she had to go to work and my lab hours got opened. It was the happiest I had been in ages. We just talked, goofed around, and even were able to be in complete silence but with no awkwardness. I was just happy to be with her and I realized when I made it to lab that all I wanted to do was be right there next to her again. I know, it's sappy and kinda pathetic, but I'll get to the annoying stuff.



Once I realized I liked her everything changed. I'm no longer my confident self around her and I think about her all the time, so when I actually have been able to see her it's been so built up I don't act like my normal self. I stutter occasionally, say bad jokes, forget things I wanted to ask her about, can't focus on anything else. It feels absolutely terrible. Just a few weeks ago we would just bounce off each other but now I don't know. It doesn't help that this is finals week and she's way more studious than I am, she is stressed out as hell and there doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it. 



Another potentially terrible thing is that we went out drinking last Thursday and the buildup waiting for her to get to my place was so overwhelming I ended up getting too drunk. I didn't black out but I did tell her that I admired her, and after we're done with all this she was the only one I would bet on to be successful. I really meant that, I truly believe it, she's amazing and I don't know how she does it all, but I feel I may have revealed my card. I don't know if it's that, my new found dumbfoundedness, my new sensitive perception of things, or the stress of finals but it seems like she's so much less receptive to me now. It doesn't help that this is all about 2 months after things ended with someone else, though I got over that very quickly and it really wasn't as big a deal as I thought it was initially. 



I understand these problems are elementary, but she's very ingrained into my life right now and if I fail at this it could have terrible repercussions both professionally and academically. I don't want to ruin things for her just because I have feelings and she might not have them back, but I know if I see her with someone else it's going to make work and the internship terrible. I have winter break coming up to get over it but a big part of me really wants to tell her and I don't know how I am going to do it. The last time I see her this week is on Saturday before we both go home ( we live 8 hours way from each other).



I understand this isn't the biggest deal at all compared to some of the stuff that's on here, but I just need to hear some outside perspective on this. I'm usually a very confident guy, I'm just so overcome with what I think has to be infatuation that I can't keep it together around her. I've had to stop myself from saying I'm falling in love with her in my head. I know it's a strong word and I'm not going to attribute it to this situation, it's a serious matter, but it does feel like I'm falling in love, or something like it. 



**tl;dr** I'm an idiot, this great girl was there in front of me the whole time. Can't seem to keep myself together and drunk night didn't help. It's all very elementary.

14pjjg,3,2012-12-11,My father [61] has cheated on my mother [48] with a Romanian woman [30-something] and I [21f] don't know what to do.,a_throwaway55452,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14pjjg/my_father_61_has_cheated_on_my_mother_48_with_a/,"Sorry, huge wall of text ahead.  I really need to vent.

So, my father has been involved with a cam-girl from Romania for the last 4 or so years.  It started a little after I graduated high school at 17, and my mother and I were unaware until this August.  It started with her finding a confirmation letter for a hotel in Romania.  We knew he went to Romania, but my mom badgered him why there was a reservation for two since he had gone alone.  So he finally revealed he's been looking a web-cam girls for a while and there was a particular one, Maria, that he had been exchanging emails with for four years.

At least with this revelation, he's slowly come clean with what has been going through his mind all these years.  In short, he felt his obligation to his wife was done when I graduated high school, and found himself in his ""midlife crisis.""  He wanted see what it'd be like to have another family, with different children.  Possibly ""more motivated"" children.  But his obligation to his new family would be mainly financial, with visits every now and again while the rest of us would be unaware of the other's existence. 

Now, I wouldn't mind if this was simply a ""what-if"" scenario in his head.    But he had intended this woman to be a traveling companion, to get her pregnant, giving her false promises of marriage while he really simply intended to ""pay her off"" and not be around much.  The only thing he mentioned to even show he somewhat (not really) cared for my mom's feelings in this is saying that he had the intent to call her and tell her this was happening if they were going to ""swap fluids.""  Which both my mom and I doubt would have happened.  

Anyway, they did not ""swap fluids"" and the only small justice there is in this situation is that Maria seems to be clingy, extremely jealous, and not really a great person.  I only have secondhand accounts from my mom and the emails that my dad has revealed to her, but my she's apparently threatened to send her boyfriend to harm him, thinks much more poorly of my mom than my mom thinks of her, skipped out on my dad in Germany which was where they intended to meet in person initially, and seems much more interested in my dad's money than my dad, which is probably why they didn't ""swap fluids"" when they did finally meet in Romania.

You think my dad would have given up after all this, especially with his own complaints of her ""being a bitch,"" and saying her beauty is fading.  But no.  He wants it all.  He thinks that my mom and him have a good ""marriage"" in that a marriage is simply a legal document saying that their finances are tied together.  And my mom is rather thrifty, which works with his own spartan ways.  And a divorce could screw him over financially, since he admits he's in the wrong (in some sense).  But luckily for him, my mom likes the financial security, though her feelings for him jump around day by day.  

So now my mom is adamant that she wants a lover on the side of her own.  And though I probably shouldn't side with her so readily on this, I think she deserves someone who cares about her more than my dad.  Or at least she should be allowed to have some (safe and sane) fun in exchange.  It's the least she deserves.  So my dad has reluctantly agreed, though he complains that she's only doing it to ""get back at him.""  But he's crossed so many boundaries I can't sympathize with him in the least.  So, my mom has no official lover yet, though she has been chatting with someone online.  At least my dad wants her to choose someone who will treat her well since she insists.

The latest with Maria now is that she's been emailing my dad claiming her boyfriend has been physically beating her.  So my mom pointed out a woman's shelter for her to go to and my dad's trying to convince her to go as well.  But she wants my father to rescue her so they're at an impasse.  I hope she's lying,  but considering this sounds like something her boyfriend would do, unfortunately I don't think that's the case.  No matter how crappy she's been, she most certainly doesn't deserve to be abused.

And well, that's most of it from my parents' end.  My mom has told me all of this, and my dad is unaware I know anything.  They're staying together, and I can't seem to push my mom to divorce him even though it's probably what's best for them.  I just don't know what to do as their daughter.  I know my dad loves me still, and I love him too, but I'm really starting to dislike him as a person.  With all this revealed (along with a few other attempts at cheating that never went as far) I finally can't ignore what a child he is.  I wonder if he's even been all that happy in his life.  But it seems as though he can't keep it in his pants, criticizes my mom's female friends (and my friends on occasion) for being ""ugly,"" has some irrational hatred of fat women, whines and complains about minor things which my mom has to deal with, called his children defective (oldest brother has anger issues and possibly schizophrenia, I have depression, my younger brother has autism, and the second oldest--stepchild to my father--was jailed questionably), and other things.

I love my mom as well, and though she wears on my nerves, she does deserve better than this.  She's been wanting to move to Ecuador for a while with my little brother, and it sounds like my dad will pay for her to live there whether he stays there full time or not.  She's been through a lot of crap in her life with an even worse ex-husband and not very helpful parents, so even though she wears on my nerves sometimes and is childish herself in her own ways, I'll always love her.  I realize that me knowing this much about the situation isn't exactly a normal mother-daughter relationship, but it's always been like this and I'm one of the few people she can talk to.  Sometimes I have resented her for it (and I think it's part of why the second oldest doesn't really talk to her much, but that's another can of worms) but I feel like it was important to know at least some of this particular situation since it really does reveal how awful my dad can be...

As for myself... I'm heading to Germany soon to study abroad and feel rather guilty as all of this has come to light.  I don't really want his money anymore since I feel like he's paying off everyone in some sense to keep things calm.  Not to mention this semester in college has been a bad one for me, so I'll have to chat with my dad about that sometime, and talks like that are never pleasant with him. (Though I am generally a good student.)  He pays for my college so that I don't have student loans, but since I'm in engineering I'm willing to take out a loan for what will probably be my last year in college after I go to Germany...  I'm also listed as dependent under him, but may ask him to take away that status.  But he covers my car insurance payments, healthcare, phone, etc.  I have a part-time job and an internship coming up for the summer, but for now I don't have that much money saved up since I paid for my ticket to and from Germany and have been dealing with everyday and rental expenses since I moved out with my boyfriend in October.  I'm ahead and earning money overall for now, but without my dad covering the other expenses, I may fall behind.  But my boyfriend claims I'll be fine since he managed to cover all his expenses initially with a part-time job, then simply working at an internship over the summer while he was in college.  And he insists he doesn't mind covering for me if I do fall behind, as long as I'm making an effort.

Anyway, this post is long enough so I'll get to the end of it.

TL;DR: My dad has been cheating on my mom with a Romanian woman.  and he does not want to lose either my mom or this Romanian woman.  They are not planning on divorce, but my mom made the condition that she be allowed a lover too.  Neither want to split also due to financial concerns.  I want to support my mom, but am growing disgusted with my dad and don't know if I should approach him at all.  I want to at least be financially independent from him so I'm don't have any obligations to him, but I am going abroad for a semester in Germany (not to mention all the other expenses he pays for me) so it isn't very possible at the moment.  Any advice? "
14pcad,3,2012-12-11,Frustrated and Living on the Edge in New York,roberteh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14pcad/frustrated_and_living_on_the_edge_in_new_york/,"I've gone back and fourth with posting this.... It's not like me to air out personal matters online like this- especially financial. 

In short for the past year I've been living in what is essentially in poverty in New York City (a terrifying and surreal feat given it's one of the most expensive cities in the world) because I still haven't found a job that will pay a reasonable salary to live a reasonable quality of life here. I've been working at an underpaying internship which pays $1366 per month- with no benefits. If I get sick or have to go to the hospital I'm going to be in more financial trouble than I am currently; I think about that a lot and am careful crossing the frantic streets of NYC. 

I've had to do small web freelancing gigs for low paying (sometimes non-paying ) or demanding clients to be able to make ends meet at the end of the month after paying the rent allowing myself to actually barely scrape by instead of nearly starving to death for the dubious ""privilege"" of working all day long at an underpaying internship.... I'm too old to be interning and feel like I have essentially failed myself and have failed my parents. I can't even save any money right now and am living paycheck to paycheck. I'm beginning to play catchup with bills even after selling my digital camera, TV and bed.I don't even know if the payment for my phone got cleared- this is ridiculous and it shouldn't be this way!

I always thought these things happen to other people, now I am ""those"" people. I come from a good background, have a college degree, live in the United States of all places and am (somewhat) employed. For many months I fooled myself into believing my situation wasn't that bad since I could pay (just barely) my rent and bills and maintain some sense of normalcy by taking myself out once in a while in the city that I love so much- so passionately in fact that I'll cling to it even as it sucks all the money I barely make out of my pockets.

It almost seems like after going on interviews and applying for positions that I might never get the position I want and should instead give into inevitable failure. This wouldn't be such a rough time if it weren't the holidays since I can't afford to give anyone anything at this point... Anyway I just wanted to get that off my chest. "
14t44s,2,2012-12-13,Tired and angry,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14t44s/tired_and_angry/,"I feel a little bit selfish writing this, as I know there are people with much bigger problems than me, but I don't have a blog or something like that to speak out, so here it is.

I feel like shit lately. I'm second year CS student going for bachelor degree and I started internship in a huge IT company, the amount of things to do(h/w, assignments, internship tasks and amount of new stuff to learn) is killing me, but I keep telling myself that it is going to be great for my career stuff. But that's not the worst.

You know how there are groups of friend on your program. Basically, I'm in one, but I don't really like them and I just don't understand what they are doing here. Most of them know nothing~~, Jon Snow~~ about programing and I think they are here just because parents told them to be in university.

Another group of coursemates is too nerdish for me. I mean I can talk with them, but I just can't see them as my friends. The only thing we share is the university. Of course, there are other people and other groups, but the problem is that they speak another language. Yup, I'm from Latvia, we are de-facto Russian-Latvian country. I know Latvian, but not enough to maintain conversation and not be weird (I'm really working on it, I'm much better than I used to be before university). So right now I have too-cool-for-school group, nerd group or to be a loner in between (what I'm pretty much doing now).

Relationships. Oh boy, my last more-than-one-date relationship (and what a coincidence, a first one ever) was terrible and ended terrible (that's another story that I posted months ago at /r/relationship_advice) more than 3 months ago and I haven't tried dating since. And that was not even a heartbreaking experience, I felt nothing, not even anger or anything! We were really mature and decided just to ignore each other. /irony

There are girls that make me hold my attention for few moments, but I don't do anything about it and I really don't know why. I can't really date with somebody while I'm studying/working (maybe I could have one free hour, if I sleep less than (like 5 hours a day)), but the thing is I that I just don't see any relationships after this tough studying/working part. There is one girl I guess I like, but here goes the language problem - I know she's nice (from creeping aside &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;), she's pretty, but I won't be able to maintain even a small talk with her. There is a chance that she speaks Russian, but it's unlikely (russians know russian and latvian, latvians know mostly only latvian).

My best friend (my classmate from highschool) is now studying abroad in Denmark and his laptop died 3 weeks ago. We were talking in Skype everyday for months. We are bros, we talk about everything and he's the only one who I can rely on to speak out. But without his laptop that's basically SMS only and that sucks hard. He's coming soon back home for winter holidays, but the thing is, when he's home he's much more away from me. He spends all his time with his girlfriend (they maintain long range relationship). So I can say that I won't hear my bro for 3 weeks more before he comes back to Denmark with repaired laptop. That sucks hard and probably that's the main reason I'm writing this. Otherwise I would have talk this out with him :D

So I don't have problem. I have lots of small ones that are hard to solve and that's killing me. I'm tired of everything and I'm angry that I'm in this situation.

Goddamit, I didn't even know I have so much to write. I had problems writing one page essays in few weeks, but I wrote this in 15 minutes. Guess, I really had to speak out. Thank you for reading, if you are still here."

For my internship, I have used a personal MATLAB-script that runs just fine on my own laptop, but my employer has become enamoured by it and wishes to incorporate it into his own company.

Problem being that said company still uses MATLAB 6.5 whereas I run MATLAB 2010a. As such, several issues have cropped up which have, mostly, been dealt with.

The problem I'm facing is that MATLAB 6.5 doesn't support the DSP Toolbox and as such, I am unable to use the Filter Design Tool to create Butterworth filters. Using the *butter*-function isn't faring much better either as 6.5 does not recognize it.

My question for you thusly; Is there any way, shy of filtering my signal through external means, to create a digital Butterworth filter in MATLAB 6.5 or should I tell my boss to nut up and buy a new license?

Many thanks in advance, stay safe."

14rbpv,1,2012-12-12,I wish I could disappear.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/14rbpv/i_wish_i_could_disappear/,"I have been depressed for over two years now. Have always felt like it would pass with time, but I can't find the energy to get back up anymore. I keep falling down harder and harder when I do, and while I felt morally crippled before, I now feel paralyzed. I've been moving around without a real purpose for 2 years, and I'm fed up with it.

I'm a 22 year old college student and am a year away from graduation. Been in a relationship with someone since I was 15 (best friend since we were kids), and she moved in with me when I was 19.  We didn't have a choice if we wanted to stay together since her parents were moving to another country. Things were great for the first few months. We even got engaged in secrecy. But when she dropped out of college and wasn't able to find a job, she grew depressed. After a while I did too, but I tried to keep it to myself, thinking that if she'd start studying or working again she'd start feeling better about herself, and then I'd be able to get past it as well. I tried to help and motivate her in any way that I could, but since I had to work a lot next to studying to cover both of our expenses, I had little time or energy left to do so. I was always trying to get some rest from college and work, while she sat at home looking forward to me coming back so we could go out and do something. This created tension and caused us to grew distant. I got her a kitten because I heard it might help, which it did, but it wasn't enough. After a year and a half of living together, I came home to an empty house. She left. I never saw her since.

I was crushed. Not only did I lose the love of my life, but my best friend as well. I put so much time and energy into it, and now she was gone forever. I figured that keeping myself busy and let time heal my wounds would be best. You might have found out already, but this only makes things worse. You become a ghost and keep yourself busy so you don't have to deal with life, while your problems just keep building up. At some time, you'll reach a breaking point, and won't have the energy to deal with it anymore.

After a few months I was starting a fulltime internship. Since I get good grades and am pretty good at what I do, I had no problem finding a company that suited me. I told them I had been going through a rough patch and I might not be the most fun to work with at first, but would try to not let it interfere with my work or bother my colleagues with it. They said it didn't matter and they would try to help me get past it. They seemed very understanding.

Unknowingly, I was overqualified as an intern, which I might have realized if I wasn't suffering from depression. After they worked me in I quickly became a cheap replacement for the company's art director (not officially, but he quit and I took over his tasks), meaning I had to work on the big projects and oversee the smaller ones, while I was just supposed to work on the smaller ones. I should've pointed that out or simply just quit, but I was too excited about being art director and hadn't felt that motivated for a long time. Like most designers, I'm in it for passion, and they made sure to abuse that. 

Work completely took hold of my life, causing me to lose the few friends I had left. I got up, worked, and went to bed still feeling completely exhausted the next day. I was a ticking time bomb. After doing this for half a year and nearly having finished my internship, I had a breakdown on my way home. My vision blurred and I could barely stand on my legs, and I collapsed on the train. Luckily, a stranger helped me on my way home; I still wonder if I had ever made it otherwise. I was at an absolute low and called in sick the next day, and called my mother since I didn't have anyone else to talk to anymore. I told my mother about the night before, the internship, and that I had been depressed and it only kept getting worse. Like most people here, I was very good at keeping my depression a secret, so it took her completely by surprise. I took her advice and visited a doctor the next day. He told me to take the next two weeks off and get some rest.

A week later, I got a phone call from one of my colleagues. He told me my employer knew I was about to have a breakdown and already started looking for my replacement, and that they wouldn't let me come back to finish my internship and were thinking of a way to justify that decision. Everyone at the company knew about it. I never returned and probably couldn't even if I wanted to. I have to redo the whole thing now. Six months of work wasted.

It's been 8 months since, and my depression is worse then it has ever been. During this time I've tried to get up countless times, but in the end there's never any real drive or motivation, pushing me further back and increasing my guilt as time passes. I left my appartment and moved back in with my parents, which only made it worse by making me feel like a useless failure. I know they love me, but I can't help feeling like I'm a bother to them. 

I tried medication for 2 months but I hated it. It just numbed me down, which was the opposite of what I needed. Tried therapy, but I felt like everything I was saying went over his head. Maybe I should give another therapist a shot...

I'm a mere shadow of the guy I used to be. I haven't felt attracted (not even physically) to anyone in a year. I'm scared of everything; sometimes I'm afraid to leave the house. I only work part-time, yet I feel as restless and pressured as I did when I used to work over 60 hours a week. I used to like going out, now it's one of the scariest things I can think of. I feel like a waste of space.

I always had a little hope. A slight bit of optimism. But since my latest breakdown even that part of me seems to be missing. I wish I could disappear completely without leaving a trace.

Thanks if you read this. I appreciate it. Had a hard time writing this."

""I spent 2 years in my college career working for a degree in drawing and painting.  
It wasn’t until I spent a year working/volunteering as an Animal Care Specialist that I realized what I really wanted to do with my life …

I want to work for animals.  I have expertise in domestic animals and some wildlife rehabilitation, but I wish to expand my exotic animal care knowledge.  More specifically, I dream to work with big cats.  Everyone’s always told me I’m the epitome of a “crazy cat lady” which I proudly agree with.  My shelves are lined with cat trinkets and mugs, my walls are littered with my own cat-related artwork, and my bed is dressed with a sea of cat stuffed animals.  So it was to no one’s surprise that this was the career goal that I made.  

My ultimate goal is to become a Veterinarian of Exotic Animals and work at a big cat facility in a zoo or rescue of some sort.

To achieve such greatness, it never hurts to have some internship experience!  Which is why the internship offered at the The Wildcat Sanctuary in Sandstone, Minnesota would be the perfect opportunity for a person like me.  I daydream about participating in this kind of hands-on experience on a daily basis.  

I just don’t quite have the money to cover the costs …

By Summer of 2014 I'd like to have enough funds to cover the following:
1. Pay for my deposit fee.
2. Pay for my road trip(s) to Sandstone, Minnesota from Milwaukee, Wisconsin (most likely 2 trips total.)
3. Pay for gas during my stay since I will be making trips with my fellow interns to the grocery store.
4. Pay for food and other necessities I may need during my 12 week stay.
5. Pay for the 3 months of rent that I will be responsible to cover while I'm gone!

It’s hard enough working two jobs and paying for my college tuition now.  Without your help, I may miss the chance to take advantage of this wild experience of a lifetime.  So do something great today by helping a girl get the job of her dreams!""

This is my first time doing an AMA, a few friends of mine suggested I do it.  Also, as a heads up, I did sign an NDA when I started here, so I guess this is more of a 'AMAA'. (Ask Me Almost Anything)

A little bit of info.  I have been an intern with DCP since late August and mostly work on the ""Bloopers"" website finding clips and writing humorous titles and descriptions as well as blogs.  I worked 3 nights at the Nokia Theater for the American Music Awards, doing random tasks backstage, as well as working the parties Saturday and Sunday night.  I also had an all-access pass that allowed me to roam the premises and see a few rehearsals.  I did NOT get to see the show, as I was preparing for the after-party Sunday night.

I will do my best to answer every question I can/ am allowed to, as long as the keep coming in.  Also, a rule of thumb that I will be adhering to regarding celebs etc, is ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.""  I did not talk to any of them, I saw a few however when I was working the check-in desks.

So if you have any questions about what goes on backstage at an awards show, what I did specifically during the show, getting an internship in the industry in general, anything I can help you with or inform you of, ask away!

14tsix,2,2012-12-13,I wish I knew about this subreddit while I was still teaching...,[deleted],teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/14tsix/i_wish_i_knew_about_this_subreddit_while_i_was/,"I was one of those, the one who came in all bright eyed and ready to mold some minds! I was the residential sub for my school and then was brought on to teach (internship eek!) at the same school and absolutely loved it. Then I was laid off. Just like that. 

I can honestly say I was a good teacher and I really did (and still do) care about my kids. I hung around that summer and was re-hired to another school in the same district. While I was incredibly grateful, a lot of the teachers there were bitter and I tended to stick to myself during lunch etc. 

My district was low-income, 60% non English speaking parents, you all know the deal, but I loved my job and I loved my kids and if it were just about me and my classroom and none of the other crap that went along with it, it would have been the perfect job. Then I got laid off again. I knew it was coming, my coworkers swore up and down it wouldn't, but there I was again, sitting in the principal's office signing paperwork. I didn't cry as much this time, I didn't break down during my prep, I was prepared for it, but it still ripped my hear out just the same. 

I decided not to stick around and see if they stuck me somewhere else two weeks into the semester like the last time and have been working elsewhere since, but I miss it everyday. That was two years ago and they laid everyone off each year again. 

I look at posts on here and see the community and wish I would have known about it before. I want to go back, but now I'm scared. I'm scared of having my heart broken again and the uncertainty of not knowing if I would be back in my classroom the next year. Taking all of my students projects down and storing them, because I now had nowhere to display their amazing work. My boyfriend tells me all of the time when I randomly recall a story, how much he can tell that I miss it and how I should get back in, but what if I can't even find a job? And worse, what if I fall in love again only to be let go (three months before I'm done with the school year to boot). Too many what-ifs. Looking in on these posts reminds me of everything again and is bringing up all sorts of emotions. I guess I want to say thank you for your stories, and hopefully, if I do go back, I'll be able to pop in here and get a little added help."
14tn8i,3,2012-12-13,[25 M] in love with [25 M] best friend who probably isn't even my best friend anymore...,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14tn8i/25_m_in_love_with_25_m_best_friend_who_probably/,"Reddit, I can't talk to anyone else about this. Maybe that says a lot about my other friendships. But this is my last resort, the only place I can turn to.

This is also the most complicated and agonizing chapter of my life, so there's no way to really describe this without a lot of detail. Considering that, I'll provide a TL;DR at the onset:

**TL;DR**: I'm a 25/m in love with another 25/m. I don't want to be. We used to be best friends when we were younger. Had a rift. Grew apart. Mended fences and became close again. He moved away. Ever since, our friendship has deteriorated again. As such, and as I've felt a bit abused, I've decided to stop talking to him. But I need advice or re-assurement given the full story...

THE FULL STORY:

I was 14. He was 14. We met at a mutual friend's party. I didn't like him. Arrogant. Spiky hair. Puca shell necklace. But for some reason, we got along well. Ended up having some classes together. Got to that point (pre-drivers licenses) where we would spend the night at each other's house every weekend. Became best friends within a few months. I'd never had a better friend. I loved him, but I wasn't mature enough to know it yet. I could just *be* with him, around him, and that was okay. We would watch a movie, and he would lay down with his head on my chest, and I was completely happy for the first time in my life. It was the most pure sense of happiness I have ever known. We would continue a lot of cuddly actions like these, none sexual mind you, but all giving me the first sense of being loved or secure that I have ever really have, and loving someone back as a result.

We were 16. Still best friends. It was just after Christmas. He had stopped inviting me to stuff. Stopped calling, IM'ing, etc. He never said why. He went out of his way to ignore me, or disregard me, in the hallways, at the lunch table, etc. I was shattered. I didn't understand any of this. Also being an alpha male teenager, my response was just to fight apathy with apathy. I responded to his silence with silence. I was passively-aggressive mean to him. I said things I shouldn't have said. I wanted him to hurt as bad as I did, and I didn't sleep much during those times.

We were 17, about to start out senior yr of HS. He reached out to me after a year of silence. He had been gone for the summer, said he had some sort of epiphany. We met at a Starbucks. He didn't really have answers. I didn't really have the balls to describe how bad I was hurt, because guys don't get hurt by other guys. And I just kinda melted when I saw him again anyway, actually talking to me. He wanted to pick up where we left off. He wanted me in his life again.

We were not even two months past that date, and it happened again. The silence. The going out of his way to not invite me to things. The way he treated me in front of other people to make a point. One day, I basically invited myself over when other people were there. He didn't like that I took his spot on the sofa when he was taking a piss, so he came back and hit me when I jokingly wouldn't get up. I left with a black eye and a broken heart, and that sounds so fucking cliche, but that was the lowest moment right there. Closest I ever came to killing myself. Turns out he had only ever really reached out because he needed my support in this club we mutually joined. I gave him his presidency. That was all he needed.

We were 18, having just graduated high school. I thought I would be the better man and call him after another year of silence, let him know that despite all the shit, despite all the feelings I couldn't understand, I forgave him, and wished him the best moving into the next chapter of his life.

We were 19, and happened to go to the same college. As had become standard procedure, we largely avoided each other. Somehow, through no specific catalyst, we began IM'ing again, back when IM'ing was a thing. We would chat for hours on end, at random times, on random days. But we were both kinda working toward the idea that we regretted a lot of the past few years.

We were 20 when we scheduled some classes together, to actually interact in person, but from the safety of a classroom. He also scheduled with his friends. I didn't like them. Jackasses. The kind of kids who would make fart noises in the back of a lecture hall. I was too embarrassed to sit around them, had to give up that effort.

We were 21 when we finally had a real day together again. He picked me up, and we went to see a movie. I knew I *should* feel one way or the other against him, but the whole time, I couldn't help but feel this magnetic attraction...again, cliche as fuck, I know. But there was almost this electric field between us, it felt like. I was so conscious, the whole movie, of just being inches from this guy, this guy who just occupied my soul, for lack of a better descriptor. I figured our time together would end after the movie, but he wanted to keep hanging out, so we got dinner and went back to my place. We broached the subject of all those angry words and hurt feelings over the years, and each struggled to talk about it, but each apologized for our role and assured we had grown up, and that was all best forgotten.

We were 22 when we graduated college and moved back to the same hometown. Against all odds, we were best friends again. Hanging out all the time. Calling. Texting. Emailing. I think we realized we could only be emotionally honest with each other. I got him. He got me. We both only felt 100% safe and secure and content to be when we were around each other. He told me this. He was I was the only person in the world who made him feel that way, quote him: ""whenever we're together, I feel like time is suspended"", ""it's just a huge relief...to exist and know I'm near someone I care very deeply about, as much as I could ever possibly care about someone.""

We were 23, and he decided to move across the country. He was depressed in our hometown. Nothing for him here, he said. It made him feel trapped. It was always like winter. He needed the sun. So he moved across country. We decided we would stay close, though, make sure distance didn't compromise what we had worked so hard to rebuild. And we wrote each other, often daily, to make sure this was the case.

We were 24, and the time between messages kept increasing. I made him promise this mattered enough to him to keep trying, otherwise we should drop it immediately. He said it did. He said even when he was an asshole to the people he loved, they still mattered to him more than anything, and he just needed to get out of his head and reaffirm this. Around this time, his girlfriend, who had never really been a serious girlfriend as long as I'd known him, moved out with him too to move in with him.

We are 25. We were finally going to be in the same zip code again. I always tried to ask if I could come out to visit him, but he was always working a lot, or didn't have room for me with his girlfriend living there too, or couldn't get time off his internship. So I had to wait for him to come back to me. He finally did, for a week. I knew he would want to see his family right away, so I didn't bother him for a few days, but then I asked if he wanted to hang out with me at all when he was back. His answer was basically ""sorry, probably won't have time"". We were 15 minutes away from each other. He couldn't find even a few minutes past midnight to come out to my car or something.

I've always known these feelings I have are unhealthy and unfair. Understand that I don't want to love him. No one wants to be the closeted gay boy who loves his straight best friend. I don't want to put that pressure on him. I don't want to disgust him. I don't want to let myself down as I constantly do, fighting a battle that logically cannot be won. It's not like this is some deep-seeded sexual fantasy or something exciting. This is a feeling I don't want, that I can't help.

It was never more clear to me that I really just needed to end things after he came back and made no effort to see me. So I deleted everything. His e-mails (except one, which I still need to, but haven't found the strength to), his texts, his contact info in my phone. It all hurts me too much. Seeing his name on social media hurts me.

I just decided to stop. Stop trying. Stop putting myself in a position to get hurt. So I did. For a month or two, I successfully managed to avoid all communication.

He's emailing me again now trying to re-establish communication. Part of me wants to respond and let him know why I need to end this, before either of us gets hurt here. Part of me wants to continue ignoring him. All of me has no idea what the hell I am doing, because for as smart as I am in every other area of my life, I'm a fucking mess here, and I hate myself for it.

Logically, this relationship is unhealthy. It only still exists because we have unhealthy dependencies on each other. I depend on him for self-esteem, the feeling of being loved and wanted, or mattering to someone who matters more to you than anyone else. He depends on me for emotional support when he needs it, or reassurance. I love him. I don't think he loves me, or if he does, he historically has a fucked-up way of showing it. Safe bet, then, he doesn't.

I've never wanted to admit my feelings to him, because I never wanted to jeopardize the friendship, no matter how fucked up it has been at times. Of course, now I realize that there's really not much to fuck up, it's a sputtering friendship at best and we live on opposite ends of the country with no mutual friends and very little chance, it seems, of really even seeing each other again. So it doesn't seem like it could do any harm on one hand. On the other hand, I'm so fucking tired of continuing to fall for the same things over and over again since my early high school years, that I really just want to quit cold turkey and not even really give him the satisfaction of getting that much out of me at this point.

I feel like I do owe him an explanation...but then, I feel like I don't, because it's always me paying the price, right?

So this is my crossroads, the hell I torment myself with every night. Am I best to just burn the past, move on, ignore him, listen to the logical side of me that says this is an extremely unhealthy relationship and I'm just putting myself in a soul-shatteringly painful position by holding on to any absurd notions that this can somehow ""work""?

Should I continue our friendship?  Reciprocate communication?

Should I *tell him*?

From the outside looking in, if you made it this fucking far (and I owe you everything if you did, really, I need to write this, because I need to express these feelings, and I just can't to anyone else), what is your objective view of what, to me, has been the single most gut-twisting chapter of my life...and something I largely blame myself a good deal for, and hate myself for perpetuating?

**TL;DR**: I've never been more sure of anything in my life than the fact I'm in love here. I've never hated anything more than I hate myself for feeling this way and being such a stupid boy. And I really, really don't know what to do right now.

I reserve the right to delete this once I realize what a huge mistake I've made."
14tm9q,3,2012-12-13,Buying a suit at Macy's: Which brands are ok and which ones should I stay away from?,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/14tm9q/buying_a_suit_at_macys_which_brands_are_ok_and/,"First off, I'm a sophomore in college but I'll need a suit for this summer and then the upcoming winter for internships and interviews. I'll be getting a charcoal (probably) or navy 2 button.

There's 25% off men's clothing at Macy's this week, and I get an extra 30% on top of that since I work there. I also have like $25 in gift cards to use. So, after all the discounts I could get a $500 full price suit for $250. Or less, if the suit is on sale already.

That means that I won't have to go dig at the bottom of the price range for a suit I want, which is good because I don't want something that will fall apart after like a year or so. I do plan on getting the suit tailored after as well, so I won't just be wearing it over the rack.

I know that I should get a wool soot, and will not spend money on a poly/rayon blend. I also know I should look for certain things like stitching instead of fusing.

The big question is, which brands of suits would still provide me a worthwhile product to own and wear?

I know I should probably stay away from brands like Kenneth Cole Reaction, American Rag, and Alfani.

I'm assuming Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein (as long as its not CK), and Tommy Hilfiger are safe bets generally? What about, say, Michael Kors and Lauren by Ralph Lauren (even though I know it's not actually by Ralph Lauren)?

Thanks in advance everyone! Other tips would be appreciated as well :)"
14vxic,2,2012-12-15,I haven't talked to my ex in four months and she is home for the holidays... all I want to do is contact her. What do I do? [23],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14vxic/i_havent_talked_to_my_ex_in_four_months_and_she/,"Hi r/relationships,

December 21, 2011... My ex and I ended a roughly two year relationship. There were many positives about it: she was my first, we were incredibly compatible personalities that got along well, and she was beautiful. Yet the relationship had it's problems. Much of the two years (about 50%) was long distance with my going away on internships and co-ops. We started out fine but it quickly became sour when I was home. The realization that we fought less when I was gone then when I was home was a very big red flag.

The catalyst for the breakup was her moving away to a foreign country for graduate school for 3 years. I knew that I did not want to commit three years long distance to my first sexual partner that clearly was more compatible with me over the phone and the internet than she was in person.

Fast forward to 2012, we would talk every now and again when it was near her coming home. In April, when she was home for a visit, we met up and had sex. It was great, and briefly rekindled what we had until we realized it still wasn't right.

Over summer 2012, I did a lot of sexual exploration. I have come to realize that casual sex is very overrated and I miss the intimacy of someone that knows me inside and out. 

My ex and I have't talked since August and we haven't seen each other in person since April. I know I should be moving on with my life but all I want to do is contact her tonight.

I'm a little drunk guys. Please help me reason out that what is in the past is in the past. That I can find someone that doesn't fight with me so much that is in my life close by. I need to know that I didn't pass up on the one person that was right for me.

TL;DR: Sorry this was a jumble; I'm drunk and want to try and contact my ex that I know I shouldnt."

I'm 20, in college, away from home

What I've done:

* I'm dating a girl who I'd been very good friends with for the past few years and started being interested in over the summer. Lo and behold she was also into me and I found out only a few days into my current streak. I've been dating her for about a month and a half now, and it's fair to say that she's a big reason that I have the mental strength to keep going with this. (should note this is my first ever girlfriend, which is cool)
* I'm doing well in school (fingers crossed, finals were this week)
* I've taken on a whole lot of responsibility at my work
* I'm dressing nicer!
* I stopped a whole lot of procrastinating activities (like deleting my Facebook, toning down on Twitter, and almost never using Reddit, and obviously masturbating)
* Just general boosts in confidence and happiness and motivation

I think that all of these things are things I could have achieved without nofap but I don't think I would have had the confidence to try or the motivation to try to better myself. Trying nofap showed me that I do have the power to change myself and that I can become a better version of me if I just put my mind to it and stop settling for the current me. Even now I'm working hard to make myself a strong candidate for an internship next summer. It honestly just feels so good to do things.

A bit more background, I tried nofap over the summer and made it a month on my first try, then had a few short spurts, and then finally my current streak. I deleted Facebook during my first month, and have gotten better with Twitter and stopped Reddit over my current streak. I have a paper taped to my wall with checkboxes on it, although I'm in a good state of mind right now where I'm not thinking about it and don't update for a few days or more. Also use chains.cc, it's pretty nice. Girlfriend knows I'm doing this, she asked about the checkboxes and I told her. Selling my computer tomorrow and sold my ipad in the fall so soon I won't have any devices I've ever watched porn on and that's a pretty cool feeling.

I can answer any questions, I'll get them on my phone! 

Otherwise thanks for making this community and helping me to realize that there was a lot in the way of a really happy version of myself. Now I'm there. I owe a lot to you."

14ygro,24,2012-12-16,Tranny-chased during my 1st time presenting [F] in NYC. Was he sweet or creepy?,oldsapphire,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/14ygro/trannychased_during_my_1st_time_presenting_f_in/,"I'm not even 1 month on HRT, but I felt confident enough in my presentation (clothes, makeup) that I decided to give part-time a whirl. I didn't seem to draw any negative attention, and even got a few female pronouns. 

Then on the train... there were no seats so I had to stand. Not very glad about that because it would emphasize my height, but what could I do? A gentlemen across from me was staring like a drooling wolf... I knew he was checking me out (I had sunglasses on so I could watch him), but I didn't think he was going to make a move. He leans in during the ride and says to me ""You're a very beautiful young woman, do you work?"" 

!!!!! My first day out and I'm getting hit on??? I was in disbelief. 

""Thanks... and... yeah, I work.""

I was so effing nervous.

After that he retreated and I tried to just ignore him. Fortunately a seat opened up and I snatched it to avoid his direct stares. Well, *un*fortunately, the seat next to me freed up at the next stop, and he was quick to plop down.

""I wonder what was going through your mind when I said that to you,"" he says.

""...Well, I was thinking about my boyfriend,"" I lied. ""But thanks for the compliment, really you're very kind."" Gosh, I sound like an old maid.

Him: ""Oh, okay. Well, now I know what they mean by the term passable.""

I ... FROZE. He knew!! I didn't know what to say.

Him: ""Passable - I'm sure that's a term you've used before.""

I got smart-alecky: ""I think I've seen it in the dictionary before, flipping around...""

Him: ""Ohh okay, it's gonna be like that; okay.""

After that he starts to go into who he is, telling me about his job and showing me pictures of him with celebrities (he works in the film industry). I told him that I was a film major, and he gave me a tip on where I could intern and get work in the future.

""See, I've been honest about who *I* am,"" he points out.

Me: ""I'm sorry, I'm really shy.""

Him: ""Oh, bull shit.""

I was like wow... kind of a compliment - implying that I'm brave or something - but I *was* telling the truth... it's my first day out! He didn't know that. And I was sooo scared. I'm very shy, at least by *my* definition.

After some small talk, his stop comes up and he leaves me his email address. He tells me to email him and then leaves. 

Okay... so here's my guess. He's a sweet creep. I mean, he was willing to flirt with me in public - knowing I'm trans* - so he's obviously not worried about what others will think, either because I pass well enough or he just doesn't care one bit. He didn't say anything rude or insulting, and was in fact correct to imply that I wasn't being entirely honest. But I was scared!  I think anyone who tries to hit on people in public - especially *in transit* - is being slightly rude, don't you? I don't know. It seems like an invasion of privacy. I mean, I'm totally willing to accept that this sort of stuff happens to females in NYC but... it won't win him any sweet points from me. 

HoWeVeR... he *was* kind enough to give me advice for my career, and didn't pressure me to do anything unreasonable. Most of the discomfort I felt was self-inflicted nonsense, I'll admit that. 

Anyway, I wonder what others would do in this situation? Send him an email like he wanted? Maybe just to say thanks for the career tip (and see where that goes)? Or ignore him completely? I think he was maybe in his mid to late 30's or 40's. Attractive but all those creepster marks bring that down.

**TL;DR:** Tranny chaser clocks me on the train, hits on me, gives me solid career advice, then leaves me his email. Would you contact him, or ignore him?

Thanks for any responses... happy &amp; safe passing, y'all :)

**EDIT:** Wow... well, I guess the jury has spoken... This guy seems to have been trying to proposition me for sex, and upon realizing that that wasn't going to happen, he exposed my vulnerabilities to get whatever shred of myself may have still been available... Frustrating!! I will **not** be contacting him, and I so appreciate all the responses so far.

Next time, I'm getting off at the next stop and waiting for another train. "

At first everyone was happy for me, because hey - I finally did it, but after my intern ended and I got my contract everyone's attitude change to - ""why are you getting paid so little"". I'm getting frustrated because I realized it won't end if I will get a rise. It started with - ""hey, you like math, you should go to high school with math profile"", so I did, but when I got in it was ""hey, you're in a good school, why you aren't good in everything?"", so I went 24/7 studying to meet the expectations but it haven't stopped.

Maybe because I'm embarrassed of how little I earn, but ffs - it's more than nothing right? I should feel something, but right now, I'm too mentally tired I can't be angry or happy anymore, I just don't care about anything.

So I've been lurking for a while now &amp; finally made an account. Little about myself: I'm a freshman in a University in Texas, studying Computer Science as my major. 

My personal dream is to move to Seattle once I graduate College, or by some miracle, transfer to University of Washington. I've lived in Suburbia Texas since I was 5 years old, and never thought of myself as a city person, as the only cities I had ever seen were all in Russia (I was born in Russia). Until I visited Vancouver and realized just how much I'd love a change of scenario.(Small note: I've been wanting to visit Seattle since I was thirteen.) Seattle is an amazing city for a computer science major &amp; I love the rain (a lot). 

I'm applying for internships for this Summer in Seattle, although as a Freshman, there's not much chance of me getting a position, but I'll defiantly fly over to my dream city this Summer.  :)

14xfr1,1,2012-12-15,Times like these I start to feel alone.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/14xfr1/times_like_these_i_start_to_feel_alone/,"Everyone I know either lives too far or is always busy, when in fact, it seems like everything in my social life is starting to fall apart.

When I was in high school, I had lots of friends. I would party every time I got the chance. I think I did this mostly because my family was never there. To everyone else, I was living the dream. Starting my junior year in high school, I started living on my own. I lived on my own because my parents actually lived in another state. Yea, they gave me money to do things, but I felt as if I was being bribed. I used to have a close relationship with them, but things changed and I had a house to myself. I spent my 17th and 18th birthday and every other holiday alone.

I had a girlfriend and she was the closest thing to actual family. I was always with her. Once I graduated, I was kicked out my family's home (the one where they were never at) and started college. I had to move a ways and she basically pushed me out of the relationship. I started college as a pre-dental major, when in fact that's what everyone wanted me to do. I started losing focus in class thinking about how screwed my family became. How my ex started dating another guy. I fell back so far in class, even with all this time to myself, studying, reading, writing, doing homework. I failed tests. I dropped out on my own decision. Not because I didn't have money for college. Not because I wasn't smart enough. I did it because it wasn't what I wanted.

This is when I would do what I wanted for a while. I wanted to be apart of something bigger. I did what I dreamed about, joining the Air Force. I wanted a sense of family again. When once I made that decision, my family quit sending money for me to pay rent or buy groceries.

A little info. In high school I was in a paid summer internship and made $3000. 

Since my family cut me off, I've been using my internship money to get by. Currently, I'm starting to run low on money and I'm waiting for my ship date to Basic Military Training. I live in a small town near my old college. I cannot find a job due to that. Every job seems to be taken. 

This is when I start contacting old friends trying to find anything. I called one of my best friends, which also happens to be joing the military. He is leaving next week and his family offered me a place to stay. 

So now I am staying in my own apartment, which to me feels like my family is kicking me out of. Twice it seems like I get kicked out my only place to stay. 

TL;DR
My family left me at a young age and used money to essentially bribe me. I dropped out of college to persue my dream of joining the Air Force. Now my funds are cut off and I'm slowing losing money. Feels like I got kicked out twice. Friend's parents offered me a place to stay.

I want everyone to know I'm not asking for a handout. I just feel like this is where someone will listen.

We are going to commence a Case Study to broaden our product knowledge, implement the stuff we've discussed on other posts, sharpen our financial analytical skills, and hopefully shapes the mindset you may be comfortable with to generate a sound financial plan.


Subject to popularity (I would personally say: popular = 20+ net post upvotes &amp; at least 8 participants commenting), this may lead to a monthly event. So, don't be shy to drop in any solution you may think is appropriate, no matter how strange it may sound.. it may inspire others to improvise.


If you are an expert at a particular topic at hand, it may be best to refrain in providing complete solutions in one go, so others will have the opportunity to be involved. Upvote/downvote inside comments will also be disabled to encourage discussion and bias toward one particular solution. Then, if possible, it will be much appreciated if experts can provide their own solution at the end of 7 days after commencement.


Here we go!!


___



You are: 23 years old Male.


HECS Debt: $20,000.


Cash at bank: $10,000.


1 Credit card debt: $2,500 15% interest p.a.


Car loan: $20,000 into a $30,000 loan. 9% interest p.a. You signed a lousy contract that says if you miss payment for 3 consecutive months, you lose your beloved car.


Expected monthly expenses: $2,500 inc rental  of $1,500.


Has just finished internship, followed by an offer to a full time position. You have accepted the offer. Salary of $45,000 p.a + 9% Super.



Will move in with your hot girlfriend of 5 years, considering to get married in 2 years time and purchase your first house. Girlfriend is not much of a saver, no assets at all - but also no liabilities. So she's out of the picture.


In previous jobs, already has super fund with HESTA, OnePath, and AMP. Not sure how much are you have inside.


You have been reading AusFinance for a while, and considering to take up insurance inside super as don't want to disturb your current lifestyle, though you don't know how much insurance you should have.


If your research says you're a big dreamer; you don't mind having to change your mind to not get married in 2 years, purchase a property, and to reduce your lifestyle expenses.



*TLDR*: you would like to know what you should do with your superannuation, insurance, and whether you can achieve your goal in 2 years.


That's it! let me know if I missed a few details that may be required in your analysis. Do realise you don't have to provide solution to all problems at once, i.e. if you only know something about buying first property, feel free to just correspond only with that particular needs.



Hopefully you'd be as geeky as I am! Let's enjoy this :P



Discussion should end after 7 days on 23 Dec 2012.




**+ Edit 1**: I just realised I worded the car loan wrongly. It was intended to be $20k left in a $30k car loan, which sounds more realistic for someone to service $10k after 2-3 years loan as a student. should've re-read what I wrote. but oh well.. it just makes this more interesting. let's go with $10k left, all good! he got lucky his dad helped a bit with to pay it up, but no more help from the old folk. Some propose to sell the car, so I'll add: Depreciation of the car around 30%, thus current market value is $20k. No terms on loan as long as repayments are paid each month.



Also, why are most of us only doing rough estimates and only focuses on cashflow problem? I can see lots of smart people with common sense, but we also discussed a lot of products on other posts re. purchasing first home, stuff to look for in super. also, you haven't figure out how much insurance you need."

I'm majoring in Chemical Engineering. I hate every class and am only interested in earning the money after graduation. But my grades are so bad that I can't even get an internship.

This semester I had Calc III, Organic Chemistry, Scientific Computing, Physics, and Material Balances. I failed every test for Calc III and Material Balances and likely failed the final exams. I had to cheat throughout Physics since I lacked any ability to memorize and manipulate the equations. 

I was doing great in Scientific Computing until we had to learn C programming. The program wouldn't download on my computer and in a haste to turn in the last two assignments, I asked another student to send me hers to turn in. The TA figured out I used her code and won't give me the points for it anyway. I feel even worse knowing that the girl who helped me got dragged into it; thankfully, she didn't get in trouble for it. I'm now going from an A to probably a C or D.

I already have a shoddy 2.8 from my freshman year. My goal this year was to get a 3.0, but now my GPA is going to drop even lower. I have no friends in or outside of school.  I did have one outside of school, but all he does is smoke, drink, and get in trouble with the law. I actually got my first charge hanging out with him. I'm sure it's another thing keeping me from getting an internship, but it's supposed to get dismissed next year.

My family doesn't know about most of this, but they will when my final grades come out. Everyday I feel so much guilt and fear thinking of how shitty my transcript is going to look. I feel so far behind the rest of my classmates. It doesn't help that I live off campus and have a harder time bonding and studying with them.

I also feel guilty knowing that my dad is struggling to pay for my tuition and here I am getting bad grades anyway. I never thought I was stupid but I literally cannot retain most of the things I am ""learning.""

I feel very alone and this is the first time that I shared this."

Then I broke up with my boyfriend and had some stressful final uni assessments but I got through it fine and was feeling so great for a while. But now I can feel myself slipping back into the darkness. 

I finished university and can't find a job, have no money, don't see my friends as often as I'd like to, and just quit another internship because I couldn't afford the bus fare and they weren't giving me anything to go. I'm feeling more and more like my city has nothing to offer me. 

I'm so lonely and I walk around with the same weight pressing down on my chest that I remember so well from when I was at my worst before the medication. I really don't want to go back on the meds but I don't want to start sinking again. I'm so upset about this. Penny for your thoughts?"
14zhpp,3,2012-12-17,My GF [21F] of 5 months is really distant with me [21M]... will she ever come around?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14zhpp/my_gf_21f_of_5_months_is_really_distant_with_me/,"**Relevant background info**

* We've been officially dating for 5 months

* It's been an LDR (3 hours apart) due to separate universities for all but the first month

* We've known each other since we were 3, have been very close friends since high school

* We found out from each other when we started dating that we had huge crushes on each other ever since high school

* She has trust issues due to an abusive father who died when she was 13.

* She also has anxiety issues, it built up untreated until two years ago when she had a severe anxiety attack but she is now on medication and sees a therapist

**What's been bothering me**
Like I said, I always had a huge crush on her in high school. Due to the separate universities we lost contact for a couple years but the year before we started dating we reconnected or whatever; we talked almost every day. Finally started dating in the summer. She was really hesitant at first because she said she is normally ""addicted to assholes"" and that she has issues trusting people and becoming too close to people who she doesn't want to lose. But we started dating anyway.

I love spending time with her, she's beautiful to me, we have a ton in common, similar goals and beliefs and everything. The thing is, she's just really distant with me. Like it took a long time before we had our first kiss, and when we do kiss a lot of times she'll just lay there and it's pretty much like she's not really kissing me back. And it's not like she's been like this in every relationship--in high school I remember her fooling around with other guys and she was much more enthusiastic about making out (and sleeping with) them.

What also bothers me is that she hasn't visited me once this year, but I've gone to visit her 5 times. Granted she is very busy with school, but I don't know why she can't just drive over on a Friday and leave on Saturday if she had to, because that's what I did every time I visited. Since I thought being ""busy"" was the problem, I also invited her to visit after her last final was over, but she declined. And since I'm spending half of winter break at my parents new house halfway across the country, I asked if she wanted to visit (my mom said she would pay the plane ticket even), to which she declined also. Her reason was that she didn't want to feel rushed getting ready for her internship that starts at the beginning of next year.

So it just feels like I have a girlfriend who doesn't really care about me and isn't really that interested in me. The thing that complicates though is that while blackout drunk I made out with another girl a couple weeks ago and immediately told her about it. I know it was a horrible mistake but I would never in my right mind hurt her; I just think it was this dissatisfaction that caused me to do that in my inebriated state. But for whatever reason, she didn't break up with me.

**What I've done/am doing about it**
I told her on the phone the other day how it bothered me that I'm the only one who went to visit, and that she didn't visit when she was obviously free. I asked her why she did that and she said she didn't know. The thing is I don't think I expressed well enough how much this stuff has been bothering me. After my last final this week we're going to be in the same town for 6 days and will be hanging out during part of them, so I plan on bringing this up again, as well the other things that have been bothering me.

**Halp?**
Idk, can anyone help me sort this out? It's just all so complicated given our past friendship, how we wanted each other when we were friends, then how she's been distant, then how I cheated and she took me back. It just feels like she's always been keeping me at arms length, and I think that's what caused me to do what I did.

Is it likely at all that she will ever come around? If there's any relationship that I would be willing to work for it would be one with her so I know any solution will take time and I am willing to do that, but does this just sound like there is no hope at all for a functional relationship?

Any advice would be super helpful. Thanks!

14zbfd,1,2012-12-17,Tattoo Noob: Planning to get my first one over winter break in the Dominican Republic. ,elfishwebbly,tattoos,https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/14zbfd/tattoo_noob_planning_to_get_my_first_one_over/,"Hello r/tattoos!

Thank you for spending the time to read this post. I've considered getting a tattoo for a while and I have recently found a design that I want to get, but I wanted to consult you guys first. 

[Design from Ryan Plett.](https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdjme3FHJw1qzdcn0o1_1280.jpg)

The only alteration that I want to make is that I want the Southern Hemisphere on top, or what Wikipedia calls a [Reversed Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upside_down_map). 

I currently live in Boston but I will be visiting my family for winter break, approximately 3 weeks, in which they live in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic (DR). 

With this break, I thought I could seize the opportunity of getting the tattoo there an have it heal/maintenance seeing how I won't be doing anything physically intensive in the DR, just research and typing up papers. The only issue that I have with this plan is the same issue a have with everything else in the DR: standards. 

When it comes to the Dominican Republic, you cannot come with the same mindset as an American. Understanding that the DR does not have the same resources as an industrialized country is fundamental when understanding their issues with poverty, healthcare and education. Even though we're strictly dealing with the concept of getting a tattoo, there are universal problems such as hygiene, cleanliness, etc. I'm not saying this is the case for every Dominican institution and establishment, but it is quite prevalent. 

In the case that I do get the tattoo in the DR, I want to go to the top-notch place. I don't know which one it is yet, but I'll be asking around friends, family and former colleagues. There is no equivalent of Yelp, so many businesses rely on word of mouth. 

**I have no previous knowledge of standards and procedures when it comes to get a tattoo.**

- What should I be looking out for? Health codes? Materials being used?
- Is there anyone else who has gotten a tattoo in the DR? 
- Am I supposed to provide a stencil or drawing of some sort?
- Does anyone have/can draw Plett's design with the Southern Hemisphere on top? 
- Does the +90 F degree weather affect the healing process? 
- I've done a search in this subreddit and no results come up for ""Santo Domingo"" or ""Dominican Republic"" in an attempt to see if someone has done this down there as well. 
- **How bad is the pain? Can you compare it to something?**

After finals, I will be asking my Dominican friends and family members if they've heard of any great places, top of the line. The last thing I want to happen if for my first tattoo to get screwed up, hence why I come to you guys. 

**My other option: Boston**

I currently attend BU for undergrad, and one of the top rated places on Yelp is *Good Faith Tattoos*, which is right on campus. My only concern is that once I get back, I jump straight into my routine of running/biking around to class, internship, work , and cycling practice. and that it may exacerbate the tattoo. I will have the opportunity of getting it at a reputable tattoo place, but I don't want to risk damaging the tattoo due to the extra stress of my daily activities, absent in winter break in the DR. 

- Adding the fact that I'll have to wait another three weeks, very slow weeks mind you, I might just say fuck it, and get it in the DR. 

I want to reiterate that I am not saying that the DR is a terrible place to get anything. It is a beautiful country to visit, awesome beaches and phenomenal food. But when it comes to getting a tattoo that I will have for the rest of my life, I don't want to mess up.

Thanks again!!!

EDIT: Removed price questions after reading the sidebar. 

**tldr: Should I get my first tattoo over winter break in the Dominican Republic so it could heal while I'm over there or wait until I get to Boston to get it during the academic year and cycling training?**"

Of course, like any transfer student, there are many variables to consider. So I wanted to get some of your experiences on the school. I have been there many times last year while working at the DNC to recruit interns and my thoughts on the school (and please know that I say this very cautiously):

1. The campus is very nice. Im not sure how new everything is, but it looks very nice.

2. The general student body really did not impress me. I feel like the vibe I get from UNCC students (and keep in mind this is through limited interactions) is that more kids there are interested in socializing and having a good time than they are interested in academics and pushing themselves professionally. This makes concerns me a bit and isn't eased by the poor ranking nationally that UNCC receives. I really can't say this without coming off in a rude manner, but this is just the feelings I get from it while I am there. 

3. I would be using public transit there and it doesn't appear that that would be a great option (any experience with this?)

Other schools I am considering are NC State and Queens University. "

I've interned for one company in the past that would like to bring me back, but they require a pre-employment hair test due to federal regulations. 

For the past few years I haven't minded the test too much as it isn't much trouble to stop smoking and take the test, but last year I really didn't enjoy the process. Normally, I am sent to a very professional clinic in my home town that makes the test go very smoothly. Last year, I had to drive an hour each way to an extremely shady testing facility, spend 40 - 60 minutes in the waiting room, spend another 25 minutes while they administered the test, and I was treated terribly by the staff the entire time. I would really like to avoid that again.

If anyone knows of an Ent run, or Ent friendly, company that might be willing to hire an Electrical/Computer Engineering student for the summer, I would really like to know about it. 

Thanks.

tl;dr: I dislike drug tests and would like an internship that doesn't require one."

2010 and 2011 were really hard for me. I had a really bad break-up, a hard time dealing with it and then a getting-back-together phase, I had to wait months for my B.A. to go through and couldn't enrol in M.A. classes, I had to work a no-brain job just to get some money in...

2012 was completely different. I quit the no-brain job, had enough money to go on an amazing holiday of 6 weeks, learned a lot, went to some great concerts, got enrolled in a university in a new town I really like, started an internship, and my long-distance relationship is working out great, too! We're at a point where we can see us having kids when I am done with university, so in about two years. For the first time in what feels like ages, I can say I had a great year. 

How about you? What was the last year like for you girls?

She did a semester at my school, and has to go back to Turkey for two more semesters. I have one more semester until moving out to a new city to begin work. She has looked into United States summer internships, with some help from me, and is applying to a few national companies that could potentially have internships in the city that I am going to be working in. The internship processes don't kick off until late January, when she will already be gone. The odds are definitely very slim that she will get an internship in the United States, even though she is very qualified. Even if she does, if it isn't in the same city it could make it tough (although I think we could work it out for the summer, and then if she gets a full time offer she could try to transfer). In the end, she won't know how her summer will be spent until the end of March or so.

Basically, we don't know how we should leave it off when she goes back in January. We could stay together and see how the internship process pans out, or break up and see what happens/potentially get back together if she is lucky enough to get something. With the chances of getting a US internship pretty slim, part of me doesn't want to put too much pressure on her doing well in these interviews should she get any, and another part of me thinks that if we break up, she won't be as motivated to do well.

150tgq,1,2012-12-17,"I [24/m] have been receiving mixed signals from a girl [22/f], and was just wondering what I should make of it. Could someone help me sort this one out?",RA_throwaway123123,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/150tgq/i_24m_have_been_receiving_mixed_signals_from_a/,"Hey RA, I'm a bit confused about something going on in my life, and thought I'd come ask you. I'll [try to] keep my story short and simple so I don't romanticize or take too much of your time:

----

Over the summer, I became acquainted with a girl during my internship on the other side of the country. Lets call this girl B. Because of a few [good] reasons, B and I never really spent any time together, but were always exceedingly friendly towards each other. I always had a small thing for her and was kind of upset when I had to go back home at the end of the summer.

Fast forward one month, and I'm back in town for unrelated reasons and happen to run into her. I was on a time crunch and wasn't staying long, but the encounter went well and we were both happy to have seen each other again. Happy enough, at least, for B to find me about a week later so we could stay in touch.

At first, our conversations went good and long (sometimes lasting upwards of eight hours). It became clear that if it weren't for the distance, we could have a great relationship or, at the very least, a fantastic friendship. 

But as time went on, I felt like B's attitude and feelings towards me changed frequently. One moment we would have extremely flirtatious conversation, and the next she would not respond to anything I said for hours (we mostly conversed through texts, and occasionally had phone conversations).

I took this as a sign that B wasn't all that interested, or didn't want to get involved in anything that can't come to fruition for at least a few more months (I took a job at the company I interned at and will be moving out there next summer). In response, I decided to drop the idea and take a step back, thinking that the last thing I wanted to do was pursue something that ~~wasn't~~ couldn't be there [yet]. ""No big deal"", I thought, ""now's not the right time.""

And this is where I get really confused. After stepping back, and not texting her for a few days, B will send me a cute message (""good morning!"", "":D"", etc...you know the kind you send when you're thinking of someone), and a conversation will continue as if nothing had changed. After a few hours or days of this, she'll again seem to lose interest and the cycle continues.

----

I was asked what I wanted out of this, and had to think about that.

The romantic in me would want to see things through, and build a relationship out of this. Conversing with her has only solidified my original impression: she's an amazingly interesting and beautiful woman. But the realist in me recognizes that our current situation doesn't allow for this, and I would really just be happy with understanding what's happening so I don't lose a friendship because I expected something that wasn't there.

----

So, RA, what do you think? What would you do in my position?

I have my own thoughts on what's going on, but would rather hear your un-spoiled opinions before I share my own.

**TL;DR** Summer acquaintance seems interested, we flirt / talk a lot, but then she drops the conversation mid-flirt. Not sure if she's not interested, or if I'm misreading something.

154xed,1,2012-12-19,"Current student considering nursing, advice needed",[deleted],nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/154xed/current_student_considering_nursing_advice_needed/,"Hi everyone, I'm currently a junior in a Dietetics program. I have been having a lot of doubts about my career choice lately. The more I hear about dietetics and the more dietitians I meet, the less enthusiastic I am about the career. Initially I was more interested in a community nutrition field, but now I realize that I am much more interested in the medical and clinical aspects. I am also feeling a little discouraged at what appears to be a very narrow influence dietitians have on patients in a hospital setting. 

I am considering nursing because I feel that as a nurse I would have a better opportunity to influence the entire health of a patient, rather than just focusing on what they eat. It also seems that nurses are much more respected as members of the healthcare team and better compensated for the amount of education they receive in comparison to dietitians. They also seem to have more opportunities for advancement.  

As a dietetics student, I am required to take many of the pre-req courses that the nursing program needs. Except instead of taking the specific science courses designed for nurses, I have taken the longer route of taking a full year of general chemistry and organic chemistry, as well as the more advanced anatomy, physiology, and microbiology courses. Since I have taken this longer route, I will not actually be eligible to apply to the nursing program until this upcoming September. At that point, I will be in my final year of dietetics. I feel a little bad about ""throwing away"" my dietetics degree, since I will only have a year left, but I also feel silly working so hard in my food service and metabolism courses when I know dietetics is not for me.

Should I go ahead and finish my B.S. in Dietetics before applying to nursing programs? Will my Dietetics background help me out at all in the application process for nursing school? Another option I was considering was going to school to be a Physician Assistant, but because direct patient contact as a healthcare provider is required I would need to be accepted to and complete a year long Dietetics internship, find a job as a Dietitian, and work for awhile to gain that experience... It seems like a very long and expensive journey. 

I would really appreciate any advice. Thank you very much. "

Long story short, my boyfriend of a year and a half finally admitted he isn't attracted to me anymore.  The signs were obvious for a while now, but I was ignoring them because, well, I didn't want to lose him.  The timing really sucks, because he's supposed to be meeting my extended family at my family's Christmas party this week.  We're thinking about faking the relationship until the break is over just so we don't need to deal with the fallout from our respective circles of people.  I had just come out to my extended family to be with him, so it's really fucking awkward for him to bail at this point.

The shitty part comes in when I realize that the next year and a half of my life was literally planned around him.  He's in the military right now, and the plan was that once I finished college I would be applying for an internship in the base he was stationed at, and we'd live together on base so we'd be close to our work and each other.

I'm rather young (early twenties), so I know I'll eventually move on and meet other people.  It's just... I don't know.  Not exactly the best holiday season I've had.

**Update:**  We're officially separated now.  Still exchanging Christmas presents, he still wants the engraved birthday present for memory's sake.  Thanks everyone for the support and advice.  We're being honest about it, no faking being together over the holidays.  We're still going to be friends, even though I know it'll be hard seeing him the first couple of times."
153lmj,4,2012-12-19,[21/m] Relationship with my mom is going downhill fast,FoxgirlMaster,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/153lmj/21m_relationship_with_my_mom_is_going_downhill/,"**Some quick background**:

It's been on the decline for the past 3 years I've been on college. I go to a university 1.5 hours from home. I come home or she visits me rather often. My grades have not been stellar, and I didn't do great this semester (better than usual, still not great) and I'm borderline on continuing my degree. 

**Where it starts**:

Last summer I took a class at a community college and did decently. I was taking class 2 nights a week, left home at 5 p.m., got back at 10 p.m. and ate whatever was left for me. Conversed with parents for a few minutes before they went to bed. I proceeded to play games from 11 p.m. until 1 or 2 a.m. I also took recreational judo two nights I had off, for 1.5 hours at night. Essentially my free nights were Friday Saturday and Sunday, and I usually umpired baseball Saturday + Sunday (about 10 - 12 hours both days). My mom complained to me all summer about not hanging out with friends (who were working internships all summer 9 - 5, when I was studying/at home).

I scored a 76, a 96, and a 55 on my tests before the final. Everyone did horribly on the third test. My parents were upset (so was I) and automatically said video games are what caused my poor grades (mind you I studied from 12 - 5 every afternoon, and played video games after class). They completely grounded me from them, saying they would revoke all financial support for me if they found me playing games, saying if I spent that time studying it would not have happened. I studied my ass off for my final in hopes of being ungrounded if I made a good grade. I made a 94 and they attributed my success to not playing video games. I was forced to end my last week of summer either watching tv or browsing reddit.

This upset me because I was not allowed to spend my free time as I wanted as well as having games I had spent MY money on taken from me.

They slackened it while I was back at uni, saying I could play console games as long as I had a friend physically in the room with me. Finished semester with a 2.72 GPA. Mom is horribly upset for me. Keeps talking about how stressed SHE is about my grades (she's been like that since I started college), and never listens to how stressed I am about it. It feels like I'm having to carry her (emotionally) through college with me. I am allowed video games, but with conditions (minor issue at this moment). 

**Why I'm posting here**:

I feel like I keep disappointing my parents. My mom and I got into a fight today because she feels ""uncomfortable: with my ""obsession"" with anime and ""girls who look like they are from cartoons"" (I post kpop songs on my facebook. Most of my friends actually enjoy it.) She also told me that having ""Internet Friends"" on my facebook is ""not normal"" and that I should be hanging out with ""real friends"" more. I hung out with my best friends nearly every day at university, but apparently she'd rather me go out and party instead of talking to people online who share my interests. Dad was really rational about this. Still went through and deleted everything/removed friends in order to keep peace.

I've also been having suicidal thoughts recently. I can't tell if it's just the stress or what have you. I sometimes feel as though I'm letting them down despite trying my best in college. I am going to see a therapist soon, at both mine and my parents urges. I know all these thoughts stem from how my mom acts towards me, so I at least know where to start. **I UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT THING TO DO, NOR DO I PLAN ON DOING IT**

I don't get to do the things I love because of school (had to stop judo because I had tutoring during those times). My mom would rather me go out and drink (neither of my best friends drink) than play video games. 

I feel like she NEEDS to control my life. I need her support, not her control. I know I should become financially independent, but I can barely balance going to school full time. There's no way I could work enough to afford my apartment and do well in school. I keep telling myself just to make it through these next few years, but everything keeps turning into a fight and I have to keep losing in order to pursue my degree.

How do I repair this crumbling relationship before we both hate each other? She tells me she is doing this for me and because she loves me, but I have a hard time believing that because it's so overboard.

**TL;DR** Mom wants to control my life, and I have to let her because money."

1535zc,3,2012-12-18,so painfully demoralized ,PastLifePlatypus,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1535zc/so_painfully_demoralized/,"Hello Reddit.  This is my first post.


I am two days away from the end of my third semester studying engineering.  Not counting the 3 classes I took this past summer to make up for the math class I failed and to meet other basic requirements of my major.  For the third time I am struggling through my finals with abysmal semester grades.


I feel like a failure.  I love my major.  I like almost every class I take.  But it constantly feel like I am all ways too little too late.  A typical week involves me barely keeping ahead of the tidal wave of homework without enough leftover time to really master the material, explore the city I’m in, pursue any of my outside interests, or go out with friends.  It feels terrible to have so much passion and interest for what I’m studying and to routinely scrape by with the bare minimum. 


I really get down when I think about how everything feeds into each other.  I have about a 2.20 GPA, which makes it hard to get internships or research positions (again, things I love to do!), which makes it hard to get experience, which will then make it hard to get a good and fascinating job.  I fell like more and more options close every time I cannot get my shit together.  I have so much guilt for wasting my mother’s money.  One of my professors was so supportive and has been helping and rooting for me all semester and I feel like I failed him with how badly I did on the final.  I even have a final tomorrow in a class where all my friends are shooting for A’s while I will be happy to get a C.  Instead of studying I feel so helpless and worthless after failing my math final today.

It is so hard to watch people around me who don’t care about what they are learning to constantly do much better than me with much less work.  For god’s sake my roommate last year smoked up before doing physics hw and I’m struggling to solve the problems this year.
I’ve tried eliminating everything that could be screwing up my academics.  My therapist and I work on the test anxiety and academic stress I picked up in high school (very competitive private school, A- was considered a bad grade).

While I haven’t decided if I really want to go to medical school, my number one reason against going is I won’t get accepted anywhere because of my performance.  I never have the numbers.

I am looking forward to next semester though.  I get to take some really cool classes, I broke up with my gf who was making me so unhappy, I have a great family at college, and I am hopeful that I can really turn it around.  But right now I’m just so tired and demoralized.

I’m looking at r/GetStudying and r/GetMotivated, but any ideas or study methods would be greatly appreciated.

Does anyone have words of wisdom or encouragement?

I recently have relocated to a new area and don't have a network of people I can use to get the word out that I am here!(And pretty dang affordable as well) I have a website, a facebook page, and have posted ads on Craigslist. I can't afford online ads at the moment. Should I be printing out flyers and throwing them in the street? All the photos I have on my website are close friends/family, most in the last area I was in. Which gives you an idea of how many actual clients I've had.

So, how can I get the word out that I exist, and make myself sound/look appealing to clients? Please help me, oh experienced ones.

152zn4,6,2012-12-18,I'm probably going to fail a gen. ed. class this semester.,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/152zn4/im_probably_going_to_fail_a_gen_ed_class_this/,"That's the long and short of it. I don't have the final pass/fail grade yet; the teacher hasn't posted it on the course website, despite an email saying that all our final grades are posted, and final letter grades don't have to be submitted to the university until this Friday, so I suppose it is not impossible that the teacher would have mercy on me, but it is highly unlikely that I'll pass. 47 on the first exam, 65 on the second, 47 again on the third. Yeah, I don't see that turning somehow into a passing grade. I'm convinced the teacher absolutely hates me as well; I somehow got a 2/100 on the last lab report despite almost definitely getting a hell of a lot more points on it than that. There's one section I didn't have time to fill out, but there's no way in hell that translates into 2/100. I should really send her an email asking how in the world that was calculated, but I'm too embarrassed. 

What follows is a wall of text. Don't really expect anybody to read this, but it feels good to just lay it all out.

I didn't mean for it to be this way. I'm normally a model student. A few factors I suppose caused everything to go wrong with this class: 

(1) I took it pass/fail, which made me aim for a C/B grade rather than an A. 

(2) I started a pretty intense internship hunt and had to miss lots of classes for interviews, not to mention all the time I spent preparing for technical interviews. I prioritized this preparation over homework/studying for this GE class. The good news is I managed to snag an internship at Google... but I wonder if even that will be enough. Hell, if I apply for full-time work at Google, even with an internship under my belt they'll want to see my transcript, and I don't know if I'll get an offer with an F on it, no matter what class it happens to be in.

(3) This particular general education class turned out to be by far the hardest gen. ed. class I've taken in college, requiring much, much more memorization than I expected. 

(4) We didn't get our first exam grade back until far after the drop date, so I didn't realize I was on the track to fail until it was almost too late. By that time, I was so absorbed with interviews and massive final projects for other classes that it was just laughable to think that I could somehow find time to memorize enough material in order to ace the final and thereby get a passing grade.

(5) I've already taken twice my fair share of distribution classes. I transferred universities, but guess what didn't come along with me? My distribution classes. I got completely generic transfer credit, meaning I've now had to fulfill the distribution requirements at two separate universities independently. I'm a math major looking for software jobs, but I've taken a year of art history, the philosophy of art, the philosophy of ethics, 19th century American literature, history of American literature, Brazilian ethnography (I had to painstakingly read papers only available in Portuguese to do my own research in that class--guess which language I don't know hardly a word of? What was my major again?), linguistics, swimming, salsa dancing, multiple history classes, game theory, economics, creative writing, Russian, and more...

When can I focus on what I'm here for? Haven't I done enough? I'm overworked and burnt out on college.

(6) One of my CS classes had what I consider to be an almost unethical work load at the end of the semester. I had no time to spend on any of my other classes. With no procrastination whatsoever, my partner and I still pulled three all nighters, as did the rest of the class. This was after already working on the project for a few weeks. The professor himself pulled one all nighter with the class on this project. It was absolutely ridiculous. Not only did it keep me from studying *at all* for other classes, but it was very unhealthy too. My poor partner managed to survive it all only through lots of Adderall usage. I stayed away from that and just somehow made it through the hellish experience. I don't want to speculate on how many empty Monster cans the rest of the class managed to produce.

Regardless, it is truly not right in my opinion for any one class to have so much fucking work. I could have passed this other class if I had been aware of the unrelenting onslaught that would be thrown at me by this single project for this single CS class and therefore prepared ahead of time... except I was still having to fly to SF and other places at that time for day-long interviews.

It makes me pretty angry looking back at the classes I missed so I could go get wined and dined by some ridiculously rich company that it turns out wasn't even really interested in me, but they're swimming in so much VC cash that they can fly out *internship candidates* and put them in five star hotels. One company in particular didn't even give me a phone interview. I just took their little programming challenge and before I knew it was being requested to miss three days of class so I could go explore Palo Alto and have a full day of interviews. They didn't even keep me around for that full day; they asked me to leave after lunch, along with ~15 other candidates.

Honestly, I don't give a shit about the wining and dining. I'm not some executive. I'm a college student who really shouldn't be missing classes for your company unless you're serious about interviewing me. So I don't appreciate it when I take a big risk to come visit your company and you don't even finish out the day of interviews because you have so much money you can just fly out every single CS student from a good college every week.

I've done all the math. This F will take my GPA from ~3.6 to ~3.3, and it will require a whopping 8 straight As to get it above 3.5 again. Since that's about two semesters' worth of work, that means it won't possibly be in the 3.5+ range again until my final semester, but I'll start applying for full-time jobs in Fall 2013.

I'm mostly worried about how this will look to employers. I'm afraid that if a potential employer asks for a transcript and sees an F, even if it is a class that couldn't be further removed from my major and profession, they will just skip me.

Now it is pretty rare to have to supply transcripts. Google is the only tech company I know of that actually asks for them. However, it is less uncommon for companies to ask for a GPA. I'm afraid I'll get excluded from interviews just because of this one class, by far one of the least important classes I'll ever take in my life (no offense meant to the professor, of course--just an honest evaluation of how the material will factor into what I plan to do). I suppose I could slyly include my major GPA, which is unaffected by this fatal mistake, but I don't like the idea of that form of subtle dishonesty."

I just posted here a few days ago, so you can find my story on my profile ([20F], ex is [20M])

It's only been a few days (actually, only since Monday night), so I'm still not doing great, but I'm doing a lot better. I read what people said on here, and although I did not maintain no contact (ended up chatting with him one last time, which ended up being good. Closure, you know?), I rarely feel the urge to talk to him now. The most helpful thing that people have said (for me), was to make full use of your support network, talk to your friends even when you don't really feel like it. And focus on your own life. I've been keeping myself busy applying to internships and such for the summer, and working various things out for next term of school. And everything's been going pretty good. I got an email back from someone this morning that said exactly what I wanted it to say, and I was genuinely, feel-like-dancing-type happy for a little while. So that was nice.

The worst parts are in the morning and at night when I'm trying to get to sleep. When I wake up, I just don't feel motivated to do anything -- most of this is my fault. When we were together, he was my motivation, I'm just that kind of person. Like, I need to exercise to stay pretty for him, I need to study to be smart enough for him, I need to apply to internships and shit to have plenty of options so we can be together for the summer, etc. I don't know if I actually believed it, I think it just helped me get off my ass. Now I don't really have that, and I have to motivate myself to do things just for me, and that's hard and different. So I think that's why there's the lag time in the morning trying to get myself out of bed. Ironically enough though, I feel like I was a more ambitious person back in high school than I am now, and I wasn't in a relationship in high school, so I guess that means I used to be pretty good at self-motivation.

Nights are pretty bad too. We used to sleep in the same bed a lot, and it's hard to fall asleep knowing that he's not there, and he'll never be there again. I just feel really, really lonely. Like lonelier than I've ever felt. Which is weird to me because he was my first boyfriend, and I was just fine 2 years ago before I had anyone. And I've been talking to friends a lot, and have my family with me, so it's not like I'm actually alone. But still, I feel SO lonely. It's insane. I usually just cry it out for a few hours and exhaust myself to sleep. Doesn't seem like the ideal solution, but I'm not really sure what else to do. It'll get better, this works for now.

Hope you all are doing okay! And if not, you'll get there. And I'll get there too :)

Oh, also, this is the first time I've been able to post on this subreddit without bursting out crying. Maybe I'm just out of tears, but I like to think that it means I'm moving on."
1554u2,2,2012-12-19,"Just graduated, moving to NYC, would you guys take 5 and grade my plan-of-attack for this undertaking?",scadler,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1554u2/just_graduated_moving_to_nyc_would_you_guys_take/,"TL;DR- just graduated, moving to the city, does this plan of attack seem feasible?

Hi all.

I Just graduated from university in Nashville. I've done a plethora of internships in my area(entertainment industry) during my undergrad, including one in NYC, one in San Fran, and one in Buenos Aires. I spent a week in NY back in mid-November and had about five job interviews there during that time, all of whom said to stay in touch. I just returned from a post-grad trip where I had two follow up interviews-- no offers, but they both said even if they had something to offer me they couldn't do anything until I was local to the area. 

I am confident that I will be able to find a position within a month or so. If not, I know I'll be able to make ends meet until I do, whether that's waiting tables or something else. I have a spectacular resume &amp; references which speak for themselves. I have spent time there and know the city decently well, and have an okay-ish network of friends and family there. Given all this, I kind of decided to pull the trigger and go ahead and take the plunge.

I'm going up for New Years from the 29th through the 1st. Over the course of the past month, I've just been bookmarking rooms/shares that seem like they might be a good fit, money and people wise, just to get an idea. I decided that taking a room / subletting in an already filled place would be best-- I have local friends there and etc sure, but without having that safety net of friends to hang around with and go out with, I figured slipping into an apartment that already has people of vaguely similar mindset there would be best.

As of right now I'm in the process of moving out of my place in Nashville. My intentions stand at emailing the shit out CL ads and seeing if I can come look at places on the 29th, 30th, possibly the 31st. Ideally I would find a place during that time, but if not, the plan B would be cancelling my return flight and couch-bumming until I found a place to live, at which point I'd come back down to Nashville to gather a few small things. I'm leaving most of my furniture here or selling it, and predominantly focusing on ""furnished"" places(i.e. comes with bed).

Does this sound like a feasible plan of attack? Given that, outside of NYE festivities(perhaps a concert or two), my #1 priority and focus would be finding a place, I can't imagine not being able to find something by January... 7th at the latest? Its a huge undertaking and I'm prepared for that. I just wanted to get /r/nyc's thoughts. Thanks fellas."

I'm 19 and a full time college student who will be going on interviews for an engineering internship next summer so I don't want anything trendy, but I would like them to look nice.  I was thinking about a 3-3.5"" heel and plain black leather or possibly suede, and I like almond toes.

157xtz,1,2012-12-21,FWB of 3 years and I wish he would contact me so I can officially cut the cord for good...,redballoon23,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/157xtz/fwb_of_3_years_and_i_wish_he_would_contact_me_so/,"I'm 20/f and he's 20/m. We will call him J.  We met our freshman year of college from mutual friends. We ended up clicking massively the first time we met, before the drinking, and then the drinking facilitated our eventual hook up. We hooked up all of freshman year. I was highly depressed, liked J a lot, he told me he wasn't interested in a relationship. It stung but I got over it, after all, I had a campus FULL of hot, intelligent men, who was J but some dork who just wanted to get laid? 

I continued to hook up with him because I enjoyed it. He was really giving when we hooked up and always made me feel great. He treated me really well and acted like he cared about me. 

Sophomore year of college I got a boyfriend. We started dating in August. Boyfriend and I have been very on and off due to his volatile personality. We had a physical altercation in Nov 2012 and we broke up for 2 weeks. I went back to J after the first week. No hooking up, but he was there for me. I overdosed on pills after my ex and I fought. J talked to me and I told him everything. I came undone. He told me my life was crazy, and I agree with him. A week later the ex and I got back together. I didn't talk to J again until April.

In April I was being ignored and let down constantly by my boyfriend. He's got a mental disorder, of what type I have no idea, but he is extremely difficult to deal with. J and I met up, and hooked up. I told him I wanted him still, and that I wanted to break up with the boyfriend. He insisted that I not do it for him because he does NOT want a relationship. He still persisted to talk to me and make me feel better about my shitty situation. J told me I deserved better, and deep down I know I do, but breaking up is hard for me after I've felt so weak for so long.

Summer rolls around and I live with my boyfriend in an apartment. We are both taking summer courses at our university. Our relationship is coasting. We are not happy, but we aren't fighting. We are just there trying to deal with a boat load of classes and not really paying attention to each other. J begins to text me over the summer while he is in an internship in another state. I miss him. He tells me he misses me too. He keeps telling me I deserve better than my boyfriend and that I need to end it because of all of the shit that happened before. We ended up talking about hanging out when school is back in session. He tells me again that if I break up with the BF not to do it for him, because he doesn't want a relationship. I cry, but I'd never tell him how upset it actually makes me that he doesn't see me as a partner. I think back, and back in April, I began to fall in love with J.

So the school year begins and I go to a party at his fraternity, where he refuses to even acknowledge I am alive. I'm drunk, so of course I make a fuss... and make myself look like an idiot, and he calls me later that night after I leave extremely angrily, at 3 am, comes over, fucks me, and leaves. Before J leaves though, I cry and he just stares at me and asks why I'm doing this to him and tells me that I'm being ridiculous and unfair and I've known that he doesn't want anything serious. He ends up walking out because I just stare back at him and can't really say anything because I'm obviously hysterical (and extremely drunk....).

After this, contact ceases for a while. He contacted me again in October... We hooked up, while drunk, and I hate to say this, but he basically forced me to have anal sex with him. The next morning I cried and left because their ""football buddy"" sorority was there and he didn't want them to know I was there, basically. That was the lowest I've ever felt in my entire life. And I vowed not to go back to J after that. I had never felt so devastated that someone I thought I fell in love with could be so bad to me. 

Well, you all can see where this is going. The climax of all of this BS is the end of November. I initially told him no and that he really hurt me last time we were together. He apologized. Whatever. Once again, we were drunk. Stupid college weekends. While we were laying in bed together, we snuggle up, just me, him, and my puppy. I felt perfect in that moment... we eventually started to mess around, where things begin to deteriorate again. He asks me if I can ""struggle against him"" I guess a rape fantasy? Again, this is extremely bad, he bruises me up pretty badly. I DID actually want to have sex this time (mainly because it was not anal...) So no, this time I consider it completely consensual.  But still, the bruises. 

That last incident has really made me see how he views me. As a whore, slut, skank, you name it. He didn't care what he did to my body. He didn't want to protect me, he wanted to hurt me. I just can't believe I let it get this bad. I can't believe I allowed someone to disrespect me like this guy did. This guy that I ""loved"" and continuously sought out and sought me out for THREE YEARS.  

I guess the thing that really baffles my brain is... why me?  In the 3 years, J only hooked up with 2 other girls or so. Why, after 3 years all of of this bullshit, does he still want to come back and mess with my head?  He knows I have feelings for him, so why after 3 years does he keep coming back if he ""doesn't want a relationship""? I don't get it. 

To end, though, he contacted me before break began and told me he was leaving for China for a semester. I guess expecting me to want to hook up? I told him a big fat HELL NO, after everything that happened. He asked me why, and I told him I didn't trust him or feel even remotely comfortable with him like I used to. He says that's ""understandable"" and that he'd like to get lunch before he leaves, just to catch up and talk.  Lunch never happens, he never contacts me, and now I'm just left here to pick up the pieces of myself. 

I know I shouldn't care about this guy, but I do. I know he's a shit to me, but I've loved him for so long now and I just don't understand what is wrong with me and why he would never commit.  It's hard knowing that I can't ever go back to him unless he completely changes his attitude towards me and can give me the relationship I desire with him... :(

I wish he would contact me so I could tell him everything and let him know what point he has driven me to and just to let him know that I'm never coming back again."

I am 23(F) and for my whole life I have been this way.  The first time I remember being severely depressed was about the third grade.  I couldn't stop crying and mentally beating myself up over leaving a homework assignment at home.  I have always lived in my head, and been hard on myself.  

Some days are a lot harder than others.  I strive for perfection, but then sometimes things just snap.  I was an honor roll student in HS, but then my senior year I stopped showing up.  I couldn't get out of bed, and I didn't tell anyone I was skipping.  My mom found out when one of my teachers called her at work asking if I was okay.  

I still graduated and went to college despite failing every class my last term of HS.  At college I tried to seek help from the concealing center, but the councilor there was very inexperienced and I didn't feel comfortable talking with her.  I never went back.  I took a year off and traveled around the world, and I still felt dead inside.  I came back worked, got an internship, volunteered, and completed a half marathon.  Still nothing helps.  I have an awesome job right out of college, but I still have that voice that jumps out of nowhere throughout the day saying things like ""I just want to die, I hate you, and I want everyone to leave me alone.""  It is like a reaction, and not really even me.  I then try to reason with ""the voice"", listing all the things I do well etc... but it doesn't go away.  When I was younger I had panic attacks, but nothing diagnosed.  Those have gone away mostly, but I still get easily anxious when it comes to my performance on things.  

Does it get better with medication or therapy?  My husband is asking me to seek help because it just keeps getting worse.  I am having thoughts of suicide, and I think he is worried since he now possesses a firearm.  I would like help, but there is such a stigma still associated with it (especially in my line of work).  I don't want people to know.  I just want to feel like I don't have to drag myself around throughout the day like a dead weight.  It shouldn't be so hard to brush my teeth, or do my laundry.   Does anyone have advice? "
157ldw,0,2012-12-20,"Feeling anxious and depressed, wishing I could get away.",anonymityanyone,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/157ldw/feeling_anxious_and_depressed_wishing_i_could_get/,"I don't really know where to start because it's all a tangled mess and I end up thinking in circles.

I recently had to move back home (with my parents), I was living in the UK with my boyfriend, and we broke up. We got back together after I had already made plans to leave (I quit my (admittedly crappy) job, closed my bank account, and bought plane tickets). So I still left, at that time it felt like the right thing to do. Now he's making plans to come live with me in Canada, he's applying for a visa, but there's no guarantee he'll get it. IF he gets the visa that's great...except that 4 months after coming home I'm still unemployed. I can't even get a back-up job in the tiny crappy my parents live in. It really sucks. I spend half the time thinking I must have some horrendous failing, and the other half raging at how unfair it is.   
I thought I was on the right track, I have a B.Sc. and I did the co-op program, and an internship after I graduated. I haven't been able to get any other job. Now I'm worried that I've been unemployed too long (there's now a year long gap on my resume since the time after my internship has been spent getting a UK visa, being unemployed in the UK then working at a tennis centre, then coming home and being unemployed). Completing never ending applications and not getting any positive responses has really got me down, and the fact that my boyfriend is hoping to come live with me adds extra pressure to get a job and get out of this place. I'm really stressed and anxious about it.   
Even without that extra pressure I'm desperate to leave this place. For several reasons. Firstly this isn't my home, never has been. My parents moved here just before I moved away for university. I don't know anyone here except my family and I'm very lonely. It's a small place and there aren't many places for me to get out and meet people (unless you include the bowling club I joined, I'm the only one under 50).   
The worst of all of this though is my dad. He has a laundry list of health problems, he's in pain constantly. He's just had a knee replaced, and the other one also needs to be replaced, so he's not very mobile. He has severe arthritis in his neck and shoulder. He's obese and has heart problems. He's on many many medications, mostly pain killers. The weight is a serious problem. While it may not be the root cause of all the health problems (I probably forgot to list several) it certainly worsens them. He was meant to lose weight after he had a heart attack a few years ago (he did but put it back on and more). He was especially meant to lose weight before the knee replacement so that he'd recover properly (in fact they delayed the surgery several months for that reason). Now he's meant to lose weight as he recovers. Instead he yells at us because we won't fetch him sweets, cookies, ice cream, and especially alcohol (it's an absolute no-no with the pain meds he's on). I'm so tired of being yelled for trying to help him. Giving him what he wants would be far worse for him, but I don't want to be yelled at anymore (and I don't want to watch my mom being yelled at even more).   
He is constantly groaning (and shouting) in pain. It's horrible to listen to. My pulse races, my stomach tightens, and I want to run away. It makes me so anxious. The anxiety has gotten so much worse the last couple weeks because a few days before his surgery, he was putting moulding on the wall and he put a nail through his finger with the nail gun (there was a lot of shouting/screaming then). I drove him to the emergency room. Now every time he yells out in pain I imagine he's had an even worse accident.  
So anyway, I want a job to move out and get away from that. Then I feel guilty, because then I'm leaving my mom to deal with that all on her own. She's extremely stressed from all this as well.   
I'm feeling anxious, and depressed, and lonely all the time. I feel like I *need* to get out of this place for my own sanity, but so far I haven't been able to manage it. I can't manage to talk to anyone about it all because I can't do it without crying. Everyday feels worse than the last.  

TL;DR Being unemployed and my dad's health problems and behaviour are making me lose my mind. Wish I could move away.

Here's my situation:

* I'm studying abroad in Senegal for 4 months in the spring. I will be in a major city, so the only backpacking I will be doing would be on the weekends/breaks and for a week or so at the end.
* I will be going straight to Singapore after Senegal for an internship for the summer.
* I plan on doing Peace Corps in the next few years as well as other backpacking trips.
* Specifically looking at packs from REI because I have a $200 gift card there (I'm willing to spend another ~100 on top of that though).

These are the two packs I'm currently looking at:

* http://www.rei.com/product/809156/rei-grand-tour-85-travel-pack-mens
* http://www.rei.com/product/830460/deuter-quantum-7010-travel-backpack

The reason I would rather invest in a travel pack rather than a luggage set is because, like I said, I plan on doing a lot of traveling in remote areas in the next 3-6 years or so and I feel like it would be more suitable for my situation. 

I don't plan on buying a lot of stuff to bring back while I'm abroad this next year, I just need something that I can keep a modest 4 to 7-month supply of clothes/supplies (although I feel like when I get to Singapore I could buy a small suitcase) in while I'm away. 

I just don't know whether I should be fine with a 80-85 L pack or if I should be looking for something larger. I don't feel like lugging around a luggage set if I want to backpack around West Africa.

Thanks!"

Yeah we had some shaky situations like any other couple does, but this was my first serious relationship. It was one of those relationships where not only you and your better half expect to one day be married, but everyone else around you expected it as well. She was an amazing girlfriend. We generally shared a lot of common interests like playing video games, cycling, and playing Ultimate. Almost my entire college career we were known as the couple of _____ and ______.

Last December, I had informed her (let's call her K) that I just got accepted for an internship at Disney World. I would be gone for 7 months. On top of that, the month I would come back from Disney she was going to Costa Rica for 3 weeks to volunteer with ISV to rescue sea turtles. I would not trade those 7 months at Disney for anything, and I'm sure K would not trade those 3 weeks in Costa Rica for anything in the world either but just the combination of distance and time really had us get apart.

When K came back from Costa Rica, she was extremely distant. I had missed her so much and was so grateful for her to come back but all she could think about was how much she ""belongs"" in Costa Rica. 2 days later, she breaks up with me because she wants to live in Costa Rica and she does not want to follow me with my career path (I'm a hospitality management major). Our paths are just too different for us to be together in the long so she decided to end it now rather than later. 

It's not that I don't understand why she did it, but it just sucks. She is 19 and still lives with her parents. Kind of struggling financially and education wise as well so I do not know how she is going to make it to Costa Rica, but I wish her the best of luck. 

3 months later: We are still friends, but to make a longer story short she still comes over to my apartment to ""hang out"". The sex is still nice but it's not helping my mental well being. She wants NOBODY to know that we are still hooking up because all of our friends would judge us. The only positive thing I can see now is that my plans after graduation have changed dramatically. I was originally going to stay in Tallahassee working for a hotel while I waited for K to graduate. Now i can take the best job offer I get and let the wind take me wherever I want to go. 

I don't know why I felt the urge to post to r/BreakUps but I do feel better getting this off my chest. Thank you. "

I know I'll be getting a lot of comments about the age difference, surprisingly it wasn't that big of a deal most of the time, our maturity levels matched in most aspects of the relationship, it was our communication that was terrible.

I tend to be quiet and hold stuff in a lot of the time, he was very outgoing but also tended to hide things, he beat around the bush. 

For example: I was an intern for a music website right around the time we met but I quit because it was ran very unprofessionally. A few months into the relationship, he asked when I would start interning and said I had mentioned it before. I never talked about it, ever. It turned out he had been googling my name and finding out past information about me without telling me. This obviously caused a few arguments.

Anyway, about 9 months into the relationship he claims to have dissociative identity disorder but he has never been properly evaluated. I always noticed he was a little weird but he never had any of these personalities show themselves before, what's even weirder is whenever he gave me a ""tongue lashing"" and apologized for it later he said he knew he was doing it, he just didn't know how to stop. Most people with DID blackout during these sorts of episodes.

I later read up on paranoid schizophrenia and he had all the symptoms. He thought the government was after him, constantly listening to our conversations, that all his friends except one were plotting against him, etc. Longer story short, he got into an argument with me via text message and he just stopped replying. I've run into him a few times since then but we haven't talked.

Anyway, I still have some his shit and we have no mutual friends. One thing including a Christmas present from last year that his step-sisters gave to him and he asked me to hold onto it.

I feel really guilty keeping these things but I don't want to freak the guy out even more, regardless of how shitty he treated me. Any suggestions reddit? Should I just send it to him? Leave it on his doorstep? Like I said he thinks people are after him and he's not getting any treatment so I really don't want to cause some sort of crazy butterfly effect. 

**TL;DR: I still have some of crazy ex's stuff that I feel guilty keeping. I don't want to freak him out but have no ""safe"" way of giving these things back to him.**

**Edit:** I have decided just to send his things to him. I doubt I'll really need to update so thanks again for your advice! :)"
159yqq,8,2012-12-22,Asking for input regarding Einstein-Rosen Bridge generation theory.,Befall,AskScienceFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/159yqq/asking_for_input_regarding_einsteinrosen_bridge/,"Hello,

I've been in development of a machine capable of developing an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, more colloquially known as a *Wormhole*. Our science department has cooked up the massive computing required to calculate and define points A and B of our wormhole, and we've successfully created a micro black hole in laboratory conditions using our fusion technology and high-density materials.

However, we've been stuck on the issue of *expanding* these micro black holes for months. We need a negative energy material to expand and maintain the wormhole's three dimensional figure, but have been stuck on it for a while. Last experiment created an antimatter reaction that wrecked our lab and killed a few lowly interns.

My question is, how would you create a reaction that would generate enough negative mass to open and sustain a wormhole? Hopefully this doesn't include some ""exotic material"", because we've yet to obtain an Unobtanium to do such a thing. Any input is helpful. Thank you."
159x70,16,2012-12-22,"Story about, and advice learned, from my small victory over anxiety tonight",bDawk20,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/159x70/story_about_and_advice_learned_from_my_small/,"I thought I'd share a quick motivational/success story of sorts-- hopefully it will inspire people or make someone feel better. I'll try to keep this short, which is difficult as I tend to ramble. 

Okay so a little background: 
My friend and I have anxiety-- he's been dealing with it longer than I have, but I've been worse lately. My friend has been on medication for a while and it seems to have helped him. I didn't really have anxiety until a few years ago and it was relatively manageable until recently. I passed out during an internship (part of my graduate program) in part because the stress was too much for me to handle. Before dropping the internship I caved and went on Buspar (my MD was the one who prescribed it though so it was a non-therapeutic dose). Eventually I dropped the internship. I feel less stressed/anxious since then, but I also feel more depressed/hopeless and worry or stress over little things or things far outside of my control. Hopefully my new ""corrected"" dosage works better-- it seems to be helping me cope better, but that could just be because there is less stress in my life now. 

Anyway, my anxiety stems mostly from social situations, stress, and random phobias (e.g. blood, vomiting, etc.). My friend's anxiety is somewhat different, but we both are uncomfortable in ""party"" situations. He does not drink (I believe it is against his religion), while I used to drink, but now don't because of my fear of throwing up. Both of us get anxious in big crowds, however, especially if alcohol or that party-like atmosphere is involved. 



So long story short, our friends had planned this trip into the city tonight. We planned to see the tree and drink at someone's apartment. We split from the group at some point to get dinner with a third friend and ended up having an interesting adventure. We encountered a few situations that were slightly anxiety provoking. For example, we missed our train/subway, which got us lost and forced us to backtrack (through a bad neighborhood at one point), but we were fine the entire time. 

At the end of the night my friend wanted to go home rather than heading back to the apartment where the party was. I knew the party was nothing out of control-- just a few friends drinking casually-- and I wanted to end this cycle of avoiding those situations so I convinced him to stop by so I could use the restroom. We ended up having fun and staying for an hour or so (it was actually his first ""party""). 

I guess the moral of the story is I didn't avoid a situation I typically would have and everything was okay. I had a lot of fun and for the first time in a while felt NORMAL. It was a great feeling.

And I guess I'll end with some advice garnered from my experience tonight: 

1. Take some risks. Don't avoid a situation-- you're only enforcing the reason for the anxiety. Granted this is easier said than done, but it's worth a try sometimes. 
2. No one is alone with this shit and it may help if you are friends with someone else who knows what you're going through firsthand. 
3. I had my medication on me most of the night (it's prescribed twice a day so I took it at the end of dinner) and just having it in my pocket made me feel better because I knew if I felt anxious at any time I had some relief to look forward to 
4. Go out. Do something. Preferably with friends. Don't sit home wallowing. I know it's hard to do when you're anxious, but I felt more alive and happy tonight than I had in a days. 
5. Think positive. Again, not easy to do, but think when the last time thinking negatively worked out in your favor. If you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining. Did I just quote that new movie? It looks so lame. But the girl is kind of cute. And they're Eagles fans, which is a plus for me. Oh, there I go with the rambling. Oops. But the message is true. If you are positive you will be happier. Studies have shown people who force a smile are more likely to genuinely smile or laugh easier. So smile and think positive."

I'm looking for something that I can do using my strong technology skill-set and business degree. I'm open to anything but my best match will be doing something with computers.

I’m a technology professional who will finish teaching English in South Korea in February 2013. I’m passionate about using IT to drive business objectives.

I graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in global business. My education at ASU involved a great breadth of training in business practices, accounting, finance, and management. Additionally, ASU has a policy of not only training its students in the science of business but also training them to be great leaders. My classes were focused on business in the international arena and we routinely had group projects where we practiced group management and leadership. 

During my time in school I worked to pay for school and my living expenses. So, I gained valuable experience working at various companies during my schooling. I was an intern at Intel Corporation as a software engineer. I worked at GoDaddy.com doing sales and customer support, where I regularly exceeded my sales quota. I have a strong background in IT. After university, I traveled to South Korea to teach English. I learned valuable lessons in thinking on my feet, educating, and traveling the globe.

So it's Christmas Eve. It's supposed to be a time where you are with your family and be happy and all that jazz right? 

Well apparently my Dad thought that today was the perfect time to tell that he wants me to pay $300 a month to keep staying at his place. That would be 1/3 of the rent, half of the electricity bill and a bit extra for toilet paper and stuff. 

I buy my own food, clothes. I pay for all my things on my own. The only thing I don't currently pay is the rent and I am expected to be the one who cleans everything. Except the house isn't tidy all the time because I work a lot, he rarely does anything in the house and he works from home. Recently he got an office with a rent that is around $100 less than than ours. 

I work 40 to 50 hours a week doing a physical job. I have a massive amount of debt for someone my age (although, it's been going down a lot this year) and after I pay all my bills, I have around 100 bucks left per week. I still didn't do the groceries with that amount and I guess I have to forget about hobbies and going out at that point. 

The debt I have is my fault. I have 3 credit cards, 1 of them is almost cleared. I bought way too much shit with them and this is entirely my fault. I have a student loan to pay (got around 9k left to it). Didn't get my diploma, even though I finished college almost 3 years ago, because I could not find an internship before last month. This is due to the market for my field of experience being super closed and also because I procrastinated big time. 

I tried to get debt consolidation but I could not because I have nothing toy name. Tried to get my Dad to sign next to me but he won't do it because if I lose my current job, he fears that he'll have to pay for me (which is a perfectly valid point.)

I could ask my Mom for help right? No. 
She told me not to study in sound engineering. I didn't listen to her because I wanted to do what I fucking wanted to in life. We don't have a good relationship and I left her place at 16 to go live with my Dad because she would be far too controlling, Was expecting way too much out of me and would yell at me just because she could. At the time my dad told me he would never make me pay the rent but I guess he saw how much I was spending on hobbies and stuff he changed his mind. 

I feel like I fucked up. Maybe I should've become a lawyer or some job like that to make my family proud. Who knows, maybe if I went that way, I would've ended up more depressed than I am right now, because I didn't do something I wanted to do. Maybe I would've ended up hanging myself. Would've made things easier. 

2012 was a shit year. 2013 doesn't look like it'll be better. I guess I'm receiving coal this year. 

Sorry for the rent, enjoy the holidays.

When I started collecting vintage Seiko's, it was the 7625-8140 that got me hooked. After enjoying mine for a few years, I decided to get one for each of my 3 sons to give them at 'the right moment' (not that I knew when that would be). Collecting the 3 for them was waaaaaay more difficult than I imagined, but this past summer I secured the last one. Recently I've been thinking that with my eldest interviewing for summer internships this year, the time was right, and maybe I'd give it to him his before he heads back after the holidays. Tonight, while getting ready for church he asked how he got the birth year diver I gave him on Father's Day was supposed to fit under a dress shirt cuff, and it occured to me the time was right. I went to the watch box, got him his 1st dress watch, and had a nice time telling him how much fun it was to collect it for him, and to wear it in good health. 

Here we are in our matching watches.

15dlnr,1,2012-12-24,[University Law] Please correct my statement of interest for my application to an University in England,BleuCommeLEnfer,HomeworkHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/15dlnr/university_law_please_correct_my_statement_of/,"Last year, as I attended the conference about the mobility possibility at the University, I wasn’t sure what my future would be. I was really interested in studying abroad for one semester and I was hesitating between the Erasmus Programme and the *School*. Nevertheless, I had the impression that with the Erasmus Programme I would have left my closed national legal system for another that I wouldn’t probably need ever again. That’s why I thought that the School with his transnational and globalized approach was probably a better choice. The course for the mention in European law finally convinced me that the *School* was the right choice. The subject of that course made me realise the importance of international, transnational, and comparative law in the more and more globalized world we’re living in.

During the summer of 2010, I lived in London for four month. I split my stay in two parts. Firstly, I attended an intensive English course for two months. Then, I worked for the two lasting months as an intern in a company which is dealing with the complaints of travellers. My stay was an incredible experience for me mainly because I had the chance to meet people from around the world. The environment at *School* will be similar and that’s a big advantage over the Erasmus Programme with which it’s only possible to encounter people from a couple of different countries. With that diversity of nationalities, I am sure that the *School* is really the ideal place to share and learn from people who are living under different kind of legal systems.

I am aware that the experience at *School* will be completely different from the one I had in London more than two years ago and that it will especially require much more work. I am not afraid of the challenge that represents the *School* in any way mainly because I can foresee the benefits I will receive from this formation for my future career which will surely require good knowledge both in English and in transnational law.

The first benefit is a good education on subjects that I am really interested in such as tax law or economic law. For that kind of subjects an international and transnational approach is essential. The second is that I will practise my English and learn the legal vocabulary that I need to express myself clearly. The third benefit is as stated above the positive influence that the other cultures will have on my personal development. I will gain new perspectives and a different understanding about the global legal environment. I am truly eager to learn about the other justice systems and share about the French one. That’s why I will invest myself completely for this semester at the *School*.

Our relationship has been very solid and we've always had a great connection, we met when we were young, went to the same college and graduated as lawyers and currently work for separate firms. Everything seemed okay and I had planned our entire future together but 18 months ago things changed. I met someone, now I've never shown interest in another man ever but John, a intern [22m] changed that, I became intoxicated with him. I didn't realize my feelings for him for the first couple of months and just thought I liked him as a friend. I started spending a lot of time with him and my wife was only happy for me, finally finding someone who shared my interests.

I started going to the gym with him and that's were it started, I noticed his body and for the first time I became curious about male body and started looking online for images and even gay porn later on. I'm going to skip forward to were the affair started, the physical one at least. It was this August, I was working late and he'd offered to stay late with me. One thing lead to another, and we kissed in my office, I stopped him after a minute and excused myself. I promised myself to never let that happen again and I thought everything would be fine because a month went by without either of us mentioning anything but on September 18th my birthday we went to the gym and after an hour and a half of working out and showering together, I followed him into a bathroom were he gave me a blow-job. 

After that we continued our friendship but now with benefits and not long after this we started having full on sex.

I want to say this, I love my wife, she's been my whole life for so long, and I couldn't be doing this to a greater human being. I honestly feel so helpless, she seems to know nothing and even  forced me to introduce John to her were I seriously felt sick to my stomach.

I've tried ending it with John but I feel empty when I don't see him for a whole week and I don't want to leave my wife, we've created a great life together even though we came from nothing. 

I've forgotten why I started writing this... Can you love two people at a time? Have you've had an experience that relates to this.

tl;dr I'm cheating on my wife of 7 years with a intern at my company, I don't know what I should do, I feel helpless and pathetic.


Edit: Thanks for all the feedback I appreciate it.

Edit 2: I've sent him an email and told him that I can't see him again, and I've also decided to take a month off at work to get my head straight.. Thanks for all the comments and advice."
15exg0,1,2012-12-25,"Stockholm Syndrome? Nah, That's Not Quite Right...",fourth_alternate,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15exg0/stockholm_syndrome_nah_thats_not_quite_right/,"Here We Go:

I had pretty much the same core group of friends from kindergarten up until the end of high school. Sure, we became friends with some girls along the way in high school to add to our group, but the same group of guys remained constant.

I was a different person back then. I wanted a girlfriend more than anything in the world. My friends were getting them, I wasn't. Maybe it was bad luck, but I was a winy, needy bitch throughout the whole thing. Freshman and Sophomore year, I had a great fucking time because the girls I hung out with didn't know how needy I was. When I got to know them, I constantly asked every single one of my friends to solve my problems, but I was oblivious to the fact that they did not give a fuck and that the world was not centered around me. I didn't realize this until Junior year of high school. By that time, no one wanted to hang out with me because I would try to ""serioustalk"" all the time before that. Plus, I paranoid/worried about every fucking thing. 

This took a toll on my parents as well, seeing me week after week Junior and Senior year sulking around every weekend being unhappy, it made them unhappy as well. I also didn't really know how to make new friends, since everyone was settled in (this being the second half of high school) and I had the exact same ones all through growing up. The whole ""make new friends"" advice meant nothing to me. 

Well, while excluding me (god knows I deserved it, I wouldn't want to hang out with high school fourth_alternate either), these friends made other friends through each other, while I was on the sidelines. I remember the seemingly endless number of nights laying in my bed with my laptop checking Facebook and seeing them post pictures and wondering why the fuck I wasn't invited.

Once Senior year hit, I was thinking about college and how it will be great that I will be forced to meet new people who know nothing about me and how I can start manning the fuck up and not sharing my problems with the world.

I was ecstatic the first day I went to college at the prospect of meeting new people. Before I knew it, I had a new, huge group of friends that always wanted to hang with me. My 2nd year of college, I joined a social fraternity, and am having the time of my life. I have more friends that I can count, and I am always included. I realized the error of my ways and reinvented myself entirely. I even got a girlfriend, but at that time I didn't care if I did or did not. I was the polar opposite of high school...

Breaks are fucking torture, though. I am right where I was at in high school. Unfortunately, almost none of my friends or fraternity brothers live near ""back home"" for me. The ones who do are off with their high school friends almost the entire time because they never get to see them. They did not have the same high school experience as I did.

Nope, I'm right back here in my bed all day on the computer, 5/7 days per week, bored as fuck. Nothing to do. I revert back to high school mentality here. I'm in the exact same position, watching my high school friends post pictures of them on Facebook having fun. And I still ask myself, ""Where the fuck am I?""

I actually tried talking to one of them (one of the ones who stayed relatively loyal to me and didn't care so much about the bitching... a Redditor who I hope doesn't check this subreddit) and he said ""dude, hit us up. you never text us. if you wanna chill, just text us."" -- Yeah, that's true, but in this whole texting crossfire, why aren't you hitting me up? You know damn well I'm doing nothing.

I don't know what I'll do if I get an internship back home this summer. I'm trying to get one by school, but I'll take whatever I can get.

Anyway, thanks for listening, /r/offmychest. Enjoy your Christmas. Be thankful for the friends you have and the person you have become. I know I am."
15etio,0,2012-12-25,[29m] looking for some feedback about a complex relationship w/ a [24f],holidayheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15etio/29m_looking_for_some_feedback_about_a_complex/,"There's a lot to cover here, but I want to try and leave out as much detail as possible - so where to begin....

We met 6 years ago when she was still in her senior year of high school, she was deciding where to go to college and i was already in. I let her make the moves because it all happened where I worked, she was an occasional customer so I didn't want to be a creep. Anyways, fast forward a few months and our trust is kind of shattered when I find out she cheated on me even though our relationship was just beginning. She told me about it, I felt like shit, but for some reason I really wanted to stick with her, something about her was so different from any girl I had been with before and I convinced myself that I should.

She decided to go to school in our city, I was an hour away throughout most of college but we kept dating. It was rocky at times because she kept bringing up how she was so young and needed to have other relationships etc., and she cheated on me a couple more times but again I chalked it up to more of her just being repressed (even though I wasn't overbearing). Mostly I just tried to let her know how I felt and that I really appreciated who she was and I hoped that we could be together. And we were for the majority of it all. 

During a summer where I traveled across the country for an internship we decided to stay together, but then maybe see other people for the first time. I chickened out when I got the opportunity but she took hers. There was a girl at this internship she became jealous of after I talked about her, I think this drove her to pursue a hookup with someone. It left a sour taste in my mouth for sure.

She took a year to study abroad and we separated for that. I visited her during the midst of it and it could've gone better, mostly because I learned about the other people she had been seeing. Up until this point I had never cheated on her, nor cared to. She had a good frienemy who lived in the dorms at her school, I stayed with her quite a bit while my 'gf'/'ex' was abroad. We got close but never did anything but emotionally cheat. I know my SO was jealous of her, and her learning that I was spending so much time with this other girl made her really upset, even though she was enjoying a feast of men over seas. Almost as if everything she had done behind my back was ok, just because I was spending all this time with her frienemy. I don't have much evidence except for stories from concerned friends, but I believe during college she got with a few of our common friends, and friends of her little brother - since our trust was wounded so long before this, it's been really difficult for me to ever forget or question who she was with. It is pretty easy to tell from the guys perspective because any guy who had been friendly toward me would just stop talking to me out of fear. Again though, I always just tried to let it go.

Anyways, fast forward a bit, I ask her to marry me in front of all my friends the summer after we all graduate because I'm going to be moving across the country for work and she'll be in the same relative place for medical school. It was more of a gesture of how I felt about her at the time, but she didn't appreciate it and felt like I was trapping her even though she said yes. So I move across the country, we're still together and doing pretty well, frequent visits and really nice.

Here's where I really mess up, because almost 2 years in to my stint across the country, I become overwhelmed with feelings that really just drive me nuts - the desire to really just be with her in the same place. To have our relationship be grounded somewhere. It was really hard for me, and I always questioned myself and why I didn't have the same compulsions as her, to want to connect with other girls, hook up, date. I found lots of other girls attractive, had tons of friendships with other girls and I broke down at some point questioning everything. I really wasn't sure if what I was after with her was something to really pursue. I couldn't tell if these whole 5 years had been a waste and I was dating a complete slut who didn't care about me at all and just followed her emotions and spread her legs for anything that made her interested. Or was I chasing a person, her essence and something about the way we could interact, how we were for so many of our friends and family and idyllic couple. We were able to be so incredibly comfortable with each other - as our love grew everything seemed to get better for me, but for her it just seemed to drive her to question everything and who she was.

I ended up cheating on her, I wanted to see what it felt like, why she did it - I wanted to understand why she couldn't simply love me, what was wrong with our relationship? I wanted to know what it was she craved about new interactions and connections with other men. I had some good sex, the kind you don't forget, but I soon learned how not worth it it really was. It seemed like my entire life just ended when I did that - I knew what I had done had monumental consequences.

I confessed to her when she came to live with me last summer, she was so accepting and seemingly kind about it. And she still wanted to be with me. The emotions that were driving me nuts wouldn't stop, I kept becoming more and more confused, anxious, and ridden with fear/guilt. It drove me to treat her in an unacceptable way that really killed everything. I was mean for no reason, unapologetic about everything I did, acted like a complete asshole to her. I was acting like I had something to prove, like I had to make sure everything was going well, and see her at her happiest and then ruin it all to get back at her for what she had done to me over all these years. I didn't consciously think that, ever. I was never in a mood for a vendetta. But I was acting like it, and I didn't really even notice somehow. I asked her for time apart at the end of that summer because I was afraid of what I was doing, and I didn't want to hurt her anymore, or myself. I needed to know if I really loved her and for the right reasons.

We were apart for almost all of this last year up until August. I finished my job and she was good enough to let me come move in with her. We had been talking on and off throughout the past year, it started off really horribly. Where I would ask her if she could forgive me for what I had done, and she told me we would never be together again. My heart was frequently dashed, and it hurt. So when she gave me the chance to move in, I wanted everything to be perfect. I wanted to show her how much I cared for her and what she meant to me.

After about a month we got back into our comfortable state, it was really nice but she stopped doing things for herself, like working out, going to yoga, eating super healthy, etc.. She attributes being alone to being really driven, and focused. I knew that my presence was really getting in the way of all this and tried to avert disaster but wasn't able to. She asked me when I could leave, so I got a new job on the coast closer to home and have recently relocated. I left on really good terms, except that she wants to be apart again to grow as an individual. At 24 I can relate to that, I was able to grow a lot on my own, and I know our age difference doesn't help. All I really want is for someone to tell me I'm not out of my god damned mind.

She claims to not think monogamy is a legitimate phenomena, or rather that it doesn't apply to her - I'm not aware of anyone else she's simultaneously in love with, but if she were she's done a great job of hiding it. I think if anything she just has trouble getting over other relationships she's had, possibly having something attachment or love there, but none as strong as our love. What the hell do I know though, hah!

I've dated almost 25 girls during the times we were 'off', and I really haven't ever found someone as good as her. It's so clear before my eyes it's just frustrating me now. I feel so upset that I blew the one chance she gave me, but I also wonder if it was even a chance at all.

Anyways, I'm hoping that maybe when she finishes up and heads to residency in a little over a year we can wind up in the same place, I'd give almost anything for that. It's weird....I guess I finally know what I want and can't have it. I'll probably try to date some girls here, but it's really difficult to feel positive about it when I'm still so in love with her. I know given our history that something may or may not happen, but this is also the worst part. We never really end things ever. Sometimes I wish I could hate her to help me move on, but she leaves things so open-ended it's kind of irritating. And so whenever anything promising happens I get kind of excited - even though I've trained myself to not have any expectations.

Time to pass out, I wrote a lot, wow. Would love to hear any feedback, thanks.

Firstly, my mother's side: The only member we're in contact with frequently is my grandmother. Since her husband died almost 6 years ago now she's developed an almost juvenile need for attention, eating herself to death, pretending she hasn't taken up smoking again, and frequently throwing similar illnesses that my mother has at about the same time.

Dad's side: We don't keep contact with them very often, save for my grandfather and his lady friend since his wife died. Reason being is that my former aunt is a psychotic religious fundie with an appetite for drama. After the recent divorce, this woman has done everything in her power to make my uncle and cousin's lives a living hell after the split and after her children couldn't be the movie stars she was trying to groom them to be. 

Cue baseless child molestation allegations flung everywhere, making her daughter feel like dirt, and treating everyone around her like anything but human. As a result my eldest cousin is on the fast track to being a baby factory for someone almost twice her age (We'll skip over how I want to punch this man's dick in) and the next eldest is looking to be a thief and a thug if/when he ends up getting kicked out of school. Absolutely inspirational!

Cut to my household: I've an autistic brother that's developed a seizure disorder, now my parents are scared witless at the idea of leaving him alone for five minutes. My mom has been chronically ill since I was seven, anything from torn ligaments, medical side effects, colitis, and several more things. Despite all that she has managed to make sure my brother is accommodated for and that the finances are balanced so food has never been an issue. Massive kudos for managing that.

However, she takes *way* more than a necessary load of stress because every time my father and I try to help on our own accord, we fuck something minor up and end up compounding the stress and then she goes demon-dragon-lady mode about how we never volunteer to do things ourselves. A rather vicious cycle.

I honestly have nothing bad to say about my dad. I look up to him and take after him because despite the shit that gets catapulted his way he keeps on. I've never had much time to bond with him, unfortunately, due to the fact he works third shift, but he's the source of income for the family and has provided well.

And now myself: I'm the second in the family that's gone to college, I should be graduating this time next year if all goes well. However my choice of New Media Arts and Science (word salad for 'I wanna make vidya game') was somewhat shakily received. As of now I'm head of the programming team for a class that's going to present an ARG type of game at Gen Con next year and interning at an indie gaming company. I'd say doing pretty good all considering.

-----

I've been fighting uphill since I was three to get to a place where I feel like what I do matters and that I have a fair chance at making a living in the same comfort range my father provided doing what I love.

However I feel like I'm at my tipping point. Between what I've recently learned of the happenings of my dad's side of the family, listening to my mother indirectly blame my father for many sub-issues revolving around my brother, and the fact I'm *supposed* to be cramming several programming languages despite both the projects I'm involved in supposedly being on break, I'm feeling quite overwhelmed, exhausted, and close to flipping the table and walking away.

-----

Then the proverbial straw to the back camels: I've basically found my alt universe self. Unfortunately I see him as the guy from the universe with nice things. We get along great, I feel like he's a brother to me and by extent his family's kindness. I even had a really jarring moment where for about half a minute, I genuinely thought I was visiting grandparents.

While likable, the guy seems almost irritably perfect. Owns a computer fixing business, been in college almost twice as long as I have due to a four year head start, and you probably get the point by now.

I don't know if I feel inspired by seeing this success, or disheartened by the fact I'm seeing what my proverbial poker hand dealt to me would be if it was a full house instead of a pair.

-----

Understandably I'm a bit overwhelmed at the moment. I *need* a break, I *need* some time off. On the same hand I feel like I need to be a good intern and show initiative, start battle plans for the Gen Con project, and also be the one person who doesn't make this family another example of the broken families I frequently see around me who do nothing but fight and go to jail for any number of reasons.

[](/lunasad) I think at this point what I really need is an honest hug.

Long vent is long, writing it down certainly helped. Thanks for taking time to read this laundry list of complaints."

About 5 months ago, I broke up with my girlfriend [21f].  It was on good, mutual terms.  Throughout our relationship, we never had any disagreements or fights, and there was a great amount of chemistry between us.  What we had at the time was special to me.  During the 9 months we were together, I fell into a depression brought on by stress of college and work.  On top of that, I was dealing with a sort of quarter-life crisis, which caused me to feel very unmotivated about everything.  My grades slipped, and I had no real drive to do anything.  We eventually broke up, as I needed space as well as time to learn to be happy, and I wasn't really putting much into the relationship.  While I originally wanted to break up with her, I immediately regretted the decision afterwards.  Minutes after parting ways, I broke down in tears.  I cried every day for the next couple of weeks.  While 9 months may not be an incredibly long time, she was a big part of my life.  It certainly doesn't help that I became so close with her family as well.


Right now (five months later), I'm still going in and out of depression, but I'm feeling much happier.  Surrounding myself with friends has helped tremendously.  On top of that, I'm starting to go back to my favorite hobbies (music, programming, drawing).  I also managed to salvage my grades and pass all of my courses this semester.  I also landed a good internship that pays well!  I feel I still have a good while to go, but I'm feeling happier every day.  Of course, I still miss her.  But being reminded of her doesn't cause me to break down anymore.  I've gone on a few dates since we broke up, but I felt like I was trying to find someone to fill the void she left behind, as opposed to trying to meet cool, new people.

I always read about how reconnecting/breaking no-contact with exes is not a good idea, but what if things ended on good terms?  How would you go about reconnecting with someone?  Message them online?  Call them?  Try to bump into them on campus?

tl;dr: We broke up on good terms.  Is reconnecting months later a good/bad idea?"

Most weeks it was every day or every other day.  Sometimes I would masturbate two or more times per day, rationalizing it with the fact that I couldn't see her, so it wasn't doing any harm.  It got to the point where every time I did it, I was disappointed and with myself.  My girlfriend got back this month, and I'll be seeing her this weekend, and I'm proud to say that I started nofap at the beginning of the month, and since have been feeling a lot better about myself.  I havent much been able to stay away from the things that make it difficult, but I now have the willpower to stop before I disappoint myself and relapse.  I'm now almost four weeks in and will be seeing my girlfriend very soon, and I'm excited for whats to come, and I'd like to thank nofap for helping me inevitably make this weekend much better than it ever would have been :)"
15hew7,8,2012-12-26,Relationship might be ending due to careers starting in different cities?,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/15hew7/relationship_might_be_ending_due_to_careers/,"Hey guys,

I've (21M) been in a relationships with my girlfriend (21F) for almost 5 months. We've known each other since we were 3 and have been really good friends since high school. Now we're seniors in college.

We both secretly really wanted to date each other all throughout high school but neither took the initiative, then we went off to separate colleges so we lost touch with each other. But this past summer we both had internships in the same city. One thing led to another and we began officially dating.

We were dating for about a month without distance, but then college started up again and we were a little over 3 hours apart. Three hours isn't bad at all but we're both very busy with school and only got to see each other a couple times throughout the semester.

Here's where the complications begin. I recently accepted a job for after graduation in the city where we both had the internships, so that's where I'll be for sure. She still has a year of grad school before she will start working though. I always had the impression that we would finally be together at that point. She loved her internship so I figured we'd both move to that city. Plus at one point we had a conversation where she made a comment saying ""it will be over a year before we're together again"". I guess I assumed that meant ""we'll be together again after grad school"".

Well, she has another internship in another city the spring. She hasn't started yet, but when she was at my family's christmas dinner yesterday (we're on Christmas break and in the same city now) I overheard her telling someone that's where she wanted to end up. That's the first I had heard of that.

So when I went to take her home, before we got out of the car I said we should talk about it. I asked her about it and she said that she would probably get an offer there, and if given the offer she would accept. Meaning that we would be long distance (~3 hours ) for another year and a half till graduation, then we would be long distance (~5 hours) indefinitely.

I told her I didn't know how I could do that. What had been getting me through the distance so far was ""knowing"" that we'd be together in a year and a half. But that was under false pretenses.

That started an argument and she thought we broke up so I went back to her place to tell her I didn't want to break up yet. She didn't talk to me at all after the argument and hasn't talked to me since, and right now I am 16 hours away at my parent's house visiting them for Christmas (I had no choice, parents made me).

I'm not going to be able to see her in person for another 2 and a half weeks, and even then it will be unsure because I will just be flying into her city and I don't know if she will be working at the time when I fly in or not.

I don't know exactly what I'm asking here for, but advice would be great. I love this girl, and I love being with her. And I don't want to lose her. I opened my mouth without thinking when I said that I didn't know how I could do this, but I just really want to be with her. Maybe she'll decide to break up with me before I can say anything to her, I don't know. But any advice on the situation would be great. Thanks

**TL;DR, long distance girlfriend wants to start career in a city ~5 hours from where I'm starting my career, meaning already LDR of 3hrs will go to an indefinite LDR. Advice please?**"

I'm extremely excited about the internship, but I'm having horrible anxiety about moving down to North Carolina.  I'm 20 years old, and this is going to be the first time I'm really going to be somewhere where I can't just go home.  I've been living on my own for the past 3 years at college, but home is only about an hour away.  This whole week I've not able to sleep and it feels like Cirque du Soleil is going on inside my stomach.  

Someone please help me to calm down :("
15ghiy,6,2012-12-26,"Name is relevant in more ways than one, [27m] thrown out twice by [24f] ",DasThrownAway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15ghiy/name_is_relevant_in_more_ways_than_one_27m_thrown/,"Going to try and give you the relevant facts and keep it short.

So I (27m) met a beautiful woman (24f) just shy of a year ago, we dated for a few months, she broke up with me because I was broke and she felt I was taking advantage of her. Certainly not my goal or intention, just couldn't pay for dates from time to time.

Anyways a week later she called me saying she wanted to try again, so we spent a few months getting to know each other again and ended up rekindling our relationship.

The first go around was hot and heavy, thus much fun, the second was extremely limited, i.e. one encounter, yet we were together for a good 4ish months after. While the lack of intimacy bothered me, I knew she was very stressed, tired, and busy because of work so I accepted it. 

We would see each other when we could, normally only once or twice a week, but other than the aforementioned issue it was a healthy-ish relationship. There were a few issues that bothered her, I was a smoker, granted I was trying to quit the whole time, and having spent my time in the Marines my use of profanity could put a sailor to shame. That said I tried to change to please her, I guess not in time for her.

One day we met for lunch and after making plans for the weekend, going shopping, and all-in-all a seeming good date we get back to my place and she breaks it to me that she can't do it anymore. She explains that she loves me, but between work, her puppy (how we met), and my bad habits she can't keep trying/leading me on.

We split on good terms, no anger (at the time {on my part}), and still talk everyday. I have run the gambit of emotions, empty, felt that I would die from the heartbreak (yes after the 7 months we were together I felt I loved her), anger, betrayed, but now my problem is that I am more or less OK but I'm still hung up on her. The pain is mostly gone and I'm ready to try again, I would still give her another chance but would lay out some ground rules, or even better a woman who can make me happy all/most of the time but...

... while there is a new interest, I find it very hard to be aroused by a different woman. Part of me wants to think its because she is the only woman for me but I really question if she is worth my time.

The flaws in myself I have corrected, I wanted to quit smoking before her and I think I have finally done it, and after she told me that the cussing bothered her while we were together I cut back to the point that she did more than myself, at least while she was around. She cussed more than me but was blinded by the previous experience. As for her work excuse, I have been in her shoes before and completely understand.

She is a wonderful woman, and I have put so much time and effort into her, I don't want to give up until I'm sure she isn't worth it. As imperfect as things were she made me happy.



TL;DR (27m) Questioning whether my on-again-off-again GF (24f) of 11 months is worth my time, and if not what do you suggest I do to break the spell.



EDIT: I haven't taken it out on her, been a gentleman through it all so we are still on good terms. 

EDIT MARK 2.1: (still stupidly defensive) Her other complaint/concern is that she wouldn't/didn't want to have to worry about me lying to her about smoking/smelling of smoke if we were to be living together. So there is that. To sum up the real problem she is afraid I'm going to lie/hurt her. 

EDIT MARK 3: Just got my AS, working on my BS, working at my school as a paid intern living off the GI Bill, so I don't make enough money to really provide for someone. She on the other hand has BA in biology, a pretty good paying job (even if she isn't to happy with what she does). To top it all off, while both of her parents are retired from the Army she feels that I don't deserve/didn't earn the benefits I have (as she sees it a free education/free ride) and doesn't respect me for the fact that I just finally moved out of my parents only to rent a room. I pay rent, buy my own food, pay my share of utilities, hell just pay my bills/my own way the best I can...

15ggtj,1,2012-12-26,Just because I don't want to date you doesn't mean I don't love you.,byrd424,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15ggtj/just_because_i_dont_want_to_date_you_doesnt_mean/,"In July my girlfriend broke up with me.  I was committed to her and I have not been my normal self since then and every day I still think about her and how I miss her and what we had.  She has a new boyfriend now (who I do not like at all but thats a different story).

I have a friend named Sammi (name changed).  Sammi and I have been great friends for over 2 years now and go to school together and hang out a lot.  Sammi is a beautiful girl and we get along great even though she is very talkative and friendly and I am more reserved and keep to myself.

After the July break up, my ex thought it would be a good idea if we tried dating other people to minimize the impact of our break up as it was hard for both of us (she said she has some personal stuff to work out, I would have rather stayed together but thats getting off topic).  So I tried dating Sammi in hopes of having someone to help me in my times of trouble and start a new relationship.  I found this to be a good idea for maybe 2 weeks until Sammi wanted to ""go public"" and be called boyfriend and girlfriend.

At this point, I was still not even fully recovered from the break up and still had a lot to look into myself before I would be ready for another relationship.  I still missed my ex.  I told Sammi this and she tried to comfort me but I could tell she was disappointed as she really likes me.

Fast forward to October.  Things got bad with my ex because of her new BF and how I didn't like him and she deserved better than him and I wanted her to talk to me about why she moved onto him so soon.  Sammi told me that I can't expect answers for that but I bothered my ex so that way we are now on not talking terms.  Off topic: saw her in a restaurant on Friday with her BF.  Had to walk to the gas station down the road and puke in the bathroom there.

Sammi says I keep leading her on which I know I am doing because I do not want to be alone.  I miss having someone I can talk to about everything and I can hold tight and love being with.  The problem is our personalities and how I see the future working.

Sammi wants to be a teacher and will be in school for about 2 more years.  She comes from a very religious family and they are close with eachother (as in they all know what has happened probably).  I am somewhat of a loner who works, then sits at home and watches TV and plays video games to pass the time.  I have friends over occasionally, but not more than a few times a month.  Ever since July, I have been questioning my religion and fate and wonder what the world's purpose is for all of this to happen.

I am graduating in May and hope to get an internship out of state.  After the incidents of July and the aftermath, I am lonely, yes, but I do not think a relationship would be good for me right now.  I still miss my ex a lot.  I appreciate Sammi as a friend.  I want to spend time with her.  Just I cannot see us dating and it ending well or going beyond dating.

I am attracted to her, I enjoy her company, but my current state does not bode well for a healthy, long term relationship.  She takes offense to this because I do tell her I miss my ex.  She feels if she were to fall off the earth I wouldn't miss her.  I would miss her.  I would be losing my closest friend I have right now.  I do not want to date you right now because of my issues.  There is nothing wrong with you.

I love my Sammi.  She is one of the few reasons I still believe there are good people out there.  I just need my space and to figure out what now."

(personal rant, sorry)",[deleted],MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/15ga1z/why_does_christmas_have_to_end_so_poorly_personal/,"I had a nice day, wonderful gifts from family and my MLP secret santa.  (And the Plounge!). Watched doctor who, a disney movie, etc.

As some know I'm visiting my parents for a couple weeks for the holidays.  Well, one of their gifts was a frame for my diploma (I graduate in the Spring).  I mentioned later tonight that it made me a little sad to know that I'm about to leave school and start my own life. 

It was a mistake to say that.  My mother basically insinuated I was a disappointment for not going straight into grad school, claimed I was ruining my fathers one dream for me, and blamed it on my boyfriend (the man I am *going* to probably eventually marry if I have any luck, goddamnit).

It broke my heart, it really did.

I want to start into my career, I want to figure out what *my employers* want me to pursue academically in the future - not just go in to something random that I would most likely hate or be unhelpful.  I don't want to have a ton of loans - I have enough.

Most of all - my father is 70 years old.  He is still working to provide me with occasional monetary supplements to help me get by (scholarships/loans pay for housing and books).

I want him to STOP WORKING.  He's older, I want him to retire, to relax.  

I just finished observations in a morgue.  I have seen younger men than he keel over for random reasons - he is not in the best of health.  He does not need to be traveling every week.  I no longer want to be a financial burden on him.

I'm tired, I'm worn out from school, from internships, from theses. I want a break, I want to make something of myself. 

And now I'm sitting here crying and crying thinking terrible things - about how I should pack up and go home, how I should break something, punch a pillow.  Heck, I had my first ""hurtful"" thought in years - heres a hint - I have scars on my arm and they aren't from ""setting up a rat cage/fishtank"" or ""my ferret"" like I claim to everyone I meet.   

I don't know what to do.  I can't stand to be a disappointment - all I ever wanted is them to feel prideful. 

Now please, kiddos, don't worry about me.  I'm not going to break things or hurt myself - I just, well, I just can't believe something like this would make me feel *so bad*.  I'm going to have to seriously have a discussion with my mother in the morning (it is almost midnight) as comments like those *cannot* be continued to be made to me in the future.

Shit, I feel like all my holidays end in disappointment. Maybe it has to do with how my family can get.

I changed the names, I think I got them all. Anyway here ya go:
_____________________________________________

James came back from his internship in L.A. and convinced me I needed to rave with him in Austin before he graduates. So we’re going to a rave called Spring Love. It’s only April but this night feels warm, like a summer night. I put my upcoming finals out of my mind. Screw geochemistry; I’m going to have a good time. 
Since I had never raved we spent the day preparing. Ravers wear “kandi”, little colorful beaded bracelets that you trade with other ravers, and you’re supposed to make your own before you went out. It sounded lame when James explained it to me, but he insisted so I throw a few of them together. I make one with my girlfriend’s name, one says Spring Love, a few random ones, and I have some glow sticks wrapped around my arms. James and his girlfriend Sarah are decked out: colorful clothes, fake vampire teeth, a dozen glow sticks between them and their arms covered with the kandi bracelets. Apparently, this is how they do it in L.A. and trading kandi is a cool way to meet people at raves. I’m psyched.


We get to the venue and it looks like a small stadium. The line is short and then we’re in, surrounded by thousands of people. For a “small” rave it seemed overwhelming at first. Some people just had kandi, but some girls wore tiny pink outfits complete with fairy wings, fuzzy boots and pacifiers, which they used to keep from grinding their teeth when they were rolling. These girls are Go-Go dancers, some hired for entertainment, some were just other ravers.


The arena is dim, and my eyes follow the laser lights to their source at center stage where a DJ in a costume of plastic sci-fi armor orchestrates his music. A mass of ravers crowds the stage and moves with every beat and every bass line from the speakers. Other ravers wander around further from the stage. There’s some trance music but mostly they’re playing dub-step, with heavy, bass filled, industrial sounds. But I don’t listen to the music so much as feel it’s vibrations through the soles of my shoes. What had sounded shitty moments earlier in the car is starting to sound awesome. I don’t know who the DJ’s are but James and Sarah do and we decide to visit the other three stages. We don’t need to use the bathroom but we make a quick stop there, away from the eyes of any security.


We walk around to the other stages while waiting to feel the effects of the altered chemistry in our veins. James tells me I should stay hydrated. Sarah seems tense, but I’m too excited to notice. James can deal with Sarah. I’m in awe of the people around me, the music, the lights, everything. We decide to sit and James whispers to me that Sarah had put on a little weight recently and being around these half naked dancers made her self-conscious. Sarah looks good, blonde, feminine, not overweight in my eyes, so I don’t get what the problem is.
We’ve been there for an hour and yet I feel nothing unusual. I’m getting impatient. Then James feels sick so we head to an outdoor space where everyone is sitting, cooling off, and smoking cigarettes. He leans against a wall. He tells me he always feels nauseous, briefly, then it passes. Sarah switches from insecure girlfriend to caring girlfriend and I decide my girlfriend could learn a thing or two from her. We’re waiting outside and I want to be annoyed with James for keeping us away from the stage but I just can’t be mad at him. In fact, I feel pretty good. 


We have more kandi than most people, and James’s outfit seems to draw people to us. Suddenly, we’re talking to strangers and making friends. Weird. I hate strangers. The next hour is a flash and I hear half a dozen life stories. I find myself telling my life story to one person, then another. A younger, hipster couple. A group of guys from a local community college. Everyone. I’m trading kandi with ravers while reciting the raver’s creed: Peace, love, unity, respect. PLUR. It sounded like hippy bullshit when James first explained it to me but it is *not* bullshit. 


I lock hands with people when we trade. I go through the motions of this new ritual. I slide the beads over my wrist and onto theirs and they do the same to me. I take the time to feel their skin, the warmth, the texture, even a little sweat. They feel amazing. I realize that people normally do everything possible to avoid touching one another and that when they do make contact it’s usually too quick and too awkward for anyone to enjoy it. I see someone with a “Free Hugs” sign and take the girl up on the offer. Twice.
James feels better and we walk around, we get a light show. A lanky kid, slightly younger than myself, dons his gloves and turns on the neon colored LED lights in the fingers. As we sit, he swirls the gloves right in front of our faces, and his well practiced hands form a beautiful blur of blue, green, and red. I feel alive. I’m living for the moment and really appreciating life. I need this. In everyday life I appreciate nothing; I just go through the motions.


More people. Beautiful people. Everyone starts trading back massages in a circle. Strangers, submitting their bodies to one another without hesitation. It’s not sexual, it’s innocent and trusting in a way I didn’t know people my age could be. I didn’t know people had the capacity to be this kind. Some people are rolling and others are not, it doesn’t matter, the warm feelings are contagious. I find myself massaging a girl, bonding with her. Her back is exposed and her dark brown skin feels amazing. She’s overweight, and she tells me she’s a lesbian. Exactly the sort of person who, in theory, I had no problem with but I would never have taken the time to get to know her normally.  *Why do I only talk to girls I’m interested in?* Still bonding with my new friend, a kid from Austin Community College starts talking politics with me. These people are not stupid. I’m stupid. I ignored these people. They have things worth saying, worth hearing.


We move to meet more people, turn a corner, and are stopped in our tracks by a jarring scene in front of us. Paramedics are loading a kid onto a stretcher. I don’t know who he is but I knew this could be dangerous. The kid is probably drunk too, he probably danced too hard, he took too much, he forgot to drink water. I hope he’s okay. We move on. We meet new people. Incredible people.


Especially these girls. James, Sarah, and I are deep in conversation with these three girls from Rice who apparently rave in Houston. A tall one, a brunette, says her name is Mary and she talks to James and Sarah. The other two fall into passionate conversation with me. Amy has a big smile, a real smile. She tells me her philosophical concept of justice while Beth and I discuss the future of journalism. Beth seems shy, so I treasure the fact that’s she opening up with me, a stranger. I want to get to know her. I find myself talking too much, but I feel so comfortable with them. I just have so much to say, and they do too. I love it. Another hour passes. Then, spontaneously, I notice the music again. It sounds great. I feel it pulse through me and I’m compelled to dance like never before. 


We go towards the central stage of the arena with the intention of dancing together. All of us. It must be one by now but I’m ready to stay up all night. Ready to live. And then the music stops. The lights flicker on and flood the room with a harsh sense of reality. Cops materialize and I’m suddenly nervous. I avoid eye contact. They say someone keeps throwing the fire alarms; they say the event is being shut down early and we must leave. James, Sarah, and I quickly say goodbye to our new friends and we shuffle out with the crowd. The drive to James and Sarah’s apartment is a blur.


We arrive. It’s late but we sit and talk till dawn. It is obvious to me that this night will always stay with me. I feel alive. I can be a better person. “I’m going to do this again”, I tell James. “Everyone should do this at least once”.

15g7x2,1,2012-12-25,Short story I about my first rave awhile back,[deleted],aves,https://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/15g7x2/short_story_i_about_my_first_rave_awhile_back/,"This is long for a reddit post (4 pages doubled spaced in Word) but I wrote this for a college writing course a few years ago and I really tried to capture what I experienced and learned in detail so that the reader feels the same things I did. I changed the names, I think I got them all. Anyway here ya go:
_____________________________________________

James came back from his internship in L.A. and convinced me I needed to rave with him in Austin before he graduates. So we’re going to a rave called Spring Love. It’s only April but this night feels warm, like a summer night. I put my upcoming finals out of my mind. Screw geochemistry; I’m going to have a good time. 
Since I had never raved we spent the day preparing. Ravers wear “kandi”, little colorful beaded bracelets that you trade with other ravers, and you’re supposed to make your own before you went out. It sounded lame when James explained it to me, but he insisted so I throw a few of them together. I make one with my girlfriend’s name, one says Spring Love, a few random ones, and I have some glow sticks wrapped around my arms. James and his girlfriend Sarah are decked out: colorful clothes, fake vampire teeth, a dozen glow sticks between them and their arms covered with the kandi bracelets. Apparently, this is how they do it in L.A. and trading kandi is a cool way to meet people at raves. I’m psyched.


We get to the venue and it looks like a small stadium. The line is short and then we’re in, surrounded by thousands of people. For a “small” rave it seemed overwhelming at first. Some people just had kandi, but some girls wore tiny pink outfits complete with fairy wings, fuzzy boots and pacifiers, which they used to keep from grinding their teeth when they were rolling. These girls are Go-Go dancers, some hired for entertainment, some were just other ravers.


The arena is dim, and my eyes follow the laser lights to their source at center stage where a DJ in a costume of plastic sci-fi armor orchestrates his music. A mass of ravers crowds the stage and moves with every beat and every bass line from the speakers. Other ravers wander around further from the stage. There’s some trance music but mostly they’re playing dub-step, with heavy, bass filled, industrial sounds. But I don’t listen to the music so much as feel it’s vibrations through the soles of my shoes. What had sounded shitty moments earlier in the car is starting to sound awesome. I don’t know who the DJ’s are but James and Sarah do and we decide to visit the other three stages. We don’t need to use the bathroom but we make a quick stop there, away from the eyes of any security.


We walk around to the other stages while waiting to feel the effects of the altered chemistry in our veins. James tells me I should stay hydrated. Sarah seems tense, but I’m too excited to notice. James can deal with Sarah. I’m in awe of the people around me, the music, the lights, everything. We decide to sit and James whispers to me that Sarah had put on a little weight recently and being around these half naked dancers made her self-conscious. Sarah looks good, blonde, feminine, not overweight in my eyes, so I don’t get what the problem is.
We’ve been there for an hour and yet I feel nothing unusual. I’m getting impatient. Then James feels sick so we head to an outdoor space where everyone is sitting, cooling off, and smoking cigarettes. He leans against a wall. He tells me he always feels nauseous, briefly, then it passes. Sarah switches from insecure girlfriend to caring girlfriend and I decide my girlfriend could learn a thing or two from her. We’re waiting outside and I want to be annoyed with James for keeping us away from the stage but I just can’t be mad at him. In fact, I feel pretty good. 


We have more kandi than most people, and James’s outfit seems to draw people to us. Suddenly, we’re talking to strangers and making friends. Weird. I hate strangers. The next hour is a flash and I hear half a dozen life stories. I find myself telling my life story to one person, then another. A younger, hipster couple. A group of guys from a local community college. Everyone. I’m trading kandi with ravers while reciting the raver’s creed: Peace, love, unity, respect. PLUR. It sounded like hippy bullshit when James first explained it to me but it is *not* bullshit. 


I lock hands with people when we trade. I go through the motions of this new ritual. I slide the beads over my wrist and onto theirs and they do the same to me. I take the time to feel their skin, the warmth, the texture, even a little sweat. They feel amazing. I realize that people normally do everything possible to avoid touching one another and that when they do make contact it’s usually too quick and too awkward for anyone to enjoy it. I see someone with a “Free Hugs” sign and take the girl up on the offer. Twice.
James feels better and we walk around, we get a light show. A lanky kid, slightly younger than myself, dons his gloves and turns on the neon colored LED lights in the fingers. As we sit, he swirls the gloves right in front of our faces, and his well practiced hands form a beautiful blur of blue, green, and red. I feel alive. I’m living for the moment and really appreciating life. I need this. In everyday life I appreciate nothing; I just go through the motions.


More people. Beautiful people. Everyone starts trading back massages in a circle. Strangers, submitting their bodies to one another without hesitation. It’s not sexual, it’s innocent and trusting in a way I didn’t know people my age could be. I didn’t know people had the capacity to be this kind. Some people are rolling and others are not, it doesn’t matter, the warm feelings are contagious. I find myself massaging a girl, bonding with her. Her back is exposed and her dark brown skin feels amazing. She’s overweight, and she tells me she’s a lesbian. Exactly the sort of person who, in theory, I had no problem with but I would never have taken the time to get to know her normally.  Why do I only talk to girls I’m interested in? Still bonding with my new friend, a kid from Austin Community College starts talking politics with me. These people are not stupid. I’m stupid. I ignored these people. They have things worth saying, worth hearing.


We move to meet more people, turn a corner, and are stopped in our tracks by a jarring scene in front of us. Paramedics are loading a kid onto a stretcher. I don’t know who he is but I knew this could be dangerous. The kid is probably drunk too, he probably danced too hard, he took too much, he forgot to drink water. I hope he’s okay. We move on. We meet new people. Incredible people.


Especially these girls. James, Sarah, and I are deep in conversation with these three girls from Rice who apparently rave in Houston. A tall one, a brunette, says her name is Mary and she talks to James and Sarah. The other two fall into passionate conversation with me. Amy has a big smile, a real smile. She tells me her philosophical concept of justice while Beth and I discuss the future of journalism. Beth seems shy, so I treasure the fact that’s she opening up with me, a stranger. I want to get to know her. I find myself talking too much, but I feel so comfortable with them. I just have so much to say, and they do too. I love it. Another hour passes. Then, spontaneously, I notice the music again. It sounds great. I feel it pulse through me and I’m compelled to dance like never before. 


We go towards the central stage of the arena with the intention of dancing together. All of us. It must be one by now but I’m ready to stay up all night. Ready to live. And then the music stops. The lights flicker on and flood the room with a harsh sense of reality. Cops materialize and I’m suddenly nervous. I avoid eye contact. They say someone keeps throwing the fire alarms; they say the event is being shut down early and we must leave. James, Sarah, and I quickly say goodbye to our new friends and we shuffle out with the crowd. The drive to James and Sarah’s apartment is a blur.


We arrive. It’s late but we sit and talk till dawn. It is obvious to me that this night will always stay with me. I feel alive. I can be a better person. “I’m going to do this again”, I tell James. “Everyone should do this at least once”.

What now?",throwm3away999,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15jm1u/i_33m_catch_23f_two_years_together_with_me_now/,"**TLDR: I discover girlfriend crushing on someone, ask her to stop talking to him, she gets very upset and hates me now.  What should I do?**

(xposted to /r/R_A)

###Background

She's a very bright, pretty (in my and others' eyes at least, cos she doesn't see herself as attractive) and generous girl.  Not too long ago, she was head over heels about me, but now it feels somewhat like she's meh.  Boys hit on her.

I am a moderately attractive man with an outgoing and open personality, who has let himself go a bit (made myself a beer belly), but I am not a lost case and I am already working out to regain what I lost.  Girls flirt with me.

Before I met her, she fought anorexia, went through a horribly abusive relationship, and also went through a phase when she wanted to be a boy (that didn't work out -- she met me).  She's very feminine and well-nourished now. 

I endured a terrible relationship six months before I met her.  I'm okay now.

We live together in a beautiful loft, and we came back a month ago from a vacation trip in Ecuador.

###The events

I only pieced together the puzzle pieces yesterday.  A few weeks of mostly dead bedroom and sporadic contempt microgestures towards me; increased interest in her grooming; her face lights up when she talks on Facebook (with someone I thought I did not know) but returns to ""normal"" and becomes secretive when I am around.  Stranger still, the past three days she had been very loving (in somewhat of a ""forced"" way), but at least we had above-average sex.  I was confused.

So I check her public Twitter stream, and she has been flirting openly with him, talking with him late in the evening. With this intern who has worked next to her for three months.  Cue horrible pit in my stomach.    I was feeling that something was off before -- now I was just plain feeling horrible, empty.  I know the guy -- I saw him flirting two weeks ago with her at the company party when I went to get drinks, and (I am afraid I willfully ignored this) she was smiling back at him and giving him IOIs.

So I meet her for lunch at work, tell her to come home to talk about something important.  Once home, I tell her the three things I noticed (above).  She becomes really nervous.  I then ask her to show me her FB private messages, Twitter private messages, and search her mail for point stuff (I know what exactly to search for, and this isn't a fishing expedition).  She holds back, saying that I don't need to; that if I check, all I will discover are ""feelings"".  That was her confession; while it appears that she did not fabricate lies, she did hide stuff from me until she was about to be caught; at least she did not deny and fog then.

""I still want to see with my own eyes; right now, we're not criticizing anything -- we're only discovering what is"", is my reply.  She sobs but she complies.

And I indeed discover those feelings stored there, secretly (thank God nothing sexually explicit), accentuated by her explanation of ""we really don't have much communication online, since we sat next to each other at work"".  He's been gone two weeks, back to Canada after finishing his internship, hopefully never to return.  Hence online communication.  I don't know if the relationship ever turned physical -- absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.  They've had three months of eight hours next to each other to bond behind my back.

She asks me if I want to break up with her, to which I say no.  ""However,"" I say, gently yet unilaterally, ""I want you to cease all contact with him"".

That's when she starts crying uncontrollably.  She truly does not want to.  She says that she knows herself and what she feels, and that's how she knows her chatting with him is not something serious for me to worry about (mmmhmmm).  She says that it's not fair for me to tell her what friends not to talk to (curious how her admitted crush who wants to get in her crotch somehow suddenly got demoted to ""friend"", right then and there).  She says that I'm being controlling and threatening her career, because ""I still need to talk to him to get information to finish my project"".  He's gone.  He doesn't work there anymore.  These reasons make no sense, except as excuses.  All she's saying is being contradicted by her (now-evident) desperation for her budding separation anxiety.

Wreck that I am at that moment, I remain outwardly unperturbed.  I am very clear: if she refuses, I will leave her.  I am outwardly quite calm, but I really feel anger, desperation, the dread of inevitability, that dread you feel when something irreversible has happened.  She's slipping away and I can almost see it happen in real-time.

She cries, but she eventually says OK; she regains some composure, but it isn't panic or sadness that her face emotes anymore.  Now it's resentment and hate.  She obviously feels that I have violated her privacy by asking her to see her Facebook, and she really does not like that I did that (neither do I, frankly).  But that's not the worst.  The worst is, I'm cockblocking my own girlfriend -- preventing her from getting her kicks from her illicit emotional relationship -- *and that appears to be the very thing she cannot forgive me for*.

Her lips say yes.  But her face appears to say ""I hate you"".

###What next?

- Ask her to get tested?
- A no contact letter from her to him?
- Should she delete him from Facebook?  (Why should she keep him otherwise?)
- When and how do I trust her again?
- How do I know she isn't talking to him behind my back?  I do not want my life to become a shitty spy novel.
- I'm already working on fixing myself to regain physical attractiveness.  How else do I regain her attraction, given these tough times ahead?
- Do I cut my losses and reserve my self-improvement efforts for someone I can trust?
- Do I just not know how to pick 'em?

I really need questions, answers, pointers and advice, cos I thought she might be forever till death do us part, but now I am not so sure."
15jiub,5,2012-12-27,My sister got no gifts this Christmas thanks to her selfish boyfriend.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15jiub/my_sister_got_no_gifts_this_christmas_thanks_to/,"He gets paid about a grand a week. For Christmas he promised her a puppy. She wanted a Golden Retriever but he told her Golden Retrievers need ""extremely active people"" and ""she's not active at all"". She is. We go out constantly. We go on hikes, walk around town for hours talking and hanging out. He sits and eats. He weighs a lot and we are all pretty sure he has diabetes. So he says they have to get a Basset Hound. She says fine. Then while she's at work he goes and picks the puppy out that HE wants. Christmas time comes, they are supposed to get the puppy in a couple days. He tells her today they don't have the money anymore and that she either has to help him pay for the puppy or for the oil to heat the house. She is obviously choosing the oil. She asks him where his money went because he didn't have any bills to pay this week and should have a grand, enough to do both these things. He responds, ""I don't know."" Everyone got her puppy things for Christmas expecting her to get a puppy.Now that she isn't she has training pads, leashes, collars, a dog gate, shampoo, gift cards etc. but no pet to spend it on. This is not the first time he's done things like this. He was driving around a really awful car, my sister had no car. His grandparents offer to sell her a really nice car they weren't using anymore. My sister agrees, gets the money in order, then suddenly he comes home and says to her his grandparents decided they wanted him to have it because they ""didn't trust her with it"". He gives her his old car and he gets their car for free. His old car broke down constantly. It would accelerate even when the gas wasn't being touched. My sister drove with her foot on the brake, not the gas. At this time she was working 3 jobs, an internship, and going to school. We were all always in a constant state of fear that she would crash. She finally got a new car, through him and his ""auto body"" family. She gets another piece of shit but this time she has to buy it. This all happened after he had been upset for weeks about her getting a new car. There are so many situations like these. He has so many flaws it blows my mind my sister is with him. He is a walking Family Guy episode. He is one of those people that will quote Family Guy as if they thought of the jokes first. My sister is a mature, beautiful, funny, intelligent person and he is a fool. He is constantly regurgitating things he hears Republicans say on TV. When challenged, he freezes up and has no idea what to say and blows it off by saying things like, ""Well, that's just what I think."" To clarify, I have no problem with anyone Republican, whatever, but if you're going to tell me not to say Happy Holidays to people because it's ""Christmas time"", you better fucking know what you're talking about. He constantly calls her fat as a ""joke"" when he is morbidly obese. My sister is almost 6 feet tall. She is 5'11"". She is not a small girl, but if you could see her, she's not fat. He is covered in stretch marks and hair. He makes fart jokes constantly even though he is an adult man. Sadly, only physically. Mentally he is 13. I live with them while I'm at school because my mom is homeless. I can never escape him. He is always there making jokes he found on 4chan. Always yelling at my sister. Treating her like she's dumb and useless. Ruining their house by acting like ""a man who knows what he's doing"". He ruined the tiled wall in the bathroom trying to fix it. There are now holes all over the shower. I can't stand him. He's awful. Even writing this brings me no relief. All of us in my family have tried talking to her but she just keeps insisting we are wrong and he's not ""that bad"". She's never happy when he's around. She is going to be a social worker. Right now she is a therapeutic mentor. I have seriously no idea how she doesn't see all the things wrong going on here. Both with their relationship, and with herself. I feel helpless. Their relationship has put a serious strain on her and another sister of ours. They aren't speaking anymore, partly due to him. He constantly infers he's cheating on her. He is constantly talking behind her back and making people hate her. She pretends like it's not him doing it. We all see him doing it. We overhear him talking on the phone trashing her and lying about her. She doesn't believe anyone. I feel hopeless. He is draining her of her happiness and money. I just needed to talk about this. Anyone can ask questions or offer advice."

I'm hoping to take a year off to learn some of the prerequisites, beef up my programming skills (which I already have a decent head start on) and find an internship somewhere.  

I've googled it but couldn't really find anything.  I'm hoping for one in the fall ideally, something that lasts ~6-8 months maybe.  And, specifically, I'm interested in computational neuroscience.  And I know beggars can't be choosers, but I'd love something in the northwest (Portland/Seattle area) if at all possible.  

Does anybody know of any opportunities like this?  

Thanks.

15jfhw,3,2012-12-27,Ex [22M] and I [22F] recently broke off our 5yr relationship because LDR wasn't working. We want to get back together but want each other to be happy. What to do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15jfhw/ex_22m_and_i_22f_recently_broke_off_our_5yr/,"My ex [22M] and I [22F] were together almost five years, we met in high school and made it through college (He graduated last year, I'm still a senior), each of us going to different schools about an hour away from each other. We had our ups and downs but it worked. After undergrad he decided to go to law school, one that was farther away which was a difficult decision because we knew it meant another 3years of LDR but he needed to do what was best for him. 

Last semester I was presented with a pretty stellar internship opportunity in FL, one I couldn't refuse, so I took it thinking it didn't matter much where I was since we'd be LDR anyway. Long story short, we were both busy with school and work that the distance started to tear us apart. We texted periodically throughout the day but we barely had any opportunities to really talk or video chat and being apart was tough. During college we would only go maybe two or three weeks at the most without seeing each other and now this was months at a time. I had planned to visit in October because I had the opportunity to tour a grad school of interest nearby, expenses paid. While there I was able to spend the weekend with him, meet his new friends, and all in all it was great. Before leaving, however, we agreed we needed to talk. The long distance was tiring and making both of us unhappy and we knew it.  Up to that point we had been putting it off and ignoring the problems it was causing between us so in the end we agreed that it would be in the best interest of both of us to break up so that we could pursue our interests (he with law school and me, school and my career) and be happy. 

After returning to FL I immediately regretted the decision and tried talking to him but he was pretty firm on giving the break up a shot. He said it was too soon to talk even though we agreed we would try to be friends in the future and that if we were to get back together it wouldn't be until after he was done with law school (3 years, if not more). We didn't talk for weeks and I was under the impression he wanted to be left alone.  Heartbroken and lonely, I didn't know what to do so naturally I tried ignoring all of my problems and started seeing someone else hoping it would help me move on. 

Now that the semester is over and we are both home for winter break the reality of the situation has been sinking in. After getting home we started having short and awkward conversations via text but about a week ago while we were both drunk the conversation started to get serious and a lot of unspoken feelings were shared. He told me he started seeing someone else but missed me. Since then, we've been texting regularly, almost every day. Each of the people we are seeing both know we've been talking as well. 

We both know the situation we are in, we still love each other tremendously and would love nothing more than to be together but we can't - physically anyway and we don't want to go back to the LDR. We've also complicated our situation by bringing other people into it. He cares for the girl he's with now and can't just leave her, and I can't do that with the guy I've been dating either. I guess the difference in our situations with these new people is that he can physically be with her while at school/will be forced to see her everyday in class but I'm still left alone since I'm going back to college in PA come January while the guy I was seeing is still in FL. He's also told me that either way he feels like he will be settling - whether its getting back together with me because we still can't physically be together or staying broken up and settling for someone else. We're not really sure what to do and it seems like a lose-lose situation. 

Having to explain to friends and family, especially around the holidays, that we broke up not because we wanted to but because the circumstances weren't right is probably the most difficult. This is the person I see myself marrying and being with after school. I fear if I let him go I'll regret it forever. And knowing he feels the same makes it worse. We're meeting to talk in about a week or so, but I'm not really sure what to say. Do we move on for good or hold out in the hopes that we can make it work in two years time? Clearly the time isn't right now, but I don't know if he's willing to go back to LDR sooner before he is done with law school. 

In the mean time I'm also struggling with whether to get a job right after graduation (next January) or go to grad school for two years. I know I won't have a difficult time finding a job in either case but it seems going to grad school also produces the best chances of us being together since all of the schools I'm interested in are nearby. Then afterward we can come to a decision together. I just don't know :( 

Sorry for the long post, I've just been extremely upset and am really torn on what we could do. I'm scared I'll never be able to move on. I know there isn't a solution to this problem but any insight or advice would be great. 

**TLDR; Mutual breakup with bf of 5yrs because LDR was hurting us, both started seeing other people, but realizing after a lot of miscommunication that we still want to be together. Not sure what to do.**"

She's a very bright, pretty (in my and others' eyes at least, cos she doesn't see herself as attractive) and generous girl.  Not too long ago, she was head over heels about me, but now it feels somewhat like she's meh.  Boys hit on her.

I am a moderately attractive man with an outgoing and open personality, who has let himself go a bit (made myself a beer belly), but I am not a lost case and I am already working out to regain what I lost.  Girls flirt with me.

Before I met her, she fought anorexia, went through a horribly abusive relationship, and also went through a phase when she wanted to be a boy (that didn't work out -- she met me).  She's very feminine and well-nourished now. 

I endured a terrible relationship six months before I met her.  I'm okay now.

We live together in a beautiful loft, and we came back a month ago from a vacation trip in Ecuador.

###The events

I only pieced together the puzzle pieces yesterday.  A few weeks of mostly dead bedroom and sporadic contempt microgestures towards me; increased interest in her grooming; her face lights up when she talks on Facebook (with someone I thought I did not know) but returns to ""normal"" and becomes secretive when I am around.  Stranger still, the past three days she had been very loving (in somewhat of a ""forced"" way), but at least we had above-average sex.  I was confused.

So I check her public Twitter stream, and she has been flirting openly with him, talking with him late in the evening. With this intern who has worked next to her for three months.  Cue horrible pit in my stomach.    I was feeling that something was off before -- now I was just plain feeling horrible, empty.  I know the guy -- I saw him flirting two weeks ago with her at the company party when I went to get drinks, and (I am afraid I willfully ignored this) she was smiling back at him and giving him IOIs.

So I meet her for lunch at work, tell her to come home to talk about something important.  Once home, I tell her the three things I noticed (above).  She becomes really nervous.  I then ask her to show me her FB private messages, Twitter private messages, and search her mail for point stuff (I know what exactly to search for, and this isn't a fishing expedition).  She holds back, saying that I don't need to; that if I check, all I will discover are ""feelings"".  That was her confession; while it appears that she did not fabricate lies, she did hide stuff from me until she was about to be caught; at least she did not deny and fog then.

""I still want to see with my own eyes; right now, we're not criticizing anything -- we're only discovering what is"", is my reply.  She sobs but she complies.

And I indeed discover those feelings stored there, secretly (thank God nothing sexually explicit), accentuated by her explanation of ""we really don't have much communication online, since we sat next to each other at work"".  He's been gone two weeks, back to Canada after finishing his internship, hopefully never to return.  Hence online communication.  I don't know if the relationship ever turned physical -- absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.  They've had three months of eight hours next to each other to bond behind my back.

She asks me if I want to break up with her, to which I say no.  ""However,"" I say, gently yet unilaterally, ""I want you to cease all contact with him"".

That's when she starts crying uncontrollably.  She truly does not want to.  She says that she knows herself and what she feels, and that's how she knows her chatting with him is not something serious for me to worry about (mmmhmmm).  She says that it's not fair for me to tell her what friends not to talk to (curious how her admitted crush who wants to get in her crotch somehow suddenly got demoted to ""friend"", right then and there).  She says that I'm being controlling and threatening her career, because ""I still need to talk to him to get information to finish my project"".  He's gone.  He doesn't work there anymore.  These reasons make no sense, except as excuses.  All she's saying is being contradicted by her (now-evident) desperation for her budding separation anxiety.

Wreck that I am at that moment, I remain outwardly unperturbed.  I am very clear: if she refuses, I will leave her.  I am outwardly quite calm, but I really feel anger, desperation, the dread of inevitability, that dread you feel when something irreversible has happened.  She's slipping away and I can almost see it happen in real-time.

She cries, but she eventually says OK; she regains some composure, but it isn't panic or sadness that her face emotes anymore.  Now it's resentment and hate.  She obviously feels that I have violated her privacy by asking her to see her Facebook, and she really does not like that I did that (neither do I, frankly).  But that's not the worst.  The worst is, I'm cockblocking my own girlfriend -- preventing her from getting her kicks from her illicit emotional relationship -- *and that appears to be the very thing she cannot forgive me for*.

Her lips say yes.  But her face appears to say ""I hate you"".

###What next?

- Ask her to get tested?
- A no contact letter from her to him?
- Should she delete him from Facebook?  (Why should she keep him otherwise?)
- When and how do I trust her again?
- How do I know she isn't talking to him behind my back?  I do not want my life to become a shitty spy novel.
- I'm already working on fixing myself to regain physical attractiveness.  How else do I regain her attraction, given these tough times ahead?
- Do I cut my losses and reserve my self-improvement efforts for someone I can trust?
- Do I just not know how to pick 'em?

I really need questions, answers, pointers and advice, cos I thought she might be forever till death do us part, but now I am not so sure."

15igdu,2,2012-12-27,This year has been a nosedive,1flux,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15igdu/this_year_has_been_a_nosedive/,"It started okay. I had just finished a great internship. I was dating a new girl, the first since a breakup of a year long relationship (3 years off and on - she was my first, it's complicated). I was about to finish my last term of school, to graduate in the summer. I was in amazing shape, running and working out routinely.

A couple of months in, things started going wrong. I got blackout drunk at a party, and got a little too close to my ex. I smoothed things over, but it would serve to show my unresolved issues. I later found out my ex had been seeing my best friend for over 6 months. I was completely torn up by this - to the surprise of my current girlfriend. I ended things with her right away - as soon as I realized I was so unstable, I didn't want any emotional casualties. 

I was angry. Simultaneously, I lost two of my best friends.

Fast forward to the summer - I've graduated, going to start my new job, but not before a month long eurotrip with my buddies.

Repressing my emotions, the cracks start to show. Every once in a while, I would get too drunk (we were drinking almost every night, but that's to be expected from a trip such as this). Every once in a while, I would overeat. Most of the time, things looked okay.

One night, I got near blackout drunk and broke my knee. Flew home, while the rest went on and spent a month at home, frustratingly regressing before the start of my new life. Worried about weight gain from no running, I underate - and lost most of my muscle mass.

Eventually, I moved to the new city, with much difficulty with my knee. I immediately buried myself in my work. A cycle of caffeine and alcohol drove my first few months. Once I was able to walk, I immediately tried running, the first false start of many. At some point, observant of my muscle loss, I relaxed my diet. 

Around this time, I started overeating. It was usually once a week, a binge on something. A couple of days of bloating, itching, irritation, regret. A few days of normalcy, and then another episode.

The normalcy gaps shortened. A couple of times a week, sometimes daily, there was uncontrollable eating.

I bought a bike, but got hit by a car biking home after a few drinks. Thankfully my knee survived.

My grandmother died.

Now for the present tense. I'm home for the holidays, and instead of trying to start running again like I planned, I've been binging on holiday desserts. I don't know my family anymore - after being away at school and moving to the city, I have nothing in common with them. In the city, I have basically no social circle. The two people which I confide in are completely out of my life. The one activity that made me feel better and be healthier, running, I can no longer do.

I can feel myself getting fatter. I've gained over 30 lbs. It's not very noticeable yet, but I can tell. My face is fatter. I can't wear my once fitted clothes. 

I'm lonely. Even after all of this shit, I miss my ex. We know eachother completely, I've never had that with anyone else. I don't usually let people in - now I'm even less likely to do so.

I'm depressed. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore - except eating, for a few seconds. My mind is a blur. Meditation, even quiet solitude conjures pain - emotional spilling over to physical. Every day I feel less connected to the world.

Hopefully this is the first step towards dealing with this. Just below the surface, I have a steady supply of emotional pain, that's only getting worse. I used to counter it with a hefty amount of running endorphins, and it was likely eased by being surrounded by friends and a familiar environment. A combination of a new life, a new (sometimes stressful) job, rebuilding a social circle, something had to give. I don't know when I'm going to snap out of it and start picking up the pieces.

tl;dr: year started good, relationship / emotional trauma, constraining injury, drinking + overeating, more injuries and shitty things, reflection, acceptance, no plan of action."

1. Thoughts on downtown-area boxes? I've looked at a few, but they all seem to have some pretty strict ramp-up periods, which might not be ideal for me (only around for 3 months...). Also, I'm an intern, price is an issue.

2. Ramp-up periods... do all boxes have them? I've been doing crossfit-style workouts for a while now and definitely know how to olympic lift (worked with a trainer for a while), are these strictly necessary? Can I ""test out""?

Thanks for the advice!"
15kvz9,20,2012-12-28,Me [21M] and my girlfriend [20F] are going through some issues and are on the cusp of breaking up.  help please. [WARNING: really long],BigRedDawg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15kvz9/me_21m_and_my_girlfriend_20f_are_going_through/,"I have a girlfriend of 9 months that I pretty much broke up with last night for a variety of reasons that aren't all relating to her.  We have had a great relationship up until about a month ago.  We were happy and in love (still are).  

We started off as friends when she recruited me into a campus organization that she was a part of (we are in the same college and have three semesters left) and things were good.  I had pursued her looking for nothing more than a hookup the semester before and she shot me down.  We didn't talk much that semester and I became infatuated with a girl that also turned me down.  Over the break after that semester, I took some time to do some introspection and figure out what I wanted and how to get it.  I came out of that break a new man.  I wanted to be independently happy and then I wanted to find someone special to share that happiness with.  I also wanted to make new friends because my social life was non-existent.

So my current girlfriend invited me to join this campus organization and I did.  I started to become friends with her and I thought of her as the beginning to my new group of friends.  I had no intention of trying to get with her or do anything sexual in the slightest.  So we start becoming closer, having dinner at the dining hall, sitting together at the meetings for the organization, etc.  after about a month, I thought I started noticing that she was flirting with me.  It was subtle and sporadic so I thought I was just imagining it and that she was just being friendly.  so this flirting slowly starts progressing and it becomes less subtle and more frequent.  I still thought I was imagining it because she was still getting over a long term relationship that had ended ~6 months prior to this.  

Eventually, we both recognized that there was sexual tension between us and that we were mutually interested.  We decided to go on a few dates.  Nothing exclusive yet, just a couple of dates.  they went well and then I wanted to make things official and pushed for exclusivity.  She doesn't want to do that because she is still getting over her ex but after a while, we do it.  boom, we're an official couple.

We took things slow and did them right.  Fast forward a couple of months.  She has a study abroad program on a different continent for 5 weeks.  we both had done long distance in the past and knew that it didn't work well.  we decided to stay together anyway.  It was tough but we chatted and skyped as often as we could through her busy schedule and my constant working at the internship that I had gotten over the summer.  

She comes back after the 5 weeks and I go with her parents to pick her up at the airport at 6 in the morning before work one day.  She doesn't seem terribly excited to see me.  We ended up going up to our college for the weekend with a couple of her friends (july 4th weekend) and she was pretty distant when we first got there.  The first night, we were drinking and despite me not drinking much, I got really sick the next morning and ended up throwing up.  She is a very motherly person and those instincts kicked in.  She took care of me and after that, our spark was back.  Everything went great for the rest of the weekend.  Everything was great for a long time.  

Fast forward another few months.  we both had killer schedules with school and we were both on the committee for planning a regional conference for the organization we were in, (she project lead, me the finance guy) and it was a huge time commitment.  It was like a job.  It was incredibly stressful for both of us.  Finally, that came and went and right afterwards, she had this 40 page term paper for her business leadership class.  I is basically a paper about you and who you are as a person and a leader.  She took this paper quite seriously and spent a lot of time on it.  during this time, I would barely talk to her, when we did see each other, our interactions were very distant, and her sex drive was zero.  I felt neglected and she even said one night when I was trying to kiss her that the found me unattractive.  It hurt and pushed me away.  while she was stressed with this, she went on to say a couple of other things that continued to hurt and push me away.  

She finally finished her big paper and right after that happened, I got swamped with a big project and finals.  I became really stressed and when she tried to reach out to me to do things, I couldn't spare the time to talk to her much or spend my time with her because I just had a massive amount of work that I needed to get done in a short time span.  I generally tend to isolate myself when upset for whatever reason because I tend to take my frustrations out on those around me.  I separated myself further from her and this only caused more fights because she felt I was shutting her out.  

during these fights, things were said that further worked to push me away and make me feel more distant.  I finally finished all the stuff that was making me stressed and then went back home for the holidays and immediately started working at my internship over the summer.  I felt overwhelmed from the finals and then I never really got a break.  That mixed in with insomnia for the past few months, I have been constantly tired.  I have noticed myself being incredibly emotionally unstable when normally, I am very capable of handling my emotions.  (I internalize things and deal with them on my own.  I am an independent person and I pride myself on that)

I have realized that I am depressed (probably clinically) and there are many factors that go into that.  

1. fighting with the person that I love.
2. having bad grades, losing my scholarship, and my parent's disappointment with me for that.  My mother brings in the money for the house and she works her ass off and I feel guilty that my failure at school is causing her to be unhappy.
3. I still have a tiny amount of friends, an even tinier amount of people I can count on.
4. I have become very unhealthy (poor diet, little to no exercise)
5.I feel like a general failure.

There was one fight in which I realized that we had an expiration date.  After college, we will both probably follow a job to a city and it is very unlikely that it will be the same city.  I also realized that she isn't the 'one'.  We are compatible and get along really well but we share basically none of the same interests, our brains think different ways (me: super logical, her: a mix of logic and emotion, leaning towards emotion), and while, I do love her and really care about her happiness and well being, I just don't see us getting married (neither of us want to get married for at least 5 years).  Most of what we do is sit around in her apartment and cuddle.  

We talked about it and agreed to not think about the expiration date and try to make it work but I just can't shake it out of my head.  I can't shake the other things that were said either.  There was one fight where we almost broke up and she said the whole 'you'll never find anyone who is as attractive as me' thing.  

I have felt for a couple of weeks now that I need to take time and work on myself.  I know that in order to do that, I need to be single and have no distractions.  The problem with that is that I would lose the woman I love in the process.  She is firm in her belief that ex's can't be friends so it is all or nothing.  so basically what I see my options as are: 

* break up, work on myself, lose someone I love

* stay together, try to get past our problems, only to break up later on

I don't like either option.  

**So here is my question.  Should I continue with this breakup that I have already half started and try to fix myself at the cost of the girl that I love? or should I keep trying to make something work that seems futile?**

tldr; boy meets girl, they start dating.  9 months later, after a stressful period in both lives, relationship is strained due to stress.  boy falls into depression.  girl loves boy and boy loves girl.  boy feels that he needs alone time to fix depression.  this requires breaking up.  neither like the concept of breaking up.

edit: She has been trying really hard to make things work since the expiration date talk.  I can see that she really cares about me and the relationship.  seeing her put in this much effort makes it hard to think about breaking up with her..."

Coming into this season, Dexter was faced with a lot of problems but they were resolved so quickly.  Oh the intern is a problem?  Don't worry, he's dead.  Issac is threatening Dexter with Hannah?  Dex will handle that in a episode or two.  Harrison being around is a problem?  Just sent him to his grand parents for half the season (why didn't Dex think of this in previous seasons?  I don't know).  Everything was wrapped up too nicely.

And the finale?  Let's have Hannah escape so we can have another love triangle between Deb, Hannah and Dexter.  ""But it's setting up for the next protagonist"" well that sucks, since her poison killing is the least intimidating killer on the show.  Also in the last season, I would like to see the series go out with a bang since post Rita this show has gone way south.  So ironic I say that since I hated her when she was around.  

And LaGuerta just shows up to the docks with no back up?  How much of a coincidence is it that LaGuerta and the Hector dude are both dead and ""killed each other"".  Of course this will go completely overlooked by the worst investigation unit ever.  

The writing on this show has gone downhill to me and I want to hear some opinions.  This is turning into a soap opera and it's a damn shame.  "

How's Terre Haute? What fun things are there to do, amenities, etc? I'm used to big cities; I'd be coming to Rose from New York City - I haven't really lived in any small towns.

I'm planning on studying computer science (you can glance at my nickname now). Does Rose have awesome CS classes and labs and things that'll make me drool?

Job fairs! I hear these are quite popular in good schools - what cool internship and employment opportunities do you folks have?

Lastly, information about the quality of the dorms and social life on campus would be cool. Also, can you have a car on campus your freshman year? I've spent over a year of my life rebuilding a MINI and I'd like to be able to take it with me.

(xpost /r/jobs)",arumberg,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/15k8z7/i_need_some_help_prepping_for_an_interview_next/,"I have an interview next week at a nonprofit social services agency in a city about an hour from where I am currently living. The job is for a 'run-away and homeless youth' caseworker, and I found the job posting on craigslist.

Before I submitted my resume, I had done a quick search to find out the name of the agency I was applying to, as it wasn't listed. I easily found it after a Google search and after giving the website a quick glance, I decided to go ahead and apply.

Now that I have an interview, I went back to read over the website more carefully, and I found something that concerns me a bit, and I need help figuring out how to raise the subject during the interview. I found out that the agency is headed by the Catholic Social Services which is headed by the local Diocese.

My issue with this is that I consider myself to be atheist. I want to know about how they implement their services. I have experience working with a faith-based organization through a school internship, whose Board of Directors was made up of head members of each of the local churches, and I preferred the way they ran their organization. Any religious services (prayer groups, free bibles, etc) were optional, and religion was never brought up in discussion unless initiated by the client. Weeks would go by sometimes before I heard any mention of God outside the occasional morning prayer circle which I did not involve myself with, with respect from the other volunteers there.

I want to find out from my interview whether the same type of hands-off religious approach will be utilized in my position. I won't feel comfortable preaching to young, impressionable, and vulnerable youth about something I don't believe in, if it were part of my job, and I wouldn't feel all that comfortable pushing a more conservative set of morals, either (for example, another part of their programs aside from runaway youth is SmartChoices, which 'guide students to make proper choices in areas of sexual abstinence [...] etc'. It makes no mention of other forms of safe sex, which I find troubling. Would I be forbidden to mention condoms or birth control if the situation arises?) But I don't know how to bring up the subject during the interview without making myself look like I'm uncomfortable with it or questioning their policies, or possibly outing myself as an atheist altogether. I mean, I know it would technically be discrimination and all if they would refuse to hire me based on my religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and all, but let's be honest. The Catholic Diocese hiring an atheist? It's easily dismiss-able by stating they would rather someone that more fits the agency's goals and mission. I.e., a potentially conservative, religious goal and mission.

But I don't even know any of this for sure. The agency's website doesn't mention anything about religion aside from ""A program of Catholic Social Services"". I mean, if they have a hands-off approach in terms of religion, then sign me up. I really want to work with this population subset. I nearly fell off my chair when I found the job ad, I was so excited. And I'm totally comfortable only making the $24,500 they quoted me on the phone while making the appointment if I get to do something I've been wanting to do for so long. I just need to find out how they handle religion in their agency as delicately and inconspicuously as possible for fear of jeopardizing my chances at getting the job.

15jxpw,1,2012-12-27,"I never interned, do I have a chance at an agency?",[deleted],advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/15jxpw/i_never_interned_do_i_have_a_chance_at_an_agency/,"So, I'm a college senior and I'm graduating in May.  I'm applying to a lot (literally a hundred or so) of ad agencies, mostly in Boston/NYC, but also some smaller agencies not in major metro areas.  I'm looking to work in accounts, so almost all of my applications have been for Assistant Account Exec positions.

I have good grades, I was the president of my fraternity, and have been working since I was 16.  Most importantly (for the accounts side anyways), I have confidence and good people skills, write and speak clearly, am organized, and can motivate others to get their work done effectively.  I think all of this would make me a pretty good AAE.  

But I've never been an intern, and all of my work experience has been in banks or restaurants.  To be honest, those jobs have given me a lot of valuable insight into serving others, communicating and working with people (especially as a maitre'd, making sure everybody is on the same page, which it seems is a big component to accounts work).  But I'm afraid they just won't look too attractive on a resume since I haven't been in the Ad industry itself.  There's not much glamour in the Restaurant Biz.  Ultimately, I can't showcase my people skills on a resume, outside of just saying I have these skills.  My cover letters convey some of what I have just said, and I feel that once I meet with interviewers, I'll have a good shot, but I'm afraid I won't even get interview opportunities based on my resume.  

Is there any way I can make myself stand out when applying?  The jobs are so competitive and I don't have the time/resources to do any kind of unpaid internship now.

Although we have indeed submitted all the proper documentation, forms and associated fees to renew our license to operate, the state has ordered us to shut down while they process our application. We have been informed that this process of review can take 2-3 months or even more. Sadly, we will be unable to survive the financial strain such a period would impose upon our very small organization.

&gt;Clearly this is a grave situation with great urgency, one for which we are reaching out to you for your support. That is why we the staff, the SFBI Family, are reaching out to you in the hope that we may be able to convince the BPPE to allow us to remain open while our application is pending review.

&gt;Faced with little recourse, we immediately decided to initiate a petition on Change.org, [which you can view and sign by clicking here](http://www.change.org/petitions/california-bureau-for-private-postsecondary-education-allow-san-francisco-baking-institute-to-remain-open). We invite you all to sign the petition, which we plan to submit on this fast-approaching Monday, December 31st, New Year's Eve.

&gt;We the team here at the school did not learn of this until yesterday, as Michel did not want to dampen our personal holiday celebrations in the past few days with this heartbreaking news. We are now facing the very real and shocking possibility of closing our doors in just a few days, and close to 30 people losing their jobs at the drop of a hat. Some of us have been here several years, some of us are interns who have recently graduated and are starting our baking careers. The common thread we all share is our love of baking and the passion to share that skill and knowledge with people like you from around the country and globe.

&gt;We hope to continue serving the artisan baking community for many years yet to come, but right now we are asking for your help. What has SFBI meant to you, or to a loved one who has attended classes here? How will the artisan baking industry and movement suffer if SFBI must shut its doors? We encourage you to send us your statements of support via this email. Please do note that the SFBI website and email may soon have to go offline per the order to cease all operations, so this email address as well as michel@tmbbaking.com are for now the best points of contact. We also offer our heartfelt thanks to the many who have already reached out to us in the last 24 hours since receiving the news.

&gt;Thank you once again for your support now and throughout the years.

Today's email:

&gt;Dear SFBI Family Members,

&gt;We thank you all for your emails and support, we are going to fight for SFBI!  You have shared with us the love and passion that you have for bread baking and that you truly care for our school.

15n8qp,1,2012-12-29,The Golden Gate - One of the first pieces I've written,GuitarGuyZA,stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/15n8qp/the_golden_gate_one_of_the_first_pieces_ive/,"The Golden Gate

An old man once told me I was meant for something. That I was going to have a job someday, a purpose. 

I didn't believe him.

Did he have a beard? He probably did. He had to—they always have beards. Nonetheless, his words escaped me. Maybe it was because of the way the sun hung just a little bit too drearily in the ashen grey sky that day, or the pungent odor of whiskey on his breath. Maybe I was too concerned with hiding the stench of my step-dad's on my own breath. Regardless, I sure as hell wasn't listening to thing that poor old bastard was telling me. 

I had places to go, you see. I had to get across the Bay to stop at the Golden Gate Bridge before going to catch that interview for the internship at Shove-It-Up-Your-Ass Inc., otherwise I'd be at home shitting around on the piano for the whole of summer, or at least finding an excuse to drink my way through it, playing my LP’s and 45’s until I wore the needle off the record player—and Lord knows no mother of mine could have that. 

I wish I knew what that summer was for. I wish I knew what that whole year was for. I was convinced it was supposed to be the greatest year to date, but it only took a few hours for that to be disproven, what with catching my at-the-time girlfriend cheating on me with my at-the-time best friend. But hey, that wasn’t really in my control was it? I guess my decision to beat the living shit out of him was in my control, but we’ll call that one 50/50. It was New Year’s. Even more I wish that trip to Golden Gate Bridge could have given me just a second of clarity.

But I suppose it’s not all that important now. I’m here either way, 11 months later, waiting for this damn bus. It couldn’t have been late on any other day in November, no sir, it could only be running late on the day that marked the start of the rainy season. I checked the weather this morning and I brought my umbrella, but it would have been a lot nicer if I didn’t need to use it. 

Even now I wish I could see the sun, even as weakly as the day it hung in the sky as that old man ranted to me about God knows what. Now the sky is just one solid light grey. Not even a lighter spot from the sun glowing behind the vapors. Completely solid, like a piece of concrete, covering the world. Even more I wish I heard what that old man was telling me that day, wish that could have stopped being distracted from the burn of whiskey on my tongue for just a few brief seconds to catch the slightest bit of goddamn meaning off of the words of one man. Just one man, just once. 

But no. I was a stupid kid then. Now, I’m much smarter. I’ve learned. After more than a few failed attempts, I got myself a new girlfriend (much better than the old one, mind you) and I shit you not, I landed that internship after masking my scotch-breath with a few mints from the desk of some secretary on the way in. I even got myself bus ticket to the Golden Gate, where I can finally learn to just take a step back and listen and, when I’m ready, take a leap forward.

15mrjp,23,2012-12-29,What the hell am I doing wrong?,bl4z3,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/15mrjp/what_the_hell_am_i_doing_wrong/,"Hi guys, I need help with men - clearly I am clueless.  Time and time again, I find myself falling into some sort of trap and end up getting hurt.  Please read without judgment.  Though, I probably deserve it! 

Just some background info am a 23 year-old female, full-time college student, and I also have two jobs (one at a retail clothing store, the other a paid internship in my field of study).  I have been told many times that I am attractive and have a ""great body,"" so that isn't what I am concerned about.  I have had 3 official boyfriends, each relationship only lasted about 8 months.  In my life, I have only gone on dates with 5 different guys, so I don't feel like I have that much experience.  Those dates never developed into anything because I realized I wasn't all that into the guy.  However, my dilemma is that whenever I find a guy I really like, I fall hard.  And fast.  This has happened twice, and I never ended up getting what I wanted (which was a relationship, I guess?).  Both times, the guy I like would stop talking to me out of the blue.  And I would send one text saying hey, and leave it at that (to avoid coming off as a crazy clinger).  And of course, would get no reply or contact from the guy thereafter.  I felt that I must have done *something* wrong, so I will provide an example for some possible insight:

2 months ago, I met a guy on Facebook.  He added me as a friend a year ago, and I never knew the guy, except that we had a few mutual friends and that we attend the same university.  I didn't think anything of it, until he IMed me out of the blue at the end of October saying that he thought I was a girl from one of his group projects, which definitely was not the case.  We had a decent conversation, and exchanged phone numbers.  He texted me immediately after, and we continued texting back and forth for about a week.  Now, during this time - I was very skeptical of this guy.  Our university is notorious for being a wild party school, with about 45k students - so I figured he was just some other douchebag.  And, we met on Facebook, which brought back memories of when weirdos would initiate contact on Myspace. 

After a week of texting, the guy asked several times if I wanted to hang out.  The first time, he was at the bars downtown with friends.  I had to work in the morning, so I had no interest in going out; plus, I didn't want to meet him when he was rip-roaring drunk (which he had to have been, based on what he was texting me).  A few days later is when shit when down.  It was 8 pm, and I had about 3 beers and was just chilling at my apartment.  He asked if I wanted to hang out with him and his friends.  I, sort of buzzed, agreed.  I told him I couldn't drive, so he offered to pick me up.  [Just a sidenote: I am aware of how potentially sketchy this could have been.  My bad.]  When he picked me up, he got out of his car and gave me a hug and said it was nice to meet me.  We then went to the liquor store, and then back to his house where his friends were hanging out.  I offered to pay for some items, but he wouldn't let me. When we got back to his house, the guy introduced me to all of his friends, who were very friendly.  The dude also offered me beer, and was getting drinks for everyone.  After a few drinks there, we went to his other friend's house to drink before the bars.  Now, I was pretty hammered at this point...and this was BEFORE the bars.  I am completely aware that I should not have drank that much, and yes I completely regret it.  Needless to say, at the bars, I blacked out.  With this dude I just met (stupid, very stupid, I know).  THANKFULLY, I woke up safely in my bed.  Obviously when I woke up, I wondered how the hell I even got there....so I checked my phone to talk to the guy.  He sent me a text saying ""It was really nice meeting you!"" and was very nice after that.  I figured he would have been wayyy turned off by my drunkenness, but apparently that was not the case.  A few days later I found out what happened at the bars, and at my apartment afterwards, and just laughed.  The story was actually pretty hilarious - let's just say I was a huuuge mess.  

Surprisingly, the dude still texted me and mentioned wanting to hang out again, and we did several more times.  Each time was with his friends though - we were never alone one on one, except once.  He stopped by my place before he went to work for about an hour, then kissed me on the lips on his way out.  Whenever I was with his friends though, he treated me super nicely, and would kiss me in front of them.  He would treat his friends who were girls like other guys, but wasn't that way with me.  After seeing him more, I fell for him, which was stupid.  He said super nice things to me, how attractive and cool I was, blah blah, and I believed it.  In the back of my mind though, I wonder if I was getting played.  The reason I thought this was because of his Facebook profile and phone; he was friends with tonsss of girls and would talk about hanging out with them, etc.  Which doesn't really mean anything, but it just made me think that I was just another girl in his life, not different from anyone else.  Anyway, I told the guy I liked him after hanging out with him a few times.  Which I guess was stupid.  But he did tell me he liked me too, apparently ""a lot.""  I also mentioned at one of the times that I don't really trust guys, and I was confused about his intentions.  I legitimately was, though - was it stupid to ask him?  I wanted to know if he liked me, but he never really made an attempt to turn it into anything else.  After awhile, he stopped contacting me, and at first he used to text all of the time.  I kept texting/contact to a minimum, as not to freak him out.  And then it turned into just me being the one to contact him, so I stopped.  And that's when our weird fling ended, and I was left heartbroken.  I haven't been able to get this guy out of my head, even though we haven't talked in about a month.  I had so much fun whenever I hung out with him, and his friends were really nice.  I just don't get it.  Do you guys have any idea what I did wrong?  Or what the guy's intentions were?  I've never been played before, but I feel like this might have been my first time.  Thank you!

EDIT:  I want to thank ALL of you for your help, telling me how it is, and allowing me to gain confidence in this sort of situation.  I did end up texting the dude, after not being in contact with him for a month, and it turned out well.  I ended up hanging out with him and his friends at his house on NYE (last night), and we ended up sharing a NYE kiss.  Not that it means anything, but we'll see where this goes!  I'm just thankful for everyone who provided insight and gave me the advice to just suck it up and go for it.  Thank you reddit!"

Scared",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/15menf/rant_first_panic_attack_ive_had_in_months_and/,"Long story short, I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD in August.I'm 21[F] years old. Started taking Prozac and seeing my psychiatrist weekly. My life GREATLY improved. I aced my internship, graduated from undergrad, recently got a new job and improved my relationships. Yesterday was the first day of my new job, and when I got home I was fine. I was supposed to hang out with my friends last night but I was feeling tired and not up to it. As the night went on, I got more depressed and anxious. Old feelings and sensations were coming back and I freaked out. My psychiatrist prescribed Xanax for me back in August and though I had never taken it, I decided that it was a good time to try. I took half a pill and after about half an hour I finally started to feel sleepy. I woke up at about 4 out of restless sleep. My mouth was dry and I was thirsty but I felt all right. A few minutes passed, and I tried to go back to sleep. Suddenly, I stuck my tongue out and thought that my tongue was too big for my mouth. I remembered reading that one of the side effects of Xanax could be swollen tongue so I immediately thought I was going to die. My heart began to race and I felt cold all over. I ran upstairs to my parents room and screamed that they had to take me to the hospital because my tongue was swelling. 

Reddit, it was awful.The looks on my parent's faces were painful. They thought I was making great progress and then I suddenly have this episode. It took me about an hour to come down from it, and for my parents to convince me that my tongue was fine and that I wasn't going to die. 

My mom was very supportive afterwards and we had a conversation about what triggered the attack but I still feel scared. Like my mind is out to get me. 

Any words of wisdom? Similar stories?

15mdtn,2,2012-12-29,Im leaving my job to work part time due to anxiety. Am I making the right choice?,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/15mdtn/im_leaving_my_job_to_work_part_time_due_to/,"I'm 24. I've had several jobs. Kitchen Porter, Bar Porter, Warehouse, Production assistant, Shelf stocker. Yet every job I've left after 4 weeks due to anxiety. (Except for kitchen porter, I worked there for 3 months).

Something happens after 4 months. I start to panic. It gets to the point where I have to give myself 10mins before I can walk in the door to work each morning.  I worked the kitchen job for 3 months but it never got easier. I went in every day feeling terrified. After lunch I would calm down usually but I never got used to the fear.

On my last day of my bar job I went to hang my jacket in the cloack room and then I froze at the door back out to the bar . I  almost had a full panic attack when I realized I was about to spend the next 12 hours behind the bar. I couldn't run. 

I realized recently though that the anxiety is lessened hugely with shorter work hours. At my bar job my favorite days were the occasional half days where I worked only 6 hours. I was able to get through those because I knew 6 hours wasn't too long. I could remind myself that I got up at 7.30 and by the time I began work at 9 t an hour and a half had passed and that time just flew by so it wouldn't be long making it to 6pm.

My current job is quite good.  Im a photo journalist. I spend the weekends covering events and 3 days in the office from 9 to 6. I was very happy when I got the job but its been 4 weeks and my anxiety has returned. I feel suffocated and no longer enjoy the job. I only look forward to when I can go home. I've decided to quit as soon as I find a part time job. I don't care what I do just as long as the hours are short maybe 2 or 3 days a week. 

It's a big step for me though. I'm going back and forth between feeling excited that I've identified a way of dealing with my problem and feeling that im making a huge mistake. I could use some advice. I'd like to hear from anyone else who only works a few hours in the week. I worry I will feel depressed about leaving a good job to a minimum wage job as a cashier or receptionist etc.

EDIT Jan 7th/2013, 9 days after post -   I quit today. I'm freaking out a little, quite a bit actually.  I was so sure when I did it and now I keep going back over it again and again. I hated how much time a 5 day week job demands of you. I felt trapped. Maybe I should have at least stuck it out for 5 more months and finished my internship. But I thought I saw the answer to my problem so why wait?. I don't know. Am I crazy?  Theres still time to change my mind but do I want to? Have I made  a huge mistake?

I have been deeply involved with computers all my life and have done things such as build and design websites to working over the summer at my school in the IT department as an intern. Around February I started looking into stocks, mostly Cisco, which while researching I heard about a company called Uiquiti Networks. Within the last years I have decided I wanted to become a Network Engineer. I mostly finalized this decision when I began working at my school this summer and got to talk to our Network Engineer and our Head of Technology. I also became vastly interested in radio communications, to which I have furthered my knowledge by inquiring information on and about the operation and configuration of such devices. Uiquiti has an amazing product line, which I have spent countless hours researching their devices and how to operate them. 
	So this leads me to why I’m here, I have read up a lot on the installation and operation of WISP’s. I find them to be quite inquisitive. At first I was pretty sure there was no way a young adult like myself could ever create or even for that matter maintain such a network. I then read about a company call Horizon Tel which received grant money to run 10 Gbit/s fiber lines though my state of Ohio. I was even more shocked to see that they had ran a line right through my county, which just so happens to run like 100 feet from my neighborhood. I then proceeded to email them and got a quick response, which basically said they would be more than happy to run said fiber to a location of my choosing. This location is across the street from the fiber line and is currently being developed, which means I could buy the land. I know the owners and I know if I paid a descent price they would allow me to buy it, as it is zoned for commercial use.  
	Also I might add that .78 miles down the road from said lot is a POP (point of presence), which I’m sure many of you know what that is. I might also note this was just installed this June and I believe it to be in operation at this time. This location would then allow me to connect without the worry of being restricted on what I use the line for, and yes I know that the price for the line increases greatly at these sites. Every pole from the POP to the lot is ran by our local power company and fiber could be attached if Horizon Tel is unwilling to allow us to resell their internet from their line. I might also note that Horizon is far from their comfort zone as they do not offer residential internet anywhere around here. I might note there is a five county distance from where they do offer said services. The only provider that offers speeds over 7 Mbit/s is Time Warner in our County. 
	I have done my research and understand towers are expensive and understand the cost, but I’m hoping that I can lease space off the local water tower (if that is possible), also I might note this property is adjacent to said water tower. I would be willing to provide free internet to County and City offices at no charge if said water towers could be utilized. I also am pretty sure that I would get the airMAX Titanium Sector antennas and set them at 60 degree increments. Which would put me at getting 6, and seeing how each is said to get around 100 clients, it would be a great starting setup. There are easily 2,000 homes within a 5 mile radius and the water tower and site sit on a hill which would provide great coverage and direct line of site of the potential customers. I would most likely use the Rocket M5 as my base station and my clients would consist of NanoBridge M2’s, AriGird M2’s, and NanoStations M2’s. Note: There is a great wiki on the Ubiquiti forms on how to setup and maintain a WISP. 
	Brand new power lines were installed this summer around the water tower to allow future growth so power will not be an issue. I believe I have a decent billing software in mind but any help would be greatly appreciated. As I am smart but not nearly as smart as those who already hold degrees, I would love any help you could send my way. Please be completely honestly and straight forward with me, as I have taken sometime to type this out I hope you see I’m sincere and would really appreciate any help you could offer.

15m77j,5,2012-12-29,This Post Is Horribly Appropriate For This Subreddit (TW for abuse),Ooniversidad,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/15m77j/this_post_is_horribly_appropriate_for_this/,"I don't know why I'm thinking of this now, but I am.

Last summer, I took a paying internship at the department of transportation that my dad works at, and has since I was born. The first two months were great, I got paid a hell of a lot of money for working long hours. Then, I was transferred to survey work. My dad had warned me the guys working survey were one complaint away from being fired, that they were creepy with female interns all the time. There are two survey guys, one worse than the other, I got the lesser of two evils.

He had a habit of grabbing stuff off of the other intern, who was a girl. If she had a measuring stick folded in her back pocket, he would take it from her rather than ask for it. He grabbed a radio off my vest a few times, and the radio had always migrated to the V portion of the vest, right in between my tits. I wasn't comfortable with him and I never respected him because he was absolutely unprofessional in every way. He also made me stay in his office with him, alone, for 30 minutes after I got off the clock while he talked about camping in Nevada. 30 minutes, in his office, alone.

I've been sexually abused by older men before, so I think my discomfort with him is heightened by that. A grandfather molested me, several old teachers were inappropriate to me. It's gotten to the point that I couldn't see a psychiatrist because he was an old man, even though when I separated him from his practice, he was a very good psychiatrist. And I feel horrible for being unable to deal with a part of the population solely based on my past experiences.

I don't know what to do next summer. The pay is so good the first two months, and I won't be able to pay for college if I don't work there during the summer. I don't know if I should talk to someone in Human Resources when I reapply and ask to not work survey, because then they'll ask why I didn't bring it up when I actually worked there last summer, which is insanely like when I talked to my therapist about the grandfather.

And if I tell my dad to ask what I should do then he'll feel bad that I feel victimized again, and he didn't protect me.

I really want to stop feeling victimized. I want to stop having nightmares and flashbacks. I want to be able to masturbate without having to stop because I flashback. I want to stop feeling the need to get body modifications just to repossess my body from old men who have taken my body like it's theirs.

I don't know. This is the weirdest rant I've ever composed at 1 AM.

I just got back from Walmart and saw a man that looked like my grandfather. I couldn't even double-take to check if it was him because I was so scared that it would be him.

I just want to be safe somewhere but I'm not. I never am because I am always unsafe.

I really just want to get high or drunk or something and forget all of this but I can't because I don't have any connections to people who can buy me shit because I have no friends."

I mostly finalized this decision when I began working at my school this summer and got to talk to our Network Engineer and our Head of Technology. I also became vastly interested in radio communications, to which I have furthered my knowledge by inquiring information on and about the operation and configuration of such devices. Uiquiti has an amazing product line, which I have spent countless hours researching their devices and how to operate them. 
	So this leads me to why I’m here, I have read up a lot on the installation and operation of WISP’s. I find them to be quite inquisitive. At first I was pretty sure there was no way a young adult like myself could ever create or even for that matter maintain such a network. I then read about a company call Horizon Tel which received grant money to run 10 Gbit/s fiber lines though my state of Ohio. I was even more shocked to see that they had ran a line right through my county, which just so happens to run like 100 feet from my neighborhood. I then proceeded to email them and got a quick response, which basically said they would be more than happy to run said fiber to a location of my choosing. This location is across the street from the fiber line and is currently being developed, which means I could buy the land. I know the owners and I know if I paid a descent price they would allow me to buy it, as it is zoned for commercial use.  
	Also I might add that .78 miles down the road from said lot is a POP (point of presence), which I’m sure many of you know what that is. I might also note this was just installed this June and I believe it to be in operation at this time. This location would then allow me to connect without the worry of being restricted on what I use the line for, and yes I know that the price for the line increases greatly at these sites. Every pole from the POP to the lot is ran by our local power company and fiber could be attached if Horizon Tel is unwilling to allow us to resell their internet from their line. I might also note that Horizon is far from their comfort zone as they do not offer residential internet anywhere around here. I might note there is a five county distance from where they do offer said services. The only provider that offers speeds over 7 Mbit/s is Time Warner in our County. 
	I have done my research and understand towers are expensive and understand the cost, but I’m hoping that I can lease space off the local water tower (if that is possible), also I might note this property is adjacent to said water tower. I would be willing to provide free internet to County and City offices at no charge if said water towers could be utilized. I also am pretty sure that I would get the airMAX Titanium Sector antennas and set them at 60 degree increments. Which would put me at getting 6, and seeing how each is said to get around 100 clients, it would be a great starting setup. There are easily 2,000 homes within a 5 mile radius and the water tower and site sit on a hill which would provide great coverage and direct line of site of the potential customers. I would most likely use the Rocket M5 as my base station and my clients would consist of NanoBridge M2’s, AriGird M2’s, and NanoStations M2’s. Note: There is a great wiki on the Ubiquiti forms on how to setup and maintain a WISP. 
	Brand new power lines were installed this summer around the water tower to allow future growth so power will not be an issue. I believe I have a decent billing software in mind but any help would be greatly appreciated. As I am smart but not nearly as smart as those who already hold degrees, I would love any help you could send my way. Please be completely honestly and straight forward with me, as I have taken sometime to type this out I hope you see I’m sincere and would really appreciate any help you could offer. 
Greatest Regards, Jason :)
Edit: I type this on Microsoft Word and it was all nicely formatted and such which I pasted it into reddit is got all messed up I am truly sorry :(

15m4ui,8,2012-12-29,Some insight into my boyfriend's behavior would be appreciated. ,[deleted],AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/15m4ui/some_insight_into_my_boyfriends_behavior_would_be/,"My boyfriend (20) has this weird habit of telling his friends stuff about me (21) that isn't true and makes up fake problems about our relationship. Some examples of the ways he does it:  

* Acts like I nag him all the time - One time, he asked me if I thought he should apply for a certain internship. I said sure, why not? A few weeks later the deadline came up and he had to do all the work for it that night. I hadn't talked to him about it since out initial conversation, but his friend called to hang out and he said he couldn't hang out because he ""had to do something for castletalkyo that she's been bothering me about."" 

* Tells people that I don't let him go out - One time he and his friend stopped by my place on the way to pick up food and invited me to come along, and I said that I had just eaten and I was doing homework anyway. So he said to his friend, ""Okay, well I'll see you later, man."" To which I replied, ""No, dude, you should go eat. I'm just doing homework, go to [place] and then we can hang out after."" And he turned to his friend and explained that he ""couldn't"" go get food and that he was really sorry. He does this the most.   

* Claims that I don't ever have sex with him/withhold sex - He also likes to make jokes a lot about how I withhold sex from him. Aside from the one time when he tried to initiate sex WHILE I WAS ASLEEP without waking me up, I have never turned down sex with him because I'm almost always the one initiating in the first place, and we tend to have sex at least once per day anyway. And I've never not had sex with him on the basis that I was angry with him because I don't believe in withholding sex as punishment. The other night we were hanging out with a bunch of friends and he said something, I don't even remember what it was, but he turned to his friend and said, ""Oh, now I'm in trouble...guess I'm not getting any tonight."" From what I can remember, whatever he said was something neutral because I didn't think twice about it. And I can't even think of a time when he's said something in a social setting that I've gotten angry with him about. But I always overhear him mumbling to his friends stuff like this, and I tend to be completely oblivious to what is supposedly making me angry. The thing is, I'm definitely not the type who deals with problems with anger. Tears, yes, but never anger. But he makes me out to be this raging bitch. 

* And one last example - We tend to make schedules for the day so that we have time to get everything done that we need to get done, we always work to stick with them and we're pretty good about it. Then, a couple of days ago, he posted a meme from here on my facebook wall about how females (meaning me) always fuck up his schedule and don't let him get anything done.

What is going on? I don't even want to think about what he says about me when I'm not around. The thing is, if I ask him about it after he assures me that everything is fine and I don't have anything to be confused about. Which then makes me double-confused. This isn't really upsetting me and it doesn't even make me mad, it's just kind of baffling and all I can do is laugh when he does it. That, and the fact that most of the time when we're hanging out with his friends, we smoke weed and I'm pretty much incapable of anger. 

**tl;dr: Boyfriend makes me out to be a crazy, controlling bitch who deprives him of sex and doesn't let him go out to his friends, acts like everything is perfect otherwise. ** 

EDIT: I didn't even realize that is was really a problem until now...man oh man. Of course the solution is the obvious, ""Ask him why he acts this way.""  "

So I've always had problems with my mother to an extent but they are really affecting my life lately. We're from a really small town with a lot of backward people. We've disagreed about a lot of things over the years ranging from religion (she's a staunch Catholic and I'm agnostic), to friendship and now she's attempting to inhibit me from living my life. 

I no longer live at home most of the time, I go to a top university and have a house there but I still come home to visit for the holidays and rely on my parents to help me cover the costs of college. Recently I have been getting interviews with companies for internships all over the country and many of them require onsite interviews. My mother is being extremely difficult about letting me go to these interviews. She doesn't see why I need to go up to NYC or fly out to Cali. She bitches when I say I'm going and says she doesn't see the purpose. Says that I'm not allowed to go on my own. I'm not allowed to go to my *interviews* so I can be successful one day. She says that my friends should go with me and because they won't (since the company isn't paying for them and it costs a lot) that they aren't my friends and that I have no friends. She has constantly told me I have no friends because they won't bend backwards to do the ridiculous things my mother expects of them. 

I am at ends right now and hate coming home for the holidays or informing my mom about the positive things that happen in my life because all she does is bitches about everything. I'm not allowed to live my own life even though I'm 21. What can I do about this situation? I fully plan on going to my interviews anyway even if I have to lie about it but I just think it's ridiculous.  "

15op5e,0,2012-12-30,Car recommendation? My 2008 Sentra can't handle a dry desert with minor exposure to off-road conditions... (crosspost from r/autos),clothsocks,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/15op5e/car_recommendation_my_2008_sentra_cant_handle_a/,"Hello! I was wondering if anyone can offer any car/car type recommendations based upon the following story/criteria.

This past summer, I completed an internship at a mine in Arizona, and used my 2008 Nissan Sentra (2WD) to travel over (very) poorly paved roads to get to the mine. They use a mixture of tree-sap and who knows what else to bind the roads, so the roads are poorly consolidated, and sometimes this 'tar' gets onto your undercarriage. Yuck. In addition to this, the dust at the mine and in the mining town clogged up my air filter pretty well. So, we are looking at wear on the entire car, most notably the tires, suspension, air filter, and undercarriage.

They offered me a job, so I'll be going back there for work, which means I'd like to say goodbye to my Sentra before I run it into the ground driving to/from the mine. Simply not rugged enough.

Storage is important, and it takes a while to drive to 'civilization' from the mining town where I would live (1.5 to 2 hr on highway), so gas-mileage is important as well. If you could recommend to me a car/car type that is rugged, has storage, and won't kill on gas, I would be very pleased. I really do not know where to start when trying to find a car that fits these criteria. Are there any decent sites you would recommend that would help me out?

Also, if this is the wrong subreddit to post this to, please let me know. This is my first post in r/cars.

Thank you so much-- anything would be a great help.

Edit: I should add that I am looking to buy used rather than new, and can spend up to $15k, though I wouldn't necessarily like to go that high."

15oi9f,12,2012-12-30,"My personal epiphany regarding whether I should ever have that ""coming out"" moment.",Jeezimus,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/15oi9f/my_personal_epiphany_regarding_whether_i_should/,"This is something that I personally arrived at, but I figured I would share my own internal thought processes in case it could help someone else.  I think each of these situations is unique to its own circumstances, so I certainly don't want to say this is the ""best"" way of thinking for everyone, but I feel like it was for me.

My personal history: I was raised in a southern baptist home from birth and attended church three times a week (sunday morning/night and Wed night youth etc) in addition to performing in the church choir/band and dramas/musicals, etc.  The Bible was infallible truth and God was everywhere and omnipotent.  My parents were and still are exceptionally devoted to their faith and lifestyle.  I to this day have never seen them once so much as take a sip of alcohol.  Religion was discussed regularly, as was the sinful nature of ""The World.""  Heaven and Hell were very REAL places, and consequences were eternal.  My parents believed in justice over mercy, voted a strong evangelical republican, and blamed the gays for everything.

My change: When I was young (12-13?) the computer was put in my room and I began to ""struggle"" with porn.  In high school, I began to smoke cigarettes and drink when I could (never because of my strict parents), but my ""faith"" was still strong.  At 18 I began to smoke weed and moved out to the dorms to go to college.  I struggled to rationalize my faith with my lifestyle, especially with my desire to have sex with girls (I had lost my virginity at 15, but sex was a rarity).  I never attended church regularly, and went back and forth for a couple years in my beliefs.  I joined a christian fraternity for a semester, but continued my ""worldly"" lifestyle.  At 19 I failed out of my current university and had to transfer schools (I was a typical sheltered kid who went ape-shit in the real world and had to get my act together)

At my new school I found success.  I got good grades, met incredible friends, and eventually met my current girlfriend (I'm about to turn 25).  My success allowed me to be more comfortable in my lifestyle (I still smoked weed and drank, but had enough exposure and control to know how to do things in moderation) and thus I was comfortable with not going to church or practicing christianity other than when I was at home with my parents.  However, even at this point I still held on to my faith internally.  I struggled with how I would raise my children.  I often spoke to my room mates about this (diverse backgrounds) and referenced pascals riddle as my justification.  I was scared of hell to be frank.

Fastforward a couple years.  I'm now 22 and had just graduated with a BA in Accounting, completed a successful internship in NYC for a large accounting firm, and received a job offer.  They were giving me time to go back and get my masters, and I had a bunch of money in the bank, so I went to hang out with my gf in Australia for a couple months backpacking (if you haven't traveled because you're american and we just don't do that, YOU SHOULD DO IT).  One of our adventures there had us staying at this nice man and his wife's house (read: beautiful mansion with a waterfall in the middle of the property).  He was extremely intelligent and well-read on American politics, history, and religion.  He was also an adamant secular humanist.  His name was Richard.  He was frank from the moment we first got in the car with him at the airport: he believed religion was rubbish.

Richard and I had delightful long talks about the world and finance and politics.  We also had long talks about religion where he pushed me like no other person would.  He was that annoying atheist who didn't respect my beliefs, but called them for what they were: bullshit.  He pleaded with me to, if nothing else, not indoctrinate my children.  It was then that I realized I no longer believed.

It took about 6 months to become comfortable with the fact that I was essentially an atheist, albeit not militant.  My mindset is that there very well may be a higher power than us that even played a role in our creation or ordering of the universe, but at the present time we have no evidence to support this.  Even more, I realized that Christianity was a man-made thing riddled with historical strife and conflict, and that the Bible was certainly no infallible holy text written by God himself.

What began to trouble me from 22 to now was my relationship with my parents.  I still feel as if my parents do not really ""know"" me.  I keep this entirely secret, though I never lie about it.  It's basically a don't ask don't tell kind of situation.  The most painful thing we've gone through is when I had to openly tell my parents I had decided to live with my gf when we both moved for my job.  My parents obviously believe this is sinful, and I was verbally assaulted for about 30 minutes, but I allowed them their time and kept quiet.  They're actually relatively chill about it now, but my sisters tell me they still talk about it rather judgmentally at the dinner table.

For a long time, I thought there would be a moment where I would come out to them.  Some supreme moment of clarity that would expose me as I am to them and they could either accept or reject me, but I would out and free and clear of any burden of Christian belief.  However, I have since realized that, at least for me, making that moment happen would be entirely selfish and egotistical.

I recently spent a few days on an island camping, and I realized how much it was my own ego desiring that moment, and that it would only be extremely devastating and hurtful to my parents.  Why did I feel such a need to rub it in their faces that I did not believe in what they believe to be divine universal truth?  The only answer I could come up with was to satisfy myself.

I'm not willing to make that kind of selfish decision, especially when my parents are being relatively respectful of my own life.  It's not beneath me to attend services with them and bow my head in respect during prayer when I visit them.  They granted me life and all the resources in the world.  I love them.  I made MY choice in life, and I will be the one to live with it.

TL;DR: Realized coming out to my parents would be selfish.

I am graduating in may from a CIDA-accredited university, and am looking to HOPEFULLY get hired at an interior design or architecture firm in Seattle, SanFrancisco, or Denver when I graduate in May.  Do you have any suggestions on how to go about doing this?

I currently have an electronic PDF of my portfolio, as well as a physical copy.  I also own a web domain, and am planning on putting my work on my personal web site.  Is this a good idea?

I am very proficient in Revit, CAD, Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, and have used Rhino 4.0 and 3ds Max on several projects.  

With that said, do you think I have a good chance at landing a position?  I want more than anything to end up in one of those 3 cities.  When do you think the best time to contact firms would be?  I hope to have a position lined up by June.  Thank you for reading; your help is greatly appreciated!"

15qndw,1,2012-12-31,Some progress in 2012 from a long-time lurker. (M-20),rosten,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15qndw/some_progress_in_2012_from_a_longtime_lurker_m20/,"Hi, all. As I've stated in the title I've seldom, if ever, posted in r/fitness. However I have been lurking, collecting advice, and staying motivated from constantly reading posts here this year. At the beginning of 2012 I was generally un-athletic, the heaviest (158 at 5'4"") I'd ever been, with almost no muscle strength to show. I started lifting at the suggestion of a friend, which eventually became supplemented with long-distance running.


I am now, exactly one year later, 137 pounds. My bench max (1 rep) went from barely 95 lbs to 185 lbs as of yesterday. Here is my album of progress photos, each pic taken about 8 weeks apart (not technically NSFW but there are some low waistlines, haha): http://imgur.com/a/PFbZc#0


I originally started by following the [Kris Gethin 12-Week Daily Trainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer.html) at the advice of my best friend, who is a bit of a bodybuilder and said he got his start with it. The program plans out exercise, diet and supplementation. For the first three months I followed this thing to the tiniest detail--egg whites in the microwave for breakfast level of strictness. Bought every supplement recommended: pre, BCAAs, multi, glutamine, l-carnitine, yohimbe in addition to whey protein. Stayed true to every exercise for each day and with 25 minutes cardio twice a day.


In the springtime I began to get less strict with the diet, and increased cardio by running longer and longer distances. As far as lifting goes, I continued a Gethin-style set of workouts with at least one day a week devoted each to chest/back; arms/shoulders; legs. I continued this lifting style for the rest of the year, but began to concentrate heavier on running. I hadn't realized I liked it so much. When at first I couldn't run more than two or three miles at once, I eventually ran a ten-mile race and a half-marathon in my city in the summer.


I continued lifting and steady cardio into the summer, when I could (working around a full time internship). The same pattern followed into the next semester. My diet at this point generally included a bowl of Special K for breakfast and a protein bar after lifting early in the morning, then a protein-heavy meal both for lunch and dinner with moderate amounts of carbs/fats. The supplements eventually ran out around June...and I didn't repurchase any (except the multi). I am not particularly for or against a supplement-heavy workout regiment (whereas my best friend who started me with all this is very much for one), but I found I was good without them.


Long story short, I learned that discipline is the most important quality to have in all this. School and work were my first priority this year, but getting fit is definitely possible with other priorities. I aimed for slow, steady growth. With distance running, this is definitely true. The key is **the more you do, the more you can do.** If you can run five miles at once enough times, eventually you can run six, and eventually thirteen. This is also true for lifting, although my growth here was slower than it could have been if I were doing a dedicated ""bulk"".


Basically, if I can gain this much strength and lose this much weight in a year, anybody can. Plenty of people on here and on r/loseit have had transformations muuuuch more inspiring than my own, that have served to motivate me throughout the year. So if I can add anything to the conversation on here, I'd like to say that willpower and discipline are most important factors in my fitness success so far. Aim for steady growth (even if it's slow). Don't stop working and don't cut corners. Make adjustments to your routine as you see fit, but make them out of preference and not laziness. **Maintain the same amount of rigor, or go further.**


For now I will continue to run (I'm studying abroad next semester at a small university with no gym :( ). I'd like to thank everyone on here for their own stories over the course of my lurking career. I feel the healthiest I ever have. I'm a lot more confident than I used to be. This year I met my awesome girlfriend, landed a great summer internship and increased my GPA. My increased confidence and overall health I feel are the biggest reasons for this :). So to anyone trying to become more fit in the new year--good luck and stay disciplined! It is really is worth it."

Anyway, the holidays have been a drag, so I've been drinking a lot.  Then I realized, ""you know what, just quit once and for all.""

My biggest issue will be being around drunk people, 'cos I will feel the need to ""get on their level"" in order to stand them.  Luckily, I have a new job and it doesn't allow for much going out and stuff.  The weekends will be spent working on an internship, so I think I'll be pretty much good to go.

15pu3a,9,2012-12-31,"Write Congress WEEKLY - Take the pledge today to preserve our gun rights (this is very long, there are two seperate td-dr's, I apologize in advance).  TAKE ACTION TODAY!!!",what-the-frack,Firearms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/15pu3a/write_congress_weekly_take_the_pledge_today_to/,"I’m soliciting the pro-firearms communities of Reddit to make a pledge that they will communicate their displeasure *WEEKLY* about the anticipated gun control bills, AWBs, 10 round magazine bills, etc. that we’ve heard rumor about since the tragedy at the horrible shooting in CT that the anti-2nd Amendment media and anti-gun lawmakers have decided to use as an excuse to take freedoms away from law abiding Americans.

**Please respond with your support for this pledge,** and once you start hearing from your lawmakers, **report back the responses that you get!**  The media has instant access to the American public, and an unfair advantage in this fight, but if we band together *we* can win this fight.  You can’t assume the NRA or anyone else is going to do this for you.  **YOU** have to fight.  Take this **WEEKLY** pledge, and spread the word today!

If you’re opposed to all the anticipated gun control legislation we keep hearing about, you need to get in touch with your legislators soon and often! To be effective you have to get in touch with all 3 of them: a single Congress Person **AND** your two Senators. First you need to find out who your 3 legislators are, and then how to get in touch with **EACH** of them.

* House (http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)

* Senate (http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) Remember to write both of them!

**To be effective there is a 2 step process you need to repeat *WEEKLY* – remember, you’re taking a pledge to do this *WEEKLY*:**

1.	Call all 3 legislators you find above (you can note the phone number for each legislator and call it directly, or you can call Congressional Switchboard: (202)224-3121, and ask for each legislator separately – remember you’ll be making 3 phone calls).  You’ll want to follow a script that you’ve prepared, and you’ll use the same script for all 3 legislators, but I’ll have more on that in a bit!
 
2.	Email all 3 legislators you find above (emailing your legislators is weird.  You can’t just put their address in your email client in the TO field, and send something off to them.  You have to go to their website, and complete a web form that has lots of contact information about you.  I think this is to reduce spam going to each legislator. That page can be found above.  Bookmark each of them because you’re going to be doing this **WEEKLY**!

**For a *very* small bonus you can:**

3.	Snail mail your letter (just a printed copy of your email). If you really want to mail something through the USPS, please email that letter first. For maximum effect, call, email and snail mail, and do it at least *WEEKLY*!  Contrary to a lot of the misinformation doled out by some of the “ole timers” on the Internet, this alone is far from the most effective means of communicating with your legislator, and here’s why: All letter to Congress that come through the USPS have to go through a “mail security” that puts a severe delay on mailed communication! Before the anthrax scare, mailing a paper copy of a letter was the most effective way to get in touch with a legislator because they assumed a real person to the time to sit down and write it out and mail it, but it simply isn't the case now.  Even though some of the older legislators (let's be honest, all of them) may not understand the Internet - they have interns &amp; aides who do, and legislators do pay attention to the reports their interns and legislative aides hand them, if they really care what their district has to say about a certain issue. If we all wrote snail mail letters today, legislators would not see any of them for 4-6 weeks.  If we get a lot of people writing in and the volume overwhelms the mailroom – AKA ""mail security"", it could start taking longer, like 8-10+ weeks.   

**For super bonus you can:**

4. 	Schedule a visit with your legislators in DC or at regional offices in their districts.  This is a huge bonus, because the legislator or their aide knows that this is a very important issue for you because you: took the time to schedule an appointment, traveled to the district office or DC, got dressed up, prepared what you had to say, and showed up to discuss it.  Hopefully, you get even more bonus points for intelligently discussing the issue. If you’re planning to do this it would also be a great time to deliver any petitions or hand written letters for the cause directly to the office.  You’ll only have about 15 minutes if you plan to do this, so make sure you have a script that you’ve rehearsed, and you’re ready to go.  Taking some like minded friends with you can also help make you less nervous, and it will give a slightly different POV about the topic from each of you to the aide.  If you do this, please report back here so anyone else who is thinking about doing this can learn from your experience.

Bottom line: we need to get emails, phone calls, snail mail, and personal visits into the legislators ASAP. 

**What to write or say in a call:**
Be concise, be direct, and be polite. Flowery language, and excessive length will only bore the intern or legislative aide that gets stuck reading what you wrote.  Ideally, if you could have the person reading your email completely get your point in under 30 seconds you’ve wrote a winning letter.

/u/lessfoxlikethansome shared his email in a Reddit submission, and I saw it in another thread I was commenting on earlier this morning. It perfectly matched what I would call the “ideal” email to Congress:

&gt;I am a member of the United States Air Force.
&gt;I am a responsible gun owning citizen.
&gt;I am a registered voter.
&gt;I am opposed to any AWB or other new gun control.
&gt;Please vote against any new legislation that will restrict the rights of our citizens.

This would not only work perfectly as an email, it would be the perfect script for a phone call.  He establishes immediately that he has served our country, owns guns, and can vote for or against his legislator in the future.  You may not be able to say all those things, but give information about you. Then he states his position on the anticipate AWB-2 and limiting rights of citizens.  State your point as concisely as possible.  If it’s longer than this, no problem.  If it’s more than 2 paragraphs or the whole thing is more than 1 page double spaced 14 point font, you’ve said way too much!  Revise it down a bit!  If you want to write about another issue, do that in a separate email.  Limit each email and call to a single issue so whoever talks to you or reads your email will know exactly why you’re calling or writing. 

The only other thing I can tell you is that if a certain bill that you oppose, does see the light of day, you need to mention that bill specifically, and direct your legislator to vote against it!  I’m sure we’ll be posting here if they get a bill opposing gun rights out of committee.  

Remember to write short, quick, concise, letters (unlike this post).  The whole point of this is to “lobby” (for lack of a better term since that word has so many dirty connotation to it now) your elected representatives so your voice can be heard.  If a legislator hears a definitive cry from the home district, he or she should voice that opinion with a vote similar to the district’s opinion.  This means get your like-minded friends involved (getting involved is not just posting to Reddit or Facebook, but that’s where it starts).  This needs to be a grass-roots type, swarm of an effort.  If you’re going to the gun shop, print off some of my or other people’s posts telling people how to get involved, and share these with anyone and everyone.  Have real face-to-face conversations with folks you know or maybe only have seen at the range or gun shop before.  Gun owners are scared that they will be stripped of their right, and would love to know what to do to make a stand against potential gun grabbing freedom-hating scumbags!   We’re here to inform them!

Remember the legislators are supposed to listen to the will of the people.  You may have a legislator that will give you a standard “F-off” letter that sounds nice, but basically means your opinion has been registered and ignored.  Legislators like this that have their mind made up about an issue aren't going to care one way or another, but it's still important to register your opinion, and in 2-6 years, work to vote their ass out, if they don't take your opinion(s) into consideration (D. Feinstein and company, I’m talking to you!).  Even though a lot of people act like it is, this isn’t a Democrat vs. Republican issue.  There are pro-gun and anti-gun folks on both sides of the isle.  We must get in touch with all of them, and let them hear our voice!  Remember, you need to work hard to get your opinion about firearms out to your legislators (all 3 of them), but you should be writing them about all sorts of issues throughout their term of office as well.  Guns are only one of many freedoms we enjoy!  For whatever reason governments love to take freedoms away from law-abiding citizens, and if we don’t bitch about it they’ll do whatever they want.

If you write an email or letter, expect a reply back from your legislator.  It usually takes 2-6 weeks before I hear back, but it’s nice to know they’ve tallied your opinion in with everyone else from the district.  Interns or legislative aides typically write the letters, and they’re likely form letters for people who write in pro or con on a certain issue.  But some response is better than being ignored.   

**Remember, this is a *WEEKLY* campaign, and a *WEEKLY* pledge from you!!!  You need to at least call and write once a week.  If you can get 3-5 other people a week to make this same commitment then you’re going to get even more of a pro-firearms voice heard in DC!!!**




**super short tl-dr**: Calling and email are most effective, see links at the top of the post, and bullet points 1 &amp; 2.  If you want to do more, read the whole post!  Sorry this turned out to be so long; thanks for reading!




**longer tl-dr**: Take a pledge to contact all 3 of your legislators, **WEEKLY** about your concern that we will lose our 2nd Amendment rights.  See the *super short tl-dr* for location of important info in the main post. Emailing and phoning are the easiest, quickest and most effective ways to get in touch with someone in Congress.  If you want to write snail mail, please do, but ensure you’ve called and emailed about the issue first.  The most effective means of getting your voice heard is scheduling a visit, and sitting down with a legislative aide in the Capital or at a regional office (it's very rare that you get to personally talk to the legislator yourself, but it can happen - talking to the aide is just as effective, going as a small group to talk to the aide is even more effective, and you’ll be able to create dialogue amongst yourselves).  While there you can also hand deliver petitions or “snail mail” for folks and that gets counted immediately, because it doesn’t have to go through the “mail security.”

15pr72,1,2012-12-31,Some progress in 2012 from a long-time lurker. (M-20),[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/15pr72/some_progress_in_2012_from_a_longtime_lurker_m20/,"Hi, all. As I've stated in the title I've seldom, if ever, posted in r/fitness. However I have been lurking, collecting advice, and staying motivated from constantly reading posts here this year. At the beginning of 2012 I was generally un-athletic, the heaviest (158 at 5'4"") I'd ever been, with almost no muscle strength to show. I started lifting at the suggestion of a friend, which eventually became supplemented with long-distance running. 

I am now, exactly one year later, 137 pounds. My bench max (1 rep) went from barely 95 lbs to 185 lbs as of yesterday. Here is my album of progress photos, each pic taken about 8 weeks apart (not technically NSFW but there are some low waistlines, haha): http://imgur.com/a/PFbZc#0

I originally started by following the [Kris Gethin 12-Week Daily Trainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/kris-gethin-12-week-daily-trainer.html) at the advice of my best friend, who is a bit of a bodybuilder and said he got his start with it. The program plans out exercise, diet and supplementation. For the first three months I followed this thing to the tiniest detail--egg whites in the microwave for breakfast level of strictness. Bought every supplement recommended: pre, BCAAs, multi, glutamine, l-carnitine, yohimbe in addition to whey protein. Stayed true to every exercise for each day and with 25 minutes cardio twice a day.

In the springtime I began to get less strict with the diet, and increased cardio by running longer and longer distances. As far as lifting goes, I continued a Gethin-style set of workouts with at least one day a week devoted each to chest/back; arms/shoulders; legs. I continued this lifting style for the rest of the year, but began to concentrate heavier on running. I hadn't realized I liked it so much. When at first I couldn't run more than two or three miles at once, I eventually ran a ten-mile race and a half-marathon in my city in the summer. 

I continued lifting and steady cardio into the summer, when I could (working around a full time internship). The same pattern followed into the next semester. My diet at this point generally included a bowl of Special K for breakfast and a protein bar after lifting early in the morning, then a protein-heavy meal both for lunch and dinner with moderate amounts of carbs/fats. The supplements eventually ran out around June...and I didn't repurchase any (except the multi). I am not particularly for or against a supplement-heavy workout regiment (whereas my best friend who started me with all this is very much for one), but I found I was good without them.

Long story short, I learned that discipline is the most important quality to have in all this. School and work were my first priority this year, but getting fit is definitely possible with other priorities. I aimed for slow, steady growth. With distance running, this is definitely true. The key is **the more you do, the more you can do.** If you can run five miles at once enough times, eventually you can run six, and eventually thirteen. This is also true for lifting, although my growth here was slower than it could have been if I were doing a dedicated ""bulk"". 

Basically, if I can gain this much strength and lose this much weight in a year, anybody can. Plenty of people on here and on r/loseit have had transformations muuuuch more inspiring than my own, that have served to motivate me throughout the year. So if I can add anything to the conversation on here, I'd like to say that willpower and discipline are most important factors in my fitness success so far. Aim for steady growth (even if it's slow). Don't stop working and don't cut corners. Make adjustments to your routine as you see fit, but make them out of preference and not laziness. **Maintain the same amount of rigor, or go further.** 

For now I will continue to run (I'm studying abroad next semester at a small university with no gym :( ). I'd like to thank everyone on here for their own stories over the course of my lurking career. I feel the healthiest I ever have. I'm a lot more confident than I used to be. This year I met my awesome girlfriend, landed a great summer internship and increased my GPA. My increased confidence and overall health I feel are the biggest reasons for this :). So to anyone trying to become more fit in the new year--good luck and stay disciplined! It is really is worth it."
15pohh,1,2012-12-31,I feel like I have grown into a worse and lesser person (long rambling inside),DoFDcostheta,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/15pohh/i_feel_like_i_have_grown_into_a_worse_and_lesser/,"Over the course of the academic year starting in fall 2011 continuing up through right now, I have grown and changed very much. I will not start by denying that all this change has some positive effects, but I really genuinely feel like I am a more scared, anxious, neurotic, and weak person. I have run into that feeling upon general reflection on my life, but also in day-to-day scenarios and I am frustrated that I keep reinforcing the neural pathways that tell me this. 
 
If anyone cares, here is some background on what my life is and has been like: I am taking a gap year right now, where my plan was to 1.) live on my own for a while in the real world, 2.) get nitty gritty hands-on farming experience through WWOOF, then 3.) try to land a farming internship in California with a lot of hands-on work (it is a farm) as well as a class-style educational component.

How did I get here? For many years (starting in like third grade), I casually took dance classes. In eighth grade, I stepped up my game and took 10 hours a week instead of 2 or 3, which jettisoned me onto the scene of serious dance. I loved it, and freshman, sophomore, and junior year I was part of my studio's company and dancing 20+ hours a week. In the middle of junior year, I started to realize I didn't want to be a professional dancer and didn't need the intensity of training I was locked into, and I burned out pretty hard. I took senior year essentially off from dance and focused on school and college and developing some things -- chiefly, a few more friends and independence -- that I never had time for while I was dancing. While I was swamped with coursework and college apps, I started to show the signs of serious stress, just like all my peers. I hit my worst depression yet at that time in late fall of 2011, which stuck with me until the sun started coming out again in the spring. 
 
I deferred my college entry in favor of taking a gap year to develop myself further and to pursue some tangential interest in farming. The first part of that gap year plan was to live on my own and support myself to get a taste of 'el real world.' I moved to Portland, Oregon with a few connections and attempted to live my life in a way that was rewarding for essentially the first 'semester' of the year. During that time, I had to motivate myself constantly because there was nobody telling me to do anything. I made many to-do-lists, developed some routines that suited me, and made the first baby steps into living on my own. I searched hard for work but found very little employment other than a sales job which I just absolutely could not stand and a dance gig at an absolutely illegitimate studio which I did for the cash (still grew as a dancer, though; can't avoid that if you're actually present in rehearsal). Essentially through all of Portland I was the most depressed I have ever been, probably related to a combination of lack of structure, lack of close and deep-rooted friendships, lack of SUNLIGHT, lack of purpose, binge eating, and a dwindling sense of self-confidence and even self-worth as my performance and ability dwindled.
 
I just got back home a week ago, and felt immediately comfortable -- a feeling I honestly could not get my hands on in Portland. I have hardly done shit since. I've been hanging out with my old best friends, three wonderful people with whom I have shared my life forever and around whom I feel like the most complete, sane, able, and happy version of myself. I try to talk to them about my depression and my insecurities, but they feel so orbital and otherworldly when I'm around them that it's difficult to be sincere. I also think I dodge around the issues to avoid revealing how pathetic I have become. 
 
When I am alone, I am an absolute wreck. Every day I have thought about doing some basic tasks like mailing in my change of address form and a utilities check, and every day I table it. I haven't worked out, cooked or eaten healthily, read, played guitar, or really done much of anything I do ""for myself"" since I've gotten here. When I have time on my hands and nobody but mom and dad around, I fret over my future or I worry about why my past experience sucked so much, but I don't really do anything about either. I don't actually have a next destination yet, and the anxiety of that looming over me is destructive, especially considering my lack of effort on finding something to do. I have 2 farms in France that are willing to take me on, but I am now rather afraid of the same kind of placenessless and lack of foundation I felt in Portland hitting me when I leave the country and my native language. I am going to start talking to farms in the US, but I have not done shit on that front since I got here... naturally. I have a job offer at a pizzeria in town that would at least give me some employment, but I'm a little daunted by the fact that shifts are exclusively from 11-10 and by the fact that my boss told me he could give me '70 hours or 50 hours' and sounded like he was settling when he said I could do 40 - about twice as much as I have ever worked in my life.
 
So here I am. I'm home, complacent, depressed, and worried. I'm extremely reluctant towards just about anything, from getting off the couch to making plans with my girlfriend to going away from everything and everyone I know and love *again* to going to work. I feel feeble; I feel like 'giving up' and going to college in the coming semester, and although I am not suicidal I have very strong urges to 'get away' from it all - it all being everything that constitutes my life. I know I can't run away from everything forever, but I feel almost powerless and haven't found anything that makes me feel empowered -- except being around the love of my best friends, which I necessarily will leave when I go to 'do the next thing.' 
 
This has veered greatly off-topic, as I so frequently do. 
TL;DR: I feel horrible, my life is ??? and I need help."
15peu2,10,2012-12-30,I [23f] just found out my boyfriend [25m] lied to me.  Already have issues trusting people and this hurts.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/15peu2/i_23f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_25m_lied_to_me/,"I've been seeing my boyfriend since late March, officially started dating in October.  We were on track to become serious sooner but he was offered an internship 20 hours away from here and so we kind of put things on halt.

We both have bad past relationships.  I've been in physically abusive relationships as well as relationships where I've been emotionally or physically cheated on.  He has been in an emotionally abusive relationship where he waited for a year for a girl to love him and he wasn't allowed to display affection during that time.

So. Back to the relationship.  Due to the distance we both agreed we weren't going to become official since long distance is tough and we hadn't known each other for very long.  I thought it was clear though that we both had feelings for each other.  Well, he went away and we saw each other a month later since we had plans to climb Mt. Whitney together, we had some hot sex, I thought everything was great.  The week after that trip I get a phone call from him saying that he has been going on a couple dates with another girl and things are starting to get serious, he wanted to get my consent to basically sleep with another woman.  I'm not happy, but I tell him we're not in a relationship and he can do as he pleases.  I know now I should have told him it wasn't ok, but hindsight is a bitch.

His internship ends, he comes back and we start taking things slow.  In October we make things official.  I still struggle with what happened this summer and we talk through it.  While it still bothers me, it doesn't bother me as much as it used to.  He tells me they aren't friends on facebook anymore and they don't text or call.  Things are going pretty swanky.  Until today.  I find out he is still in fact friends with this girl on facebook.  She apparently has 2 facebook accounts and while he defriended the one account, he is still friends with her on the other one.  Not only that, but since her account isn't entirely private I can see that he has been liking her pictures, the most recent being just a few weeks ago.  Since he lied it makes me feel like he still has feelings for her.  When he came back this summer he said he wants to move back out there once he's done with law school, so this makes me feel like he wants to move back there for her and I'm just in the fill in girl for the time being.  What is the best course of action here?

tl;dr- boy says he is no longer friends on facebook and doesn't call/text girl he slept with this summer.  While he isn't friends with one of her accounts, he is friends with her other account and continues to like her pictures.  Makes me feel like fill in pussy.  What do?"
