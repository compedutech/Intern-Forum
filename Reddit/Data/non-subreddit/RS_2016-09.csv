50khg5,4,2016-08-31,Got my first interview for an actuarial internship. I need advice!,dalmationsr0ck,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/50khg5/got_my_first_interview_for_an_actuarial/,"I started applying to actuarial internships and I just got my first phone interview! yay! (it's next friday) But I'm kind of terrible at phone interviews, and have never done one for an actuarial role. I've done two or three for other internships and didn't end up getting them (was not surprised). I really think I'm a qualified candidate, I have exam P passed, math major with insurance and risk management minor, 4.0 gpa, involved in my school's risk management and insurance fraternity, involved in other campus activites, blah blah blah... but I have a really hard time selling myself in interviews. I'm a very social and talkative person and have no problem talking to people in non-interview settings but for some reason in interviews, especially over the phone I get so nervous and don't do as well as I probably could in person and have a harder time selling myself.

Does anyone have any tips on questions they will ask and answers I should have, aside from the standard ones in any generic interview? 

Also tips on what questions I should be asking them... I want to seem interested because I am extremely interested but I know what actuaries do and I feel like asking generic things about the profession will make me seem uninformed about it. But at the same time I want to ask questions.

If anyone has any input at all for me it would be much appreciated! Thank u all :)"

I am recruiting for any ACC football teams and we are looking to expand. If you love a one or many ACC football teams and think you could write about them (previews/recaps/analysis) on a consistent basis, please DM me!

We are currently expanding for this upcoming ACC season. We would love to have more ACC writers who want to get more involved with their beloved teams.

We like to focus on college students because this qualifies as an internship opportunity but anyone can become a writer. And mods, you can definitely join as well!

Thanks!"
50kw0j,1,2016-08-31,Am I [21/m] latching onto nothing with [21/f]? How much BS is there?,pcs444,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50kw0j/am_i_21m_latching_onto_nothing_with_21f_how_much/,"Detailed Backstory: We both graduated from the same college a few months ago. Claire (this is what we'll call her) and I met early on freshman year and she was one of the first few friends I made at college. As that year went on, we became really close friends. However, we grew apart the following year, after our friend group fell apart. Things got dramatic too, and we didn't talk. I felt bad, and it sucked that we virtually became strangers. One night at a party junior year, we ran into each other and we ended up drunkenly talking about everything until like 6 am in the morning. It made me realize that there was nothing anymore and that was it. I never saw or spoke to her again until senior year rolled around, and we bumped into each other quite a bit in random places. We would just have small talk, but we didn't shut each other out like we did in the past. Halfway through the year, we run into each other at a party. We were both drunk, flirty, and we started dancing together. Then, I decided to kiss Claire and had no idea what kind of floodgate I just opened. We stared at each other before making out until the party ended. We were both kind of freaked and we went our separate ways. We texted a little bit throughout at that week, and eventually I asked if she wanted to hang out one night. We hooked up, and then it became a weekly thing. 

After about a month, she wanted to talk about us. She said that she didn't want a relationship but that we should keep doing this, and I agreed because we were graduating and I felt there was no point. So we were friends with benefits, and two people who eventually fell super hard for one another. After a bit of jealousy on both ends, we talked about it and decided that we were official in March. We never had sex together until shortly after becoming official. I wasn't a virgin, but she was, and I could tell that it was a big topic for her so I didn't want to press too hard when we were just fwbs. 

In April, we started talking about what we were going to do after graduation.  Although we were just 45 minutes away from each other (which isn't that bad of a LDR, but way different from 45 feet away in college), she got a 1-year internship that she really wanted across the country in California. I stayed on the East Coast working in finance. She had doubts, but we promised each other we were going to try. We finished out the year great, very lovingly. We were crazy about each other. Graduation was bittersweet for many reasons. We saw each other that night before we moved back home, and we started making out until she just got overwhelmed with emotion. We both did. We didn't want to say goodbye and wished that we had more time. We cried into each other's arms. I've never cried about a girl before. 

We were together for about just under another month after graduating. We saw each other after a week and a half and it was great. We talked on the phone almost everyday, texted too. We never really did phone calls while at college, but I took some advice from friends to do that at least once a day. I saw her again after a couple weeks, and we were having dinner. She dropped that she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. She cited not being mentally prepared for going long distance once she's away in L.A. Even though I told her I was ready to make it work, she wasn't. She also said that she isn't ""emotionally mature"" enough for a relationship and although we both had the same sentiments in the beginning to the end, at the end of the day she wants to pursue her career more than anything. She said it was ""commitment issues"" and although she had briefly mentioned that before, I didn't buy it. I especially didn't buy it when she said, ""It's not you, it's me."" My experiences have shown me the bullshit behind that statement. I asked her on four separate occasions throughout that talk if she was talking to anybody, she firmly said no each time in a way that seemed like I was asking the dumbest question she's ever heard. I believe it, as she is a serial monogamist. She said she wanted to be friends, and being in a dazed state, I accepted it (wasn't thinking.) 

A few days later, thinking I was cooled off enough, I called her asking if we could talk about it a little more. She opened up a little more, saying that being in a LDR would hold her back when she's away in L.A. That she wants to really focus in on the job and succeed. She said that the prospect of building future plans around someone was terrifying to her because she wasn't sure if she would return to the East Coast after the internship is over. Things eventually got heated and she hung up. A couple days later, I sent her this long message and apologized, wished her luck, and said we could be friends. (Still was a lot more emotionally charged than I thought.) I figured, fuck it, let's start the healing process and get it done like I've done in the past. I saw her a couple weeks later for a mutual friend's birthday and while I was cool and calm on the outside, I was infuriated when I saw her throw herself and flirt with this guy for an hour in front of my face. Nothing happened, but I felt sick to my stomach. After that day, I went NC and thought I could just get over her.

But it hasn't been way. A couple months later and I'm still hung up on this girl and heartbroken. I've never felt this way, usually with exes, I was over them in a week, tops. We started texting a little bit about a month and a half after, in the weeks leading up to her departure. I wished her luck, and it's been almost a month since we last talked. On Facebook, she put up a picture of this wall of photographs she has in the room she's staying in. I saw that I was in a handful of them, and I was stunned. One of us together, but then the others are in group photos.

I miss her dearly, I immerse myself at the gym and work, but the distractions aren't enough. I know she'll be back for the holidays. I can see why people say go NC after a breakup, now that the fog has cleared and since logic set in, I realize a lot of the boneheaded things I did when it came to handling this and the flaws on both sides. I understand why it happened, but I just don't believe it and I'm conflicted in feeling that there's nothing to save. Especially when there's just so much time until the holidays, we're both bound to get over it, right?

TL;DR: I started hooking up and eventually dating one of my ex-closest friends that I met in college. We reconnected senior year and started dating second semester and through graduation. She got a big post-graduate 1-year internship that began earlier this month in L.A. With me being in the East Coast, we were ready to try a LDR. About a month after graduation, she called it off, citing commitment issues, not being emotionally prepared for a LDR, feeling trapped, and the ""it's not you, it's me"" card. We started talking a little bit, but not since she left, and I've been having a hard time recover/deciding if I'm holding onto lost hope. "

--------------------------

""Dad. Stop."" Mr. Delcrius was fixing up Richard's hair, commonplace during their meetings. He's never really liked the way his son presented himself in the whole hair-department. Richard showed up late, and Mr. Delcrius had no way of seeing him before hand, the long hair was a bombshell that had to be addressed.

""I'm not stopping, Richard. Your hair looks like three Grindylows tried to duke it out with its strands."" He said curtly. ""You have a meeting with Marlon Rolphe, you should've addressed this before coming here!""

Richard sighed, he figured he'd be met with some sort of criticism. A thought then occurred to him, and his eyes widened in near-horror. ""Wait, Marlon Rolphe...what...what the heck? You told me we were meeting with his adviser, Steven! Not the man himself!""

""If you want to get into the Beast division, you're going to meet with Marlon. They're quite picky, pickier than the Spirit and Being divisions."" 

Richard groaned. ""God, I should've been an Auror.""

""If they set you off with an exploratory pass, you'll have free, funded reign to travel the world and find, research, and categorize Magical Creatures. I did it for years, Richard, it's rewarding as all hell, and you *know* it's what you want to do.""

Richard sighed. ""Yeah, I know, dad, it's just, I mean, this is going to be tough...they could just deny me, you know.""

Mr. Delcrius laughed. ""Not with my beautifully crafted character reference, not to mention your brother's friend Jordan! You'll be certified in no time, Richard.""

A women entered the hallway, clipboard in hand, Richard looked up, expecting to see a dull, devoid of meaning intern, but she seemed quite peppy. Dark brown hair flowing down in curls, a cheery smile as she shook Richard and his father's hands. ""Hey! Marlon's ready to see you now.""

Mr. Delcrius pat his son on the back. ""Off you go, then, good luck."" Richard took a shaky breathy, nodded, and followed the women along down the hall. His future was literally waiting for him at the end of the hallway, once he stepped through those large, cheery-wood doors, he'd find that he made it to where he wanted to be, or that he failed, and his whole life would have to be reworked. Like kicking down an anthill, his whole being would be disrupted, perhaps even destroyed forever. 

""Don't be nervous."" the girl spoke up. ""I was nervous, too. I mean, I'm from Ilvermorny, I moved here for a fresh start. I only graduated last year! Good things happen here, even if we're new to all this.""

Richard smiled. ""Oh, uh, thanks. I know...I'm not usually nervous before meetings. But...you know, this is Marlon we're talking about. He's notorious for being an arse, isn't he?""

She tilted her head. ""He is? He's been nothing but kind, to me. So...guess we'll have to see! Good luck, Richard."" 

He wanted to ask her name, though he supposed she would be one of those vagabonds that stroll through his life and instantly flee when they've passed him. She turned and left as Richard wandered through the doors. What awaited him was a large desk, a few papers floating about, along with a large, ornate globe towards the right.

Marlon sat in his reclining chair, looking through some paper work, he was an old, tall man. Not pudgy at all, some wrinkles here and there, though he retained most of his hair. Dignitary and just, the man seemed to be. A small, black dish sat on his desk as well, it looked a lot like a satellite dish, though far smaller.

Marlon nodded towards the chair in front of his desk, and Richard quietly shut the door sitting in front of him, hands gripping each other on his thighs. 

""Hello, Richard."" Marlon started dryly. ""Before we begin, do you have any questions?""

Richard cleared his throat. ""Erm, yes, sir. Is that dish a-"" Richard had begun to point, but the man had already interrupted him.

""Secrecy Sensor, yes. I dislike lies."" 

Richard furrowed his brow and nodded, still sitting upright, waiting for the man to speak some more. ""So, Richard, you want to join the Beast division? Straight out of Hogwarts, huh?""

""Yes, sir. I do. I think you'll find that-""

""Hush, now. I'm still talking."" the man wagged a long, rough finger. ""You're gunning for your father's old position, huh? One of those explorers that prattle about?""

""Yes, sir."" Richard said quietly. 

""Nowadays it's much rougher to get a job here, Richard. We need a lot more. You have outstanding research of your own...however, if you're not combat ready, you can't go out there.""

""Combat...ready?"" Richard asked.

""Yes, I run my researchers as if they were soldiers. You need a whole arsenal of charms, hexes, and curses, if you're going to be dealing with those 'Fantastic Beasts', as our friend Newt would put it. Not only that, you're missing a few field tag-alongs.""

""Sir...I assure you, I've studied magic everyday of my life for years-"" the Secrecy Sensor shuddered. 

""Might want to avoid exaggerations, Richard."" He narrowed his eyes.

""Yes, yes. Sorry. I've studied magic as hard as I could for years."" he paused, waiting for the detector to set off, it didn't. ""Some days were exceptions, obviously, I mean, sometimes I'm too sick to move. Though even on those days I did everything I could. I know every damned charm in the world, some of my research was even for a newly worked charm I was in the process of creating! The beast sound replication charm. Jynxes, hexes, the whole nine-yards! You've read my papers, right? You know how passionate I am about this. You know I'm qualified. Over-qualified, even. Why are you delaying it? Why would you *not* want me?! Erm, sir."" Richard squeezed his fists to calm himself. 

Marlon smirked. ""You've got a mouth on you, Richard. I'm a fan of that, honestly. You're like your father. And your brother...and your grandfather."" the man rubbed his temples. ""You Delcrius men will be the death of me."" Marlon sighed, continuing soon enough. ""I had your father spread those rumours about me, I'm quite a cool-headed man, Richard. You have the job, more or less. This was just a formality. You simply need some more field experience.""

Richard blinked a few times. ""So...wait, really? What happened to...you seemed so tough...""

""Hey, I *am* tough. I, however, conduct interviews under intimidating conditions. I test to see whether someone will crack, or not. You cracked quite fast, these normally last an hour. If you don't crack at all, you don't get the job. Because that, in itself, is a lie."" He smiled broadly and opened his arms. 

""So...what now, then, sir?""

""Just call me Marlon, Richard."" the man yawned. ""My, it's been so tiring here...anyway, you're going to go back to Hogwarts, naturally. Spend some time studying with the Magical Creatures professor. Barrick has already been contacted."" 

Richard smiled. ""Wait...Hogwarts? I-I can go back?!""

Marlon nodded. ""Yes, you can, Richard. You can stay till you've fulfilled all the requirements. You'll assist the professor, and do your own research. By the end you should have a stunning enough resume for us to allow you in."" 

""Hogwarts...I'm going back..."" Richard realized he was crying, tears dropping delicately onto his pants despite his smile. 

Marlon tossed him a tissue. ""Are you alright, there?"" 

Richard shuddered a little. ""I-I'm sorry I don't...I don't know what's wrong. Just...just a flush of emotions. P-probably. Are we done?""

""We are...and, you sure you're alright?""

""Yes, yes, of course!"" Richard chided, standing up, shaking Marlon's hand, and quickly starting for the door. ""Everything's great! I'll see you soon, sir!"" By the time the door shut, the Secrecy Sensor was still vibrating.

50lafu,17,2016-08-31,How I overcame my gaming addiction.,fabri_jinga,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/50lafu/how_i_overcame_my_gaming_addiction/,"Hello, today begins my new life challenge, one that I have been planning for a long time now. I am a 21 year old Canadian guy who is studying Software Engineering at University. My grades, as of now, are average given that my CGPA is 3.3/4.3 (B+ average OR 77-79%). I strongly believe that online video games has had a negative impact on my ambition, my academics and my overall life. I would like to share, with you guys, my action plan to quit gaming ,my thoughts, and hopefully help or inspire someone.

## My Gaming History
After reading a couple of posts in this sub-reddit, I have always been curious about what games or consoles the authors were addicted to. I think that it can help the readers relate more.
&amp;nbsp;

* I was born in 1995
* The first video game that I played was *Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo* in the late 90's on my father's computer.
* Around 2001, I got my first console; a PS One.
* In 2002, I got my GameCube.
* In 2005, I spent most of the summer playing *Super Smash Bros Melee*.
* From 2006-2008, I played *Runescape*.
* In 2007, I bought a PSP and I played *Monster Hunter Freedom 2*.
* In May 2009, I bought my Xbox 360 , where I played *Call of Duty 4* and *Fallout 3*.
* In August 2009, I got Xbox Live.
* On November 11th 2009, I bought *Modern Warfare 2*.
* On November 9th 2010, I bought *Black Ops*.
* I created my steam account in May 2010, where initially I played *Half Life 2* and *Counter Strike Source*.
* In January 2012, I restarted playing *Runescape* until early 2013.
* I first tried *League of Legends* in the summer of 2012. 
* The summer 2013, I played Xbox 360 single player games such as *Assassin's Creed*.
* In December 2013, Started playing *Dota 2*.
* I sold my Xbox 360 and all games in the summer of 2014 for CDN $120.
* Summer and Winter of 2014, 2015 and 2016 I played *Dota 2* and some *League of Legends*.

## My Gaming Play Times
I only listed the games where I spent more than 50 hours or that I could calculate the number of hours played. For this reason, all the games in older consoles are not listed.
&amp;nbsp;

Game|Playtime                        
:--|:-- 
Dota 2| 1526 hours (64 days)
Modern Warefare 2| 50 days approx.
Runescape| 50 days approx.
Black Ops| 25 days approx.
League of Legends|537 hours (22 days)
Call of Duty 4| 20 days approx.
Fallout 3| 400 hours (17 days)
Steam Games (excluding ones on this list)| 371 hours (15 days) 
Monster Hunter Freedom 2| 200 hours (8 days)
Counter Strike Source|133 hours (6 days)
**TOTAL HOURS** |6647 (277 days)
&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis**
&amp;nbsp;

It is shocking to me that I wasted AT LEAST 277 days of my life playing video games and as of now, I did not benefit in any way from it. It's quite the opposite; gaming screwed up my eye sight (- 4.00 prescription), got me out of shape, and all that time was **quick pleasure without long term benefits**. If I had worked all that time for the minimum wage (assume CND $10), I could have earned theoretically $66,460. Also, if I had studied or worked out, I bet I would not be writing this post. 
&amp;nbsp;

## My Thoughts of Gaming
As of now, September 2016, I believe that some video games are a work of art, while others are just made for pure profit. I know that a handful of people can make a living out of video games using platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. Additionally, professional gamers can earn millions of dollars in competitions. However, that is not my case what so ever. When it comes to me, gaming is a waste of time, since I do not gain any benefits other than forget about the things that I should be doing. I also used to get this weird feeling of regret every night after I spent all day gaming. Every night I would say ""tomorrow I will be productive"", but the next day my urge of gaming brings me back to my pc to game all day. That cycle repeated so many times. Don’t take me wrong, gaming has a bright future with the constant technology improvements such as VR, and a growing industry. I felt like buying a new gaming rig after watching the Battlefield 1 trailer for the first time. I am glad that I didn't. I don’t consider gaming with moderation a bad activity. I just cannot control myself, so the problem is me.

## Why am I quitting?
The main reason why I am quitting gaming is for a better future. If I continue gaming at this frequency, I will regret it later when my friends start getting married, landing nice jobs, starting companies or buying houses. The numbers that are on the table were shocking to me, and I was quite ashamed to be honest. I hesitated to post them, but I did to help you guys realize how many hours we *waste* on gaming. I am happy that I still have control of my life and that I realized this before something happened. 
&amp;nbsp;

Another reason is because I am starting to feel old when I play online games. I don’t like the feeling that I get when I play online video games, and there are 11-12 year old kids in the same lobby as me. I feel as though I am wasting my life. There are also new activities that I want to try, such as video editing and vloging. I think that I spent enough time gaming (see the table above), and it is time to move on.
&amp;nbsp;

I am just glad that I realized how many hours, I have *wasted* and that it is not too late now. Hopefully, I also helped one of you guys realize that you were in the same sinking boat. 


## My Action Plan
I think that in order to quit gaming, you must have a strong action plan. 

* **The best way to start would be by gradually reducing your gaming time.**
This would allow you to familiarize yourself with the feeling of deprivation of gaming. I have been only gaming on the pc ever since I sold all my consoles. I remember that every time before school started, I used to uninstall all my games. However, I remember always being on YouTube and Twitch watching people play video games. For this reason, I strongly recommend to permanently delete all your social media accounts related to gaming such as your Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, etc. Which is worst in my opinion, since I am helping a random guy make money while I was my time and do not benefit what so ever (only the quick pleasure). 

* **After, the next step would be to find a hobby or something to fill up that void.**
There are tons of hobbies out there, you can just google for some ideas. Personally, since I am studying Software Engineering, I started learning new software technologies, and programming languages/frameworks. I also started taking online courses related to web programming to boost my resume. This really paid off, since I got an internship in a prestigious software company as a Front-End developer. I will start September 6th 2016. I will be working until December 2016, and then go back to school in January 2017. I am saying this to motivate you guys, not to show-off. I strongly believe that if I can do it, then anyone can. Also, I will start a monthly [blog]( https://fabrijinga.wordpress.com/), where I will keep track of the progress I make, the things I learnt, funny mistakes that I did, etc. The last thing, an the most interesting in my opinion, is that at the beginning of each month, I will give myself some challenges to keep my life fun and entertaining. For September 2016, my challenges are to run 30 minutes per day on the tread mill ( haven’t exercised in 3 years) and continue with my strict diet. Another challenge for this month will be to watch at least one movie per week, and hopefully finish a trilogy.

## My Plans For the Future
I intend to do activities/changes that will benefit me in the future. I will list a few the activities that I plan to do before Summer 2017.
&amp;nbsp;

* ONLY ALLOWED TO WATCH YOUTUBE ON SATURDAYS; 2HRS MAX (no more procrastination)
* Go to the gym (many benefits)
* Start swimming (many health benefits)
* Continue with my diet (many health benefits)
* Go to sleep everyday at maximum 10:30pm (No more sleep deprivation)
* Do a monthly blog (improve writing skills, keep track of time)
* Build web applications to improve my resume and get another internship summer 2017.
* Go to at least 3 hackathons (improve coding skills, socialize, meet employers)
* Read the news (stay up to date, can start conversations)
* Learn video editing and vloging (improve communication skills, keep track of time)
* Learn Photoshop (boost my resume, can create crazy websites)
* Learn more about buying properties, start-ups, stock markets, etc.(personal interest, possibility to make money)
* Read/Learn about Bitcoin and Ethereum (personal interest, possibility to make money)

50ljm1,1,2016-09-01,F4M Some scenes to choose from!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50ljm1/f4m_some_scenes_to_choose_from/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

50lom1,1,2016-09-01,College and grief and depression,awesomeabby,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/50lom1/college_and_grief_and_depression/,"Hey everyone! I have never posted to reddit before, so here I go. 

I am a senior in college, and ever since I came to college I have been battling depression. It has gotten awful in the past year because my mom died in November, with a fraternity brother of mine passing away the next month. After this happened I never went to class and was incredibly depressed and eventually attempted suicide. Dealing with grief away from your family is so difficult. I also got very bad grades.

I was very proud of myself this summer because I did an internship and finished a class that got me out of academic probation. 

So fast forward to now. I am VP of my fraternity, but I want to drop. I think my fraternity is toxic, makes me anxious and is  bad for my mental health, and makes me upset regularly. I care about my brothers and my organization but I shouldn't stay in if it's bad for me, right? I feel so bad about letting everyone down though. I am also afraid that I am just alienating myself from people because of my depression.

I am still dealing with my grief a lot, it takes up a lot of my thoughts. But I also am generally depressed and am already falling back into not going to class. And I'm only one week into the new semester.

Basically, if anyone has any experience dealing with these things in college, let me know how you dealt with it or what you did to keep you going to class. Also- has anyone removed themselves from a thing they used to love because it stopped being good for them?"
50lqkv,1,2016-09-01,FC St. Pauli: Trendwende auch ohne weitere Verstärkung?,betamax65,fcsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcsp/comments/50lqkv/fc_st_pauli_trendwende_auch_ohne_weitere/,"[](http://ift.tt/2cswKlk)Bekam kurz vor Transferschluss keinen neuen Teamkollegen mehr: Robin Himmelmann © Imago

Intern hat man beim FC St. Pauli nicht zuletzt wegen des kapitalen Fehlstarts in der Liga mit drei Niederlagen an den ersten drei Spieltagen zwar über Verstärkungen kurz vor Transferschluss diskutiert, doch letztlich haben die Verantwortlichen des Kiez-Klubs darauf verzichtet, noch einen neuen Spieler hinzuzuholen.

### Kein passender Spieler auf dem Markt

Die Optionen, die auf dem Markt waren, beheben unsere Probleme nicht. (Thomas Meggle)

_„Wir haben links und rechts geguckt. Die Optionen, die auf dem Markt waren, beheben unsere Probleme nicht. Es gibt keinen, der uns am 10. September gegen Bielefeld in eine andere Liga gehievt hätte“_, begründete Sportchef Thomas Meggle in Bild die Entscheidung gegen einen Transfer damit, dass schlichtweg kein passender Spieler zu haben war.

**Sebastian Kerk, der nun [vom SC Freiburg an den 1. FC Kaiserslautern verliehen wurde](http://ift.tt/2bGK3Ja), war zwar wohl ein Thema am Millerntor, doch nach monatelanger Pause in Folge von Achillessehnenproblemen ist der 22 Jahre alte Offensivmann aktuell noch nicht einsatzfähig und eben kein Spieler, der schon am übernächsten Wochenende gegen Arminia Bielefeld für frischen Wind gesorgt hätte.**

### Vertrauen in den Kader

Wir sind uns einig, dass wir mit diesem Kader eine stabile Saison spielen. (Thomas Meggle)

**Gleichzeitig sprach Meggle aber auch dem vorhandenen Personal sein Vertrauen aus und glaubt daran, dass damit die Wende zum Besseren geschafft und die Abstiegszone schnell verlassen werden kann: _„Wir sind uns einig, dass wir mit diesem Kader eine stabile Saison spielen.“_   
**

Im „Kicker“ (Ausgabe 71/2016 vom 01.09.2016) machte Meggle indes auch klar, dass sich teamintern nach dem Verlust von mehreren Eckpfeilern wie Lennart Thy, Marc Rzatkowski, Enis Alushi oder Sebastian Maier erst noch eine neue Hierarchie bilden müsse, die für den Erfolg enorm wichtig sei: _„Wir hatten in der vergangenen Saison einige Profis, die in einer funktionierenden Mannschaft funktioniert haben. Durch die Abgänge müssen sie nun Führungsaufgaben übernehmen. Diese Schwelle zu überschreiten ist nicht einfach, da bleibt mitunter die Leistung auf der Strecke. Das haben wir durchaus einkalkuliert“_, zeigt sich der Sportchef vom Fehlstart zudem nicht gänzlich überrascht.

50mgpy,11,2016-09-01,I've cultivated a victim mentality for too long.,ParisSky84,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/50mgpy/ive_cultivated_a_victim_mentality_for_too_long/,"I am feeling regretful right now because of really trivial issues. You can probably criticize me all you want for feeling remorseful for them too. 
I regret not going to a more prestigious university and dorming there (first world problems). I had an option between a prestigious university and a full tuition scholarship for a university I would commute to. I had suicidal thoughts beforehand, and I was self-harming as well. Even though my parents reassured me that they would pay for everything, I was still anxious about going because of how much I would pay. I thought I was too immature to go, and alongside with my suicidal thoughts, it would be too risky (financially) for my parents to pay for it. On the day I had to decide, I showed them my self-harm scars and told them I couldn't make the decision. They told me I should go to the commuter college instead. I felt thankful that they took the responsibility of making a simple decision off of me. 

Now it's been a year at this commuter college, and I still can't decide on a major. I've lost my motivation simply because the college simply isn't prestigious. My parents have to make a 45 minute trip each way to drop me off (I'm barely getting my license this week-yes, I'm a piece of shit). This makes it not only more difficult for them, but it's makes me lose opportunities to network and explore career possibilities. Yes, I know it's my fault. I also know that I can intern outside of college, but I haven't done that either. 

Looking back, I completely regret not going to the prestigious university because of how it would stop me from being too sheltered and it would make the foundations of my career a little bit more smoother. However, despite this, sometimes I can't help but get angry at my parents for not properly teaching me things from age 12-17 (changing tires, cooking, laundry). I get more embarassed that I feel this anger at my age (19) because I have the ultimate control over this. I decided not to get a job this summer either and decided to take several online courses to see what I really wanted to do as a career. I haven't finished anything. 

I am now realizing how much of a victim mentality I'm having over this regret. Honestly, I have the ultimate say on whether or not I fail at finding a career. No one truly cares about us until we actually fucking try, and I haven't. The grass is always greener, and I'm going to see this commuter college as a precious opportunity to jumpstart my career, regardless of the prestige. 

If I never cultivated a victim mentality, then I would have fucking tried to be an adult and enroll at the prestigious university. I would have gone to therapy there, treated myself, and applied myself further. It seems as if no matter where I went, it was always someone else's fault that I didn't apply myself.

Understandably, my parents are becoming more sarcastic and bitter at me for not trying. This is the first time my parents aren't putting a charade on me. I'm glad that they are beginning to recognize me for the piece of shit that I am because they shouldn't be supporting me financially or emotionally at this point (at least, in my point of view).

For now, I'm trying to get rid of this victim mentality by becoming more positive and taking simpler steps to problems. Despite this, I still feel unmotivated because I'm scared of the pain of adulthood. I know that's a generalization. I know that I will still survive because I live in such a developed nation. I still want to commit suicide, but I still think it's because I see myself as a victim. I've talked to a therapist, and he doesn't think it's serious, so it's probably just me being a helpless child. I can't help but suspect that even if I have a mental illness that it's fucking treatable and I shouldn't burden others because of it. 

I'm still a piece of shit, and I still don't have any form of purpose or motivation, but you know why? It's because I've never been hit hard with responsibilities before. 

I'm so sorry mom and dad for being a burden. I promise that I will become a fully functioning adult. I will never bother you again.

I know I'm looking for some form of validation, but I don't deserve any just yet because I haven't done anything. I just don't see a reason to live, but we all know that's bullshit."

Some years back, Washington Post reporters Mark Halperin (currently of Bloomberg News and MSNBC) and John Harris (now editor in chief of Politico) wrote a book about political journalism called “The Way to Win: Clinton, Bush, Rove and How to Take the White House in 2008.” In it, they made a famous admission about how Beltway journalism works in the digital age:

    
Matt Drudge rules our world … With the exception of the Associated Press, there is no outlet other than the Drudge Report whose dispatches instantly can command the attention and energies of the most established newspapers and television newscasts.

    
So many media elites check the Drudge Report consistently that a reporter is aware his bosses, his competitors, his sources, his friends on Wall Street, lobbyists, White House officials, congressional aides, cousins, and everyone who is anyone has seen it, too.

Mitt Romney’s former spokesman called Drudge the political media’s assignment editor. And in 2012 on the day after the election, Halperin gave credit in where credit is due in a tweet:

I had assumed that Matt Drudge’s star had faded a bit in the intervening years as fresher, sexier right-wing sites like Breitbart and The Blaze had emerged. But as Politico has reported, Drudge is doing better than ever:

    
For the first time, The Drudge Report moved into second place on Similar Web’s top U.S. Media Publisher rankings, placing just behind MSN.com with about 1.47 billion page view for the month of July. The Drudge Report’s traffic beat out the likes of news sites from Disney Media Networks (which includes ESPN.com and ABCNews.com), Yahoo, Google, Time Warner and Fox Entertainment Groups.

In an article last month called “The Man Who Could Have Stopped Donald Trump,” Oliver Darcy of Business Insider noted Drudge’s still-dominant role:

    
Drudge was the top traffic referrer to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and other news outlets in 2015, according to a Vocativ report. The report said the site accounted for a staggering 52 percent of referral traffic to the Associated Press.

All those organizations are very well aware of the potential for clicks from a Drudge link, and they know what kind of stories he wants to flog. The incentives to please him are obvious.

As the last leg of the 2016 campaign approaches, it’s worth remembering Drudge’s original claim to fame:

    
Web Posted: 01/17/98 23:32:47 PST — NEWSWEEK KILLS STORY ON WHITE HOUSE INTERN

    
BLOCKBUSTER REPORT: 23-YEAR OLD, FORMER WHITE HOUSE INTERN, SEX RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT

The original post, which went on to name various publications that were allegedly holding the item, put journalists at the center of the story. Needless to say, they were excited. The rest, of course, is history. For years Drudge was fed news items by the media, which would often launder them through the foreign press. Then he would feature links with screaming headlines reporters that editors could use to show that a story was “out there.”

Today such stories are still generated in the British tabloid press, but also in right-wing conspiracy sites and bigger operations like Breitbart News. Recently Drudge managed to disseminate the discredited story of Hillary Clinton’s alleged ill health by posting a picture from a fringe website showing Clinton’s slipping on the stairs some months before with this screaming headline:

    
2016: HILLARY CONQUERS THE STAIRS
    
2012: FALLS AT HOME, BLOOD CLOT
    
2011: FALLS BOARDING PLANE
    
2009: FALLS GOING TO WHITE HOUSE, BROKEN ELBOW

That story is now part of the election campaign, with people demanding her full medical records and the press watching her every move like a hawk for signs of brain damage.

With the news this week that Clinton’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin had separated from her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, after yet another public humiliation, Drudge used the opportunity to tee up one of the right’s favorite rumors — that Clinton and Abedin are secret lovers. Unsurprisingly, whispers among unenlightened right-wingers about the feminist harpy Clinton’s being a lesbian go back decades. But the Abedin insinuations, which started in 2007, have taken off in this campaign.

Mainstream publications have fed the notion with click-bait stories like this slide show from Politico, which sat at the top of its “most-read” list for months this year, despite its having been originally published back in 2013. As it turned out, Drudge had been up to his old tricks. He had linked to a British tabloid story in which Abedin was quoted as saying that she thought Clinton was beautiful, which sent millions of drooling Drudge readers searching for “Clinton Huma lesbian.”

There’s no way of knowing if mainstream reporters were among those intrigued by Drudge’s dirt. But we do know that The New York Times found this item worthy of a breathless front-page lead:

    
Among the trove of emails released from Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state was this instruction to a trusted aide who needed to brief her on a matter that could not wait:

    
“Just knock on the door to the bedroom if it’s closed,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in November 2009 to Huma Abedin, then her deputy chief of staff.

Drudge doesn’t even try to find political relevance to his lewd, juvenile innuendo. But the mainstream media’s reaction to this week’s Weiner-Abedin story was hardly any better. Attempts to make it into a campaign story were downright embarrassing.

Yesterday under the headline “Weiner free!” Drudge insinuated once again that Abedin and Clinton are lovers with a picture allegedly showing the two of them hugging with joy now that they have vanquished one of their husbands. As it turned out, the other woman in the picture wasn’t Abedin. It was Burmese opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, but whatever. He made his point.

We can be sure that Drudge’s nasty little sex rumors aren’t the end of it. The more scurrilous charges that Abedin is a secret Muslim agent are now breaking into the mainstream direct from the fever swamps, via none other than Donald Trump himself. And publications like The Hill and the New York Post, hungry for Drudge links and eager to give the monster what it wants in return, are already pushing it into the mainstream. As long as Matt Drudge is driving the news cycle, it will only get worse.

I'm trying to determine if I should visit her or not, and if so, which week.

One of the week options would be in late September — I would miss an important presentation that counts for 100/700 of my points for that class. I'd also miss an art critique, but that will be fine if I miss it. But, she's in classes instead of internship at that point, and she will have much more free time to spend with me.

There's another week that works much better for me (no conflicts) in early November, but she would be at her internship four days a week, 9-5, and she wouldn't be able to spend as much time with me. This week is also slightly more expensive with airfare, but nothing unmanageable.

The other option is to not go. It's a lot of money, and I'd miss class. But it's also a unique experience that I don't think I'd have with her again.

Help me make my choice!"

50o0gm,16,2016-09-01,Tips for Business Horizon/Job Fair?,KingKyung,VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/50o0gm/tips_for_business_horizonjob_fair/,"What are some tips on making a great first impression during your Business Horizon? Some tips for juniors/seniors I received so far:

1. **COME IN PREPARED**: Research the list of the companies you want to work/intern for, usually 10-15. Go to their website/Business Horizon page, look up the company information, positions you are interested in, prepare related questions.
2. Example questions: @#$ sounds really interesting, can you tell me more about it? 
2. Practice conversations
2. **PRACTICE ELEVATOR PITCH**: Introduce quickly, followed by questions. Name, major, year, tell me more? Within X department, do you @#$?. Practice in career center. Can be structured or have a little more freedom.
2. DON'T ask what they do. If you don't know, fake it to the best of your ability. No salary information, etc.
2. At least 10 resumes + extra just in case.
2. **Tell the company why YOU want to work for them** by using the information you received from preparation.
3. Focus on smaller companies with little lines first to get used to the environment/calm down/shake off the jitters. Plus, with them it's easier to establish more personal connection and you might even find that they are the best company for you. If desired, hit your top companies (like Big 4) later.
3. When it comes to technical questions, qualifications you put on your resume have a greater chance of being asked. So be careful what and how you put on.
4. Some companies ask for technical questions, but not all.
4. Talk about your side or in-class project and/or what you are learning right now.
11. **SHOW YOUR PASSION IN THE FIELD**: Passion speaks louder than experience; talk about your coursework, interests in the related field.
11. **FOLLOW THROUGH**: Ask for a business card. Even if they seemed uninterested, send follow-up email within 24 hours and keep the relationship up and have them keep emailing you, so they can add you to the pool. Be very polite, but short and sweet like your followup text after your first date. Start with introduction, I loved talking about A, B, and C. Hope to talk to you soon. Ask for additional steps.
10. Make a Hokies4Hire profile, and apply, but it's different between companies.
10. It's a good idea to secure summer internship/jobs in Fall rather than Spring. So take this seriously and don't procrastinate.

11. Offer time frame differs depending on companies, but it takes weeks to months.
12. Don't feel pressured to accept every interview offers, ask them for extension if needed. 
13. If you feel you waited a bit too long, ask the career services on next steps.
14. Interviews are likely to be more technical. Go to the case study workshops in the career center.

Personally, I was a transfer Junior when I first attended Business Horizon and I got completely overwhelmed and intimidated by the environment. 

I don't know what I expected, but I came in unprepared and paid the price as a result, and I'm still looking for my first internship before I graduate Fall '17."

50p7uz,2,2016-09-01,Antidepressant As A Last Resort,UrinaryUgggggghgency,Urology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Urology/comments/50p7uz/antidepressant_as_a_last_resort/,"Hello rather inactive subreddit, and all who inhabit it. 

Over the last year I've started dealing with urinary urgency. It started when my girlfriend and I were having unprotected sex, and I noticed that before I would go to bed I would sometimes have an urgent matter of expelling the little urine in my bladder (even if I went to the bathroom a little while ago). 

This happened for about four months, and then I started noticing it during the day. This is when I found my Urologist in Prescott, AZ. He started wondering if it was overactive bladder, but to be sure, he had my bladder x-rayed for any malignant tissue. The x-ray came back normal, there was nothing to be worried about, but the urgency was still there. He started me on Rapaflo (8mg) and said to try that for a while and see if it made anything better. At the time I was just finishing up my junior year at college, and the main side-effect of Rapaflo was feeling dizzy or nauseous. I didn't want to take that chance until after my classes were over so I waited. 

In distress of moving out of my house and into a new one (landlord issues), I ended up throwing away the Rapaflo and never starting it. Which I know was a bad idea, but anyways, I spent my summer working for a company in Salem, Oregon. This is when the urinary urgency started disrupting my sleep. 

One Friday evening I noticed that the urgency was so strong that I could not get to sleep no matter how hard I tried. I would go sit on the toilet, try to open up the urethra and try to calm it down, but nothing worked. I was awake all night, into Saturday, and awake all Saturday into Sunday. I will digress here, and state that when I went into my internship, I had what I thought was a hemorrhoid and I felt like it never went away. That being said, I noticed a connection between the rectal pain (doctors thought it was a hemorrhoid as well), and the bladder spasms (what the doctors think are happening). I mentioned the rectal pain and urinary urgency to my doctor in Prescott, and they said they could not help me. So that sucked. I had an appointment with a Proctologist to find out if I had something wrong that was effecting both, but it ended up being a dead-end. Finally, when that troublesome weekend happened, I called the on-call proctologist of the clinic, and they got me worried about having an anal abscess, which could explain both problems. So I went to the hospital and got a CT scan of my lower abdomen, with an immediate urology appointment at the local urology clinic the next day. The CT scan was negative for an abscess, and the urologist didn't find anything wrong with his side of things. He also thought it was overactive bladder, and put me on Sanctura and Rapaflo. These two medications made me feel like shit, but seemed to help for a little while. Especially the rapaflo. I was fine for about a week, but then the urgency came back. At that point the doctor recommended trying a different brand called Vesicare, which didn't help either. This all happened towards the end of my internship, and they didn't want to do a cystoscopy or anything if I was leaving (returning for my senior year at college). So I waited.

I was still taking the Rapaflo and Vesicare when I returned to Prescott. My inital urologist said next step was to get a cystoscopy and CT Urogram to try to find something. The cystoscopy was this morning, and the CT Urogram is tomorrow. The cysto was ""perfect"" (excluding the burning and even more increased urgency afterwards...) and he doesn't believe the CT will come back with anything. 

Finally concluding this long-winded post of my urinary history, my doctor is going to put me on a pediatrich dose of Imipramine. Test that for a couple weeks, then move me to an adult dose and see if that can help. I am worried about taking an antidepressant, but hope that this can finally be the light at the end of the tunnel. This effects my work, my love life, and now it is going to affect my school. I have constant urgency still, I barely sleep anymore, and I try to stay home as much as possible so I don't have to deal with any of this in an unfamiliar environment. 
Should I worry about this antidepressant? Is there anything else I can try to relieve the urgency? 
I was working out at one point, but stopped when all of this got worse because I was so tired. I try to take Azo Urinary Pain Relief when it gets so bad that I can't sleep. It helps sometimes. I'm definitely on it now that I was scoped. God the burning is terrible.

Let me know if this isn't an acceptable place to post this. Just looking anywhere for help."
50pa8u,1,2016-09-01,"My husband, an absolutely fantastic researcher and one of the hardest workers I know, is being harassed and belittled by his academic advisor and I don't know what to do about it.",peecatchwho,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/50pa8u/my_husband_an_absolutely_fantastic_researcher_and/,"Hi, as the title says, I am pretty sick of observing my husband's advisor's behavior. 


Before anyone says, ""That's academia, welcome to it; he should suck it up and get used to it,"" I wish to say that as far as I know, my husband is the only person in our university's department (large state school) experiencing this. The department is constantly advertised as a loving, welcoming community where the students are treated like family and appreciated. When we came here, that was absolutely the feelings we felt and how we felt we were treated by the department.


Over time our feelings have changed. I started with an advisor who was absolutely amazing, but our research was interrupted when he suffered a devastating injury that took him from school for an extended period of time. He and I mutually decided that I should change advisors and take a new research project (which is going very well!). 


At that same time, the department hired a new faculty member, Person A, with a certain specialty that was right up my husband's alley. We both thought it would be great and a perfect opportunity for him to have a chance at a wonderful research plan. At first, he was coadvised by Person B, a long time faculty member, and Person A. 


Because B did not have as much experience with the new research in the area, everyone made a mutual decision that it would serve my husband better if he switched to being advised by A only; paperwork was submitted and everything was great!


Over the last two years, A has presented himself as someone enthusiastic about the department and helping students, but upon closer inspection, he appears to be serving only one interest, namely, himself getting tenure. This has become more obvious in the past three months. He had a second student who was a year behind my husband, but the second student had mental issues and difficulties passing exams the first time. A convinced him to leave the department and ""drop out for the better"", despite the fact that the department wanted to work with the student and help him with his exams.


Because A has not had much luck publishing over the last few years, he has pushed all of this burden onto my husband, and it is obvious that A is feeling the pressure of his mid-tenure review. My husband took a highly competitive internship this summer and worked toward his own personal career goals of landing a great industry job upon graduation; however, this summer A applied a tremendous amount of pressure on my husband to publish papers with him and essentially ignore a large part of his internship.


Shit hit the fan when a very rude email was sent to my husband. The backstory is that he was focused on working over a particular weekend, and did not clear his email queue as fast as he usually does. A's email went unreplied-to for 12 hours,  and apparently warranted a rude email from A claiming ""calls, messages, and emails have been ignored"" and work on the paper ""has absolutely not gone as expected,"" because my husband ""seems to have plans other than to be a contributing member of a team.""


This was the ~4th email accusing my husband of not being a ""team player"" and not doing work as promised; in actuality, research is hard, and sometimes things do not go as expected!


In my husband's reply, some statements were misconstrued, and tone was inferred in the message. This opened up the door for A to approach the graduate chair about ""a belligerent student"" who is ""absolutely not completing research on time"", among other things. Also, according to A, faculty members he discussed this with ""overwhelmingly recommended"" he drop my husband as a student.



Firstly, this is definitely not the case, and it seems that A is pushing off his shortcomings onto my husband, who IS making progress on his thesis, and who has most definitely and without a doubt passed each program requirement. 


Secondly, I cannot fathom any faculty member dropping a fantastic, award winning and hard working student over ONE instance of misinferred tone in an email, which leads me to believe that he has painted a terrible picture of my husband to other faculty members, smearing his name for his own personal sake.


I don't know what to do here, considering that one of the faculty members was the graduate chair of the department who is supposed to help students with such conflicts. I think that now many faculty members just have a tainted image of my husband because of the skewed picture A has painted.



It is really easy to read this and say we are overreacting, but the things he is dealing with have plagued him to some degree for the past year, and it has taken a toll on him mentally. He is now convinced that he can never work hard enough to satisfy his advisor, that he is a failure, and that his mental state is not important to his advisor (he battles depression anyway, and his advisor has made comments to the effect of ""you should have NO free time in graduate school,"" and ""depression is not an excuse"").


I am at a loss here, and am running out of ways to support my husband besides just convincing him that he IS worth something and that he CAN finish his work despite the beliefs of his advisor. I don't know what to do. :(

50pac0,1,2016-09-01,Antidepressant As A Last Resort For Urinary Urgency,UrinaryUgggggghgency,askdoctors,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdoctors/comments/50pac0/antidepressant_as_a_last_resort_for_urinary/,"Posted this to r/Urology, but was told to post elsewhere as it doesn't have much traffic.

Hello whomever reads this,

Over the last year I've started dealing with urinary urgency. It started when my girlfriend and I were having unprotected sex, and I noticed that before I would go to bed I would sometimes have an urgent matter of expelling the little urine in my bladder (even if I went to the bathroom a little while ago).

This happened for about four months, and then I started noticing it during the day. This is when I found my Urologist in Prescott, AZ. He started wondering if it was overactive bladder, but to be sure, he had my bladder x-rayed for any malignant tissue. The x-ray came back normal, there was nothing to be worried about, but the urgency was still there. He started me on Rapaflo (8mg) and said to try that for a while and see if it made anything better. At the time I was just finishing up my junior year at college, and the main side-effect of Rapaflo was feeling dizzy or nauseous. I didn't want to take that chance until after my classes were over so I waited.

In distress of moving out of my house and into a new one (landlord issues), I ended up throwing away the Rapaflo and never starting it. Which I know was a bad idea, but anyways, I spent my summer working for a company in Salem, Oregon. This is when the urinary urgency started disrupting my sleep.

One Friday evening I noticed that the urgency was so strong that I could not get to sleep no matter how hard I tried. I would go sit on the toilet, try to open up the urethra and try to calm it down, but nothing worked. I was awake all night, into Saturday, and awake all Saturday into Sunday. I will digress here, and state that when I went into my internship, I had what I thought was a hemorrhoid and I felt like it never went away. That being said, I noticed a connection between the rectal pain (doctors thought it was a hemorrhoid as well), and the bladder spasms (what the doctors think are happening). I mentioned the rectal pain and urinary urgency to my doctor in Prescott, and they said they could not help me. So that sucked.

50pehy,1,2016-09-01,[Loan] Best loan options of around $20k for a soon-to-be college graduate (non-tuition related)?,finance_throwaway64,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/50pehy/loan_best_loan_options_of_around_20k_for_a/,"Hi everyone.

Short backstory: 22 years old 4th year college student, zero debt until now (had a credit card since 17 and actively used it all the time while paying it off in full at the end of every month) because I managed to pay my school/housing expenses using money I earned during internships and such. Comes Fall 2016, the company I used to work for during last school year (because I interned for a different company in a different state) got absorbed into another company and terminated. I saved enough during summer to pay for my tuition and a few months of rent, but that is about it. The company I interned with for summer gave me a full-time offer (~$9k/mo+stocks) with a signing bonus of around $30k (that I haven't even negotiated up yet, I have time until about end of October), but I only receive $5k on signing and the rest with my first paycheck. These $5k might last me a few more months, but not enough until I graduate (my rent is $1k/mo for a shared apt + some food/gas expenses, urban area).

Therefore, I decided that I need to take out a loan until I graduate in May. I won't have time for any work during the semester anyways because of how many hours of school and TAing that I am doing (had to request an override permit to go over the maximum allowed credit hours for my institution).

Would taking out a loan in my situation be not a bad idea? And if no, where should I take that $20k loan from if I am planning to pay it off within the first month of me starting the job I mentioned before (which would be around July-August, because I wanted to take a few of months off after graduation since I haven't had a single summer or even a month off since starting college)??

**TL;DR**: I have a full-time job offer lined up (I just need to sign it, which I did not yet because I am waiting on a few competing offers) after I graduate this May, however, my current savings will last me only a couple of months tops (even if I just pay rent and nothing else). The offer is good enough so that even the signing bonus alone covers the total amount of loan I am planning to ask for (but I will only be able to receive that bonus with my first paycheck after I graduate). I can't have a job right now because I am taking way too many hours of school in order to be able to graduate in May. Is a private educational loan (from a bank, for example) of $20k max a good idea? If yes, which one offers the best conditions?

**EDIT**: On another thought, can I qualify for a private (from a bank, for example) student/education loan? Technically, I only need money to pay housing expenses, which my college includes into their estimation of Cost of Attendance."

I'm a recent college graduate who is turning 22 on Sunday. It took me until now to come to senses with how I've been feeling lately.

Because my college internship hired me full-time, I accepted the job because it was employment right out of school. When we all graduated (my roommates and best friends), we moved out of our college house and parted ways. I stayed in the area for my job, and found an apartment to rent. My summer was great, because one of my other friends from school roomed with me for before he had to go back to school. As of last Wednesday, I've been living on my own for the first time in my life.

I don't know many people in the area, and my phone sure isn't buzzing like it used to. Besides the fact that I don't have a significant other (or never have for that matter), I'm not the most social person. I'm living in a pretty rural area and finding people (not only someone to date, but friends also) is hard to come by- even dating/meetup apps have been not helpful for me.

It's taken me until now to realize, that I really don't have anything in my life besides work. Work is starting to become a bother, because I'm incredibly underpaid for my field and my take net take home is about $200-$300 at the end of the month (after all expenses). If my parents weren't able to help me out with my groceries, I would be going into my savings to work at a job I'm not happy with anymore. I plan to have a new job before the start of next year. A lot of the time I question why I didn't just find a job back at home and live with Mom &amp; Dad for a year or so.

I've dealt with depression in the past, and have been prescribed SSRI's which I did not like. I felt that they didn't work for me and I felt mad at the fact that I had to take a drug to make me feel ""normal"".

Tears are beading down my face as I'm writing this post, as it looks like I'll be spending my 22nd birthday alone- the first birthday I've ever spent not in the presences of friends or family.
I really don't know what I'm expecting from this post. Maybe some advice, or a feeling of comfort. Mainly just to vent out because I haven't had anyone in my personal life to talk to about things like this for a while now."

50qhun,2,2016-09-01,Is university worth it (CS Degree)? Considering a gap year.,RedDeadPill,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/50qhun/is_university_worth_it_cs_degree_considering_a/,"Uni starts in a couple of weeks **(UK)**, I didn't apply in time to make it into any halls where most of the socialization happens and friendship circles form, there are also hall specific freshers activities I'll probably miss out on. This means I will have to rent a place with a few other students.

Considering my Degree **(Computer Science)**, Is University worth it? I've heard that experience in coding is sufficient enough to land you a job or at least an internship where you can rack up industry experience. **Would a degree really separate you that much from other job applicants?** **Is the debt worth it?**

**My three options are:**

1. Take a gap year, save until January and leave, start Uni next year and get into a good hall/accommodation. Ideally I'll earn whilst abroad.

2. Put University off completely and work on learning computer languages on my own, seeking out internships. (I only know very basic JavaScript as of now.)

3. Suck it up, go university this year, put in extra effort to meet other people, network and form friendship circles. **(I'm friends/acquaintances with one person from my hometown who's also going to the same uni.)**

Honestly, despite the fact I'll have to save-up, the gap year is most attractive to me right now. Considering I've never been abroad and have very little worldly experience. I'am only half prepared for University right now, some advise would be appreciated."

But I had a clingy girlfriend of 2 years who pretty much left me for no reason. Saying shes upset. 

Shes had a tough history, I know shes had depression. I always did do everything I could for her. She would say things like sometimes I want to date you sometimes I dont. She would break up with me every few days for 2 hours and come back. One time in january she made it all dramatic and left for a few days and came back. 

She doesnt have any friends and complains about it often. On Saturday I noticed a guy who she doesnt know, was talking to her her over a video game, Sunday is when she stopped responding, and Monday is when she said its over. 
I feel like the guy influenced her in leaving me. 

But do clingy people usually come back? She wanted me to call her 24/7. And she was always addicted to me. 

I cried a bit for the first day, and begged her not to leave over text. She wouldnt bother picking up the phone. The next day though she said give her a few weeks. I dont know if shes trying to just make me wait a few weeks and get over her, or if she genuinely wants a few weeks. 

I dont want to toot my horn but her whole life, she suffered from depression and a moody family. And I honestly felt I was one of the best things that happened to her. she wore my tshirts day after day, kept telling me how cute I was, she loved getting presents and me comforting her when she was upset. 


I did as much as I could but this past month(s) I have been busy with work and I couldnt call her while at my internship, even though she wanted me to. 

I really miss her, Ill get over it if i absolutely have to, but Im not sure. Any input?

Add on: On Saturday she was even talking about buying a new video game I was playing to keep playing together.

I know a lot of that is based off of what you want to do as a practicing attorney, your grades, and the school you go to, but I feel like some of you can still offer me good insight.

Due to a strong family connection, there is a good chance I'll be able to lock in an internship for the Senior Vice President Legal &amp; Regulatory Affairs of a Fortune 500 company in Switzerland, and this sounds like a dream come true. I'm very lucky if it comes to fruition. But is this a fantastic experience for a law student? It nearly sounds as though this role could be more administrative or business related and would be almost a divergence from the law practice. I don't know him personally, so I can't ask what his day to day business is. Obviously I would if he ever seriously began speaking to me about it (which I expect to happen relatively soon).

To be clear, my interests are in international, corporate, business, tax, real estate law. Very broad I know, but I feel like this could easily combine many of those into one. 

Mainly, I just want to make sure that this would be solid opportunity for my future as an attorney, if I were to take it (either to try and end up with that company or to use it to go elsewhere as a 2L). If it isn't, where should I focus? Do 2L internships prefer a certain type of 1L internship? Any and all help you could lend me would be appreciated."

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

He refused to see me as his lover, even though when given the chance we would always cross that imaginary line. We would leer at each other constantly, and have intense discussions about our interests in history and philosophy. He was my dream partner, and I pursued him as hard as I possibly could.

Eventually, I got tired of being in love with someone who just didn't feel the same way, and we drifted apart. I kept dating these guys I didn't care for, and I always thought of Y. I even had a 3 year long relationship with a man, tried to make it work, but I would always think back to Y. It became hard for me to even bring Y up to myself, and I pushed him back from my thoughts, because I knew he never wanted to be with me. He made his choice, and the worst part was it sounded like his girlfriend didn't even care for him. I know/knew we could care for and challenge each other.

After I finally got close to not thinking of him, he contacted me. He explained that things weren't working with his girlfriend and they officially ended. He apologized for mistreating me, and admitted that had he been more mature and sure of himself he would have pursued me. I instantly met with him, and we began dating soon after that. One month after dating, out of the blue, he sat me down at his kitchen table and said he was worried about getting his work done and finding the right job, and he needed to end things. I was completely devastated because I was sure I wanted to be with him, and we were having such a great time together. Things were hard because we were poor and looking for work, and I had an internship I didn't much enjoy, but I thought we could at least help each other through it all. I left crying after we talked for hours, and I told him I would not like to see him again ever. I was so hurt. I spent a lot of time alone trying to recover from this pain. I got involved with a man who was emotionally abusive because I just stopped caring. I loved Y so much, and it hurt to be turned away again.

So, I start a new very relaxed job working with some close friends. I'm dating this emotionally abusive dude, who doesn't really see himself as emotionally abusive, but trying to ""help me succeed"" by basically controlling everything I do (friends, activities, interests). He was pretty unbearable. I complained constantly to everyone at work about how much I disliked him, but I stuck with it because I needed to make something work, and he was smart and exciting. my boyfriend hosts an event where my coworkers show up, and one of the coworkers I don't know a lot about sits down next to me (this is the 26 M). We start talking and I basically tell him that I want to disappear in India because I love it so much there, and I read Howard Zinn when I'm sad because it makes me feel closer to social change. After I say all this he grabs my hand instantly and squeezes it, and I remember thinking, ""uh, oh"". He says, "" I know exactly how you feel, like you can't do anything for people and all you can do is try,"" or something like that. I felt like he understood me so well, and I also thought he seemed sad. So I sign up to sing a song at this event, and my boyfriend won't let me sing it because it's too slow. 26 M writes a note that says, ""If you don't let us sing the song, H( me 25F) gives me permission to murder you,"" and this is the moment I can say I fell in love with him. We sang leonard cohen together and I loved it. I felt so sad to see him leave that night, and when I went home with my boyfriend I started freaking out. I felt something so good that night. I started hanging out with 26M more and I broke up with my boyfriend. Everything about him just gets better every day. He's extremely creative, and just in a short amount of time we've done so much together. I love every moment I've spent with him.

So immediately after I meet 26M, the other guy from college 29M writes me a beautiful letter about how much he's been struggling with depression and indecision and he should have doubled down on our relationship. This letter was incredibly heart-felt. I sent back a rather angry response, but I did respond. He just has something I will always be attracted to, and I will always want more. He asked me to marry him and spend our lives together. 

So, now what do I do? I JUST fell in love with someone else after 6 years of being completely lost.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: An old lover who means everything to me sent me a letter just two weeks after falling in love with someone new. I love him very much, but this new person is exciting and more on my path. What is to be done here?"
50tbe1,7,2016-09-02,How do you get initial traction as a B2B-startup,alexlash,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/50tbe1/how_do_you_get_initial_traction_as_a_b2bstartup/,"Initial traction for a B2B-startup basically defines its existence and has to be delivered straight away. The problem is that there's a huge chuck of founders who rely on nothing but B2C-marketing and eventually fail to tank up their startups with money.

So here we are. Bootstrapped, profitable and proud: a B2C-startup doing content for others. Let's take a look back and see how we got initial clients without pouring cash into self-promotion.

**Blog about your expertise (even as a newbie)**

Both of our co-founders stepped into marketing around 2010. RoR-development and SMM for local startups is a good way to learn and build up your portfolio but what really gave us a jumpstart to where we are today is blogging the heck out of what we were working on.

Looking back at it, it's hard not to make fun of how childish and miserable our personal blogs were but this is exactly what brought us our first client – one of the major local UX-shops. Freelancing for around a couple of month (job boards is a good option for getting initial leads) brought us to thinking about doing it as a business and we were lucky to have our offers accepted and implemented as a content-marketing project.

The project was focused on delivering usability insights to potential customers and employees via client's blogs and social media profiles. It resulted in 1.5m views leading to actual sales and hires by our client thus giving us a case to approach more tech companies.

**Approach niche sites and journals**

Blogging is good but it's not enough. One of the most important sources of potential clients is located outside of your comfort zone and it's niche sites and journals on tech, startups, media (or whatever) journals.

Reaching out to editors helps you formulate your offer and think about your business from the standpoint of an average reader. Publications or comments on the right topic may drive tens of instant leads that are hooked by your expertise and thus are easier to closing a deal.

We're happy to have good relationships with tons of folks who blog about tech and startups locally and worldwide but it's really cool to discover new spots and publish there.

**Approach your ex-colleagues (and even classmates)**

Sometimes we fail to follow one single career path as we move from one university to another or switch subjects and it's actually not as bag as it looks. Actual working experience and even internships let you connect with industry experts and prove yourself as a responsible employee. It's extremely important to keep it up and stay in touch with your network even on switching jobs.

One of our founders managed to approach his ex-colleagues and this is how we got our second client – one of the major local brokers. They've trusted us with their content and it's been a great journey for about 3 years.

The point is that we didn't approach them with just an idea – we had already gained outstanding results with the UX-shop client and prepared thought through solutions on how to invigorate their content. This one have got over 3m views and thousands of potential clients pouring into their system.

The ex-colleagues model is hard to scale but you can look at it as a continuous networking and building on top of that. Let's talk about that in detail.

**Network wisely (even when you travel)**

Pitching to your customers in person seems to be one of the most effective ways to sell... but how about being average tech guys who haven't yet mastered the game of thrones (apart from actually watching it)? Yep, you have to start somewhere and prior to going places our co-founders looked around a bit.

One started curating StartupDigest Moscow and StartupGenome Russia, the other went on to write for a local tech journal. Thus, we discovered coolest events, places and folks to network with – knowing what's where keeps you from wasting hundreds of hours on pointless lectures and seminars (and commutes). We do our best to meet as many folks as we can when travelling and having established connections prior to hitting the road saves you time and opens doors at your destination.

TechCrunch Moscow 2013 was one of the many gigs we attended and got two clients straight out of the crowd – a local eCommerce-startup and an innovation consultancy group from France. Both companies were great to work with and we had lots of fun creating content for them.

**Get recommendations from your clients (even ex-clients)**

It seems like an obvious move but applied to the initial traction stage it only depends on how lucky you are. There are really low chances that you will have your first client go out and recommend you but you might want to take it into the account when hustling on your initial projects.

Scaling this requires you to be able to provide discounts and additional services to those who recommend and often those who become your next clients. It's really hard to balance out your ""recommendation"" offer and you should really tailor it individually.

One of the main points here is to be aware of your client's needs and be there to provide necessary help. One of our founders hosts weekly shows (podcasts) and interviews local startups, tech and media companies – this helps us in expanding our network and promoting our services in person.

**Host local seminars and discussions**

Public speaking is great for understanding real-world problems and syncing with your potential clients. We enjoy hosting seminars on content-marking as we share our tips on marketing your project with no or minimal budget.

Preparation matters but what's really important is understanding your audience profile in order to be talking to ""your"" people instead of trying to get to folks with no need to buy what you're selling.

And how did you get initial traction (espesially as a B2B company)? Share your experience in comments — I'd like to find out some new ways. "
50tdlv,7,2016-09-02,22Futa4F - Lilith Fairchild: The High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50tdlv/22futa4f_lilith_fairchild_the_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

- *The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?

- ~~*The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.~~ **Temporarily retired due to overexposure.**

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I'm trying something different today: I’ll be playing a bitchy, mean 18 year-old futadomme with more than a few destructive habits.*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.*

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, dubious consent, impregnation (one-night stands only), cumplay, sweat, spanking, facesitting, modification (piercings, tattoos, etc.), humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, ageplay (18+ only), blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), scat and watersports.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon,*

During STEM OPT extension period, under the new policy, is an internship position counted as employment? Or do I have to find an actual position, which is not internship?

   Can I use an internship position to apply to USCIS for STEM OPT extension?

2. What is an actual position, as opposed to an internship position, called? Is it called a longterm position, or something else?

3. Under the extension policy, can a qualified internship position be either full-time or part-time, as long as the work is at least 20 hours/week?

Thanks.

Beginner at IT Career here. I'm Network+, Security+ and Linux+ certified and just received my CCENT 2 weeks ago, but I only have 3 months IT experience at a NOC. It was an internship of sorts and I learned a lot about a large network infrastructure (Class B Network) and how things work on the inside, but they let me go because they wanted someone with more experience.

I'm stuck in the unemployment world again and have been using my free time to work on my resume and study for the ICND2 and receive my CCNA. I'm watching Chris Bryant's CCNA videos on Udemy and have been using GNS3 to emulate a virtual network and get good hands on with Cisco IOS and am fairly confident I'll have my CCNA by mid-September.

My question is, once I get my CCNA, what entry level networking jobs are available that I should apply for with a bunch of certs and only 3 months experience? Will my CCNA give me a ton of leverage for my career? For the record, I have over 7 years experience in customer service related work (mostly serving/waiting tables at restaurants) and I know my soft-skills are good.

My ex GF is a single mom and is still legally married but separated. 

In last week of June She informed me about the pregnancy, I wasn't happy at all as we both still in School and hardly have money to support ourselves. She said that she will do it with or without me, She went to Ohio for a month to her grandmas during this time we hardly spoke. She owed me $1150 in Credit card bills , when I asked her about the money, she broke up with me saying I care only about the money (I honestly would not have cared much about $1000 if I had a full time job), I tried to get back together but she wasn't interested at all. So she burnt bridges with me.She also to me that I shall not be seeing my kid ever.

Now comes the part I am most concerned about. I am not a US Citizen, and have taken $55000 in educational loan to get a degree here in US. Due to nature of my degree its really really hard to find a job in US as a foreign national not impossible but hard. People just to get their foot into the industry work as an unpaid intern for 9-12 months so that they can an entry level job.

 Since she is still married , initially her husband will be on the birth certificate. I understand he can disprove his paternity and that's where I will come into picture.My fear is that I will be on the child support hook life and wont see my kid. Lawyer told me if she isn't willing to cooperate my legal fees may rack up to $6000-$7000 just to get visitation rights. I hardly have money to meet my bills , I don't know how can I afford this legal fees. Right now for me the easy way out looks like going back to my country after graduation, I know its wrong thing to do, I cry my self to bed when I think about it. She on the other hand will show no mercy and go after me for child support.

This is the moral dilemma I am living with right now. Here in Florida if she applies for Govt assistance (She likely will as she too doesn't have any income at all) There are two possible scenarios 

 1) The child support agency comes after me , I am hooked for 18 years. I will be mentally disturbed as she wont allow me to part of kids life, If I don't get work visa (its hit or miss) I will go back home in debt and mentally lost. She doesn't even have to work because of money she will be receiving money from two baby daddies and all the government benefits, while I lose it all supporting my child and family back home (my parents are old).

2) I move out of united state soon after graduation, be a dead beat dad and Look like a worthless piece of shit. Her husband will become legal father of child and he will be hooked on child support.


I know supporting the child is the right thing to do, but I can guarantee this that she wont make things easy for me if I decide to be in my kids life. She will enjoy seeing me struggle and would love to have the last laugh. Right now we haven't talked in weeks at all, I wanted to discuss this thing with her , but, she doesn't even want to see me. I can hardly eat or sleep now a days , I also have been puking a lot due to stress. I would really appreciate any advice, I just feel lost at life. Should I meet her and explain the whole scenario or just move back to my country and never ever speak to her again. 

TL;DR-  Ex GF pregnant, She doesn't want me to be part of this kids life, Should I try to be in kids life or leave?   "

Preferred Combat Style: Commando 

Prewar History: Jack was always a smart and charismatic young man. His schoolwork and social life were packed with oppertunities. During highschool he signed on as an intern of RobCo and helped them develop and test robotic prototypes, he soon graduated and went to college with a scholarship. During his college days he met his soon to be wife, Nora and they dated. During their relationship his department in RobCo was assigned military contracts. Hearing the call of duty, Jack answered it with his sharp wit. After his military duties were finished, he moved to sanctuary hills and had a son by his wife. Then the bombs fell. 

After leaving vault 111, Jack's entire world is destroyed. His successes both financially and scientifically are gone, his wife is dead and son missing. The kind intellectual and flirtatious man was gone, in its place was a cold calculating man who put on a smile when inside he was seething with rage. He was, Handsome Jack. 

Upon entering the wasteland Jack will make all haste towards any leads of Sean he can find. He comes in contact with the Minutemen, and while sympathetic to their plight he has his own problems to deal with. 

While exploring the Commonwealth and heading towards Diamond City, he comes across the Police Station, where he meets Paladin Danse and behold the power of the Brotherhood of Steel. The BOS overwhelms Jack with their military presence, here he thinks, is the best shot at getting Shaun back.  

He continues on to Diamond City only to find the detective, Nick Valentine is missing. Taking Piper, the new newsreporter he had just met, the pair go off to find him, in another Vault. In a daring rescue, Nick and Jack discover it was a mercenary named Kellog who kidnapped Shaun, armed with this knowledge and using Dogmeat, they head towards Kellogs hideout, fighting their way through the synths and finally confronting the mercenary. They gun him down and use his memories to find the Institute. 

After dealing with Kellog, Jack is welcomed aboard the Prynwarden and granted the rank of Knight and his own set of Power Armor. Jack, starts buying into the Brotherhood Code, forming a hatred of synths that goes unmatched and is accepted with his new friends. Clad in Power Armor, Jack takes on the fancy that he is a hero. As a hero it is his duty to save everyone, not just his son. 

Returning to the Minutemen, Jack realizes he can help these people and help himself. He establishes new settlements, and a new militia, and new trading routes, all loyal to him. He discovers Vault 81, and the vast amounts of resources there too, after killing the would be ghoul Overseer.  He turns it into his base of operations. 

He continues to assist the Brotherhood, eventually destroying the Institute. The revelation at the end, shocks Jack, but he soon realizes the son he would have had, is Dead, and the synths are nothing more then dirty impostors who have corrupted him. 

Upon reaching Far Harbor, Jack is disgusted with Acadia and the Children of Atom. Believing the Children to be foolish zealots, he works towards using them at first, but realizes they cant be controlled, so they are destroyed. Once their base is destroyed, he marches with the Brotherhood on Arcadia, killing everyone inside down to the last Synth. Leaving The Island to Far Harbors residences. 

Jack hears the radio signal to Nuka World and goes to investigate. What he finds is one of the things he hates the most, Raiders. Raiders are good for nothing bandits who take and destroy and poison the world. After killing the Overboss and speaking with Gage, he pretends to go along with Gage's plan to ""Lead"" the raiders, only long enough for him to open the door. Once inside, Jack lifts his combat rifle and guns Gage down, staring Open Season on all the Raider leaders. 

Once all of them are killed he leaves Nuka Town in the hands of the slaves and traders, returning to the commonwealth. 

Handsome Jack raises an empire of wealth through trade. Backed by the might of the Minutemen and the Brotherhood, there is none that can stop him. In his mind he has avenged his wife and son. 

He sits on a pile of caps, and laughs.

50vpv8,3,2016-09-02,Never had a serious relationship - [M/22],mrw9416,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/50vpv8/never_had_a_serious_relationship_m22/,"Hi there,

Ok basically I've just got myself into a mess about my current situation and I'm looking for advice on what to do.

First off, although I am always fighting my slight anxiety with girls, I see myself as socially competent and have a had a more than average amount of sexual experience with girls (mainly due to being part of a sports club at uni). I would say that I have always wanted to have a relationship but at the same time, up until recently, not been overly bothered by it, I always felt it would happen at some point. Nothing really happened for me at secondary(high) school apart from somehow losing my virginity in my final year. 

After some attempts at dating in my first year of uni with no luck, I decided just to ignore this and have fun etc meeting girls which led to much more success as I was more relaxed and confident, this made it much easier for me to talk to them if I knew I had a sexual connection first but I still struggled getting dates, but shrugged off each rejection quite easily.

Skip to final (4th) year with in same situation. Then I met one of my new housemate's old housemate (had to move in with others as some had graduated after 3 years with bachelors, as she had, I had vaguely met her a couple of times before but only had short conversation) who I immediately hit it off with, we slept together the next three nights that she was staying down for. I was interested in her and she said that she wanted to see me again which I took with a pinch of salt as no girl who had said that to me before had followed up. However she agreed to come and stay with me and did a few weeks later for a weekend which went really well. 

We continued with similar arrangement for the next couple of months and I felt strong feelings for her, in my mind I would never have gone anywhere near another girl and she was aware and agreed to the same. I was kind of just going with it as I had never been in this situation before but felt really good, I had never felt a connection with someone like I had with her. She then decided that it wasn't right for her and didn't want to continue romantically with me. I honestly had no idea that it would feel so bad and I had never cried over a girl before but this was it. I realised afterwards I was so happy with it and didn't want it to end, I had no idea what I was doing or whether any of my actions were good or bad, and also felt like I could have done more (she hinted I could have put more effort in) but I didn't know what.

I was really upset about it at the time and it really affected my confidence talking to girls. When I was with her girls were actually hitting on me and then afterwards when I tried to rebound as my friends suggested, I tried to talk to girls and they would almost instantly reject me. (I know completely this is a body language thing due to my confidence) Also my grades had been so much better when I was seeing her and I only just scraped through with graduating with what I wanted in the end.

After graduating, I moved home. I managed to become completely depressed at my situation. It felt hopeless, so many worries about the rejections I had had before came to the surface, along with why it had gone wrong and the previous girl (still head over heels for) and how I had managed 4 years at university with only 2 dates, how something must be wrong with me etc. I am living with my parents, I have a full time job (obviously not bad, internship saving to travel) but it is in engineering (my degree), and my main hobbies are sports so I pretty much have no options to meet new girls.

I managed to get myself out of the depression and have been looking at confidence building techniques etc and I am feeling much better about myself (apart from today where I got reminded about all the good things from a relationship that I wanted). Moving forward for the time being, with my current situation I'm not likely to be able to have a proper relationship for another year or so with travelling, move out of home etc however I would like to meet people and I'm not sure how to go about it. 

At university it was so easy, I could walk out of my house onto campus and there were girls that I would like to meet, I would go out 2/3 times a week and there were always girls (still couldn't get dates though!). Now I'm not meeting anyone at all.

I've started going on tinder, so wanted advice about how to go about meeting girls like this. What to say first? Lots of things I see are cheesy chat up lines etc but I'm not really like that, so any advice on openers would be nice. I still go to nightclubs fairly regularly but not as much as before and the girls are completely different than I'm used to, a bit older generally and not really my type. 

So what other ways can I meet women? Is it really acceptable to approach girls in the street or at the supermarket etc without seeming creepy? What are the best ways to ask a girl to go on a date that you've just met? Even if I get a number, what do I say? I guess I've not had much real world experience, and I've also had experience of girls seeming interested but then flaking out so it still seems daunting messaging a girl after ""matching"" with them.

Thank you for anyone who bothers to reading this and gives any advice, I know it's long and probably not particularly bad compared to a lot of people, but I was very depressed about it all and am now trying to move forward. I have heard all the ""you're young"" and the ""love yourself first"" stuff and it does make sense and I truly do enjoy being with myself and I know I shouldn't being searching for happiness in another person. But I feel as if people are happy in a relationship, then I can be unhappy not in one.


TL;DR fairly socially competent, looking for a serious relationship but living with parents and opportunities for meeting girls is limited, just wanted to know women's opinions on tinder, messaging, approaching girls in clubs, on the street, getting dates etc."

Some years back, Washington Post reporters Mark Halperin (currently of Bloomberg News and MSNBC) and John Harris (now editor in chief of Politico) wrote a book about political journalism called “The Way to Win: Clinton, Bush, Rove and How to Take the White House in 2008.” In it, they made a famous admission about how Beltway journalism works in the digital age:

Matt Drudge rules our world … With the exception of the Associated Press, there is no outlet other than the Drudge Report whose dispatches instantly can command the attention and energies of the most established newspapers and television newscasts.

So many media elites check the Drudge Report consistently that a reporter is aware his bosses, his competitors, his sources, his friends on Wall Street, lobbyists, White House officials, congressional aides, cousins, and everyone who is anyone has seen it, too.

Mitt Romney’s former spokesman called Drudge the political media’s assignment editor. And in 2012 on the day after the election, Halperin gave credit in where credit is due in a tweet:

I had assumed that Matt Drudge’s star had faded a bit in the intervening years as fresher, sexier right-wing sites like Breitbart and The Blaze had emerged. But as Politico has reported, Drudge is doing better than ever:

For the first time, The Drudge Report moved into second place on Similar Web’s top U.S. Media Publisher rankings, placing just behind MSN.com with about 1.47 billion page view for the month of July. The Drudge Report’s traffic beat out the likes of news sites from Disney Media Networks (which includes ESPN.com and ABCNews.com), Yahoo, Google, Time Warner and Fox Entertainment Groups.

In an article last month called “The Man Who Could Have Stopped Donald Trump,” Oliver Darcy of Business Insider noted Drudge’s still-dominant role:

Drudge was the top traffic referrer to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and other news outlets in 2015, according to a Vocativ report. The report said the site accounted for a staggering 52 percent of referral traffic to the Associated Press.

All those organizations are very well aware of the potential for clicks from a Drudge link, and they know what kind of stories he wants to flog. The incentives to please him are obvious.

As the last leg of the 2016 campaign approaches, it’s worth remembering Drudge’s original claim to fame:

Web Posted: 01/17/98 23:32:47 PST — NEWSWEEK KILLS STORY ON WHITE HOUSE INTERN

BLOCKBUSTER REPORT: 23-YEAR OLD, FORMER WHITE HOUSE INTERN, SEX RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT

The original post, which went on to name various publications that were allegedly holding the item, put journalists at the center of the story. Needless to say, they were excited. The rest, of course, is history. For years Drudge was fed news items by the media, which would often launder them through the foreign press. Then he would feature links with screaming headlines reporters that editors could use to show that a story was “out there.”

Today such stories are still generated in the British tabloid press, but also in right-wing conspiracy sites and bigger operations like Breitbart News. Recently Drudge managed to disseminate the discredited story of Hillary Clinton’s alleged ill health by posting a picture from a fringe website showing Clinton’s slipping on the stairs some months before with this screaming headline:

2016: HILLARY CONQUERS THE STAIRS

2012: FALLS AT HOME, BLOOD CLOT

2011: FALLS BOARDING PLANE

2009: FALLS GOING TO WHITE HOUSE, BROKEN ELBOW

That story is now part of the election campaign, with people demanding her full medical records and the press watching her every move like a hawk for signs of brain damage.

With the news this week that Clinton’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin had separated from her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, after yet another public humiliation, Drudge used the opportunity to tee up one of the right’s favorite rumors — that Clinton and Abedin are secret lovers. Unsurprisingly, whispers among unenlightened right-wingers about the feminist harpy Clinton’s being a lesbian go back decades. But the Abedin insinuations, which started in 2007, have taken off in this campaign.

Mainstream publications have fed the notion with click-bait stories like this slide show from Politico, which sat at the top of its “most-read” list for months this year, despite its having been originally published back in 2013. As it turned out, Drudge had been up to his old tricks. He had linked to a British tabloid story in which Abedin was quoted as saying that she thought Clinton was beautiful, which sent millions of drooling Drudge readers searching for “Clinton Huma lesbian.”

There’s no way of knowing if mainstream reporters were among those intrigued by Drudge’s dirt. But we do know that The New York Times found this item worthy of a breathless front-page lead:

Among the trove of emails released from Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state was this instruction to a trusted aide who needed to brief her on a matter that could not wait:

“Just knock on the door to the bedroom if it’s closed,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in November 2009 to Huma Abedin, then her deputy chief of staff.

Drudge doesn’t even try to find political relevance to his lewd, juvenile innuendo. But the mainstream media’s reaction to this week’s Weiner-Abedin story was hardly any better. Attempts to make it into a campaign story were downright embarrassing.

Yesterday under the headline “Weiner free!” Drudge insinuated once again that Abedin and Clinton are lovers with a picture allegedly showing the two of them hugging with joy now that they have vanquished one of their husbands. As it turned out, the other woman in the picture wasn’t Abedin. It was Burmese opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, but whatever. He made his point.

We can be sure that Drudge’s nasty little sex rumors aren’t the end of it. The more scurrilous charges that Abedin is a secret Muslim agent are now breaking into the mainstream direct from the fever swamps, via none other than Donald Trump himself. And publications like The Hill and the New York Post, hungry for Drudge links and eager to give the monster what it wants in return, are already pushing it into the mainstream. As long as Matt Drudge is driving the news cycle, it will only get worse.

As a past graduate of Dev Academy (www.devacademy.co.nz) - I just want to openly warn people who're thinking of attending this course to steer well clear of it.

They claim on their website that they have 81% of graduates of jobs within 3 months of graduating, but how are these claims supported by 3rd party checks?  They could claim grads as tutors or not even working in ICT as 'employed' so don't fall for the hyped claims...

The course is way overpriced for what you got - looking back I could have obtained the same information for free or very cheap using online resources like Lynda.com, Team Treehouse, Codeacademy, Code school etc....

Their claim of 'industry partners' is far fetched and don't believe the big name logos on their website - Trade Me, Xero etc... only a couple of EDA grads are working in these big players.

You are given the impression that they will put you forward to these big companies or have some kind of established intern scheme, that's not the case.  Instead you are given a trello board with exhausted leads and a careers channel with sparse jobs posted that everyone and his dog applies for...

You're better off having the discipline to either code alone, or with a friend in the library and attending meetup groups showing a portfolio to impress potential employers, and that's all for free - it just takes time and discipline.

There is no real continual support post graduation, so you're on your own to fend for yourself and create your own networks, sad but true.

Don't bother with these guys, once they have your money their balls are on the line to help you further, so I would apply for a bootcamp elsewhere such as App Academy or Code House, both of which are actually incentivised to get you a job or their revenues would plummit.

Any questions?  Please ask below, I'm wiling to help prevent victims of $11k get scammed"
50wg0w,1,2016-09-02,Possible Switch of Majors within a Department,Cepholapoid,CalPolyPomona,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPolyPomona/comments/50wg0w/possible_switch_of_majors_within_a_department/,"Hi guys, I've got a few questions I was hoping to get answered.
I'm starting my second year as a Chemistry major (Chem Opt), but was considering switching to Biochem option.

First off, anyone with experience in either sub-plan with some insights what to expect? I feel that without any major internships under my belt or insight into the endgame I'm kinda just going with a slightly informed gut feeling, which probably isn't the best idea. Any other tips regarding either sub-plan are also appreciated.

I was also wondering if anyone has any insights into how difficult it is switching within the same department (i.e. from Chemistry (Chem Opt.) to Chemistry (Biochem Opt.) From what I've heard switching majors can be a bit of a nightmare when they are impacted, but haven't seen much info on switching sub-plans.

Lastly, if I where to switch to the biochem option, would it still be possible to get into the pre-professional major program (most likely pre-med) even if I didn't originally apply for it?

Sorry for all the questions, but just wanted to inform myself a bit before going to ask advisors and/or faculty to avoid any embarrassing ""stupid question"" moments."
50wjxn,0,2016-09-02,Advice- pursuing flying after University,i_am_canadian737,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/50wjxn/advice_pursuing_flying_after_university/,"Hey all,

I'm in need of a little bit of insight from you. For locational context, I live in Canada (if you couldn't tell from my username...I really need a new one). It's a bit of a long story so please standby.

I've been an aviation enthusiast my entire life, and from as long a I can remember, being an airline pilot has been my ultimate goal. Through young adolescence I realized that, should I pursue flying as a career, I should have a backup plan in place. So, in foregoing attending a university flight program, I enrolled in engineering school. My initial plan was as follows:

* graduate high school, do PPL summer before University
* work on CPL over the summers away from school 
* graduate with degree and CPL and hopefully most ratings, decide where to go from there.


Of course, life rarely goes as we plan it to. Change is inevitable and things come up. I was unable to finish my PPL as I ran out of time before having to leave for university. I was almost ready for the solo but was unable to apply for my student permit in time. I also still needed some xwind practice. So, I left the city for first year university. I came back the following May, ready to fly. The wind and weather were particularly nasty that month which grounded me until June, which, unfortunately, was at the same time that I found a summer job. Due to scheduling conflicts with my job, some personal issues, and the fact that my instructor left my school, I was only able to do about 4 or 5 hours of refresher flights in the circuit, still no student permit. That summer was a write-off for flying. No problem, I'll finish next summer!

...Well, it's next summer. Or, it was. I've finished 2 years of my degree, and I'm enrolled in a co-op program in which I work in internships with different companies for 4 month terms, adding a year to my degree. I came back this summer again ready to fly. I was finally able to write my radio test, but now my PSTAR is outdated- thus, I still cannot apply for my student permit. I was ready to continue, however, I got my 8-month internship at the last minute part way through June, forcing me to move cities again and put the PPL on hold. This will be the case for the rest of my degree- I'll likely be in a new city every 4 months or so. I can't fly during school due to the workload of my program, and while I may have some time during my work terms, delays and a limited schedule might mean I won't finish before having to move again. As well, I really need flying to be my sole focus in order to finish it. 

So, I guess what I plan to do now is try to somehow fit in my PPL somewhere; if not, I'll have to do it after I graduate. I'll be 22 by the time that happens. If I can finish my PPL before graduation, I plan to go into a 2-year commercial program at a university close to home for my CPL. In all likelihood, I'll need to take a year off to finish the PPL and then enroll in the CPL program the following year. That puts me at 25 by the time I have my CPL, ratings, diploma, and engineering degree, barring no more setbacks. 

I guess what I'm contemplating is the impact of being slightly behind might be. The co-op program I'm in is great and will put me ahead- but not in the career I really want. I will try my hardest to fit the PPL in somewhere, but I've already had it fragmented far too much, which has increased the costs a lot. 


I guess my main question is, and I'll make this a **TL;DR:**
*Does it make sense to put off flying right now to focus on my unrelated degree?*

Thanks, blue skies"

I wasn't super optimistic about life but the negative thoughts weren't so bad. I actually got back into a hobby of mine. Unfortunately, that only lasted about 3 weeks.  I got home after the first day at a new internship and I had a full relapse.  I'm just so horrifically lonely. My therapist says I just have to wait but I've been waiting about 10 years. I have social anxiety but I can be funny and personable. It takes me so long to get comfortable with someone. My therapist probably hates me. She asked if I was using the social isolation thing as a way to slip back into depression. Why do therapists always think you want to be depressed? My lack of meaningful human contact is kind of a big problem. Everywhere I see people out having fun with people that care about them. About what they think and how they feel.  If it wasn't for the fact that I have a few decent friends from where I used to live I'd get rid of Facebook. I'm just so full of jealousy and sadness. I hate everything about myself and there's really not much I'm happy about in life. Yeah I went back to school but what does it matter if I have nobody to talk to about it. Nobody to go out with. I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that I'll be alone for the vast majority of my life. When I think about waiting longer I feel a stab of hopelessness so terrifying that if I had a gun in my hand I'd stick it in my mouth and pull the trigger right there. So here I am, in my room all alone with nothing to do and nobody to see.  I think of what I would say to everyone before I kill myself. I'm not very angry at the world. I just think you have to play the hand your dealt and I just don't have the right cards to make it in this world. It's around the time of year of my two hospitalizations for suicide attempts.  I don't have the motivation to try but I think about it every minute.  If I get there then that's fine with me. I want to just post on Facebook how fucking lonely i am, but you can't do that. Some people will say some kind words and everyone will see how pitiful and broken I am. I have no energy. I don't feel like playing video games or watching a movie.  I just want someone to care about me and want to be in my company. All I can do is just hold tight and hope I feel better. Ok that was rambling, sorry. Anyway I hope everyone is at least doing better than me. "
50x3v2,25,2016-09-02,"24 year old graduating from college in December, looking for guidance on loan repayment prior to graduation",Alonewarrior,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/50x3v2/24_year_old_graduating_from_college_in_december/,"So, I'm working on finally finishing up my degree in Computer Science. I'm in the United States. I have an internship that started a week ago and will continue to run through the 22nd of February, earning $20 an hour with a cap of 40 hours a week, although I'm only pushing 20-25 for now until I'm settled into the job and my last 2 college classes. I also work 12-15 hours a week at a movie theatre where I'm making $9.75 an hour. I should also mention that I live at home with my parents and will be with them until the start of next summer when I plan to move out and live on my own again (after having done it before and running out of money due to poor spending habits).

After college completion I'll have just over $40,000 in federal financial aid loan debt. I also have a car loan of about $4,500 that I'll have paid off in two years, and make payments of $203.30 every month and its interest is around 6%. I have a private loan for $5,500 that has accrued $2,200 in interest with an interest rate of 9.94%. Lastly, I have a small private loan that has roughly $850 left with a 3.5% variable interest rate; this loan requires payment on interest every 3 months and I've been paying well over that to slowly bring it down.

Financially, I have $5,000 in the bank that I received back from federal loans over the years. I've used that money to pay for books for school or other classes during the summer. I have around $2,000 in savings as fallback money, and I have $600ish in checking to hold onto for card payments, insurance, and all that other stuff. From financial aid this semester, I'm getting $1,200 sent to my account that was an excess from grant money—none of it is loan money.

My plans from this information was that I would use the $5,000 of loan money to dump into my larger private loan to get rid of the interest and put a significant dent into the principal, and then use the $1,200 in grant money to further reduce it to around $1,400. From there maybe keep making large payments for the next month and a half, assuming $700 per paycheck from my internship (other job wouldn't contribute to this at all, and only $400 per paycheck from the internship would be put towards the loan). This way it would be paid off and no longer accruing debt.

My next goal would be to shift my resources more towards increasing my monthly payments on my car to roughly double what I'm currently making in the hopes of having it that much closer to being paid off by the time I graduate and hopefully complete it before I need to start repaying my student loans.

My last goal before having to start repaying student loans would be to pay off the $850 loan I have out since it has the smallest interest rate.

I'm hoping that by posting this plan I can get some pointers on what can be improved upon and whether some of my ideas are problematic or if they're roughly where they should be.

Thanks in advance!"

I will start this off by telling you a little bit about myself for the sake of context. 

I am a 23 year old recent university graduate. Over the course of my degree I had one goal or purpose and that was to land the “perfect” high paying internship or job. I know right a shocker! I applied to countless jobs that I did not necessarily like because hey I needed the exposure and I definitely needed the money.
  
Over my 4 years in university I was introduced to local school startup clubs and incubators. I was instantly attracted to the startup culture. It portrayed a lifestyle and work ethic that valued passion and flexibility. Where creativity was the native currency. With university coming to an end and the real world alluring in front of me I had a choice to make. Look for another 9 to 5 job that I know I would not like or take a chance on myself.
 
Therefore I decided to make a change I embarked on a journey to help people just like myself find the right fit or calling if you will. I wanted people to really dive into what they were interested in and take a chance on themselves. I decided to build a platform for entrepreneurs particularly startup enthusiasts.  An online community that provided a platform for individuals to share ideas, receive feedback, build teams and most importantly interact with like-minded individuals.

Anyway I don’t want to make this post too long and neither is it my intention to gain sleazy exposure. I truly believe this website can be beneficial our startup community.

Their claim of 'industry partners' is far fetched and don't believe the big name logos on their website - Trade Me, Xero etc... only a couple of EDA grads are working in these big players.

You are given the impression that they will put you forward to these big companies or have some kind of established intern scheme, that's not the case. Instead you are given a trello board with exhausted leads and a careers channel with sparse jobs posted that everyone and his dog applies for...

You're better off having the discipline to either code alone, or with a friend in the library and attending meetup groups showing a portfolio to impress potential employers, and that's all for free - it just takes time and discipline.

There is no real continual support post graduation, so you're on your own to fend for yourself and create your own networks, sad but true.

Don't bother with these guys, once they have your money their balls aren't on the line to help you further, so I would apply for a bootcamp elsewhere such as App Academy or Code House, both of which are actually incentivised to get you a job or their revenues would plummit.

I will start this off by telling you a little bit about myself for the sake of context.

I am a 23 year old recent university graduate. Over the course of my degree I had one goal or purpose and that was to land the “perfect” high paying internship or job. I know right a shocker! I applied to countless jobs that I did not necessarily like because hey I needed the exposure and I definitely needed the money.

Over my 4 years in university I was introduced to local school startup clubs and incubators. I was instantly attracted to the startup culture. It portrayed a lifestyle and work ethic that valued passion and flexibility. Where creativity was the native currency. With university coming to an end and the real world alluring in front of me I had a choice to make. Look for another 9 to 5 job that I know I would not like or take a chance on myself.

Therefore I decided to make a change I embarked on a journey to help people just like myself find the right fit or calling if you will. I wanted people to really dive into what they were interested in and take a chance on themselves. I decided to build a platform for entrepreneurs particularly startup enthusiasts. An online community that provided a platform for individuals to share ideas, receive feedback, build teams and most importantly interact with like-minded individuals.

Anyway I don’t want to make this post too long and neither is it my intention to gain sleazy exposure. I truly believe this website can be beneficial our startup community.

50yors,12,2016-09-03,22Futa4F - Lilith Fairchild: The High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50yors/22futa4f_lilith_fairchild_the_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

- *The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?

- ~~*The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.~~ **Temporarily retired due to overexposure.**

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

50zkls,1,2016-09-03,Can hear my former gf[F20] having sex from my[M21] room.,HydroMattress,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50zkls/can_hear_my_former_gff20_having_sex_from_mym21/,"Hi guys. Last Wednesday was one of the worst days in my life, and I don't really have anyone who I can talk it over with. 

Backstory: My former girlfriend [F20] and I[M21] started dating my junior year of high school. She was my first serious girlfriend and I shared many great moments with her. We both decided to attend the same college which allowed us to continue our relationship after graduation. Freshmen year of college was tough to adjust to, but with her around it made it easier. By this time we had been dating around a year and a half; this is when we lost our virginity to each other. Sophomore year took a hit on us, and by the end of the year we broke up. She was the one who wanted to opt out of the relationship, saying that I didn't pay enough time to her and that we were not happy with each other anymore. I accept that I was really busy at the time (mainly due to finals and family issues) but I did try to my hardest to make time for her. After all, by that time I had really fallen for her.

We broke up, since she didn't want work through it. I thought the situation sucked but I had a feeling we would get back together. Fast forward three months, to the start of a new school year,  

Present: My junior year of college started two weeks ago, and I was in a great state of mind to be successful. I was looking to do great in my classes and hopefully get an internship this upcoming summer. By this time my former girlfriend and I had been broken up for 3 months. I was half-assing getting over her as I thought that there was a chance we could get back together. On Wednesday, my roommate informed me that she lives next to us, something that I thought was normal. He also told me that she had a boyfriend, as he had seen her and some other guy walking out of her place together. That hit me hard, knowing that she moved on from a 3 year relationship in 3 months. I needed an outlet so I ran until my legs gave out. I came back home, showered, and turned on netflix. I was about ready to go to sleep when the most terrifying thing happened. I hear a bed squeak. Repeatedly. Faster and faster. My heart started going out of control. I had a mental picture of them together, she being intimate with another guy, someone who is not me. They finished and I couldn't control my heart rate. I needed to know if it was really her, that was the only thing that I thought could calm me down, the small chance that it was not her. I go out of my apartment and sit on the ground, waiting for them to come out. And sure enough it was her, with her best friend from highschool. As soon as I saw them I rushed back to my room, laid on the floor, and started breathing frantically. I think I suffered a small panic attack. I had to take long breaths to force my heart rate to decrease. Needless to say, I did not sleep that night. 

The next day was a continuation of the last. School was horrible and I didn't have the comfort of going back home to a safe place. As soon as I heard them having sex I realized that I didn't want anything to do with her. From one moment to the next I was over her. And I am really happy about that. However, I am sharing a wall with them, and that is my own little hell. I cannot live the next year where I am at. It has been 2 days and I am going crazy. My motivation is nowhere to be found, my confidence was demolished, and my mental health is taking a toll. 

I have talked to the apartment complex about moving me to another building, but they say the earliest that can happen is next week, if at all possible. I don't go in my room anymore, I have laid on the couch in the living room for the past 2 nights, not getting much sleep either. Every time I see her car parked outside, I automatically picture her with the other guy. 

I am lost. I don't know what to do or how to get those images and noises out of my head. 

Thank you for reading if you made it to this point. Can anyone relate to this story, and let me know what is the best thing I can do to get back to being the person that I was?

I'm graduate student in the field of AI. And I'll be an exchange student in the upcoming year, so I'd like to buy a new laptop. It will be mainly used for my master thesis which will be on deep learning and computer vision (not sure exactly what yet). I'll probably do some [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions and contributions to some open source projects (including non-AI) as well. Apart from that I do some gaming from time to time and plan to buy Oculus as I have some discounts for it.

I'm looking for the following in a laptop:

 * performance
 * build quality
 * battery life
 * reasonable price

The [Lenovo P50](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/p-series/p50/) seems like a good option. However, I'm not up to date with the new hardware trends. I'd love to hear your opinion about the laptop and the following questions: How does the Xeon processor perform on a laptop? Should I get it or stick with an i7? Do I need an ECC memory?

I'm currently on an internship in the US and I have some really nice discounts for Lenovo. The P50 with 4K display, Xeon, 64 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD is around $2k.

So what do you guys think about the laptop and specs? Suggestions for other laptops than Lenovo are welcomed if the price is reasonable (up to $3k).

510645,33,2016-09-03,The Sketchy Update,sketchyfitzgerald,cripplingalcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/510645/the_sketchy_update/,"Greetings everyone (Ricky Cs and Lurkers, this even includes you)

I have been kinda off the charts for a while. Well recently I havent been depressed. I utilized counseling and well, I had great success. I am much more in tune with my emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. 

Along with this, my drinking has significantly reduced. A year ago I was whimpering off the side of my bed throwing up blood, crying, and still continuing to pull of a room temp plastic handle of whiskey (I still get PMs about that thread and the last one was only a month or two ago). Today, I woke up with no hangover, was able to socialize with my friend and play 2 rounds of disc golf before I go into work. It feels amazing. 

If I am to drink I count my drinks now, and find a reason why I need to be sober be a certain time the next day to prevent binges/benders. I have been drinking more craft beer, and wine. Typically will settle around a 6-8 drink limit (unless certain occasions) and its typically with other people. I have stayed away from hard alcohol for the most part (suppose I should update my flair). We all know how well I am at flying off the rails.

The worst part about not being depressed anymore, was that I lost my artistic talents (or whatever little I possessed). My song writing and poetry came to a screeching halt. I had nothing to write about, because I only knew how to write the blues and sad sad country ish songs. I know this is common with artists that they arent able to fully express themselves if they change their baseline state of emotion. The last time I recorded a song was back in May but that was written back in about Feb.

My main fear is how the winter will impact me. But Ill deal with that until it comes, and enjoy where I am at currently.

I just landed an internship to complete my graduate degree. Which still feels very surreal. My last semester of classes this summer, I had a 4.0 

Things are going well. I still frequent CA as my main sub. I love you all. It just seems to be that when things are going this well, ""the big crash"" is about to happen and shit hits the fan. Ive had shit luck all of my life it appears to be. Maybe this is my break finally. I know its a cognitive distortion to worry about that. But fuck it, I am going to enjoy where I am at currently. 

Well thought since I was overdue for an update of why I have seemed to somewhat dissapear, [here](https://sketchyfitzgerald.bandcamp.com/track/wishin-for-much-more) is a link to my first ""happy"" song. Compared to my romance with self-destructive and addictive themes to my songs before, this one almost sounds like glitter and rainbows. I was able to still express myself through music, even though the content has changed. 

Thanks everyone,
Cheers and stay drunk"

When he started working at my store, he was a regular associate like I am. As i started working with him and getting to know him the first few weeks, I started to like him, and im not sure if he liked me but he would tell me i was hot, and he always did things for me and would rub my shoulders alot and get all touchy. 

I was afraid he just wanted to get in my pants, so i kept acting like i didnt notice what he did. Months later, he started seeing someone. i tried moving on, especially after he got promoted to supervisor, but i haven't been able to. When he got into that relationship, i started to avoid him but he would always try to hug me and ask me what was wrong. he would go as far as calling my best friend (who works there as well) to ask why i was mad him. 

Our relationship at work is strange. He still asks around when im mad at him. I've never had anyone care so much. we argue alot at work but we get along well. sometimes, if im on break, he comes in and sits with me and we just talk. we've actually gotten alot closer these last few months. A few weeks ago, he did something at work that really made me and another coworker upset, so i stopped talking to him. the other girl is upset as well, but with me, he is trying so hard to make it up to me. he keeps trying to talk to me and he is letting me do what i want, and he keeps asking my friends about me. and he is not doing anything like that with the other girl. anytime he does something for me, he tells me he did it for me because he loves me. im not sure how he means it.

i know i should not get involved. i already know. he has a girlfriend. he's my supervisor. dont get involved with people at work. i know. but this job isnt my life. im only there during college. im planning to switch stores eventually, or leave once i graduate or get an internship which i am still working on.  i'm just alittle confused with his actions. 

i would think he is just being a good boss who cares about his employees but he isnt this caring with anyone else. he doesnt care if everyone else gets mad at him. should i just tell him how i feel? or should i keep attempting to move on?


tldr; ive liked a guy at work for about 2 years. he eventually became my boss. he is always touchy feely with me, and tries to please me and make me happy but he wont do that with everyone. im trying to let it go but i haven't been able to. i dont know if i should just tell him how i feel. "
511fr5,3,2016-09-03,"Accepted B4 Audit offer, applying to other service lines at other firms?",AccountantwithaQ,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/511fr5/accepted_b4_audit_offer_applying_to_other_service/,"Hey guys, so I've tried searching but never quite saw something exactly like this.


So I did a busy season internship at a B4 in audit and got a return offer to do another internship this upcoming busy season (after which I hopefully would get an offer for FT). I have already accepted the return offer a couple months back.


However I'm interested in eventually moving into TAS and I have this fall recruiting cycle coming up and I've noticed a couple firms are hiring interns for that service line and while I know it's difficult to get these positions without doing a couple years in audit first I figured I would like to at least throw in an app because you never know. 


So really my only worry is that the recruiters of other B4 firms talk among each other and somehow word that I'm looking for other opportunities reaches my current B4 firm and they pull my offer and I'm left unemployed. I wasn't feeling optimistic enough after my first internship to decline the return offer and just go all in for advisory so if I did somehow get a position I would be reneging on my audit offer (which tbh I am ok with, as has been pointed out many times on this sub we need to do what's best for us). I just don't want to end up offerless somehow, as I really still do have a lot to learn in audit and don't mind going back. 


Anyone have any advice what to do in this situation? Should I throw caution to the wind and apply and hope for the best or should I not apply at all in fear of losing my current offer? And if I do get an interview, should I just be honest and say I did receive a return offer and I accepted it but I feel like TAS aligns more with my interests?  "
511g5g,2,2016-09-03,"Me [24 F] with my boyfriend [24 M] 4 years, I am in school, he is not...I feel left out that he has the time to go out with our friends and I don't",x_spectrum,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/511g5g/me_24_f_with_my_boyfriend_24_m_4_years_i_am_in/,"My boyfriend and I used to always go out together when we first met and have developed a close relationship with the same set of friends. Anyway, when we met I didn't really have a plan for my future so I went out with him all the time and we always had a blast! 

A few years passed and we grew up and realized we basically needed to get our shit together and couldn't be party animals forever. 

In a nutshell, the career I became passionate about requires a doctorate degree. So the past few semesters I have been working my butt off on science pre-reqs (trying to catch up), been doing internships, working in a clinic, and now I'm doing applications and studying for the Graduate Record Exam.

Anyway, I feel like this is a really big part of my life!!! I'm really busy, especially this past month and it's SO hard being with someone who is not taking school as seriously or going through the same thing. He's more concerned with working full-time to make ends meet than school (which is understandable). 

However, it's a problem because inside, I'm still that fun girl that wants to go out and drink with our friends and have a lot of fun! I know I'm about to take this huge important exam but instead of studying hard I'm at home jealous that he's been going out with our friends (especially today, they ALL went out today to play some drinking games) while I have had to be shackled at home working on my graduate school apps and preparing for this exam. He's all out having the time of his life and I'm just suffering at home.

How can I talk myself out of this? I'm trying to build myself a good future but I am constantly jealous my other half gets to go out and have fun while I have to be the lame one who misses out on everything...
p.s. he's an amazing boyfriend and supportive of my dreams, i really have no complaints with how he treats me but this situation in general just sucks  
  ---   
  tl;dr I'm full time student, working, and applying to grad schools-can't go out. Boyfriend is working full-time and taking 1 class so he has time to go out and have fun with our friends while I stay home shackled to my responsibilities. Would you guys be jealous too or am I just being a selfish b*tch? It's alright if you think so...I just need to know. Also, how to cope!"

I will reveal today ...

  
in the afternoon.

  
In the presence
Baby Brent himself.

  
How's everyone?

  
Baby Brent!
- What are you doing?

  
Cans piling up with me?

  
Who's with me
to the unveiling of the mayor?

  
With the help of these guys
I will save the city.

  
Well guys, Sardines!

  
Swallow Falls forever.

  
What a fun.
Do you want to that revelation?

  
You go ahead.
I watch it on the matter.

  
Really? Are you sure you handle it?

  
Yes, Dad, sure. That's okay.

  
Well then. I am about half hour back.

  
This hole is too small for me, Brent.

  
I want great. I want people
look at me and say ...

  
""That's a great mayor.""
And why should this work.

  
It should work.

  
Otherwise I'm just a little mayor
of a small town ...

  
from tiny sardines to
hungry idiots.

  
I do not?
- Not you, Brent. You're like a son.

  
Hello all.

  
Under this canvas is the largest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.

  
We have only 17,000 kilojoules
need.

  
Go!

  
What are you, Flint Lockwood?

  
I just keep my hands behind my back.

  
Know what you are, Flint Lockwood?
An impostor.

  
Kung Fu.

  
Have you seen my beautiful son? Cal?

  
I love him so much.
It is my only son.

  
I want him a good future.
A future where you do not ruin our city.

  
With one of your crazy inventions.
- That's all behind us.

  
See you this contact?

  
This contact represents you.

  
And my eye represents my eye.

  
I have my eye on you.

  
My God, a careless pedestrian.

  
And I have arranged live report
of a large network ...

  
and most experienced
professional reporter.

  
That is cute intern,
and she is very bright.

  
We are also looking,
to someone who brings back to television.

  
Trainee, you would report
to do it again ...

  
of a small island in the middle
of the ocean as a favor to my cousin?

  
Can you believe it, Manny?

  
Temporary, professional meteorologists.

  
What do you here?

  
Hello America, I am Sam Sparks.

  
Hello America here Sam Sparks.

  
Hello America, I saw you not.
I, Sam Sparks.

  
Way.

  
This is a great idea.

  
The news happens again,
or not.

  
About to Swallow Falls, where
Our intern's first day starts.

  
Or should I say first gray days.
looks pretty foggy out, intern.

  
Hi I'm Sam Sparks America.

  
It is all the fault of ...
Or let's go over to the mayor.

  
Thank you, and welcome public
national television.

  
Here comes the one who
the ceremonial ribbon is cut ...

  
the favorite son of Swallow Falls,
Baby Brent.

  
I am the best in town.

  
This is strange. There is something going on.

  
The attraction that the whole world
to the waiting ...

  
Sardine Land!

  
I have the copy of
the world's largest sardine.

  
And his glorious flame.

  
 Cheese Burger. 

  
A moment.
I'm doing ...

  
It seems like sardines Swallow Falls
needs for the better.

  
No.

  
You are arrested, Flint Lockwood.

  
Luckily you Sardine Country
not very damaged.

  
I'm sorry.

  
I'm sorry. Is everything okay?
I did not ...

  
Not bad, but it is pain.

  
I'm not myself today.

  
My career was ruined by
an idiot in a homemade rocket Sat

  
Hold on. What about your feet?

  
""Spray on shoes. They will not come off.

  
Cool. This may loose shoelace
epidemic problems.

  
Where are they made.
An elastic material.

  
Yeah, exactly.

  
I mean, they are shiny.
I am Sam.

  
Is that a monkey thought translator?

  
Unbelievable. Will you make this?

  
You've hit me with that rocket.
- You have kicked me in my face.

  
I told you that I am sorry.

  
You only get one chance, and
if you do not save ...

  
you again have to do cleaning.

  
That can only mean ...

  
This really works.

  
Your machine?
Was that rocket of yours?

  
Do you love it?

  
Delicious! It's great!

  
This is the biggest weather phenomenon
in history.

  
You do not weather?

  
Our trainee humiliated again
is apparently back.

  
Thanks, Patrick.
That you will not believe ...

  
but I am heart
a hamburger rain.

  
Perhaps you have seen a meteor shower,
but such meteors've never seen.

  
The city does not eat more sardines,
This is absolutely wonderful.

  
This will be great.

  
This is actually food  again
invented by Flint Lockwood. 

  
Flint Lockwood?

  
You are arrested for destroying
Land of Sardine.

  
Those burgers were great.

  
The director called, and he said,
""everyone thought that great food again.

  
""Food Show"". This increases
Country or Sardine.

  
Can you please again
eat make it rain?

  
I really do not know if I ...
- Do you back?

  
You take me a fool?

  
Please?

  
Yes!
- No.

  
Give me a chance.
- We both know that it was accidental.

  
I know.
- Cheese Burgers from the sky ...

  
that is not natural.
- My invention can save the entire city.

  
You are so proud of me, Dad.

  
And ...
A career.

  
Can you look into my eyes and tell me
you have this under control?

  
And not that it ends in a disaster?

  
Yes.

  
I have it under control,
it does not end in a disaster.

  
Well.
- Thanks, Dad.

  
Of course.
- Good. So Sam ...

  
Here the magic happens.

  
 Home, Flint. 

  
You take really much time alone.

  
How it works.
Water goes in the top ...

  
and food is coming from the bottom.

  
So if you are in the stratosphere,
change the molecules ...

  
the cumulonimbus layer.
- This is a clever observation.

  
I mean, the clouds contain
probably water.

  
I think you therefore
appeared there.

  
Why did I do that.
- Exactly.

  
The machine uses the principle
of hydro kinetic mutation.

  
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation ...

  
that mutates the genetic recipe
in any food you want.

  
Pizza is?
- Yes!

  
Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

  
Peas? Cake? Apples? Apple Sauce?
- Yes.

  
A sandwich with bacon, lettuce and tomato?
- I am pretty sure every kind of food.

  
Kipvleugels?
- Think about what you want to say ...

  
if the food is, it can.
- Bullshit.

  
Nonsense is no food.
- Gelatin then!

  
Do you enjoy gelatin?
- Delicious.

  
I agree, wonderful.
And then peanut butter?

  
No, I am very allergic to peanuts.

  
Me too.
- What is it?

  
Peanut allergy.
- No, the machine.

  
Of course. It is called the Flint Lockwood
diatonic super mutant ...

  
etensvermenigvuldiger dynamic "".

  
Or for short 'the FLDSMDFR.

  
FLDSMDFR.

  
FLDSMDFR.

  
Manny, make sure you record it.
He is now making the food.

  
Now?

  
I can not.

  
I did this hilarious internet
video show.

  
Impressions, build, connect.

  
Paints, run.

  
Staring, motivate.
Place.

  
I can not believe I
all three hours sitting watching.

  
I know.

  
It works.

  
What do you want for breakfast?

  
Gummi Bears.
- No, we know how you are with Gummi Bears.

  
Eggs then?

  
Toast?
- Orange juice.

  
Bacon!

  
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

  
To the computer!

  
Input code  eat.
Menu: (Bacon), crisp. 

  
 eggs. 
- Are you sure this is safe?

  
Do not worry. I have a meter that hazard
let us know when dinner is overgemuteerd.

  
What happens if it mutates to eat?

  
That will never happen.

  
Now it will explode.

  
Keep your distance.

  
Those cheeseburgers were only the beginning, because
a breakfast area go to Swallow Falls.

  
My prediction: ""fried eggs"".

  
Flint my boy, can you do?

  
We do so, you let it
snacks but still raining ...

  
weather girl doing free advertising ...

  
I have a loan with high interest
concluded ...

  
this miserable town
""a tourist voedseltopia"" change.

  
You should only eat to rain,
three meals per day ...

  
every day in the foreseeable future.
And in thirty days.

  
We reopen the island on
a fantastic way ...

  
as a destination that you must have seen.

  
Then everybody, everywhere,
adore your invention.

  
Do you?
- I know.

  
Poultry in motion.

  
Mr. Lockwood, there are waffles?

  
A waffle. - Jelly Beans.
- Avocado.

  
Coming.

  
Leftovers? No problem,
with the latest invention of Flint Lockwood ...

  
from the zichter. Thereby bringing it
the uneaten food out of sight.

  
And you thought it out.

  
Flintlock Woods napkins

  
Great!

  
A pizza in a turkey is stopped
All frozen and dipped in chocolate.

  
I am the mayor.

  
You look different. Another hairstyle?
- Yes, that's right.

  
Thank you remember.

  
Dad, I'm going back to the laboratory.

  
I can show you how I make dinner.

  
No thanks. This techno eat ...

  
is too complicated for an old fisherman.

  
I got it.

  
I can still use your help here.

  
I now work with the mayor.

  
The reopening of the city
is about one weeks.

  
Exactly. I got it.

  
Flint Lockwood?
- Yes.

  
Tomorrow is my birthday son Cal.

  
Can you not
something special to rain?

  
I'm quite full of requests.
And you were always mean to me.

  
For just once.
For my special angel.

  
A special day.
- I do not know.

  
I want the machine
too much work, so ...

  
I knew I would make little chance.

  
I just wanted to show Cal
how his father loves him.

  
I thought you would understand.

  
You always know how their father's love and
appreciation to their sons want to show.

  
Earl, wait.

  
I have an idea.

  
Congratulations son.
- Dad?

  
This is your day.
Go have fun.

  
I love you. You are crazy.
- I love you, boy.

  
Ice!

  
Frozen strawberries river.

  
Come on, Dad.
- I do not know, Cal. It does not ...

  
I love you boy.
- I know, Dad.

  
You say that every day.

  
Flint, this is crazy.

  
For ice design, which looks like,
I do not know how you did.

  
Perhaps with hot caramel?

  
Flint, meaning in a snowball fight?

  
What is the problem?

  
I've never thrown snowballs.
- Really?

  
I know the rules.
Is there a way now, or ...

  
to death.
- No.

  
You never ...
Even Steve throws chocolate snowballs.

  
So?

  
No, throw harder.

  
Snowball!

  
Snowball!

  
Well, I can not say
on your enthusiasm.

  
Snowball!

  
Snowball!

  
Snowball and snowball!

  
What is going on.
- Snowball!

  
Snowball.

  
 I scream, you cry,
We all scream for ...

  
 Flint's latest delicacy. 

  
 We freeze and have fun
if the mayor declares that ...

  
 it is a holiday ice cream. 

  
 He wants to invite everyone in the world,
a cruise-liner to take ...

  
 Saturday to qualify for the grand opening
Chewandswallow of ...

  
 a town that really
in fashion. 

  
 A town that is truly full of ice. 

  
 This is the news today on WNN.
I am Sam Sparks. 

  
Flint, this is the best present ever.

  
I got it. Investigations,
role.

  
Rotate.

  
Wait.

  
Sam Sparks.
- End.

  
Regret. Think about it.
See what I do?

  
Flint?
- Hey Sam, how are you? That's nice.

  
I was wondering if you with me ...

  
morning with something I wanted to do?

  
Well.
- Great, bye, meet me in the woods.

  
Got it.
I have to go Steve!

  
Keep the lab to watch for me!

  
Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

  
I thought it was fun
to piece together a run.

  
Like friends do.

  
Look, what's that?

  
Jelly is my favorite.

  
You never made a request, so ...

  
I have one for you.

  
Join us.

  
How did you ...

  
I made some jelly
middle of the night ...

  
and when I awoke
I brought it here and ...

  
and pressed it into a giant mold
I had made.

  
Nothing special.

  
Everything is made of jelly.

  
These piano. These hanging lamps.
That Ghetto Blaster, which jelly.

  
The aquarium.
The Minus D'Milo-with-no-face statue.

  
And David the conqueror as you see.

  
Come on, Sam, what are you waiting for?

  
Nowhere on!

  
Cannon Ball!

  
Jelly-stroke.

  
I know I should not do.

  
So, so jelly.
- Yeah, right.

  
It is fixed, it is liquid.
It is transparent and you can eat!

  
I mean, it's good.

  
Why are you doing?
- What?

  
Most clever thing to say and then
see from there?

  
Can you keep a secret?
- No.

  
But this time.

  
It is a long time ago but
I was also ...

  
a nerd.
- It?

  
When I was a little girl ...

  
I wore a ponytail, glasses ...

  
and I was completely obsessed
the science of weather.

  
Other girls wanted a Barbie,
I wanted a weather radar Doccler Turbo 2000.

  
Robert Child Rick taught me a weird song,
which was not even clever.

  
Eyed, squinting,
you have a need glasses to see!

  
Go ahead.

  
So I got a new look,
gave science doing it ...

  
and there was never laughed at me.

  
And I still need those glasses, but
I never wear it.

  
I bet you look good
with glasses.

  
And up it.

  
What?
- Nothing.

  
Wait!

  
It is a jelly-clamp.

  
And now, the unveiling.

  
I mean, you looked good before,
but now ...

  
you are beautiful.
- No, I mean ...

  
so I can not come in public.

  
Why not?
I mean, this is you really! Right?

  
Smart. Respect Abel.

  
Who would not want that look.
- You know ...

  
I've never
as you met Flint Lockwood.

  
Me neither.
How about you?

  
Flint, you phone.

  
Is your phone?
- That's odd?

  
Someone must have turned my number.
- Flint!

  
It is the mayor.
Do you mind if I answer him?

  
No, go ahead.
- I'm so sorry, I must ..

  
It is really important.
I step outside.

  
Dad, you've come.
I must tell you so much.

  
Do I look good?
- You look great! Come on.

  
I would stand in the list.
- Hi, Brian.

  
What?
You let the guy inside?

  
That guy is a Nerd!

  
Thank you.

  
At Flint and his delicious steak!

  
Thanks though.
- Very nice case.

  
Flint Lockwood!

  
No roof?
- Yes.

  
Just love on your plate. I even let
your favorite foods rain. Meat.

  
You know that tomorrow is the big opening
of the town?

  
The mayor has asked me
at the ribbon cutting.

  
He says that my invention has the city
saved. Are not you proud of me?

  
Flint, seems you do not steak
a little too big?

  
Yes, it is a great steak and not
each steak was exactly the same.

  
Did you not hear what I just said?

  
I'm not this good
for humans.

  
You may need this thing off.
- It makes everybody happy.

  
Everyone except you.

  
If you accept now that I'm like?

  
Instead of trying to me
a tackle shop to get boring?

  
You obviously know what you're doing.

  
Then I will not stand in the way.

  
You can do him no favors.

  
He is everything I do spoil.

  
These are great hot dogs.

  
This is not so bad?
Or it may, Steve?

  
Yellow.
- You're right, Steve.

  
The danger meter is in yellow.

  
I do not know what to do.
- I do.

  
This delicious hot dogs as explained!
- Oh no!

  
How did you get in?
- Tomorrow is the big day Flint.

  
The fate of the city
is in your food again.

  
I think to post up.

  
Just sign here.
I do not know you in the lurch.

  
Mr. Mayor, I think
You should see something. - What?

  
This is the molecular structure of
the hotdog who last week cases.

  
And this is the structure
of a hotdog, today cases.

  
The machine uses radiation to micro
the particles of food to mutate.

  
The more we ask to make
more clouds he used ...

  
the more radiation there is,
the more the molecules-to mutate.

  
And therefore the food growing.

  
This I have heard,
science, higher.

  
And bigger is better. Everyone is crazy
the size of these portions.

  
I certainly would.

  
My dad thinks I should put him out.
- Geniuses like us ...

  
fathers are never understood, Flint.
- As things now ...

  
Who has the approval
need of a family ...

  
if your approval
millions of people have?

  
And not to forget, that cute girl
one of Sam Sparks.

  
And me.
I've always seen my own son.

  
I will be so proud of you tomorrow.
And you cut ribbon ...

  
and saves the city and proves to everyone
what a great inventor you are.

  
So here is the opportunity.

  
You can let go by
and have anything you want ...

  
and the great man,
I know where you are ...

  
if you put it out, ruined everything,
and nobody will ever allowed.

  
The choice is yours.

  
Choice.

I mean, bigger is better.

  
Right?
- Oh yes!

  
Who is hungry?

  
Welcome tourists,
in Chewandswallow.

  
This is a great mayor.

  
Fun in our Nacho Cheese Hotspring.

  
Allow the children to eat junk food all
they want our children unsupervised area.

  
Jelly Beans, teeth.

  
And when the fun is over ...

  
look at the sunset
in 'mountain leftovers.

  
Protected by our
suspected indestructible barrier.

  
Today we have people here,
around the world.

  
Flint, you should consider this.

  
Are not you on TV?
You would have to send out.

  
There is a problem. I think
the food increases.

  
No, it's great. Big portions.
Everyone loves it.

  
Flint, I'm not sure
we do well.

  
If we have more on our plates
than we can chew?

  
For the first time in my life is
everyone like what I did.

  
Why can not you just be happy for me?

  
Go say something about the weather or something.

  
And now the hero of the city, and my
metaphorical son, Flint Lockwood!

  
Flint, we wish you the ceremony
with the scissors does.

  
Flint? No!

  
Please.
- You can not tackle!

  
Baby I'm Brent.

  
The truth is, Flint,
everyone loves you.

  
Danger!

  
Salt and pepper wind?

  
Oregano?

  
Sam, wait. I just sold.

  
I can sell?

  
Sorry.

  
Sorry.
- No problem.

  
Look there.
- Not now, Steve.

  
Sauce.

  
This is Sam Sparks, live
Chewandswallow from ...

  
Sam, we find a good storm is fun,
but you look like a nerd out.

  
Several children are stranded
in a tornado.

  
My stomach hurts.

  
What is that, one schrunchie? I took
not seen since 1959.

  
We have an emergency.

  
We come right back to that storm, as
Sam is looking more attractive.

  
Steve, we have the Kill Code Upload ...
What are you doing here?

  
I am the last ten minutes
to ordering food.

  
Why? Is there something wrong?
- I try to stop the machine.

  
I've put everyone in danger.

  
So much can it not be.

  
No!
- I'm off.

  
I can command
Kill the stop code.

  
Send the Kill Code.
- I'm back.

  
I have the button ...

  
Flint, it's nice to beat.

  
Not so fast!

  
That was the only way the machine
to work.

  
What exactly did you order?

  
""A Vegas Style
all you can eat buffet "".

  
Jelly Beans ...

  
Is everyone all right?
- Yes.

  
Somebody help me!

  
It is my son.

  
We have a doctor.
Is there a doctor?

  
Someone?
- I am a doctor.

  
Are you?
- That was me. In Guatemala.

  
I came here for a better life.

  
Quite a big decision.

  
How is he?

  
He is in a food coma.

  
Too much junk food. I need celery.
- Please.

  
Papa?
- Cal, I love you son.

  
It seems that everything has come.

  
Not yet. That tornado is nothing
compared to what is on.

  
Manny, connect us.

  
Do you report, Nancy.

  
Patrick, there is a huge
food storm.

  
It will spread around the globe.

  
I have calculated speed of the storm.

  
First it will arrive in New York.

  
Dan Paris. And it goes on to China.

  
And about four hours, the entire Northern
Hemisphere have a big blockage.

  
Hi, Dad.
- What are you doing?

  
I've tried to help everybody
but instead ...

  
I ruined everything.

  
I'm just a piece of waste.

  
So, I myself discarded.

  
Along with all these stupid inventions.

  
This is shit ...

  
and it is junk.

  
Listen son, if your boat ...

  
if not now ...

  
you know.
- I understand.

  
Mama had no right.

  
I'm not an inventor.

  
I had to take time
you said that.

  
Well ...

  
when it rains, do one coat.

  
Papa, I do not understand vismetaforen.

  
Come on, Steve, we have
a team together.

  
Download Kill Code.

  
Redesign, fertilize ...

  
cutting, burning ...

  
wrought iron ...

  
Help me!
- Fifteen.

  
Yes!

  
My car!
Now we will.

  
I have dreamed of.

  
Hotdogs!

  
Everyone!

  
I would say that I am sorry.

  
Especially to you, Sam.

  
I have a plan.

  
This memory stick includes a Kill Code.

  
Food that I will storm fly
the machine stop in the ...

  
and for ever cease.

  
As you evacuate the island ...
- It's all his fault.

  
Get him!

  
Shake the car back and forth!

  
The mess we are in it,
is all our fault.

  
Take my own son.

  
I'm just so mad at Flint
like you.

  
I will save him even at his face
if he comes out of the car.

  
I know that the food has Flint Lockwood
made, but that was to order.

  
And now we all
pay the price.

  
Thank you, Earl.

  
Sorry.
- It's okay.

  
Let us build a boat.

  
I go along with you.

  
You need someone who you
will navigate through this storm.

  
I can not just leave it.
- Sam, I am so sorry.

  
Do you kidding?
- I just thought ...

  
No!
- Good.

  
You need a co pilot.
- Are you a pilot?

  
Yes, and I am a physicist.

  
Really?
- No, that was a joke.

  
I am also an actor.

  
Let's do it.
- I go along.

  
Brent, it is good.
- No.

  
It is not good. I've had since I
a baby on my fame tarred.

  
But it is all just an illusion.

  
Maybe I was upstairs from
who I really am.

  
We are already full, so ...

  
Yes, Flint.

  
Good luck, kid.

  
He is too far!
- Manny, press the wiper.

  
Flint, there accumulates a lot of gas
around on the machine.

  
It seems almost as if ...
- Inside a huge meatball.

  
Water is a top, and
a hurricane food comes out from under.

  
Why I wear a diaper.

  
Has anyone ordered pizza?

  
We are haunted by a pizza?
- Sends it eat?

  
That is impossible.
- The massive molecular structure ...

  
mutating into super food.

  
Genetically designed to
the FLDSMDFR protection.

  
Pizza.

  
That was a close call. Can you imagine
Kill Code if we had lost?

  
Dad, are you okay? Great.
I need your help, the world is at stake.

  
What do you need?

  
Go to my lab, the computer
and mail a file to my mobile.

  
Well.

  
Yeah, okay.

  
That does not look bad.

  
This is the plan. Sam and I
go here in the meteorite ...

  
what to us now FLDSMDFR
should lead.

  
Manny, you and Steve continue to ship.
Pipe not around.

  
Once my father told me the Kill Code
emailed ...

  
destroy the machine and we meet
we meet at the western point of ...

  
How long before the world is destroyed?
- Approximately 20 minutes.

  
Just that.
- What about me? What should I do?

  
You may be president of the backseat.

  
Car upside down, and go!

  
Ladies first?
No? Well.

  
Wait for me!

  
Stay on course, then we
there right off.

  
Where is Steve?

  
We are at a different place or landed.

  
But if we go that way, should
FLDSMDFR here that the air shaft are.

  
Brent, come away from that cake.
- What?

  
 Home, Flint. 

  
That is hot.

  
 Flint, you get a call. 

  
Dad on the screen
a file, Kill Code.

  
Move it to the e-mail window.

  
Type my name and click
send.

  
Window?
- See that thing, a little piece of paper?

  
Use it to drag the file.
- Drag?

  
Drag.
- Drag?

  
He does not drag!
- About the Office.

  
That worked for a yard.
- Of course not, you know what?

  
Hurry.

  
Watch the sails.
We have almost no time.

  
Hurry. What are you doing?
Keep it full, come on!

  
Wait, I have an important announcement.

  
So long, suckers!

  
Bon voyage and bon appetit.

  
Food is released.

  
Your way I never lose again.

  
Good hold.

  
Anyone heading south!
We need the storm ahead.

  
And now?
- Click send.

  
Flint, the FLDSMDFR is there.
- Papa, hurry!

  
Sending ...
Wait.

  
Papa?
Can you hear me?

  
Go!

  
They are actually pretty cute.
And this is ...

  
They have eaten Brent.

  
Dad, we are now surrounded by
men consuming chicken.

  
So if this is goodbye, thank you
I told the truth.

  
I am a bit late
found out I think.

  
Give back my phone!

  
Baby Brent?
- Baby I'm not Brent.

  
I kippenman. And I do finally
a contribution to the community.

  
Go on, crazy child.
And save the world!

  
Brent Chicken You've done it, really.
- Go!

  
Right in this hole.

  
That's peanuts.

  
If even one of us touches the
we get an anaphylactic shock.

  
Actually I'm not allergic
for peanuts.

  
I told you so just me
nice could find.

  
So you really thought you
more attractive with allergies?

  
This is a great bagel!

  
Would I allowed some extra mustard?

  
You are about to pulverized
to be a huge corn cob.

  
It seems that the food storm
follows an unusual pattern ...

  
she hit the main points first, and
now spreads over the rest of the world.

  
What the ...
- Come on, guys.

  
After my phone in the FLDSMDFR
I stopped and got destroyed ...

  
I pull the rope twice, and
then you pull me up again, right?

  
Sounds good.

  
You have your cut, or not?
- It's only a scratch.

  
Flint, Sam needs you to bring airplane
for an injection against allergies.

  
Hold on.
- Let go.

  
Let go, Sam.

  
I will not let you go!
Then you sit down there.

  
It is not ideal really.

  
Come with us, then
we start over again.

  
Then we live under the ground,
and we use bacon as clothes.

  
Sam, it's not really a good plan.
- We will at least not lose.

  
Listen, I like you very much.

  
As friends?

  
No, if I like you ....

  
I miss you too.
But then you.

  
Flint, no!

  
Hold on, Sam. Doctor Manny
has medicine for you.

  
We are way, hurry!
- Hold on, Sam.

  
I'm almost there.

  
What is that?

  
Gummi Bears.

  
From below!

  
Where are you?

  
She has touched a peanut,
or something.

  
Friend, the kitchen is closed.

  
Daddy, no!

  
When it rains ...

  
pull a coat.

  
Spray on Shoes.

  
Where is Flint?

  
No!
- I know.

  
Where is Flint?

  
Sorry ...

  
Your son was a wonderful man.

  
Flint ...
- Papa.

  
If you ever broken your line ...

  
if it is not right ...

  
Come on!

  
I am proud of you, Flint.

  
I am amazed that
an ordinary person like me ...

  
the father may be, of someone so
particularly as you are.

  
You're talented, original
and your laboratory is breathtaking.

  
Your mother always knew
you would be special ...

  
and if she still lived
both of us she would say ""I told you"".

  
If I afdoe this thing, and if I
vismetafoor a say ...

  
know that a fish metaphor
means ...

  
I love my son.
- Love you, Dad.

  
So, where were we?

  
You just wanted me to kiss.
- Will you kiss me again?

  
Why do not you get it back?

  
I would not be rejected again.
- Just kiss me!

  
This was not really the intention.

512n9w,3,2016-09-04,My Story - 1st Reddit Post,Jemalias,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/512n9w/my_story_1st_reddit_post/,"Hi.

This is my 1st post to Reddit.

I'm going to admit something I've known for a long time: That I have an addiction.

During college, gaming consumed me. I failed classes and lost friends because I how much I played. I finally made the decision last year to quit gaming. I sold my Xbox and my desktop.

I wish I could say I never looked back, but that's just not the case. My addiction just morphed into different form: videos. The same destructive patterns of behavior I saw with gaming just shifted to Internet content, in general.

In some ways I feel like I am back to square one. Gaming, I was able to compartmentalize from other aspects of my life. But how do you beat an addiction to something that you use to socialize, to work, and to organize? My addiction is all around me now. No matter what I do professionally, I am almost certainly going to need to use computers. Plus, if I want to have relationships with people my own age, I need technology to certain extent. Even now, I am reaching out and getting help for these problems over the Internet. The irony of this is not lost on me.

I've been graduated for several months now. I've been working an pretty nice internship but it doesn’t pay that well and my time’s almost up there. Whenever I have spare time, it’s spent doing pointless shit on the Internet when I should be looking for a new gig. I’m terrified that it’ll be just like six years ago, with me living with my deranged mother and no meaningful job to speak of.

The fact is, I’m not going to be able to get a job if I don’t beat this addiction- but how? I’ve tried searching for a support group for the past few months, but I can’t find anything to speak of. I’m seeing a therapist, which is great for general mental/emotional issues, but he doesn’t have experience with these sorts of problems. The fact that society doesn’t take these kinds of things seriously also doesn’t help.

**TL;DR** - *Overcoming my gaming addiction led to an Internet addiction, which is much harder for me to manage. How can I strike a balance between use and abuse, given the fact that, historically, my self-control with anything digital is almost zero?*

I have been to China with my family before and this would be my first time alone. Apparently even if i feel hungry, i would soon feel unwell when i start eating.

513hhy,2,2016-09-04,Having trouble deciding which shoes to buy for university,koipen,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/513hhy/having_trouble_deciding_which_shoes_to_buy_for/,"Hey

I'm starting in the University of Cambridge this fall and need help constructing a shoe wardrobe. I've structured this post under ""haves"", ""needs"" and ""ideas"" which I hope will be the most useful.

***Haves*** - shoes that I own

* A torn-down pair of Stan Smith's - the upper is removed from the sole about 5 inches down the side of the right shoe. Generally super ragged  and already a bit difficult to use; been holding them together with Duct tape for this summer. Probably need to part with these :(

* A pair of Brown long-wing Derbies. Bought these a couple of years back, not very high quality. Unsure whether these are welted or not - stitching on the bottom would suggest yes but it might be cosmetic. Leather still looks okay-ish after roughly 2 years of occasional use; a coat of polish will probably make these look usable.

* A bunch of practical shoes; athletic sneakers, espradillas, flip-flops; no need to worry about practicality for the most part.

***Needs*** - what kind of situations I need shoes for

* Everyday life - going to lectures and supervisions, conducting business in the city etc. I travel by bike most of the time. Not sure how cold and wet it gets in Cambridge in winters but I'd assume a fair bit.

* Semi-formal events - formal dinners. My college has a particularly lax policy on dress code so I don't think I need to worry about them, but I might need something for more formal - read suit and tie - dinners elsewhere.

*  Banking spring weeks and internship interviews - not a common occurrence but probably should be prepared for this as well.

***Ideas***

* A pair of [black Oxfords](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/brindisi/sale?coloris=chataigne) and a pair of [Brown boots](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/enfieldgommecountry/sale-boots_shoes?coloris=chocolat) from Bexley, and a pair of grey or white sneakers. Bexley is one of the few good shoe makers I can afford and I figured that this combo would leave me prepared for most situations.
(i.e. sneakers most of the time, Derby longwings if I feel like going a bit fancier, Oxfords for formal events and Boots for winter)
* Same as above, but instead of sneakers [some form](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/wembleyclassic/loafers?coloris=noir) of loafers? I've heard that loafers are great for an inbetween alternative for sneakers that can also pass in better occasions. Not sure how comfortable I'd be wearing loafers day-to-day though.

* Are black oxfords the best option or should I instead focus on a more versatile pair I could use outside strictly formal contexts? Say, [chestnut oxfords](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/stresaii?coloris=chataigne) or something else? Are black oxfords too formal to wear with chinoes / shirt / sweater for every-day wear or in conferences?

***

Any and all advice is welcomed; I probably need to pull the trigger and order within the next few days.

I was staying in the city we both go to school in for an internship, while she had an internship in San Francisco. Previously, I thought we had a perfect relationship, we never had any bad fights, she never had any complaints or wanted to change how we were doing things, and we even talked about getting married after we graduate.

A week after she gets to SF, she texts me saying she wants to go on a break. I reluctantly agree. A week after that, she facetimes me to break up with me, saying that she can't commit to anything right now, which is a total 180 from what we were talking about even the night before she left. 

She says she still wants to be good friends with me, and hang out, but without any of the romantic aspects. I've known her since high school and we were very close friends before things developed into a relationship. I was close to her family and she was very close to mine, coming to Thanksgiving dinners and Christmas mornings and my sister's wedding.

I was devastated, and it took me most of the rest of the summer to get over it. I was finally feeling better, but at college we live in rooms that are right next door to each other, so I saw her on move-in day, and we share a class together, so I have to see her at least twice a week, and a lot of those bad feelings came back.

The second week of school she texts me saying she's seeing someone else and she wanted to tell me before I found out through facebook, which I appreciated. Still, seeing a picture of her with this other guy made me feel terrible. I started going to the counseling center on campus (I had mild depression even before breaking up) which has helped, but it's still been hard.

On top of that, we were all in one big friend group with other people, so a lot of things they do she'd go to as well, and another one of my good friends is her roommate.

A part of me hopes that we'd get back together because everything was so perfect, but every day I'm getting more resentful and a little angry. I don't think I should have to stay friends with someone who dumped me without warning like that, but it's hard to avoid contact due to our living and school situation.

I don't want to be an asshole, but I feel like I should cut things off. Is that the right move? How do I handle interactions with her when I have to see her in the hallway/in class?

  **tl;dr**: Ex-girlfriend who I thought I was going to marry dumped me out of the blue, wants to stay friends, can't avoid her due to living next to her, how do I handle it?"

### Hosted in Dodoma, Tanzania
**A smaller amount of African nations will be addressed due to the recent disaster putting strain on Japan**

In place of the usually massive TICAD summits, Japan will be holding personal talks with select African nations to continue the development and advancement of the African continent. This will still be known as the seventh TICAD summit, just at a smaller scale, then the conferences will return to the schedule proposed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldroleplay/comments/510qph/diplomacy_the_tokyo_international_conference_of/).

The nations that will be addressed at this TICAD summit include:

   - Republic of Djibouti
   - Kingdom of Morocco
   - Republic of Ghana
   - Republic of Côte d'Ivoire
   - United Republic of Tanzania
   - Republic of Mozambique
   - Republic of Namibia

Once again, only some African nations will be addressed until Japan has officially recovered, then we will return to our normal practices and tackle the entire continent together. _This comes after decades of TICAD summits and cooperation with Africa, and also follows the last TICAD summit in which Japan committed billions of dollars._

## Djibouti

Djibouti is a nation plagued with environmental hardships and little economic diversity, but that shall change now. Japan's commitments to the nation of Djibouti will follow four main points: _economic diversity, natural protection and tourism, agriculture, and education reform, and infrastructure._

**Economic Diversity:** Right now, the Republic of Djibouti faces many challenges, some of which can be traced back to their economic portfolio. The majority of Djibouti's jobs and business come from the services sector, and the rest of the market is left stagnant as a result. Japan plans to help Djibouti create more variety in their economy, thus creating more jobs, a more stable condition, and boost their GDP growth. The State of will help the nation from the Horn of Africa accomplish these goals in the following ways.

   &gt; $400 million USD from Japan

**Environmental Protection, Safety, and Tourism:** Djibouti is a land with many environmental wonders and is a hotspot for endangered flora and fauna, and as such if the nation were to monopolize on this fact, it could help solve the unemployment rate and promote the protection of the important natural wonders of the nation. Japan has partnered with the International Ecotourism Society, the oldest, largest, and most experienced organization in this regard, to help Djibouti utilize their environmental hotspots in both a responsible and profitable way.

   &gt; $150 million USD from Japan and $150 million USD from TIES along with managerial and supervisory support to get workers and set up infrastructure.

**Industry Sector - Agriculture:** Djibouti has the great potential to tap into their agriculture sector, but with their lack of rainfall and flash flooding, it is understandably difficult. This is why Japan pledges to work with the International Fund for Agricultural Development, an agency from the United Nations, to help jump-start sustainable and productive agricultural progress. This means the construction of greenhouses for domestic and foreign use, along with the placement of more farm lands for the production of sustainable crops without a need for much water such as amaranth, southern peas (that also fix nitrogen, will will improve the soil for other crops), nopale cactus, Jerusalem artichoke, and more, along with training for employment at these locations.

   &gt; $550 million USD from Japan, and $800 million USD from the IFAD.

**Infrastructure:** Japan will put money towards the creation of new infrastructure system based on anti-earthquake protection, something Japan is particularly good at, along with the construction of new arroyos and flood deposits.

   &gt; $786 million from Japan along with volunteer workers from Japan and organizations.

---

## Morocco

Japan's commitment to Moroccan aid will focus on three main issues: _energy, education, trade, and poverty_. The problems that Morocco currently faces all contribute to the continuation of the other problems.

**Trade:** Currently, Morocco does not have enough foreign currency to afford imports and avoid debt. This exacerbates already massive problems, with the nation receiving most of its energy supply from elsewhere. Japan will increase its trade relationship with Morocco by establishing a free-trade agreement, lowering tariffs, and investing capital into the government and a low interest rate to give Morocco a greater chance to grow. We also ask that France, as Morocco's most prominent trade partner, put in place similar efforts so that North African nations has the ability to receive more imports without falling into great debt.

**Energy:** Currently, the vast majority of Morocco's energy supply is foreign, up to 91%, and the domestic energy production market is just being tapped into. Japan will help Morocco produce more domestic energy in an attempt to both diversify and solidify energy security. Morocco has showed great interest as of late in their hydro-power that is only just being tapped into, and with Japan's history and strong track-record of implementing hydro-power with the most minimal environmental effect and the best output, from our own tidal barrage, to helping the Republic of India implement their hydroelectric reform, and more, we will help Morocco to construct more hydro-electric facilities, working with the nation's Office National de l'Electricité et de l'Eau Potable (ONEE) to build more stations. Private Japanese companies have also pledged to help Morocco construct more wind and solar power. Morocco already implemented more renewable energy sources in 2016, and this renewed effort will add vastly to the domestic energy supply of the nation.

   &gt; $700 million USD from the government of Japan towards hydro-electric power, $600 million USD from Japan Renewable Energy Co., Ltd. and $300 million USD from Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, both towards solar and wind energy.

**Education:** Morocco's illiteracy rate is too high, and the education system far too disjointed to support a nation. Education is at the heart of a nation's development, and as such Japan will invest in reforming Morocco's education system. We will help provide textbooks, supplies, after school activities, and the construction of more schools, along with helping to set up special programs for energy and communications.

   &gt; $300 million USD from Japan and $100 million USD from the Global Partnership for Education.

---

## Ghana

Japan wishes to expand its relationship with Ghana and become productive partners for the betterment of the West African nation and the continent as a whole. As one of the most peaceful nations, with relatively high literacy levels, we believe Ghana to be both a political, and cultural guide for Africa, being that they were also the first independent former colony in Africa. Japan extends this helpful hand with a focus on: _education, health, and access to clean drinking water._

**Education:** Japan will offer millions in an partnership with the The Global Partnership for Education and Education International to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Ghana's education system, as well as to offer programs focusing on business and energy, and internships in Japan and with Japanese companies. 

   &gt; $100 million USD from Japan, $50 million from both GPfE and EI as well as workers, staff, and supervisory support.

**Health and Access to Food and Water:** Japan's other support for Ghana comes in the form of medical and foodstuff support. Japan will invest in Ghana's medical and health, along with food and water services to build more reliable water pipes and pumps, water sanitation centers, and clinics in the north of the nation which desperately needs it, along with a new hospital in Ghana's most populous city, Accra. All of this with support from the World Health Organization and the NGO Water.org.

   &gt; $300 million USD from Japan, $100 million from WHO, and $35 million from Water.org along with volunteers from both.

---

## Ivory Coast

The Ivory Coast is a special nation with a rich culture and varied history, and Japan is excited to begin a new chapter in relations with the West African nation. We will be focusing on the following: _education, agriculture, environmental protection, health, water and sanitation._

**Education:** Japan will be investing in the Ivory Coast's education reform to improve the quality of teaching and learning for the children and young adults, and to improve literacy rates. Japan will work with two previously mentioned organizations once again for this.

   &gt; $150 million USD from Japan, $50 million from both GPfE and EI as well as workers, staff, and supervisory support.

**Agriculture:** The people of the Ivory Coast often find it hard enough to produce food for their own families, let alone for national and international markets, and as such Japan will help Côte d’Ivoire in placing new greenhouses and small farms in areas that will not affect the environment of the bio-diverse nation. This also means an investment in sustainable crops that do not require much space or water in order to be fruitful and profitable. 

   &gt; $525 million USD from Japan

**The Environment:** The vast biodiversity located in the Ivory Coasts shores, lakes, and forests must be protected, and can even offer financial gain to the nation. Japan will be working once more with the International Ecotourism Society to help the Ivory Coast stop deforesation without derailing their economy, and replace it with an active and profitable ecotourism sector. The other Japanese investments in the nation will also help to off-set the losses from the slowing down of deforestation.

**Health and Foodstuffs:** While Japan's massive contribution to the domestic agricultural sector in particular will help immensely to food shortages, water is another matter. Japan will help the Ivory Coast stop the pollution of its water, established new water pipelines and pumps, and construct new water sanitation centers to provide water to the people of the nation. This will be in association with previously mentioned organizations. In terms of medicinal health, Japan will also help construct clinics and health safety initiatives, along with support from international organizations like WHO and Doctors Without Borders.

   &gt; $550 million USD from Japan, $100 million from WHO, and volunteers from DWB

---

## Tanzania &amp; Mozambique

Both Tanzania and Mozambique are beautiful countries with many opportunities for expansion and growth. With great potential in agriculture, biofuels, textiles, and more it is obvious to see the areas of growth to be capitalized on, and Japan wishes to help in those sectors, and more. We recognize the wrong doings of many corporations in lying to the people of Mozambique and Tanzania in regards to biofuel production, and wish to lend a helping hand where these scandalous companies refused to.

**Education:** Both nations will each be given million to construct new school, particularly in the farmlands and rural areas, equipped with textbooks and supplies readily available.

   &gt; $400 million USD to both nations from Japan, and $25 million USD from both GPfE and EI to each nation as well.

**Health and Food Services:** Japan, WHO, Water.org, and UNICEF will contribute even more money to the establishment of local markets, water pipelines, pumps, sanitation centers, and more for the people of both nations. This, along with the construction of a new major hospital in the most populous cities of both countries, and clinics and aid centers in the more rural regions.

   &gt; $800 million for both nations from Japan, with volunteers, assistance, workers, and a cumulative $450 million USD from the assisting organizations.

**Food Services:** Japan will contribute to changing the two nation's policy on domestic production by funding the construction of new farmlands that do not contribute to deforestation, with good practices, along with the development of more staple foods and greenhouses to produce them on a wider scale. This will be primarily sold domestically to solve hunger issues.

   &gt; $475 million USD from Japan

**Biofuel Production:** Japan will fund the increased production and research of cane and jatropha biofuel, while simultaneously increasing domestic agriculture as mentioned above so the food vs. fuel debate will be null.

   &gt; $600 million USD from Japan

**Energy:** Japan will help construct energy sources for the two nations, focusing on hydro-power, followed by wind, and then by solar. We will construct 7MW off-shore turbines for both nations, and contribute to the development of wind and solar farms.

   &gt; $600 million USD from Japan with $420 million from various organizations.

---

## Namibia

Japan wishes to assist the Namibian people and provide a reliable source of a food, and create places for people to find work that matches their education. We also intend to help provide the nation with improved infrastructure and methods of halting desertification.

**Education:** Japan will contribute to the Namibian government to reform their educational system, providing them with more supplies, textbooks, well-trained teachers, and more specific teaching styles that lend to vocational research and address the problems Namibia faces today. We will also open working opportunities for the people of Namibia in Japan companies.

   &gt; $600 million USD from Japan

**Infrastructure - Water Access:** We will invest millions in improving infrastructure in the nation, creating more roads, water pipelines, water pumps, and sanitation centers for clean water. These roads will allow rural areas to integrate more with the rest of the nation.

   &gt; $820 million USD from Japan

**Desertification Prevention:** Japan will provide the people of Namibia with new methods of preventing and stopping the desertification of their land, eventually allowing them to farm more, and lessening the problem of hunger. We will send researchers to work with Namibia, and supply them with already known methods that rural Namibians are unaware of.

   &gt; $400 million USD from Japan

**Health Services:** Japan will also contribute to the construction of clinics in more rural areas, equipped with trained and professional staff and medical supplies needed to combat Namibia-specific diseases.

   &gt; $660 million USD from Japan.

This smaller TICAD event was still incredibly successful in our opinion, and Japan cannot wait to begin these new relations, and then get back on schedule with our original Future of TICAD plans. This was a statement from Prime Minister Abe of Japan from the smaller TICAD summit that was held in Dodoma, Tanzania:

   &gt; _""We thank the people of Africa for their patience and acceptance of this special TICAD summit in the face of disaster back home. We also thank the cooperation of all the nations, NGOs, and companies that contributed to the betterment of African nations in partnership with Japan - these investments are obviously not immediate, but will be poured into these nations overtime. Thank you all.""_"
515n8l,53,2016-09-04,I feel like a big fraud. scared and thinking of dropping out.,feedbackplz2,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/515n8l/i_feel_like_a_big_fraud_scared_and_thinking_of/,"Background: I'm an MSIII and increasingly feel like I'm in way over my head. I've been holding all this stuff in and just need to let it out somewhere. Even the most shameful embarrassing stuff. Just need someone to listen to me and help me.

Okay, let's start from the beginning like any good story. Since motherfucking *high school* I've been a bad student and struggled with grades, despite trying different study strategies etc. The first three years of college I similarly got below average grades, then shaped up and started improving. MCAT 30. Applied once to 50 schools, got shot down each time. Decided to do a respected post-bacc and applied again to 50 schools... got interviewed and accepted to exactly 1 MD school. Yep, count 'em, 1 MD school. Out of 50 applications.

At this point you're thinking to yourself *he sounds subpar already, this isn't going to end well*. But hold on to your pants because the roller coaster is just beginning.

I failed 2 classes during my preclinical years due to a combination of personal issues and bad study habits. After the second failure I had a Come to Jesus moment where I realized if I fucked up again I'd be out of med school, out of my life dream. I faced a fork in the road... to improve by really starting anew and changing the way I look at / study for medicine, **or** to improve using cheap tricks like memorizing random facts and buzzwords.

I chose the cheap tricks. I started doing better on tests simply due to a combination of being able to guess high yield questions correctly, connecting buzzwords with options even though I didn't understand what the fuck they meant, and generally being lucky.

Then began MSIII. I am now 8 months into my rotations and have passed using the same rotten foundational skills and a combination of being a clever charlatan and charming people to get good evals. Example: I passed my internal medicine rotation despite not knowing how to auscultate the heart even though I practiced so much futilely (hell, to this day I have not heard an abnormal heart sound). In the end, I would just go through the motions, hear random bubbling sounds and write that down as ""regular rate and rhythm""; sometimes I felt guilty at lying like this, and would ask my interns if they heard anything. If they did I would say ""oh yeah I heard that too"".

I have a good personality and very charming demeanor and this is how I got soaring evals despite being more ignorant than a premed. I still suck balls when it comes to basic things like auscultating, central lines, understanding fundamental disease processes, fuck... even knowing what normal saline does. Things an MSI should know.

I love the concept of medicine and love being in the hospital. But I feel like I built a philosophical mindset that rests on a rotten, unsustainable foundation and it's too late to change now that I'm almost done with core rotations. This isn't just imposter syndrome. This is a guy who doesn't know his most basic science and clinical skills and has somehow blithely fumbled his way through med school anyway.

This weekend I did some soul searching and realized I'm going to kill patients as an intern if I keep this up. Is there any point trying to start afresh and strengthen my weak points (ie everything) at this stage?

It's hard to describe what I'm feeling... imagine being in a car that keeps speeding up little by little and you can't brake. For some time you can ignore the problem but eventually that car is getting unruly, going 90mph, and you're having to wildly swerve narrowly out of harm's way every few seconds. Eventually you know you'll crash.

Am I crazy to consider dropping out? I just feel like I got in as a fraud, a guy with a below average GPA/MCAT barely getting into an MD school by the skin of his teeth. And I'm afraid I just cannot compete with my more cognitively-able peers.

**TL;DR: From the beginning I've been a subpar student with terrible study habits and severe deficiencies but somehow have made it to the end of MSIII. And things are getting out of control. I love medicine but should I eject, for my own well-being and that of future patients?**"

5169lu,11,2016-09-04,How/should I respond to negative review from host?,Skizzle5,AirBnB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/5169lu/howshould_i_respond_to_negative_review_from_host/,"This was my first time booking a place through Airbnb so I was new to the whole experience. So the situation was that I was moving to a new city and I booked a place for 2 weeks, 17th - 31st, to give me some time to find a permanent apartment. There was a slight language barrier between me and the host but it seemed fine, English/French. I understand/read French, usually need people to speak slowly and clearly to understand better though, he spoke very low and quick and I wouldn't understand so he just defaulted to his English which was enough for us to communicate although with plenty of repetitions. 

I wrote this clearly to the host in my message stating that I'd be spending most of my time either contacting or visiting apartments, I feel like there's no reason for this to be misunderstood because he could have translated anything since it was text. If I'm combing through online ads and calling places yeah I'm going to be spending some time in the room. The place was clean, quiet, and as advertised so I left him a short nice review. Overall I felt fine there, but took extra care to be quiet and clean (the place was spotless). I spent most of the nights on the phone with my girlfriend because that's just what we do when we're apart, tried not to be too loud (to her frustration). There was a couple (francophones as well) staying in the other room who seemed just as busy as me, I believe the girl had an internship in the city and the guy was visiting her. I only saw them once when I went up to their room to introduce myself because we had completely different schedules (they would be out when I got up and asleep/in their room when I got back).

So basically the host wrote that I wasn't social enough and left a bad impression. That I had ""holed myself up with the blinds and door closed"" along with how he felt I avoided him and the other guests possibly because of the different languages but that he hopes not. 

So first of all, the place was a basement with only a tiny window out of reach unless I hopped on the furniture lol. To me it seemed like we just had different schedules and didn't put any thought into it tbh. I literally went around the entire city in less then a week so I certainly wasn't holed up in the room, I mean I kept the room door closed when I left? I greeted the host plenty of times when we would bump into each other and he never mentioned anything. I brought a soap bar with me and he asked me to use the liquid soap he had in the bathroom instead because soap bars apparently cause build up (with a note by the sink which I thought was sort of passive aggressive but yeah didn't complain), when I saw him I said that it wasn't a problem and continued using the liquid soap despite that not being mentioned in the ad and me hating liquid soap. I had to leave after the first week because I found a place that wanted me to move in asap and I let him know without making a fuss over trying to get a refund (since I know that has nothing to do with him). I even folded the sheets when I left!! He wasn't around when I left so I also left him a small goodbye &amp; thank you message on the app which he didn't bother to reply to. I really felt that I had been courteous and thoughtful as a guest so I'm more than slightly annoyed at this. Even if I had literally not said a single word to him I feel like this shouldn't matter because it is my prerogative to do what I want while I am in the room I paid for, and it certainly isn't my job to keep the host company lol. Despite disagreeing I just don't see why it matters to him either as long as I left the room how I found it? Furthermore it's not like the host or other guests made any effort to interact with me either or that I rudely rebuffed any interactions, I mean I was the one who approached the other guests to introduce myself! Actually looking back he didn't even make the effort to walk me around the place to show me around, isn't that just standard routine for a host? I had to go up to him in his room to ask for the wifi, ask where I should keep my food, etc!

Meanwhile the entire time I was shitting my pants thinking I wouldn't find an apartment in time (things looked bleak at first and a lot of my initial plans had fallen apart), if anyone here has ever been in this type of situation then you know what it's like, so sorry if hanging out in the living area is the last thing on my mind.

This ended up longer than I thought, but I wanted to type out the whole story. So I was thinking of writing something along the lines of, ""Sorry, but I certainly wasn't holed up or avoiding you. This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and I tried my best to be as thoughtful and courteous as possible. Looking back it felt like we just had different hours and to be honest I hadn't even put any thought into it. I spent most of my time contacting/visiting apartments along with exploring the city just like I had clearly stated to you in my first message."" I think this is the most simple and concise but I also want to add something like, ""furthermore you weren't around when I left so I took the time to leave you a small goodbye and thank you message which you didn't care to reply to, nor did you make any special effort to interact with me or even give a brief tour of the apartment so I'm not sure where the bad impression comes from."" I know the second part starts to get a bit of a more personal tone, but I don't want other hosts thinking I was just a dick without more information.

It sucks because I'm a student so it's not like I'll be visiting places often and this review is just gonna sit there and I really did make an effort to be a polite guest. What do you guys think about the whole thing?

516akb,6,2016-09-04,Can I enter into the construction management world with a degree in mechanical engineering and a previous internship at a GC?,scootzee,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/516akb/can_i_enter_into_the_construction_management/,"Basically, as a senior, I am switching from CM to majoring in ME because I want to get into the technology sector and do R&amp;D work or product development. I'm just wrapping up a project engineering internship and can already tell that in terms of overall value of education and knowledge a degree in CM is almost worthless. I've learned more during my internship as a PE than I anticipate I will learn in the next two years of my CM program. I am letting my GC know about my path switch very soon and anticipate it will be received well albeit reluctantly. I am a cerebral guy and have a passion for learning math and science and at this point in my life engineering is for me.

My question, however, is this: Upon graduating with a degree in ME and if a job in my desired field is unavailable or if I decide the engineering sector isn't for me, is it possible for me to re-enter the construction field with a degree in mechanical engineering, an internship with a GC and some carpentry experience? I anticipate this option to be my fall back. I appreciate any responses!! Thank you. "
516sb8,310,2016-09-04,[FR] Recently gave a hard next to my oneitis,bobbyskeight,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/516sb8/fr_recently_gave_a_hard_next_to_my_oneitis/,"First post here after nearly a year of lurking. A year ago I was three years deep in a relationship I thought would be my only one. Standard case of oneitis. We were doing long distance as we went to different universities and it was going as well as long distance can go. I ran across this sub and read into it. Naturally I was shocked and offended at what I read. There was no way that my girlfriend could be like the girls you guys described. I was sure that she loved me the same way that I loved her. I was wrong.

By the beginning of the next semester we were broken up. Looking back my biggest mistake was that I had made her my primary life goal. Whatever I did I'd be happy as long as I was with her. How naive I was to think that she might feel the same way. She had other ambitions she needed to follow and I can't blame her for that. We ended things on uncommonly good terms.

I had let the relationship be a defining factor in my life and I was left with a large space to fill. I feel lucky to have found this sub when I did. I knew the only way I could get over her was through radical self improvement. I hit the gym harder than I ever have before. I learned some game and stacked up a few plates so I routinely had my sex needs covered. Most importantly I learned how to make goals for myself then go out and fucking accomplish them. 

I moved across the country for the summer to take an internship and pursue my passion for whitewater kayaking. When I was out there something clicked in my head that mentally changed me from a boy to a man. It was the best summer of my life and it never would have happened if I stayed mentally sheltered in my previous relationship. I probably wouldn't even have had the balls to accept the offer and move.

Recently when I was home for a few days before going back to school I saw her. We caught up, had lunch, and went on a walk. There came a point when we ran out of small talk and there was a long silence. I could tell she was uncomfortable and still not totally over the break up. On the other hand I wasn't phased. I realized I didn't need her any more. Eventually she asked if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. I said there was things I've been thinking about but nothing I needed to say. More silence. Usually I had been the one to initiate ""relationship talk."" 

She had previously told me that she sees herself settling down with me in the future, but doesn't want to date now. Now I refuse to let her keep my emotional commitment while she goes out and fucks other guys. It doesn't work like that. As drove her home I told her that it seems like we've both been doing great without each other so there's no reason we should pretend that we'd get ever back together. Then the tears started. She was still at a loss for words as I dropped her off at home and drove away. I got an I still love you text later that night. I decided it'd be best not to respond.

I feel like a lot of guys here want the chance to show the girl that hurt them how far they have come. It is a bittersweet feeling. It is great to have that feeling of closure and validation that you've truly changed. Yet, it's still at the cost of breaking someone's heart that you used to hold dear. Unless your oneitis really fucked you over it's not something that you should take pleasure in.

Thank you TRP. Everything I do now is to follow my own goals. Nothing burdens my mind as I pursue my ambitions. You've helped me learn how to live life on my own terms and the sex I get because of it on the side is like the cherry on top. I feel stronger than I ever have before. My insecurities have vanished. I can do anything that I set my mind to. "
5170gl,2,2016-09-04,I will be here if you need me.,Vacvvm,nofriends,https://www.reddit.com/r/nofriends/comments/5170gl/i_will_be_here_if_you_need_me/,"I try to be a good person. I will help people out whenever I can. I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am.    
  
I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself?  
  
I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am.  
  
I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them?   
  
Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing.  

I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence)  and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something.   
  
As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face.  I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. 

For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her.   
  
I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship.   
   
Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end.   
  
Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing.  
  
It is as if the world if intentionally turning its back on me.  
  
Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me.   
  
I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people.  I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything.  When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year.  I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead?

I can't find any strength in myself. I don't know what to do.

I/21M have been going down the spiral hard and fast. The complete absence of any idea what to do or think of my future has lead me to turn to you again. I will try to keep it short.

Most of us started uni/college (again), and so did I, but for me it is different. I have failed to get the necessary credits for year 2 twice now. Iied to my parents about the second time because I wasn't only scared of the reactions but also the questions. I fucked up big. Very big.

I am stuck in limbo where I can't do much because my whole course is internship based for the second year and most classes have assignments and papers that have to be done and written in reference to my internship. I failed my internship twice and never got to do most of my assignments. I feel like I am getting dumber too and I am forgetting so much, it is like I am losing my own memory. I even forgot how old I was and had to recount from my birthdate.

I feel like the biggest failure for having to go through this the third time, hell I am surprised I have not been kicked out yet. It doesn't end here. I am having panic attacks and pain in my body and chest thinking about going to classes. Its 4am night right now and I spend last six hours with small attacks but many at a time. I want to just end the misery but I don't have the guts to do it. My debt is slowly getting bigger and I am losing hope in myself for being able to successfully accomplish anything.

I just don't know what to do anymore.

I've managed to save up a little over $4000 this summer and have secured another relatively high paying part time job for the school year. I plan to invest a large portion of that savings and as much income as I reasonably can. I've been reading up a little and I understand that it is best to invest early, with low fees, and the best bet is probably something that tracks an index. 

My plan was to invest in Vanguard's total market index fund (VTSMX). I have the minimum $3000 to get into the fund, and the fees are .16%. This seems like a safe bet, and my parents, who have always been pretty good with their money, have just moved their investments to Vanguard. I was looking around a bit more and noticed that Schwab also offers what appears to be the same fund (SWPPX) with .09% fees. Vanguard also offers the same fund for investors with $10000 (VTSAX) at .05% fees. Are all of these funds essentially the same thing? Is it a good idea for me to start my money at Schwab with the intention of moving it over to Vanguard when I qualify for the lower rate? If not, why?

I have also found Vanguards total stock market ETF (VTI). The fees are only .05% and there appears to be no minimum. I understand this is different from the index fund, but I don't quite understand why. Could somebody give me the essential information on the differences here please. Is there a reason that many people recommend VTSMX but I haven't read anything about VTI? 

If you think there's something better I should be doing with my money, I am open to all suggestions.

Thanks for reading

It gets me away from home and allows me to make decisions on my own. Even though through the scholarships that I get we pay instate tuition each quarter with some extra money from the school because I took all the advanced classes in high school so I'm apparently smart enough for it, there's still some left to pay. The college is considered one of the most affordable in the country and has a good program for my degree. Out of the 4 times my tuition has needed to be payed, my parents payed once. The other 3 times were from a combination of the money I've saved and student loans taken out under my name. 

This past summer, I've come home to a household with no money, even for food and bills because my dad's been gambling all the money at the casino. He's the only one that works so he feels that it's his decision where it goes. My mother refuses to get a job because of her ""health issues"" (judging by the fact that she suddenly became diabetic and it was gone the moment she realized that we were giving her shit about eating sweets, most of her problems are fake) and she refuses to get on welfare because ""[she doesn't] want that label on [her]"". Due to the lack of money and the fact that I managed to save over $2000 in the bank, my parents mooched off me and I ended up paying for groceries, gas, and cigarettes because they refuse to stop or even slow down. (There's days we go hungry because the last $7 in their bank account went to another pack.) When I refuse to buy, I get screamed at until I cave in and buy 3 packs. I've taken to couponing to help keep the expenses down. Mom spends a good amount of money on doctor visits and the 4 strong, highly addictive, prescription painkillers she takes which she often puts before my sister's medications. Because she's gone without she's been having nightmares for a couple weeks now.

A few weeks ago we didn't have the money to pay the electric bill and so we stayed at my grandmother's house. My grandparents are enablers. ""Your dad wouldn't be so angry or spend all of his money at the casino if he could come home to a clean house."" So we cleaned indoors with no air circulation in the middle of a Texas summer. Except for my mother, who suddenly came down with a migraine and couldn't do any work (which was miraculously healed about an hour after everyone stopped cleaning). I was told to clean my room, which I worked on the whole time. My mother is a hoarder and doesn't like me throwing my old things away so a lot of clutter built up over the years. Both my mother and grandmother complain that I didn't do a damn thing. 

About an hour ago I got ganged up on by my mother and father for being a lazy selfish brat. They wholeheartedly believe that they do everything for the household. The fact that my bank account went from well over $2000 in checking alone to not even $150 in both my checking and savings accounts isn't enough proof as to what I've done for them this summer. They don't care. They think that because they make the car payments and pay my phone bill that I don't know anything about how to live on my own. They won't even let me try to drive in the city because they know I'll fail regardless and use that as an excuse to not let me do things on my own. I told them that I was planning on taking a paid internship with free housing next summer and even though ""I do nothing around the house"",  I need money to afford college and I don't have a lot of job experience they're totally against it. I'm in the wrong for not seeing them as the victims in every situation. My mother has admitted to checking out of my life 10 years ago but still stands strong on the 'I did my best to be a mother' point. Dad lost his job and doesn't pay his bills on time, but I'm the one who can't function in the real world.

TLDR: My parents are dicks and as ready as I am to get out but their sabotaging tactics are too strong."

5199lu,1,2016-09-05,I [20M] am questioning my sexual attraction to my boyfriend [21M] and I don't know how to address it.,retalliate,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5199lu/i_20m_am_questioning_my_sexual_attraction_to_my/,"I've been dating my boyfriend for the past 9 or so months. We've been very happy with each other, but we've constantly been in a long distance relationship. We met at a convention this past winter break, and decided that even though we attended schools that were a 5-hour drive apart, we'd test out a relationship. 

Within the first month, things went much better than expected. We were able to visit each other about once every other week and that worked out fine for the spring term. Over the summer, I had an internship in London and we couldn't afford to see each other, so we spent the majority of the summer apart. We did get to visit for a few weeks when I returned, but right now I'm on a term abroad in Japan and I'll be returning in January to see him the next time.

I believe we've done a really good job at keeping up this constant long-distance relationship. We love each other and we care for each other even when we're on opposite sides of the planet. My parents really like him, and although his parents don't approve of a gay relationship, they're very pleasant with me and like me just the same. I've been really happy in our relationship and I could possibly see us getting married some time in the future.

However, I've had a pressing issue of sex come up recently. We've been sexually active for basically all the time we've been together. Whenever we see each other, we always schedule some time for sex just so we don't miss out on the opportunity. I've always had issues staying hard throughout sex, though, and recently, we've both had trouble finishing for lack of energy or maybe interest.

I realized the last time we had sex that if I imagined some of the guys I was previously attracted to before we were in a relationship, it was much easier to stay aroused than when I was imagining my boyfriend. I regretted the decision to think this though, because I feel completely sick and wrong for thinking of somebody else during sex. I found it revealing about myself that I felt I wasn't terribly sexually attracted to my boyfriend.

We both understand that sex is a small part of our relationship, but I feel that it has an important role in our dynamic as a couple. I don't want to bring this up with him (yet) but I'm struggling with how to deal with this in the meantime. In addition, since I've been away on exchange, one of my friends here, who I'm attracted to, has been toying around with the idea of having sex since we're both away from our boyfriends, and I'm starting to think this could be a fun change. My boyfriend and I are supposed to be in an open relationship this term while I'm abroad, but I know he's going to wait for me and I don't want to hurt him if I have fun over here. 

My boyfriend is really great and I would hate to have this issue tear us apart considering we care for each other this much. I'm really excited to see him in January already, but the thought of having sex with somebody I'm not that sexually attracted to is stressing me out.
  
  ---   
  
tl;dr been in a very long-distance relationship with my boyfriend for 9 months and even though we love each other a lot, I don't think I'm sexually attracted to him. I won't be seeing him for 4 months because I'm abroad and the thought of having sex with other guys is much more appealing. We're really happy in our relationship besides the sex so we wouldn't want to break up on this basis."

Cyber Law has been my favourite subject in university. I love informatics and I know some basic programming. I'd like to look for internships about this kind of things, but I'm honestly very confused about work opportunities available. I've found a really cool institution in the EU about data protection, for example, but what else? Do you have suggestion on what kind of institutions/companies I could try to ask internships?

I am an engineering intern (not intern as in student but intern as in working towards professional licensing) and I am trying to keep all the professional things I learn neat and organized using OneNote. I am realizing just how unorganized I am and how much my mind mind needs organization to function. I'm becoming what I would call scatter brained because things mentally and digitally are so badly organized.

This realization has put me on the path to learning a system of organization but I just can't seem to get things locked down and the multitude of options/decisions is paralyzing me in moving forward. 

There are two types of notebooks I'm trying to create:

1. Knowledge based - This is where I will keep detailed notes of the things I learn as fundamentals, infrequent design/engineering issues that won't be reinforced repetitively, questions and answers section, troubleshooting for software used, etc.

2. Project Specific - This is where I will keep all the design specific information, files, etc. for a specific project. For example, which building codes were used when designing a storm drain, and any design specific deviations and reasons. I would also, like to have an ""at a glance sheet"" which would be one page of less detail design info for the project. 

I've tried to make these but have found that my categories are often redundant or too vague/specific to be useful, and it seems the more aware I become of being unorganized the more trouble I have overcoming the disorganization.

Any help/direction/advice you can offer will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in Advance."

Smoked for almost 3 years, last 2 years were daily. Last smoke was 8/19/2015. More details below of my story. I wanted to lay it all out in case it helps someone. Stick with it, don’t be discouraged by what I write. Even through the good and bad days, quitting has been the best decision I’ve ever made. Feel free to ask me any questions about this process! 

--


*Withdrawals:*   
-night terrors / sweats (about 2 months)  
-very intense dreams (about 4 months)  
-depression, irritability (about 5-6 months)  
-cravings (intense first two months, eased up but I still have the occasional dream and wake up craving)   
-headaches (first month)  
During withdrawals, it’s important that you stay busy. I think having a goal, or something small to work on each day is really important. My brain was used to being entertained with THC all day, and even things I used to enjoy like reading felt like an uphill battle to enjoy again.   

**My Story**


   I realize I’ve now passed one year without weed. It seems impossible that I’m even writing this. I started smoking when I was 19, my sophomore year of college. I stopped when I was 22. I know compared to some people here that isn’t much time. I went from a ‘once a week with friends’ smoker to a ‘multiple times a day alone’ smoker within that time. It was really fun for about a year and a half. Then it became less fun, more filled with feelings of guilt and anxiety. Then, after an experience I explain below, it became not fun at all – simply something I did, because I was very unsure about my life path and didn’t know what else to do.  


--


   I quit three months after graduating college, and I was about to move home to live with my parents because I hadn’t secured a full time job yet. I have to admit, my biggest success factor in staying clean was that I moved away and lost all my contacts, and didn’t have a lot of friends. It kept me clean, but not very sane. I felt quite alone during this process.   

--


   Overall, I knew it wasn’t working. My life wasn’t moving in the direction I wanted it to, and I had to know if it was because the weed. My grades slipped toward the end of college. I had a smaller friend group, mostly comprised of stoners. I thought we were really great friends, until I didn’t smoke with them and it seemed like there was little to do or talk about. I had no interest in my career or where/when I was going to get a job. I had an internship at the time and figured I’d move home with my parents if it didn’t pan out to be a full time job. That’s exactly what happened. Smoking weed always led to self-fulfilling prophecies of self sabotage. When I was feeling uncertain (which was always), there was one thing I could count on, one thing that could ease my mind – “If this doesn’t work out, I’ll just smoke some weed and know that I could’ve done it if I tried harder”. I needed to know if I could do it. About 6 months before I quit, there was also a pretty intense experience where I was kicked off a plane at the Denver airport for passing out because I had eaten an entire chocolate weed bar (can’t let it go to waste! – ugh). That was definitely my dramatic “bottom”. I continued to smoke until August 2015, but every time I smoked after that I had anxiety and bad feelings.   

--


   To really seal in my need to quit, I like to look at my last week smoking. Leading up to quitting for good, I had 30 days sober, mostly because I was broke. My friends and coworkers knew I wasn’t smoking at the time to save money, and had planned a last hoorah before I moved away. On 8/15/2015 (yes, I remember the date. I wonder if I’ll always remember these dates. It shows how strong my connection was to letting go of the green.), I smoked with two coworkers. On the clock. Something I never thought I’d do. We took a break, left a few other people in charge for an hour, and went outside behind a fence and smoked. It felt dumb. Just, why am I here smoking with these kids on the clock? It felt like a new low, but I was flattered that they wanted to say goodbye in a meaningful way. On 8/19/2015, I had my apartment packed up. I drove back to campus to smoke with an old buddy and former dealer. We got super high, and sat at his pool with our feet in the water. I felt light headed, and it was so fucking hot outside (August in Texas), my nasal cavity felt like it was swelling up and the humidity was making it hard to breathe. I was definitely having a freak out in my head, caused by the weed. I was speaking slowly, acting dumb. I remember being frustrated with myself, like once again- what am I doing? Saying goodbye to a good friend by having a meaningless, dumb conversation that seems like a chore to get out of me? I wished I was sober. I wished I could joke and laugh and tell stories without this hindrance of being so stoned. In that moment, I realized weed was a handicap on my true personality, keeping me from connecting and sharing myself. I left that night feeling alone.   


--

   These two smoking experiences, combined with the previous 30 days I had sober, made me say goodbye for good. I had quit for a month, achieved the oh-so-coveted-low-tolerance, smoked with good friends, and it still wasn’t fun anymore. I knew the jig was up. The next morning, 8/20/2015, I threw away my pipe in the dumpster, left my sublease check and key on the counter, and drove home. The next few months of scattered employment and no friends were hard. I credit my parents for their support during this time. I also began seeing a therapist for anxiety and worked out some things. I finally found a full time job in November of 2015 and moved out of my parents house a couple of months ago. I still have days where I want to smoke. It isn’t always a conscious thought of “man I want to smoke right now”, but the empty, bored, anxious spaces of my life that I used to fill with smoking are now wide-open and I have to feel. I have to work through things. There is no escape.   

--


   Somewhat related note about sobriety- I also was a typical binge drinker in college. I say typical, because I never drank alone, and probably only drank 2-4 times a month, but when I did it was usually to the point of blackout. I decided to cut that out of my life too, out of fear it would escalate without the weed. I’m glad for that decision as well, but socializing and networking has definitely been hard without alcohol.

   Out of fear of rambling like my stoner days, I’ll end it here. Thanks for reading this far, and thanks for coming to this sub to look inward and make a change. The fight is worth it!

A “friend” raped me at a party.  It changed my life forever.  When the drugs that he gave me started kicking in, he said he could see that I wasn’t feeling good and offered to help me lay down.  I was being raped over and over again just a few feet away from my friends.  No one came to save me.  When the drugs wore off the next morning, I came to with him still on top of me.  I was beyond confused.  He told me I wanted it and that I had said “No” to him too many times.  He actually tried to explain how his actions were justified.  Thinking about that drives me absolutely insane, as if once I understood it would all be okay.  


I didn’t speak for almost an entire day.  It wasn’t until the next day that I would put it all together.  
I was registering for classes at college, I was helped by a man who had initially came up behind me and touched my shoulder.  I couldn’t understand why in that moment I felt so overwhelmed.  He took me back to his office in the very back corner of the building.  He looked me up and down a few times and continued making me feel uncomfortable.  All I wanted was to sign up for classes and move on with my life, eager to put the past behind me.   Sitting in this man’s office I began to feel like the walls were closing in and I couldn’t breath.  Tears began rolling down my face.  I bolted out of the room and away from the threat of this man.  A couple people shouted, asking if I was okay.  But I didn’t stop till I got out to my car.

This was the first time I actually admitted to myself what had happened to me.  I didn’t know what to do.  I still couldn’t catch my breath, I was shaking and sweating and couldn’t think clearly.  It was obvious that I needed help.  I understand now I was experiencing a panic attack.

Realizing what had happened shook me to the core.  I phoned my father and was able to get out that I was coming over to tell him something.  Mentally realizing what happened and saying it out loud to someone else proved to be excruciatingly difficult.  He drove me to the ER.  I took a rape kit and had my injuries documented.  The drugs I was told had come out of my system, but the detective, who has been doing this for 30 years, assured me that it had been in my system.  She documented all of it, the tears, the bruises.  It’s taken years to not break down anymore when I see a bruise on my body.  

My father drove me to the police station after the ER.  That was another horrific experience, having these men laugh me out of there and telling me to go home.  I cannot express the rage that this experience caused.  I came for help but what I got was a lesson in great injustice and soon learned how common this was.  I have been very sensitive to injustice since.

I was so determined to become an LMRT and Medical assistant.  I worked during the day and went to class at night.  I carried on the best way I could.  But it wasn’t long before the panic attacks became more frequent and more intense.  I eventually had to quit my job because as much as I tried to move past the incident, it kept coming back, like it was happening to me at that moment. 

 I almost didn’t finish school because when I got to class, sometimes I couldn’t walk in.  I was in a class where I was the only girl and the rest were men.  Despite this I did finish and worked 6 months of unpaid, full-time, internship.  I was hired by the urgent care immediately after I finished.  I was so proud!  I had overcome so much to be where I felt I belonged.  

In less than a year of working there, I was pushed against the wall and touched inappropriately by a doctor.   I did nothing.  I was in shock.  When the doctor did that to me it caused the flashbacks to intensify.  The panic attacks became even more frequent and severe; I could no longer work with this person.  I told HR under threat of termination, they said it would stay between us.  It didn’t.  

HR called me back to let me know that they questioned the doctor and he said I had misinterpreted the situation.  The pain of that sting hurts me every time I think about it.  I quit that job to get away from him and took a new job at a different urgent care.  I had my fist panic attack a week after I started because him and I came face to face.  He wasn’t a patient, he was the new doctor.  Not only that but he worked out at my gym.  My gym had become my safe haven of sorts and was what I felt like was keeping me together. 

 I was scared but told HR about what had happened before with him and how I felt it had been mishandled.  They assured me I wouldn’t have to work with him and that they would schedule me around him.  But the schedules got mixed up, a lot.  And every time I saw him I lost it and was so inconsolable that I would have to go home or get someone to come get me because I would shake so bad I couldn’t drive.  I stayed for a little over a year before I had a complete breakdown. 

 I walked out of work one day and checked myself into the first of two psychiatric hospitals in a year.  I wasn’t able to hold down a steady job after that.  The medication I had been prescribed contributed to me gaining 20 in just a few months.  That was really hard for me to deal with, I had never been that big before and was uncomfortable in my new, expanded body.  I wasn’t used to the looks, comments, and judgments now being thrown my way.  It certainly didn’t help that I was in such a fragile state already.  I mean for me my life had just become so out of control and terrifying.  I no longer had my career, independence, body, engagement, or sanity.  I am still recovering from that.  


I have to learn who I am all over again.  She is so different to me.  She’s timid, reclusive- to the point of agoraphobia, not trusting, angry …so much anger.  Feeling out of control is such a scary place to be.  I had always prided myself on my grace but now it seems as if it’s been bled dry and only hostility remains. Even though she scares me I must get to know this new me so that I can understand and heal her. 

 It’s been years and I must focus on my healing every single day.  This incident has had an impact on every aspect of my life.  I work gigs when I can, practice yoga and meditation, journal, seek out joy, I still have to push myself out of the house but at least I’m taking that first step out of the door.  That’s not something I could say even just a few months ago.  

I have weaned myself off medication after some intense suicidal urges.  I have so far to go, so much to do and learn and that’s okay because I’m on my way. 

 I feel strong for the first time in a long time, I’ve missed this immensely.  I find it necessary to share my story as part of my healing process.  Giving my story actual words and then turning it loose, I’m hoping, will be extremely liberating.  I feel that because my story has so ingrained itself into my everyday life that I would always have to carry it.  I could never figure out how to let it go so I’m hoping this will help.  This is the first time I’ve ever written this, down.  It is, without a doubt, the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to write.  I hope this helps you know that you are not alone.  This is part of the process of regaining my life.  I must first regain my voice.  

I still struggle with rage and some days it’s all I can do to get out of bed.  I still cringe when someone touches me.  Even if it’s a girlfriend touching my arm, it still makes me jump.  I have tried to forgive the person and their transgressions against me.  I might even have to do it everyday for the rest of my life just to get through.  If that’s what it takes I will do it.   

I still don’t have the right answers for how to support myself but I have learned how incredibly passionate I am about metal health.  I deeply want to help others affected by it that are lost and scared like I was.  I want to be the hand to others that I needed so desperately.  What that translates to, I don’t know but I am heading in that direction.  And for right now that’s good enough for me.

Should I try to learn German?,radioflyerCO,German,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/51b4i3/i_need_advice_should_i_try_to_learn_german/,"So this is my first time posting.  I'm a senior in college and this past summer during my internship I developed a close friendship with another intern from Germany. He's slightly older than I am and has a full time job at a company in Hamburg.  He said if I could become at least proficient in German, he'd be willing to get me an interview with his boss, so I might be able to work in Germany (which having lived my whole life in the US would be spectacular).  However, I'm a little skeptical at the plausibility of this feat as I've heard German is very difficult to learn. So I have a couple questions: 1) would this even be possible/should I even try?  and 2) if it is possible, how much time would I need to devote to become proficient by say May 2017? Keep in mind I'm in my final year of college and have a full course load and part-time job, but I am motivated and could devote a reasonable amount of time.

Also, my friend said that he has a german friend that would like to improve his english. Should I take advantage of this and try to Skype with his friend and teach each other our native languages?"

After debating getting dreads for a while I decided to get crocheted dreads for the sake of convenience, namely getting over the awkward stages of dreads while still having to attend school and my internship. But I've found myself regretting getting crocheted dreads pretty quickly. I feel like they're falling apart in just a few days since there's loose hairs all over and my loctician told me that I wasn't allowed to wash my hair at all with these types of dreads (something I'm not in favor of). My loctician was also super vague and with her answers or would just straight up get annoyed at my questions so I'm at a bit of a loss at the moment.      

I still want to keep my dreads but was wondering if it's possible to let the crocheted dreads sorta transition into natural dreads. Will the new growth still dread naturally if I leave the crochet dreads? 
     
Any idea how intensive the damage to my hair is from this one session of crocheting? While it was being done I could hear so much hair ripping and it's made me a bit nervous.

It started with a M, or an H, but he couldn't quite remember which. Leaning forward, he pressed a button on his desk, and the intercom crackled to life. ""Who's appointment is next?""

A young, bouncy female voice answered, sounding ecstatic just being alive. ""The two o'clock is Mr. Shackleton, Doctor!""

With a grunt, he leaned back again, releasing the intercom button, and scribbled down the name. Apparently it wasn't an M *or* an H. Filling out the rest of the form, he paused at the last section.

*Reason for therapy: _________________*

Glancing up at the clock, Dr. Silverstone saw that it read 2:03. Shackleton was late. Leaving the last spot blank, he placed the pen and clipboard down, and was just about to reach for the intercom again when it turned on by itself. He could practically feel the smile through the intercom when she said, ""The two o'clock has arrived, Doctor!""

Frowning, he glared at the speaker that lay on his desk. She must be new. No one smiled for long when they worked next to him. 

He was about to stand up, when the door opened, and a small, rather disheveled man peered in. ""Is this the right place?""

Dr. Silverstone raised his eyebrows. ""There's only one office in this building, so unless you wanted to find an empty room to cry in, this is where you need to be."" He gestured to the red couch that lay in front of his desk, and rolled his own chair around, scooping up the clipboard as he went. 

Hesitantly, the man sat down on the edge of the couch, and folded his hands in front of him. For a brief moment, he was still, but then he started nervously tapping his shoe. Dr. Silverstone watched this with a skeptical eye, until the man noticed, and forced himself to stop

""Lie down, make yourself comfortable."" While the sentence was amiable enough, the doctors tone made it sound more like a threat. A grumpy threat. Glancing down at his clipboard, he took off his glasses. ""You are... Mr Shackleton, right?""

The man had started wringing his hands, but he lay down obediently. ""Nackleton, actually. Timothy Nackleton."" 

""Hmph."" Silverstone scribbled a note down. He probably hadn't felt like correcting the intern when she got his name wrong. ""Well, I suppose we had better get to work, then."" Glancing over at the figity man, he frowned. ""Put your arms at your sides and hold still, for Pete's sake.""

Puzzled, Nackleton slowly obeyed. ""Um, excuse me, but... are you really a therapist, sir?""

""What makes you say that, Nackle?"" growled Dr Silverstone. He fumbled around on his desk for a moment, looking for something. 

The man frowned. ""I thought therapists were supposed to be... I dunno, nice and cheerful, or something.""

Finally finding the thing he was looking for, a black remote, he rolled his chair back to the couch, and checked Nackleton over, tucking in any bits that stuck out too far. ""Never liked those half-witted excuses for therapists, always dancing around the issue with their *talking* and their *sympathizing*. It's much simpler just to get to the root of the problem."" With that, he pressed a big red button on the remote.

Immediately, large metal bands slid out from under the couch and wrapped themselves around Mr. Nackleton, securing his so tightly they knocked the air out of him. A feeble scream escaped his lips.

Guiding his chair back around behind the desk, Dr. Silverstone punched in a couple more buttons on the remote. Bright lights flared from each corner, and a panel opened in the wall, revealing an array of glowing weapons, from a tiny, shining dagger, to a massive broadsword. Picking up a pair of curved blades, he swung them around experimentally.

""Wha... What's going on?"" Nackleton was frantic, struggling against his bonds. ""Who are you? What are you going to do to me?"" He paused, gasping from the exertion. 

""I'm your therapist, Mr Nackleton. This is going to be your first, and hopefully *only* session."" Discarding the dual swords, he picked up an axe, the head glowing with an unearthly light. He tested the edge on his finger, and it passed right through, leaving an ice cold wake behind it. Hefting it over his shoulder, he turned back toward the couch, and pressed one more button on the remote. ""Lets get started.""

Immediately, the couch started to glow, and Nackleton screamed again, holding it out for several seconds before running out of breath. Gasping, he screamed again, but this time it was deeper, strange coming from a man so small. This time it didn't stop, instead just getting louder and louder, until it shook the walls.

A dark blob appeared on Nackleton's chest, and quickly grew. Looking carefully, Dr. Silverstone decided the slight tinge of blue probably meant it was anxiety, which made sense, considering how nervous the man seemed. 

It got bigger and bigger, leaving Nackleton's chest and stretching up to the ceiling. It was enormous, bigger than anything Silverstone had seen before, and he had to suppress a twitch. Anxiety fed off of fear, so it was better to give it as little as possible.

Finally, it stopped ballooning. At the top, a gaping mouth appeared, stretching wide. The wailing continued, but by now it was clearly inhuman, a screech beyond the reach of human vocal chords.

Rather suddenly, the screaming stopped, and the blob slithered off of the glowing couch to the ground. Above the dripping maw, two sideways slits opened, each with a mass of tiny blue dots. The swirling eyes gazed down at Silverstone. 

Not wasting a moment, the doctor swung his axe, aiming to slice it clean in two. It hissed, and slid away from the blow. It stretched out, getting thinner and longer, until it resembled an enormous, oozy snake. Curling up, it watched Silverstone carefully.

Lifting his axe defensively, he stalked closer to the beast, watching for any movement. With every step forward, it curled tighter and tighter, looking ready to strike. 

But he was ready for it. He feigned forward, and the anxiety struck, mouth gaping wide. Dodging to the side, he swung the axe in a small arc, and the glowing blade sliced right through the neck of the snake as it flew by.

The two separate pieces fell to the ground with a heavy thud. The cut edges started dissolving, and he kicked them into a corner to finish disappearing. With a sigh, Silverstone sat back down, placing the axe casually on his desk.

Scooping up the clipboard and pen, he scribbled down a summary of the session. Halfway through, a huffing got his attention. Nackleton was still bound to the couch, and he was watching the snake dissolve with wide eyes. ""What *was* that?"" Glancing briefly at the doctor, his eyes focused on the glowing axe. ""Did you just... kill it?""

""That was your Anxiety, Nackle. It's gone, for now. You get to experience a bit of freedom from it."" Peering over the clipboard, he looked Nackleton in the eyes. ""But you can't be lazy about it. If you let it, it'll simply grow back.""

Nackleton wouldn't look at him, instead gazing over Silverstone's shoulder, avoiding eye contact. ""Why'd you kill the snake, but not that one?""

There was a moment of silence.

And then Silverstone spun around, twisting the cap on his pen as he went. A glittering blade burst from the tip of the pen, and he swung out behind him.

But he was too late. Something small and fast hit his face, knocking him from the chair. They hit the ground, and Silverstone dropped the pen, instead grabbing frantically at the tiny demon that snarled and scribbled at his eyes. It was strong, and at the ends of its hands and feet were sharp claws.

When he finally got a grip on it, he peeled it from his face, and held it up. From the glimpses he got, he saw no color, aside from its eye, which was a single ball of dark red hate. It was a suicidal thought, the most dangerous of all.

It scratched at his wrists, trying to get closer to him, and it was all he could do to hold it in place. Rolling over, he pinned it against the floor with his whole body weight, and reached out for his pen with his free hand. Snatching up the blade, he lifted up and stabbed at the ground beneath him.

There was nothing there, and the blade stabbed into the floor, stopping at the pen hilt. It hit with such force that the pen snapped, and the blade fizzled away.

Abandoning useless pen, he whirled around, just in time to see the little dark demon launch itself toward him again, and he raised his arms to cover his face.

Between his arms, he saw a flash of light, and a horrible gurgling noise. When nothing happened, he peeked out.

The demon lay on the floor, cut clean in half, and a young woman wearing a sweater and jeans stood before it. She was holding one of the swords from the rack, and she lowered it. She wiped her brow and grinned at the doctor. ""Whew! Good thing I came in when I did, huh?""

He recognized her voice from the intercom, and gazed at her disbelievingly. ""You're the new intern?""

She smiled even wider, teeth shining almost as much as the sword. ""Yep! Heard some weeeird noises in here, so I decided to see if you needed any help. Saw the little monster and a bunch of glowing weapons, so I did what seemed the most prudent. I stabbed the little bugger with the first thing I could get my hands on!"" She stuck her hand out to help him up. ""This was certainly an interesting first day on the job!""

Taking her hand and standing up, he gave her a once over. She was spattered in dark flecks, held a glowing sword, and had possibly just saved his life. Despite himself, Dr. Silverstone grinned back at her. Maybe this one was a keeper. 

From the couch, Nacklton cleared his throat. ""So... do I pay at the front?"""
51bm5a,1,2016-09-05,General Feedback on how the interview went,ragingWater_,Programming_Interview,https://www.reddit.com/r/Programming_Interview/comments/51bm5a/general_feedback_on_how_the_interview_went/,"Hi guys,
So I had my telephonic interview a few days ago, and wanted a general view from you guys on how it went.
The interview was supposed to be 45 minutes but ended up at the 40 minute mark. At the start of it I was asked to introduce myself, I had something in my mind which was around 5 lines (This was a technical interview for a Software Intern) after which the technical questions were asked. The first question was an implementation based question which I had already seen but this time the question had a twist (we had a shared code-editor) . So I explained my approach and was able to code it in around 5 minutes (this includes the time required to explain the approach as well as code it). He made me dry run the code on a sample input and the code didnt have any problems and the interviewer said ""It looks good"" and asked me the next question. The next question was to find the sum of three numbers in an array whose sum is 0. I had previously seen the same question, but rather than acknowledging it, I tried my best to explain the approach, starting from how to solve it for 2 numbers and then proceeded to tell him if I can fix one number in the 3 number tuple , how can we search for the remaining 2 numbers in the array, by first sorting the array and using 2 pointers. I asked him if the approach was good enough or if it needed some refinements. He asked me to go ahead and code it. I did the same but this time he did not ask me to dry run the code and said ""it looks good"". We were at the 25 minute mark now and had around 20 more minutes to spend. So he asked me regarding my previous internships and some more personality questions. By now we were at the 35 minute mark. He enquired if I had any questions for him, I did and asked him ""about the challenges which he faced with his work"" and ""what do you look for in candidates"" . We were at the 40 minute mark when the interviewer himself said ""I will be ending the interview a bit early, and your recruiter should get back to you in a week"". 
So honest opinion, how do you think I fared? 
And are there any negative markers ?"
51c2n3,35,2016-09-05,I am very lost,neverbeen47,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/51c2n3/i_am_very_lost/,"I'm in a place where I never expected to be. I was raised in a large, well educated, Mormon family outside of any very Mormon place. We moved around quite a bit and the church was a wonderful kind of constant in my life. It was a time when my family was all together and no matter where we moved we were welcomed and accepted. I enjoyed serving in the church as an aaronic priesthood holder and enjoyed hanging out with the other youth. I liked studying the gospel (although I rarely read my scriptures because I hate reading), and felt comforted during some very tragic times in my life (the death of my high school coach, father's heart attack, sister's attempted suicide and throughout my military training). Along with those comforting times there have been what have seemed to be undeniable spiritual experiences that I still treasure to this day. 

I went on to serve a foreign mission and was super obedient and worked super hard to do what I felt was right. I tried hard to be a kind companion and to share happiness with other people. There mission was the first time my testimony was really tested, and I came to the conclusion that the gospel was good, because it brought happiness into my life, and seemingly into the lives of those I was close to. This is what motivated me to share it. I had a wonderful mission president who was a convert and a wonderful example, and welcomed honest discussion. The area presidency (70s) was very different. There was one counselor that I really didn't like. He didn't seem very Christ-like to be and seemed to teach missionary methods which went against peach my gospel, so in a couple mission leadership councils I went head to head with him and it worked out pretty well. That's not so relevant to this post other than that I have never believed in blind following or in the Lord's anointed being perfect. 

I returned from my mission to military service and found that the church was still a wonderful influence in my life. I appreciate the fellowship and many of the standards (not drinking, being nice to people, etc.). I met a non member girl and fell in love. She was amazing and I invited her to church with me a couple times. After a couple years while I was out of state on an internship she met with the missionaries and got baptized. I tried really hard not to flirt to convert. After a year we got married in the temple and left on our honeymoon. We've been married now for 3 months and love each other a lot. 

For the first month we were traveling a lot and didn't go to church much. The last two months we've been super good Mormons just like we have always been. But it wasn't the same and I see everything differently now. This weekend I read [this article](http://nyti.ms/2bMo9Kx) by my favorite NYT columnist about how Christianity is now about the establishment than Christ's example these days, and I struck too close to home. 

The things I have always valued in the church are the fundamental teachings about empathy and service but those are so clouded to me now by the things like the lack of transparency from church leadership and what seems to be no connection between a heaven and the apostles. 

I have never ignored or shunned anti Mormon literature (I have read exmormon forums since I was a teen-ager, and have eagerly read each essay as they have been released), but suddenly everything has come down around me. How can the church publish that the book of Abraham is not a translation, and still include the facsimiles and their translations as scripture? 

Anyways I don't know what I will do but it helps to write this down, because I have a big test tomorrow because these thoughts have been keeping me from any sort of concentration. When I told my wife how I felt yesterday she seemed okay with it and was very supportive, and it made me look back (hindsight 20-20) and realize that she really did everything in the church for me, which makes me a little sad because that was the opposite of what I wanted, but I appreciate her support a lot. We probably won't go back to church but I want to be careful. I don't want to do the wrong thing. Although I don't like some things about the exmormon community, especially the anger and bitterness, I appreciate the honesty that I find here and I really just needed someone to share this with, so thanks. I'll probably reach out to some of my old companions, siblings and my mission president for their opinions too.

Edit: I guess I should add that another huge problem between the church and me is the sanctioned patriarchy and sexism. I can't imagine rasing a future daughter in a church that relegates her into a lower tier box. "

I'll try to make my background info as brief as possible and just lay out the main points here.

I am an incoming 4th year at a fairly competitive undergraduate school in CA.  I am pursuing a degree in the sciences.

I have a 3.88 GPA, although my sGPA is a bit lower (3.7 maybe?).

I have taken most of the prerequisite classes necessary for med school.

I have not done any clinical medicine internships

I have worked in a neurology lab (...for many many hours and 6+ months, although I recently quit this to pursue an opening in another lab)

I pride myself in my self-discipline and hard work and am fairly confident I could do well if I put in major hours for the MCAT; however, I do not know if I will be embarking upon a fool's errand, so to speak, if I decide to pursue this so late in the game.

I have heard from many people (including my college's faculty members) that GPA and MCAT scores are prioritized more than anything, which is why I even bother to ask at all.

Any advice is appreciated!

51d8rs,35,2016-09-05,My life is just a facade.,this-is-a-confession,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/51d8rs/my_life_is_just_a_facade/,"Here I am again.

I never thought, and I had hoped, that I would be in this situation again. The fake life I have built. This fake happiness that could never last. I built it up, knowing it would come back to haunt me, and so it has.

I am 22 years old. Male. And a two time college dropout. Growing up I always wanted to be like anyone else, and was told the same things that everyone else was; go to school, get good grades, go to college, get a job etc. It's all that was ever wanted of me, and not a very difficult task either. Yet from a young age I never had interest in school. I never failed a class in highschool, but I never had really good grades like my brother. He was always the best of our parents children, straight A's and good at soccer. My younger sister is a close second, while not as naturally talented or intelligent she has an amazing drive and work ethic. She knows how to study. Both would study, get good grades, follow the rules and be model children.

And I never was. And I never will be. 

Growing up I wouldn't follow the rules, I'd question everything, why do this and why do that. The usual unruly child. I don't like to think of myself as a bad kid, but I was certainly the trouble maker of the family. I would steal simple things like a piece of candy or two, never anything of true value until I was a teenager. I wanted to, but I was afraid. Of getting caught, yes, but not by the store or anything. Always the fear was of my parents.

And so it still is.

I fear my parents. I was raised not to love and respect them, but to be afraid. Always my achievements were hushed away and asked why I could not do better. Why could I not be like my brother? Why couldn't I do as well as the kid down the street? Oh, look how nicely their kids behave, why can't you be like that? And always when I would bring up a comparison I was told to not compare myself to others, when that was all they ever did. I can't help but compare myself to others. Even now I look at my friends, who I haven't made enough of an effort to see this summer, progressing through their degrees and graduating and getting jobs and travelling the world. I wish so desperately to be normal.. I think about it a lot. What is it like to be someone else? What is it like to be normal? I know that no one really is normal and we all have our own lives growing up, and that many people probably think this way. But I can't help but wish and wonder. What is it like to not be depressed? I have dealt with it silently and alone my entire adult life, since I was 14. Usually seasonal, but I've had springs and summers as well with no drive and no feeling, just going through the motions. That first year, freshman year of highschool, I tried to tell my parents. They shoved it back in my face and told me to stop pretending just because I wanted attention. So now almost 10 years later I suffer still silent, though I know they have grown as I have grown. It would be ignorant to pretend things are the same.

But I fear so much opening up to anyone. There are so many things I have never told anyone. So many wishes, thoughts, malicious in nature that have been shoved deep and ignored. One in particular I've been thinking a lot about the last few weeks. My dad is the type of person that if there is any possible way he can do it himself, he will. I, not my brother, was always the one to be roped into it. For many this would be a bonding experience, and I truly wish they had been. My dad has a short temper and no acceptance for error. Any little thing I did wrong was met with harsh words and a raised voice in anger. I resented him for it, and still do. Years ago, so much more than that. I hated him, I truly despised being called to help him. There were specific times I remember I wanted to kill him. And I almost did. I was so close, once. We were redoing our basement and I was helping him put up a new wall. He was angry because things weren't going well, swearing and yelling at me for not doing well enough as always. He was kneeling on the ground, and I was behind him. The hammer was in my hand. I was so enraged in that moment, I thought about striking him in the head and truly ending him. I wanted it. I thought about how I could claim it was an accident, perhaps it fell off the ladder and struck him in the head. In the end the only thing that stopped me was fear and my own greed. As much as I hated him I needed the house. I at least was old enough to understand that my life would not be better if I killed him. But my god I wanted to bash his head in.

There was a friend when I was younger that was one of the cool kids. I wasn't part of that group, so of course I wanted to hang out with him as much as I could, despite one thing: he would kiss me. I don't know why, and never will, but he would always catch me off guard and kiss me. Christmas time; mistle toe for example. Then at school he would tell everyone I would always try to kiss him, and always they believed him of course cause he was cool and I was not. Harassed for being gay, when I wasn't. I still struggle with my sexual identity, there are certainly some men I find attractive but the thought of any physical act repulses me, but part of me still wants it. I hate myself for it. I don't think I could fall in love with a man though. It's irrelevant.

I used to steal money from my parents when I was a teen, up until probably 17 and got a job for myself. I played league of legends, and wanted to buy skins. Over the years I probably stole around 150 dollars, and I don't think that there is any way that they didn't know, but I was never confronted about it. I don't know why. I still feel guilty about it. I was so ungrateful. They had money in a savings account for me for college, not a lot, but as much as they could afford with three kids. I didn't have an allowance, and so I justified my stealing by thinking I deserved it since I had no allowance and everyone else I knew did.. Maybe if I had had an allowance I would be better with my money today. I have a job that pays okay, and I have 500 dollars in my savings when I should have at least $2500. I spend so much money, and it's still on video games. My parents had $2000 in one of my accounts that was not at all mine; spent over the last two years. I have since quit LoL, but I've spent hundreds on CSGO this summer. I haven't bought anything in a few weeks, at least. I'm trying to be better. I want so badly to be better. 

I used to cut in high school. Not badly, and I have no scars. I am grateful for that. But I just wanted to feel, and the pain was more than being a shell, at least. And I wanted to relate with other kids I knew that cut and were proud of it in a way, they glorified it. But I always was trying to be someone I'm not, and I still do it to this day. I never had friends growing up except for one, and I treated him like shit. High school was the same until senior year, when I made friends for the first time with the stoner kids, because they were the only ones nice and accepting enough to let me be around. And that summer before college I smoked weed for the first time, and it was wonderful. I felt like I belonged, and I almost did.

In college the freedom was amazing, no one was telling me I wasn't good enough, except when my parents would call or text. I played a lot of games, but I made it through. I made friends with everyone on my floor, we all played a lot of video games, and I truly felt like I had friends who I actually fit in with when I was just being myself. That was the last time I really remember not being depressed half the year since I was 14. I didn't fail any classes until I got to sophomore year, when I lived in a different building with no option for transfer to theirs. My roommate moved out, and I started living in isolation. I started going to class less and less, and was drinking every day. Second semester I failed out of school. Telling my parents was the worst thing I've gone through, the crying and screaming and depression came reeling over me for weeks. I enrolled in a summer class of one of math classes I failed, and I actually did pass. I went to community college for a semester and dropped one class, but passed my other three. I reapplied to my original university and I got back in. Last summer, I was turning my life around after fucking it all up so badly.

And here I am again. Utterly FUCKED. Last fall I moved in to a house with some friends, and it was honestly a big mistake. I started smoking weed every day, and playing so many videogames. I blew off class again, thinking I could make it up later. In early October my school had a career fair, and I actually landed an internship at a fairly prestigious company within my major. Yet by the end of October I wasn't going to any of my classes and depression and anxiety (anxiety from smoking so much, truthfully) were in full swing. I failed out again, but didn't tell anyone. I kept pretending I was in school, though some days I wouldn't even leave my room or my bed. Months this went on for, and I assumed somehow that the company would find out I wasn't a student anymore, as they actually have really close ties with my former university. But somehow they never did, and my parents didn't find out either, and so I moved back home without the company or family or girlfriend knowing that I have failed out again. And thus has been the last few months of my life.

At work I thankfully have enough education to get by without anyone being suspicious, and from being scared into obedience I have a decent work ethic, when I'm not too depressed. I tried shrooms back the first week of July, and the last two months were, without a doubt, the most happy I've been in years. People at work like me, and two managers from different departments have both told me that they wish I could be with them permanently. My sister went back to school last week, and my brother left for a job in the southwest this week. And this is why I am fucked: when my Dad gets back from helping him move, they want to look over my student loan information with me. But there isn't any, because I failed out last fall. That is pretty much the only thing I feel like I have going for me, is that I'm not $6000 dollars in additional debt. But I do owe $3300 to my parents that could have been paid back if I wasn't so shitty at budgeting, despite some of my better efforts. And they will ask to see this information that I do not have, and there is no way out of the lie. No way around it any longer. Again there will be crying and yelling and more depression, and I'm clutching on to these last few days. I wish I was a better version of me. I know I could be, and I'm not. No matter how angry and disappointed my parents are going to be, there will be no one more angry or disappointed in me than I am. Years ago in anger my dad yelled at me that I should try not to be such a fuck up. And here I am. I tried, and I couldn't. I might get kicked out, and my internship lasts until December upon which I will have no job. Staying with the company is very unlikely as I won't be graduating and a job there would require it, and if I come clean they won't hire someone who has lied to their faces for 6 months. 

I am so fucked. I'm trying to think of next steps before depression sets in again, but the last few weeks I've started losing interest in all the things I like to do. It's getting harder to get out of bed in the morning. I'm not sleeping as well. I can feel it coming. This week I need to see if there is any chance at me getting back in to school for Spring semester, but even so I'll be another year behind what I already was from failing out the first time. I should be graduating but instead I have minimum two and a half years to go. I still smoke weed every day, and I am going to cut back or stop, if I can. It's starting to be a negative influence as it was last year, at least I can recognize it. I want to be happy, and I know that the biggest thing in the way is myself. But after all the conditioning, the comparing, the fear, I have such a shell that I never open to anyone and never have. I can't talk about how I feel because of the rejection and belittling those years ago. 

I am afraid. Afraid of my future, afraid of the coming depression, of the entire facade I have built myself up upon to come crashing down again. If I didn't exist this would be so much easier, though I will never kill myself. No matter what happens, that is my one vow to myself that I will always uphold. My life will go on, I don't know how or what will happen or when I will truly be happy as I was these last two months, but life will go on. As it always has, as it always will. 

I wish I could have been the person I thought I would be by now."

Growing up I wouldn't follow the rules, I'd question everything, why do this and why do that. The usual unruly child. I don't like to think of myself as a bad kid, but I was certainly the trouble maker of the family. I would steal simple things like a piece of candy or two, never anything of true value until I was a teenager. I wanted to, but I was afraid. Of getting caught, yes, but not by the store or anything. Always the fear was of my parents.
And so it still is.
I fear my parents. I was raised not to love and respect them, but to be afraid. Always my achievements were hushed away and asked why I could not do better. Why could I not be like my brother? Why couldn't I do as well as the kid down the street? Oh, look how nicely their kids behave, why can't you be like that? And always when I would bring up a comparison I was told to not compare myself to others, when that was all they ever did. I can't help but compare myself to others. Even now I look at my friends, who I haven't made enough of an effort to see this summer, progressing through their degrees and graduating and getting jobs and travelling the world. I wish so desperately to be normal.. I think about it a lot. What is it like to be someone else? What is it like to be normal? I know that no one really is normal and we all have our own lives growing up, and that many people probably think this way. But I can't help but wish and wonder. What is it like to not be depressed? I have dealt with it silently and alone my entire adult life, since I was 14. Usually seasonal, but I've had springs and summers as well with no drive and no feeling, just going through the motions. That first year, freshman year of highschool, I tried to tell my parents. They shoved it back in my face and told me to stop pretending just because I wanted attention. So now almost 10 years later I suffer still silent, though I know they have grown as I have grown. It would be ignorant to pretend things are the same.
But I fear so much opening up to anyone. There are so many things I have never told anyone. So many wishes, thoughts, malicious in nature that have been shoved deep and ignored. One in particular I've been thinking a lot about the last few weeks. My dad is the type of person that if there is any possible way he can do it himself, he will. I, not my brother, was always the one to be roped into it. For many this would be a bonding experience, and I truly wish they had been. My dad has a short temper and no acceptance for error. Any little thing I did wrong was met with harsh words and a raised voice in anger. I resented him for it, and still do. Years ago, so much more than that. I hated him, I truly despised being called to help him. There were specific times I remember I wanted to kill him. And I almost did. I was so close, once. We were redoing our basement and I was helping him put up a new wall. He was angry because things weren't going well, swearing and yelling at me for not doing well enough as always. He was kneeling on the ground, and I was behind him. The hammer was in my hand. I was so enraged in that moment, I thought about striking him in the head and truly ending him. I wanted it. I thought about how I could claim it was an accident, perhaps it fell off the ladder and struck him in the head. In the end the only thing that stopped me was fear and my own greed. As much as I hated him I needed the house. I at least was old enough to understand that my life would not be better if I killed him. But my god I wanted to bash his head in.
There was a friend when I was younger that was one of the cool kids. I wasn't part of that group, so of course I wanted to hang out with him as much as I could, despite one thing: he would kiss me. I don't know why, and never will, but he would always catch me off guard and kiss me. Christmas time; mistle toe for example. Then at school he would tell everyone I would always try to kiss him, and always they believed him of course cause he was cool and I was not. Harassed for being gay, when I wasn't. I still struggle with my sexual identity, there are certainly some men I find attractive but the thought of any physical act repulses me, but part of me still wants it. I hate myself for it. I don't think I could fall in love with a man though. It's irrelevant.
I used to steal money from my parents when I was a teen, up until probably 17 and got a job for myself. I played league of legends, and wanted to buy skins. Over the years I probably stole around 150 dollars, and I don't think that there is any way that they didn't know, but I was never confronted about it. I don't know why. I still feel guilty about it. I was so ungrateful. They had money in a savings account for me for college, not a lot, but as much as they could afford with three kids. I didn't have an allowance, and so I justified my stealing by thinking I deserved it since I had no allowance and everyone else I knew did.. Maybe if I had had an allowance I would be better with my money today. I have a job that pays okay, and I have 500 dollars in my savings when I should have at least $2500. I spend so much money, and it's still on video games. My parents had $2000 in one of my accounts that was not at all mine; spent over the last two years. I have since quit LoL, but I've spent hundreds on CSGO this summer. I haven't bought anything in a few weeks, at least. I'm trying to be better. I want so badly to be better.
I used to cut in high school. Not badly, and I have no scars. I am grateful for that. But I just wanted to feel, and the pain was more than being a shell, at least. And I wanted to relate with other kids I knew that cut and were proud of it in a way, they glorified it. But I always was trying to be someone I'm not, and I still do it to this day. I never had friends growing up except for one, and I treated him like shit. High school was the same until senior year, when I made friends for the first time with the stoner kids, because they were the only ones nice and accepting enough to let me be around. And that summer before college I smoked weed for the first time, and it was wonderful. I felt like I belonged, and I almost did.
In college the freedom was amazing, no one was telling me I wasn't good enough, except when my parents would call or text. I played a lot of games, but I made it through. I made friends with everyone on my floor, we all played a lot of video games, and I truly felt like I had friends who I actually fit in with when I was just being myself. That was the last time I really remember not being depressed half the year since I was 14. I didn't fail any classes until I got to sophomore year, when I lived in a different building with no option for transfer to theirs. My roommate moved out, and I started living in isolation. I started going to class less and less, and was drinking every day. Second semester I failed out of school. Telling my parents was the worst thing I've gone through, the crying and screaming and depression came reeling over me for weeks. I enrolled in a summer class of one of math classes I failed, and I actually did pass. I went to community college for a semester and dropped one class, but passed my other three. I reapplied to my original university and I got back in. Last summer, I was turning my life around after fucking it all up so badly.
And here I am again. Utterly FUCKED. Last fall I moved in to a house with some friends, and it was honestly a big mistake. I started smoking weed every day, and playing so many videogames. I blew off class again, thinking I could make it up later. In early October my school had a career fair, and I actually landed an internship at a fairly prestigious company within my major. Yet by the end of October I wasn't going to any of my classes and depression and anxiety (anxiety from smoking so much, truthfully) were in full swing. I failed out again, but didn't tell anyone. I kept pretending I was in school, though some days I wouldn't even leave my room or my bed. Months this went on for, and I assumed somehow that the company would find out I wasn't a student anymore, as they actually have really close ties with my former university. But somehow they never did, and my parents didn't find out either, and so I moved back home without the company or family or girlfriend knowing that I have failed out again. And thus has been the last few months of my life.
At work I thankfully have enough education to get by without anyone being suspicious, and from being scared into obedience I have a decent work ethic, when I'm not too depressed. I tried shrooms back the first week of July, and the last two months were, without a doubt, the most happy I've been in years. People at work like me, and two managers from different departments have both told me that they wish I could be with them permanently. My sister went back to school last week, and my brother left for a job in the southwest this week. And this is why I am fucked: when my Dad gets back from helping him move, they want to look over my student loan information with me. But there isn't any, because I failed out last fall. That is pretty much the only thing I feel like I have going for me, is that I'm not $6000 dollars in additional debt. But I do owe $3300 to my parents that could have been paid back if I wasn't so shitty at budgeting, despite some of my better efforts. And they will ask to see this information that I do not have, and there is no way out of the lie. No way around it any longer. Again there will be crying and yelling and more depression, and I'm clutching on to these last few days. I wish I was a better version of me. I know I could be, and I'm not. No matter how angry and disappointed my parents are going to be, there will be no one more angry or disappointed in me than I am. Years ago in anger my dad yelled at me that I should try not to be such a fuck up. And here I am. I tried, and I couldn't. I might get kicked out, and my internship lasts until December upon which I will have no job. Staying with the company is very unlikely as I won't be graduating and a job there would require it, and if I come clean they won't hire someone who has lied to their faces for 6 months.
I am so fucked. I'm trying to think of next steps before depression sets in again, but the last few weeks I've started losing interest in all the things I like to do. It's getting harder to get out of bed in the morning. I'm not sleeping as well. I can feel it coming. This week I need to see if there is any chance at me getting back in to school for Spring semester, but even so I'll be another year behind what I already was from failing out the first time. I should be graduating but instead I have minimum two and a half years to go. I still smoke weed every day, and I am going to cut back or stop, if I can. It's starting to be a negative influence as it was last year, at least I can recognize it. I want to be happy, and I know that the biggest thing in the way is myself. But after all the conditioning, the comparing, the fear, I have such a shell that I never open to anyone and never have. I can't talk about how I feel because of the rejection and belittling those years ago.
I am afraid. Afraid of my future, afraid of the coming depression, of the entire facade I have built myself up upon to come crashing down again. If I didn't exist this would be so much easier, though I will never kill myself. No matter what happens, that is my one vow to myself that I will always uphold. My life will go on, I don't know how or what will happen or when I will truly be happy as I was these last two months, but life will go on. As it always has, as it always will.
I wish I could have been the person I thought I would be by now."
51de0m,1,2016-09-05,Should I take an internship while I have it or wait for a better time?,cbo92,DCInterns,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCInterns/comments/51de0m/should_i_take_an_internship_while_i_have_it_or/,"I was recently fortunate enough to be offered an internship in for a congressman in my home state. At first, I was ecstatic that I was offered a position on Capitol Hill, especially from a congressman in my own state. The more I think about it, however, a few concerns are raised. Namely:

1. I need to pay down my debt. I have been barley getting by for close to six months and have ran up credit card debt in addition to student loans I already had. I recently moved out of an apartment and back to my parents to try and pay down debt/save some money in the next six-12 months while I look into pursuing a masters degree at local schools. This internship, which is unpaid for three months, would require me to take out a loan with my family and pay them back, which I don't want to do for comfort reasons. 

2. The congressman I would be working for is very conservative, and while I don't consider myself at all a dire hard liberal, but I don't agree with many of his policies which tend to be Republican standard. All that being said, he seems like a genuine man and I wouldn't mind working for him but I have seen other posts suggesting you work for the party you would want to be in business with long term only.

3. As mentioned before, I was planning on pursuing a Comp Sci Masters to complement my Finance bachelors degree. My real interest is in public policy research and I think I can leverage those two degrees into something in that area, particularly data analysis. However, the interviewer told me I would also have an opportunity to research legislation while there, and that they would try to hook me up with whatever kind of position I wanted post-internship.

*TL/DR* Is it worth me putting my plans on hold and straining myself financially for a three month DC internship? Is this really a once in a lifetime opportunity, or can I get myself in a better situation financially while building up some practical skills (i.e. formal training in programming) and expect to land a similar roll later on?"
51dq9k,58,2016-09-06,A Message to Christians [LONG POST],TheOldEskimo,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/51dq9k/a_message_to_christians_long_post/,"I have been a Christian for most of my life. I was born into and raised in a devoutly Christian home and even attended a Christian University.

I prayed to God every day and thought I saw him working in my life and in the lives of others. To me, it seemed silly that people could possibly think he does not exist. Surely they were just deluding themselves; surely they were just angry with my God or wanting to live selfishly.

It seemed clear that we deserved the suffering we had as a race. According to my faith, we had no to blame but ourselves after all.

Regarding other religions, I understood that they were very simply incorrect. I thought that surely they did not have the academic verification and the irrefutable set of evidence that supported my religion.

But I was wrong and accepting that I was wrong was one of the hardest things I have ever done. Accepting that what I had believed and been taught my whole life was false was not something that occurred overnight. On the contrary, I tried my best to refute doubts wherever I found they popped up. Try as I might, I found the answers Christianity provided, at best, left room for reasonable doubt and, at worst, were wholly unsatisfying.

In what follows, I hope to write about some of what I learned and what led me first to agnosticism and then eventually to atheism.

---

The first subject I would like to discuss is **The Problem of Evil** (a subject Christians are well-versed in and something Christians have a solution for).

Regarding the problem of evil in the world, most Christians I have spoken with (and my previous self) would have addressed this with Free Will.

The claim, as I understand it and in an admittedly brief summary, is that Yahweh created the world, but gave man free will to make his own choices. This means that people have the ability to hurt one another and act selfishly which results in the problem of evil. 

At first glance, to me, this sounds very plausible. I think a lot people stop here.

But when we dig deeper, it becomes clear that the Free Will Argument does not hold up to scrutiny at all.

Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, Cancer, Stillborn children, and even general unintentional harm are all unaccounted for by free will.

Additionally, if we look deeper into philosophy and our own brain chemistry, it becomes clear that free will does not even exist (at least not in the way many people think it does). That line of thought may be more abstract than what we’re going for here so I won’t digress into philosophy for this particular paper.

---

The next subject I would like to discuss is **Hell**.

Bertrand Russell was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist and Nobel laureate.

My understanding based on his writings is that he was a far smarter and wiser man than I will ever be; I would guess a smarter and wiser man than most of us.

What I value most about Russell is not his math proofs or scientific achievements, but his reasoning and his process of determining truth.

I would like to add as an aside that I highly recommend Russell’s article from the 50s, “Is there a God?” Of all the books and papers I have read, none have come close for me in concisely, clearly, and reasonably explaining how we can answer the question, “Is there a god(s)?”

Regarding Hell and Eternal Suffering, Russell said, “There is one very serious defect to my mind in Christ's moral character, and that is that he believed in hell. I do not myself feel that any person that is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment.”

Hitler and Stalin are reviled the world over (and for good reason).

If a man engages in genocide, we call him a monster. If god engages in genocide (as Yahweh is claimed to have done in the case of Noah and the flood to name one example), we call him good.

But there is more to it than that. Death when compared side by side with eternal suffering (as hell is described to be in Matthew) is far more forgiving.

This life and the pain we experience here is temporary. Eternal suffering is forever. Condemning someone to hell is far worse than condemning them to death. It is even far worse than condemning people to torture for a lifetime; it is far worse than what Hitler and the Nazi’s did when they put Jews in concentration camps to starve, suffer, and die. It is far worse than anything any man could ever hope to do to another person.

And what for? Not for murder, not for genocide, not for harming a single person, but for the crime of genuinely not believing something is true. How do we know they genuinely don’t believe it’s true? Good question, let’s talk about that.

I have heard it said that people choose to go to hell. 

Suppose I offer you a choice: 

-A five star hotel for all eternity

OR

-A torture chamber for all eternity

Which are you going to choose? The thing is, there is no choice. The choice is clear; relegated to self-interest. No one in their right-mind would ever willingly choose the latter.

I have heard it said (in different variations) that people reject god so they can do evil and have their way in this life. Let’s talk about that too.

Suppose christianity is correct: I think a very compelling argument could be built that the most important thing to anyone would be their eternal fate. What is this life when compared with eternity? What is a blip compared to the endless? 

For someone to choose a life of wrongdoing here in exchange for an eternity in hell is a poor trade that would not be made by anyone who truly understood the choice they were making and its ramifications. No one in their right mind would make such a choice.

No one who genuinely understood Christianity, believed it was true, and was in their right mind would ever choose to “reject” Yahweh. The “choice” (if we can really call it that) is relegated to self-interest.

If Yahweh really wanted people to choose him, then I do not think he should have threatened us with the ultimate punishment. Doing so makes it no choice at all.

An additional question worth asking with respect to this topic is, “Do people choose what they believe is true?”

For example, can I choose to believe the wall immediately to my right is not there?

I would say no, we do not choose what we believe is true, but rather, we acquire core beliefs and principles over time as a result of numerous inputs or causes.

If you were born in a dominantly Muslim country in the Middle East, do you think you would be a Muslim instead of a Christian? Statistically, odds are, you probably would be.

Do you think that your Muslim self would deserve eternal damnation for having a core belief that could not be helped? One that you genuinely and truly believed was true and correct?

I am aware of different ways Christians have tried to rationalize the concept of Hell. 

Some are advocates of Universalism.

Some are advocates of Annihilationism.

Some say that bad people go to hell and good people go to heaven.

Some say that people make a conscious decision to go to hell every moment they are there.

I do not think any of these views are Biblically supported. Rather I think these views are adopted  to rationalize hell once one realizes how utterly monstrous it is.

Matthew 25:46 tells us that hell is a place of eternal punishment.

Matthew 13:50 tells us that hell will be like a blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

I must concede that many of hell’s descriptions in the Bible seem vague and metaphorical.

I think this makes it easy for people to read in whatever they want.

Despite the difficulty in building a clear picture given the obtuse nature of the verses, I think it is quite clear that Hell is described to be a very wretched and painful place in which unbelievers suffer for all eternity.

---

Now, I would like to address the subject of the **validity** and **inerrancy of scripture**.

This section will pull some information from the following threads and credit is where credit's due for the fine folks who contributed:

https://m.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/50nsij/question_about_gospel_writers_being_eye_witnesses/

https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/52469y/did_the_apostle_john_write_the_gospel_of_john_and/

I imagine this will come off rather brusk, but I am afraid I must be blunt. 

Those who claim that the Bible is inerrant are misinformed or pretending to know things they do not. 

I suspect many Christians take for granted what they were taught in their upbringing (I know I did).

The Bible has contradictions and fallacies. Take your pick:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk

I do not think we can say all of them are translation errors without a leap of faith.

To most people coming at the Bible without bias, I think these are fairly obvious.

Was Jesus born during the end of Herod’s reign? Or was he born during the census and the time of Quirinius?

Did Judas give back the silver he received for his betrayal or did he buy a field with it?

Both according to the Bible.

A common misconception that some Christians I have spoken with have is that the gospels were eye-witness accounts.

There is no real debate about the authorship of the gospels as far as being eyewitness accounts. They are not. Bart Ehrman is a biblical scholar and has written about this (as have many others).

http://ehrmanblog.org/why-are-the-gospels-anonymous/

They are almost certainly not written by Jesus’ disciples.

None of the gospels came with the authors' name. They are all technically anonymous. Traditional names were attributed later and there's no reason to think those traditional names are correct.

Most importantly, the gospels are all written in Greek. Good Greek that would have required a relatively decent education. The disciples were uneducated, Aramaic-speaking fishermen. If you are truly coming at this without bias, it is quite obvious that the disciples did not write them without taking a leap of faith.

This is from Boston College:

http://www.bc.edu/schools/stm/crossroads/resources/birthofjesus/intro/the_dating_of_thegospels.html

""Most researchers place the date of Jesus’ death at Passover time around the year 30. The earliest New Testament books, the letters written by Paul, were composed in the decade of the 50s.

In the mid-60s, James, Peter, and Paul are all killed. Peter and Paul likely perished during the persecution of the church in Rome by Nero. The deaths of these important church leaders likely encouraged the writing down of narratives about Jesus.
In the year 70, Roman armies destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple, effectively ending a Jewish revolt against the Empire that had begun four years earlier.
Although some scholars disagree, the vast majority of researchers believe that Mark was the first Gospel to be written, sometime around the year 70.""

These dates are relevant because life expectancy was relatively low back then. If Jesus died around 30 and the first gospel arrived around 70, it is unlikely any of the disciples were still living.

Additionally, we run into other cultures historical accounts not lining up with the Bible's. So, for example, Egyptian history vs the Bible's interpretation with Moses is claimed to line up by Christians, but not by most other scholars.

There was a specific post about this very thing in r/AskHistorians sometime ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1tvwsg/does_the_egyptian_history_record_the_ten_plagues/

""The general consensus amongst Egyptologists, though, is that much of what is written in the Old Testament simply doesn't have evidence in either the archaeological, written, or artistic records of Egypt.”

Another example of this exclusion from other historical records would be Herod’s slaughter of the innocents.

Flavius Josephus, who carefully chronicled Herod's abuses, makes no mention of it.

I think the biggest problem with claiming the Bible is inerrant is the reasoning process used to come to that conclusion.

The following is an excerpt from “Archaeology and Biblical Accuracy” by Farrell Till.

“Has archaeology proven the historical accuracy of the Bible? If you listened only to biblical inerrantists, you would certainly think so. Amateur apologists have spread this claim all over the internet, and in a letter published in this issue, Everett Hatcher even asserted that archaeology supports that ""the Bible is the inerrant word of God."" Such a claim as this is almost too absurd to deserve space for publication, because archaeology could prove the inerrancy of the Bible only if it unearthed undeniable evidence of the accuracy of every single statement in the Bible. If archaeological confirmation of, say, 95% of the information in the Bible should exist, then this would not constitute archaeological proof that the Bible is inerrant, because it would always be possible that error exists in the unconfirmed five percent. Has archaeology confirmed the historical accuracy of some information in the Bible? Indeed it has, but I know of no person who has ever tried to deny that some biblical history is accurate.”

For the Bible to be inerrant, as it is so often claimed to be, it would have to be 100% verified in its entirety. Not 95%. Not 99%. 100%. Quite frankly, no one will ever be able to verify that the miracles in the Bible (or the miracles of any other religion for that matter) ever occurred. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

I speculate some will say, “You cannot disprove it.” This will be addressed in the next section.

---

One of the last things I would like to discuss in this paper is the **Burden of Proof**.

Suppose I told you that a goblin king under the surface of Pluto created the universe, its laws, you and me, and that he communicated with me telepathically and my predecessors wrote a book about him.

I’m going to level with you. There is no way you would believe me.

You would, quite reasonably, expect evidence. Testable, demonstrable, repeatable evidence, that is available to everyone.

Why do Christians not believe in Allah, Vishnu, Zeus, or the Flying Spaghetti monster? Why not believe in Leprechauns or an invisible laser unicorn? Why not the matrix or that little blue men live within Neptune? 

You cannot disprove them after all.

The answer is The Burden of Proof.

The one making the claim has the burden to substantiate it.

This is why simply saying, “You cannot disprove Yahweh” is not a good argument.

---

This section will be addressing the difference between **good and bad evidence** and how it applies to Christianity (and religion as a whole).

Good evidence is testable, demonstrable, and repeatable. Good evidence is available for all to examine.

I think good claims are doxastically open. That is to say that they are open to criticism and revision (such as scientific theories for example).

It is important to understand that no one is beyond criticism. No teacher, no politician, no leader, no theory, and no god.

Whenever I speak to Christians now-a-days about their religion, typically, one of the following comes up as a reason why the individual believes.

Personal experience, coincidence, (admittedly iron-age) eye witness testimony, and faith.

Personal experience has a number of relevant criticisms and has proven to be a very unreliable form of evidence. Additionally all religions will claim it.

Suppose a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu all sit down independently with a neutral interviewer. 

When asked about their personal experience with god, each will say something very different. Who they say he is will vary dramatically.

Coincidence does not prove god's existence either. When Timmy's mother prays for him to get an internship and he gets one, that is not proof of god’s existence, it is a coincidence. What if Timmy's Muslim friend prayed to Allah that Timmy would find a job too? Whose god answered the prayer?

Iron-age eye-witness testimony (again, that every religion seems to claim) is also unreliable. As covered above as a common misconception, none of the gospels were eye-witness accounts. There is no real debate surrounding this. Depending on Saul's word that he had a vision is just as suspect as Muhammed’s or Joseph Smith's.

Finally we get to faith. I have often heard faith defined with deepities. That is, something that sounds very good, but is utterly meaningless or unclear. Faith is belief without evidence or in the present of conflicting evidence plain and simple. Some have defined it (rather aptly I think) as pretending to know things one doesn't know.

Contrary to what Christianity teaches, faith is not a virtue. By faith one can believe literally anything. Anything.

None of these are good kinds of evidence.

---

I do not think the Universe needs a god(s) to exist.

Is it not possible that the universe has always existed in some form or another? Indeed, there is no evidence of anything else.

We have the burden of proof to push us away from agnosticism.

We know right and wrong can exist without a deity (addressed in the P.S. section below).

I think a lot of Christians are very smart.

I honestly think that a lot of Christians are simply misinformed.

I think there is a difference between being misled or uninformed/misinformed and being stupid.

I think stupidity is the inability to learn while the others are either having the wrong information or simply not knowing.

I think many Christians in the USA (where I reside) are victims of childhood indoctrination and, for lack of a better word, brainwashing.

I think the important thing to remember through all of this is that we can all be fooled.
It has been said that it is easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled.

At the end of the day, we all decide what we believe is true for ourselves.
But now perhaps you have some new information and I hope someday I’ll see you on the other side of the fence.

I know this was a long read so thank you for your time and for hearing me out. I wish you all the best in your lives and in the search for truth.

Have a good one and thanks again

PS

I’d like to add a section concerning **right and wrong**. It’s fairly lengthy, but I think it’s a very important topic to address for a lot of Christians.

I’ve been told by many Christians that if there was no god(s) human beings would destroy one another.

C.S. Lewis wrote in “Mere Christianity” that natural law proves god’s existence (though I must say, even if natural law did prove god’s existence, which it doesn't, it would not prove which god(s) was the correct one).

To address these claims I’d first like to break down where right and wrong come from and how we determine them.

Right and Wrong, Good and Bad.

It seems like most people I have come across believe right and wrong and good and evil are objective or inherent things.

Sometime ago, I held that view, but after experiencing a loss, I began to think about the subject in a more existential sense. Initially, I failed to come up with a set of criteria for evaluating something as right or wrong that did not fall apart under scrutiny. More on that later.

My understanding is that right and wrong are either objective or they are not; that it is a null and alternate kind of problem where if right and wrong are objective, they are not subjective and vice versa.

If you’re claiming right and wrong are objective or inherent it’s your burden to substantiate it.

Initially, I tried to substantiate the claim myself, but found what I came up with unsatisfying. In researching the question, I was not able to rationalize the ways some others had substantiated it either.

**Where I started was trying to come up with a set of criteria for evaluating right and wrong. Are right and wrong determined by feelings and sensibilities? Are they determined by general consensus or the law? Are they determined by god(s) or religion?
I think each of these has its problems.**

Feelings and sensibilities are disagreed upon. Some are appalled by eating meat while others are not. Some see guns as an evil and some do not. If I felt murder was fine, that would not necessarily make it so. Alternatively, if I felt murder was not fine, that would not necessarily make it so. You can take metrics on the majority view, but this leads us to general consensus which I think has its own problems.

I think the problem with general consensus is that it only means what most people think; it says nothing about the truth or correctness of what most people think. By the logic of general consensus, if most people believed murder and rape were just and right, they simply would be. My understanding is that in Rome, many people had no problem with gladiators or the arena. General consensus can vary depending on time period, location, people groups, and so on. It has also arguably changed over time with things like slavery or homosexuality as an example. Some groups still oppose homosexuality which is often due to one of the next systems for making criteria which uses god(s) or religion as the ultimate determinant for right and wrong (which I think has its own problems). General consensus is not necessarily indicative of truth or falseness. It only means what the majority think or feel which can be incorrect as seen throughout history with regards to many fields of study. Simply because the majority once believed the earth was flat at one time does not mean they were correct.

Regarding the law, Captain Picard has a quote I like where he says, “There can be no justice so long as laws are absolute.”

Suppose person A drives drunk and gets into a car accident killing an elderly couple. In this scenario, the accident is entirely the elderly couples fault and driving error (they were driving the wrong way on a one way highway or something); let’s assume it would have happened regardless of the drinking.

Now suppose person B drives drunk and gets into an accident killing the elderly couple. In this case, it is entirely his error.

Should the two of them be punished in the same manner by the law? Should person A receive something more akin to a DUI while person B receive a more severe sentence? Should they receive the same sentence?

The law deals with a practically infinite number of edge cases which can cause problems when something like the above case occurs and you have a flat law to deal with it. Whether a flat law is sufficient for both person A and B is debatable. Some I speculate would be fine with person A and B being punished the same way while some I speculate would not.

Furthermore, laws can also be arguably unjust. I don’t think I need to give examples of that, it’s rather evident throughout history that at least some societies had laws that I think most would consider wrong by today’s developed country standards. I do not think that simply because laws change over time that old laws are necessarily wrong or that new laws are necessarily right.

Finally, we get to **god(s) or religion as a means for evaluating right and wrong**. The problem with this, I think, is that it does not take into account what god(s) does and does not do and only makes sense to me in a kind of, “He who has the gold makes the rules” way. By this method for developing criteria, god could, say, destroy all of humanity with a flood and this be considered right or have his people engage in religious justified genocide and this be considered objectively right because he said to do it and he makes the rules. It also makes right and wrong simply dependent on the whims and desires of the most powerful being (or something in that vein) regarding the “He who has the gold makes the rules bit.” Once again, if this were our determinant for right and wrong, god(s) could simply decree murder and rape to be just and right and, by our criteria, they would be.

**Perhaps most importantly, which of these methods for determining right and wrong takes precedence when they disagree with one another? What if my religion conflicts with the law or general consensus? What if my personal feelings and sensibilities conflict with one or both of the other two? What if your order of precedence differs from my own? Which of us is more objectively correct?**

It seems many people I have spoken with develop guiding principles such as, “If it hurts someone, it’s wrong.”

For starters, I speculate a good many people are hypocrites on this point and do not apply this principle uniformly. For example, suppose some friends go out with person A. Person A does not want to drive so he lets person B in the group do it even though he is aware that person B is inconvenienced by it. This is good for Person A and bad for Person B. One could argue it helps person A and hurts person B.

In a different scenario, suppose person A leaves their partner, person B, and starts a relationship with person C. Person B has their dreams crushed, loses their partner and best friend, and is depressed for years. In this case person A did what was in their best interest regardless of the pain to person B.

In both of the above scenarios, I speculate that whether or not the actions of person A are right or wrong might be debated to a degree, but by our aforementioned principle, I think both would be wrong.

Where do we draw the line when using principles like this? Is it at death and murder? Is it in small things like going out to eat with friends our letting our spouse do the laundry? But all of this is beside the point and I speculate many would admit that they believe the principle is true absolutely and that they simply don’t follow it in all things because of their nature, personal failings, or something in that vein. But I digress. The hypocrisy and uncertainty of people tells us nothing about the validity of the principle itself.
I think the biggest issue with a principle like this is that it is grounded in one of the items we’ve addressed: the wheel of feelings and sensibilities, law or general consensus, or god(s)/religion which are each fallible by my current understanding.

My conclusion is that right and wrong are ultimately rooted in self-interest and human needs. I acknowledge that empirically we see trends regarding the views on right and wrong that people hold, but I think that these trends are fallible because they depend on our wheel of criteria. Right and wrong exist, sure, but they exist as constructs we make for our mutual benefit or to gain some kind of advantage (this 'advantage' could be psychological, social, or economical for example).

I don’t want you stealing from my shop. I agree not to steal from you if you don’t steal from me. I won’t take your seat if you sat in it first on the condition that you don’t take my seat when I sit there first. Some people will say I’ll respect your beliefs so long as you respect my beliefs (though that one is questionable because beliefs rise and fall based on merit not respect), and on and on it goes.

My understanding is that these are social contracts which are fine examples of mutual self-interest at work.

I am aware of the question, “Is selflessness ultimately selfish?” 

How do we define a selfless act? 

Gareth Roberts discussed defining a selfless act when he wrote, ""It rather depends on what we mean by selfless. If a selfless act is something from which the doer gets absolutely nothing at all (including a sense that they're a good person, the absence of regret etc) then there is obviously no such thing.""

There is naturally a lot more to it than that (a lot more philosophy and a lot more explaining), but for the sake of the character limit, I'll have to explain my take on this with more depth in a future paper. For now, I hope we can all see there is no completely selfless act.

If the answer to the question, ""Is selflessness ultimately selfish?”, is yes (I think it is), then I think we are left with another question: Does selflessness exist at all? Again, I would say ultimately no, it does not. Provided these assumptions are correct, I think the result would be that the choices we make are based on cost analysis; we factor in our personal feelings and sensibilities, our religion, our desires, our understanding of the consequences, our cultural influence, our human needs and programming, and so on, and then make what we see as the best choice given the circumstances.

I think if this is true, than it has certain ramifications that I speculate a lot of people won’t like very much (though naturally what we like or what makes us happy or sad is hardly indicative of a universal truth).

With this logic in mind, suppose we have person A who wants to murder someone. Now, person A has evaluated the consequences of his actions (death or lifetime imprisonment), evaluated the risk of capture, and then decided by cost analysis that murdering the person is worth the consequences. By this logic, it is not wrong (at least not universally) for him with respect to his cost analysis. Of course it would almost certainly be wrong with respect to the victim and their cost analysis and self-interest.

Suppose a different person A exists who is married to person B. Suppose Person B wants to run off with a younger woman and leave person A and their kids. Suppose person B evaluated the consequences of losing his spouse, their children, and his wealth from the split, but still decides he wants to do it; that the gain outweighs the loss. By this logic, it is not wrong for him with respect to his cost analysis. Once again, however, his decision would almost certainly be wrong for his family and their own self-interest and needs. In reality, I think Person B would likely have feelings, sensibilities, empathy, and core beliefs which would factor into his cost analysis and perhaps prevent him from making such a decision. If this were so, it could alter what is right for person B because all of these things factor into how he makes choices: namely, his cost analysis and decision-making 'algorithms'.

When applying this logic to contracts, it becomes clear that they are only valid as long as they are deemed by each party to be in their own best self-interest. If a party evaluates the consequences of breaking the contract, but still deems breaking it worth the consequences, if follows that it is not wrong for them to break it. Rather, it is perhaps bad for the other parties involved so they won’t like it and may think the action wrong and do what is in their power to rebalance their own self-interest or serve consequences to the contract-breaker (which should factor into the cost analysis of the contract-breaker before their decision is made). In the real world, the long term fallout and the set of consequences that result from breaking a contract is often enough of a deterrent to give contracts a kind of general stability (though not in all cases and perhaps only for a certain time frame).

If someone lies to get what they want or to generate advantage while understanding the risks and consequences and after a careful evaluation and cost analysis with their decision-making algorithms, it follows that it is not wrong for them to do so with respect to their personal self-interest (though in typical fashion, it may be wrong for someone else).

If selflessness is ultimately selfish and right and wrong are ultimately built on self-interest, what is right for you and what is right for someone else may be entirely different; **right and wrong are only objectively definable with respect to one’s goals and personal cost analysis algorithms**.

I speculate many will say, “People would do horrible things all the time and the world would fall apart if this were true,” but I disagree.

Even if human beings are inescapably self-interested, this does not make us evil or vindictive or prevent us from building successful societies that most of us can benefit from. Just because what is right for one person with respect to their happiness is not always right for another with respect to theirs, does not mean that this is always the case.

Indeed, it is often the case that our needs and interests overlap. People are interdependent. We need each other to meet our needs. People must give to get. People may be kind because if they are rude or cruel, people will dislike them and they’ll be unable to meet their own needs. People have emotions and feelings; empathy and programming to gain happiness from those they love or are emotionally close to. I think it could be argued that we are programmed to do nice things for the people we cherish and, quite frankly, we must if we want to keep them. I think many people hold core beliefs that it is right or the correct and proper way to live to treat people well (though again, I speculate many people haven’t thought it through as well as they think and practice hypocrisy in their principles as explained above).

Some I have spoken with have presented love as something pure and unselfish. I do not think love is a good example of human selflessness.  We each get something out of love whether we want to admit it or not. Love is selfish -- an exchange of goods to meet each other’s needs. It has been said that to fall in love is to desire to own. Suppose Person A acknowledges that love is temporary and that all relationships inevitably end for one reason or another (either because of death or because one or more parties opt out) so they don’t get too attached or possessive. Their behavior is still ultimately rooted in self-interest: perhaps to avoid future pain or perhaps out of a desire to see things as they are and act accordingly.

Regarding the belief that chaos would ensue if this logic were correct, even if right and wrong don’t really inherently exist and are just human constructs for self-interest, I still think it makes sense that laws and punishment exist because consequences factor into our choices and cost analysis. **A community with similar goals might want to set up a standard of rules for mutual self interest and then have consequences to protect the interests of the majority.** I think it could be argued that discrimination, slavery, tyranny, and so on, eventually work themselves out because they are things that are not in the best self-interest of those oppressed and so the oppressed end up fighting those in power and appeal to the empathy of those around them. People unaffected might be moved to help those oppressed due to their empathy or varying factors of their cost analysis. By my conclusion, slavery is not inherently right or wrong, it is right or wrong with respect to something; we deemed it wrong because of push back from those whose self-interest was harmed and because of the empathy of human beings who are programmed to feel another's pain and put themselves in their shoes.

I think a problem with inherent right and wrong is that it turns into a game of “Who said so?” Person A says it’s wrong to hurt something living. Person B says, “Who says so? Why?” Person A lists some of our failed criteria from above. Even if 100% of humanity agreed on a code for right and wrong, it would not be inherent, but rather what we as a community decided based on cost analysis; balancing our inescapable drive for self-interest as best we could for mutual benefit. Would the universe care that 100% of humanity agreed that murder was wrong? No, I do not think it would. If someone shot me in the head right now, I would not like it because it is not what I want and not in my best self-interest, but I cannot argue that it is inherently wrong. What I can do is agree with my neighbor that neither of us want to be shot in the head and form a mutually beneficial contract with consequences to ensure the other sticks with it. My neighbor and I have just labeled an action ""wrong"" with respect to our self-interest and agreed to a contract with consequences to motivate the other party to keep their word.

Right and wrong are words for things that we like or do not like; things that are bad for us or good for us; things that go against our programming or core beliefs and things that do not.

Regret can be explained by people having inadequate information and making the best cost analysis judgement they can, but realizing later it was a poorer decision than they could have made. We as individuals do not know so much. We are always learning and changing. Sometimes, we cannot see the consequences that will result from our choices or we think they will not affect us in the way that they do. Learning something can result in regret because sometimes we realize we could probably have been happier than we are or have more than we do now if we had made different choices.

**Ultimately, I think right and wrong are not inherent, but rather the end result of self-interest. I think this means that what is right and wrong for one person may not always be what is right and wrong for another. Despite this, people are interdependent, share the same basic human needs, and often share the same goals which leads us to construct rules and standards for our mutual benefit as a species.**

My particular view and conclusion on this may be unpopular, but the overarching point I'm hoping to make is that **right and wrong can exist without god(s). Indeed, as covered above, using god(s) to determine what is right and wrong has a number of problems.**

To say that right and wrong cannot exist without god(s) is to say that self-interest cannot exist without god(s) because that is what right and wrong are ultimately derived from.

There are many more papers that due far more justice to the topic than I am here and certainly many more papers with views on right and wrong that are easier to swallow.

I'd like to add that selfishness is not inherently or necessarily a bad thing. I cannot help but notice whenever I say people are selfish, at least some of my audience cringes. It's a loaded word and one that has a lot of connotations for some people (particularly if you are or were a Christian I suspect), but I think it's important to understand it's a part of human nature and that it can result in the development of standards for our mutual benefit just as much (if not more) as it can contribute to our detriment.

Again, thank you for your time and best of luck

--

As an aside and continuation of the right and wrong address, I'd like to add that Scandinavia is almost entirely atheist and they aren't ripping each other to shreds as immoral heathens.

Quite the contrary, Scandinavia has some of highest satisfaction of life in the world.

This is one example of why claiming atheists are immoral or destructive to society are not good arguments.

---

Somethings I left out of this paper were the various logical paradoxes associated with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent being like Yahweh.

Additionally, I did not discuss a lot of Christian Apologetics (the teleological argument, the ontological argument, and the moral argument are a few examples).

Suffice it to say, these arguments are fallacies that have been addressed thoroughly and repeatedly. They do not hold up to scrutiny and very plainly do not make sense.

I did not include a section on Christian Apologetics because the problems with the argument in question can typically and easily be found with a cursory Google search (that, and I ran out of character space).

Perhaps in the future, I'll make a compilation of my own, but for now, there are others (I am aware Dawkins and Boghossian cover them in *The God Delusion* and *A Manual for Creating Atheists* respectively).

I know when I was a Christian, the titles alone of those books would have predisposed me not to read or respect those books, so if anyone would like to share any arguments in the comments, I'd be glad to discuss them with you.

Thank you again for your time and understanding. I hope the read was valuable to you and all the rest."

I' am an intern at a company as a part of my IT education. I have been given the assignment to map, look into and assess the general set-up of the local network and Wi-Fi. I was told to take it on as if I' am out at a new client and trying assess what their current setup is and what could be missing/improved.

Currently I have made a small overview as a starting point, but it would be awesome if you guys could help me look it over and see if I missed anything I definately should be documenting:

What is present? (Brands, models, firewalls, cabling versions)

What is physically present? (How many APs, switches, routers, cables, servers)

What are the configurations? (elaborate, what could be improved? what is missing?)

Mark things up. (mark up cables and devices so its easy to see where it goes or what it belongs to. Does the current marked up names correlate with config names?)

I hope I dont come out as a complete moron, this is my first time handling anything like this, everything else I've done so far has been pure theoretical at school. But I hope you are willing to lend your knowledge and input, it will be greatly appriciated!"

Since my first post a few weeks ago there have been some changes in my plans. Don´t worry, i didn´t give up already.

Due to the extremely complicated university regulations in germany i  was unable to enroll at Tübingen university. My ""high school"" degree only allows me to study at Universities of Applied Sciences, in german ""Fachhochschulen"". Tübingen University is none of those.  Unfortunately the degree i am aiming at is only availabe at normal Universities.  

Luckily for me, there is a loophole in these regulations. The federal state of Hessen has a law in place that allows people with the *Fachhochschulreife* to study at any University within Hessen. Of course there are exceptions for courses with state examination, but for me it works. Kinda unfortunately, the only possible candidate is the Goethe University in Frankfurt. 
Its name of course will look nice on a resume later, but for now it brings a few problems with it:  

* Its in Frankfurt. Next to Berlin and Munich probably the most expensive city to live in   
* the tution fees are 3 times higher than in Tübingen. Now while that seems kinda bullshit, it still is only 340€ per semester, so around 700€ per year. That means till i got my Master it will cost me at least 3500€. If you are a US student at a private University reading this you are probably screaming internally. Don´t forget, the state pays students around 150-180€ per month during your college time simply for studying.  
* Its still in Frankfurt. My car will probably be useless most of the time. driving to campus with a car in one of the busiest cities is a very bad idea, so i will need to public transport and bikes. Also cost a bit of money. 

While there are publicy funded student dorms that cost half of private appartments, the waiting list is long. The women on the phone told me it could take up to 6 month. Kinda bad when the semester starts in 3 weeks. 
That means till i get a place there i´ll have to bite the bullet and rent something expensive, that is available immediatly.
 
Now i know this would put a lot of people off and make then choose a different college, but this is no option for me, and i don´t want to give up before it even started. 

Now that that´s said, we need to talk about something as important as education, and that is physical health. Currently i would describe myself as an average dude. I am neither an athelete nor am i fat. I weigh 71kg at approx 178cm(i need to measure myself again...). The fattest i ever was, was during my internship at DHL, were i weighed around 80kg.   
That was mostly due to sitting 8 hours a day, with lots of sugary drinks and fast food. After the internship i dropped down to 70kg immediatly, and have since stayed there.   
Getting in shape should be quite easy. the college offers sports programms for free, a good way to socialize and meet new people.   
Staying in shape for the next 10 years will be a lot harder. Keeping a training routine when are constantly on the move will be a challenge, for which i haven´t yet found a solution. But first things first, i gotta buff up.    
Walking into the interview with biceps like John Cena will probably put them off. I assume what they want to see is physical endurance. That means lots of cardio, the abbility to sustain high Gs for some time and work under extreme conditions (it can get really hot in these suits).
I know for sure that one test you have to pass is sitting in a repilca crew cabin for 2 hours at around 36°C and still function normally. Really looking forward to that.


So, to bring this update to an end, here is a list of things i will have to start soon to stay on track with my plans:
1. start studying
2. enroll in at least 1 sport program
3. take advanced english classes and get language certs
4. start looking into meal plans and how to eat healthier
5. socialize more?
6. ???
7. space!

51f3k7,2,2016-09-06,It's amazing how one person's gain can be another one's loss,EventHorizonMeltdown,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/51f3k7/its_amazing_how_one_persons_gain_can_be_another/,"I went to college today, only had one hour class, of course the hour went like it was a day long. I don't know how I will be able to handle the days where I have multiple classes.

This girl I liked a lot (I still do even after rejection, I try to move on, but a good part is still daydreaming) told me that after this year, she would go in a firm as an internship for 2 years before working there.
In my mind, it just meant that after 4 years with her boyfriend she probably wanted to go to the next step; living with him, both would be working and the next couple years it would either be a pregnancy or a marriage. Things would go very fast for her from this on. She's 22-23, I guess that the right age (even if a bit young by my standards but it's probably my bitterness who's talking)

And I realized that for this girl that I meant quite a lot to me (it was my first real crush) I wasn't much. She was excited when she told me about her future project after this year, so it's definitely good for her; she's starting her real adult life.

I will probably never see her again after this, and basically to her I will be nothing more than a college buddy, I will be forgotten the next year or the one after we go our own ways.
I don't know if the next year I will still be in love with her, I hope not. 

It hurt to see that we are not much to each other. I probably care much more than she will ever do. She already has her upcoming years sorted out; she gets her job, she lives with her boyfriend and after that it's gets really fast (marriage or 1st child)

Meanwhile I don't even have a car and I'm a 19 years old guy who doesn't know how he will handle the next day.
And when I look forward to see her, I shouldn't. We are not close and we shouldn't be. She doesn't think about me at night, she doesn't feel anything about me.

I feel like some teenager who gets sad over such pointless shit (you got a first failure in love, yeah just like everyone else did at some point)
But the fact that nothing good is happening for a while now, it's shitty. She would be one of the few things I care about anymore, but it's pointless. There is no place for me in her life, especially as a lover. And I don't want to be ""friend"" with a woman I have feelings for, because I would end chasing her for too long. 

I really have to put some distance, to be more distant, more cold but I can't.

Sorry for this rant who shouldn't be one. It's nothing, but seriously I jus want one good thing. To have a chance with her would have been the best.

I wanted to go study abroad for this year, so I could move on more easily and not see her anymore and it could make me grow as a person, it would have been really hard but I guess I could have overcome. But obviously I wasn't admitted.



I hope my text makes sense, I'm typing on a whim and I'm venting."

Since I've been here I've done more than I thought I would be doing and have been to things that I wouldn't think I would normally go to. Such as meetings with clients, 'competitions' for bids, etc. 

The company recently just bought me a computer, cost about 3k, and are sending me to California for a week in October (to attend Dreamforce). 

Normally I'd think around 6 months would be a good time to ask for some kind of raise, but since I recently got the expensive computer and will soon be getting the trip. I'm not sure. 

I do make a decent amount (60k salary), but when I first got my offer letter, the owner called to talk to me about it and said how much I would be getting and very nervous me just said 'Yeah that's great!' even though he blatantly asked if it was enough money.

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

51fwrw,14,2016-09-06,Considering change in career path,drainedenough,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/51fwrw/considering_change_in_career_path/,"Lol, what career?

Recent graduate. ""Excellent"" (I strongly disagree personally, but everyone gives birth to kittens over it) school, decent grades. Thesis and internship under belt.

The industry and job market is almost in as bad of a situation as the housing market here.

So let me tell you what my plans were/are.

* Get a job, get money. Preferably something related to geology, environment, whatever, but I'll take anything. (And believe me, I have had several wide-eyed looks from interviewers) Get financially stable/independent. Save for a new car, because the one I had crossed over to the scrap yard. 

* Take grad-level courses if I can afford to. (spoiler: I can't.) I have to compensate for an ""average"" GPA and I know it.

* Study for the GRE. Both general and subject tests.

* Apply for more internships/apprenticeships, etc. Either in the workforce or in academia. Willing to go anywhere as long as someone will take me. Pray I can make good connections (future LOR writers, contacts, whatever) because I can't trust anyone at my alma mater. Curse the fact that I am not American so I'm not eligible for a lot of stuff.

* Get out of the country for the sake of my sanity. Do a Master's. Maybe.

As you can guess, things aren't going well. I've been doing some soul searching and I am more than familiar with life dreams not being for everyone.

One of the things I've been thinking about is how I don't think I can imagine working in the field that my thesis and internship were relevant to. Don't get me wrong, they were interesting, but I don't think I could do it for the rest of my life. All I know is that I would like to work with mass specs, chromatographs, and similar equipment.

I've spat at the field of geology out of frustration, and even considered going into computers (I know several programming languages. I'm not the best, but working with computers is something that comes naturally to me). Then I remember the time I almost lost my mind in second year due to family issues, and considered going to college to get a lab tech diploma.

I've also considered changing my field completely. I've thought of things from medical science to farming.

It doesn't have to be relevant to my thesis/internship, but I think lab work is at least somewhat relevant to a geologist and it could keep my options open. Or I can just become a hermit. So, some questions I guess.

* What would you recommend for a wannabe-lab tech?

* How do I unscrew myself for having past experience irrelevant to my current interests? Just to give you an idea of what I mean: A recent STEM internship at this environment conservatory/learning centre went to a Spanish major. The other students at the internship I was at were clueless and uninterested in the topic. I have no idea how they got there, and it felt like a slap in the face to have worked to know all these things, when they didn't even know what a mass spec was. 

I'm used to getting screwed over so I just want to be prepared. 
I'm applying for jobs and other programs (lots of relevant opportunities are opening up now, and if that doesn't work out, so are retail opportunities for Halloween and Christmas!), and will be attending a convention later this month. I'd appreciate any advice.

Thanks in advance."

51gkal,1,2016-09-06,[M4F]-The future face of fetish fashion,xxMrJxx,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51gkal/m4fthe_future_face_of_fetish_fashion/,"The fashion world was no stranger to kink but the break out designer Mr J was the talk of London fashion week when he shocked all who attended. He sent his summer collection down the catwalk where each model’s key accessory was Mr J's cum all over their face. The line of dresses where each designed as a single piece of beautifully embroiled fabric held to the body by complex shibari.

This bold statement clearly impressed as during the year Mr J has hand tied many celebrity in his creations, before sending them down the red carpet. That said only one starlet made her way down the red carpet wearing Mr J on her face too. Mr J's success doesn’t end there either, his studio has been filled with a veritable who's who of the sexist women alive. All trying to join his harem of muses for his next adventure 

So here's where you come in, I'm starting my new venture and you have either applied to an open casting call or perhaps your already a star and requested my services. I'm happy for real or original starlets but if you do go real please give a few options. 

The Catwalk: looking for new models to show off my latest collection. Exhibitionists are required.

The Fitting: an opportunity for socialites and heiresses to be fitted for the latest must have garment.

The Cover Shoot: I'm shooting a fetish cover for a fashion magazine and am looking for a photographer who can work with me to create a shared erotic vision

The Book: I'm putting together a book of celebrities in fetish situations, the twist though is that no one is to be identified in the book so views are left guessing who's who.

The Album: I'm putting together a concept album where the music is a mix of the growls, sighs and moans of my instruments along with the hits on their skin and the lead singer being toyed with throughout recording.

The Music Video: the theme of the video is pony girl chariot racing and Roman orgy. Lots of different position to fill on this set.

The Internship: I'm in need of a new seamstress and secretary, a good place for the more innocent to start.


So please include your project, who you are, a bit about both your look and personality why you want to work with Mr J. also a warning I’m a slow writer so this will be more of a long term thing.

As the title mentions, I was one of the few that failed the NAPLEX my first time. In summary, I rushed it and didn't prepare for it like I should have, so now I'm retooling my studying and refocusing making sure I pass it the second time around. (Now, please don't comment on how easy the NAPLEX is or how I could have failed the exam, that I'm not meant to be a pharmacist....Look, I failed, I take 100% responsibility, moving on.) Anyways, I'm currently a grad intern at ABC pharmacy and was thinking about quitting due to the reduced hours and pay I'm getting (not able to afford my apartment since it's far from my parent's home, car insurance, etc). 

I wanted to know what you're opinions are in terms of getting a job during this time, while I'm studying for the retake if I leave my position. I've had hospital experience working throughout my years at pharmacy school and was thinking about applying for a per diem Pharm Tech position. However, I understand, coming from a director/management position that it's not beneficial to hire someone that will potentially pass their board exams in a couple of months.

Just want some advice in terms of job opportunities out there that I can capitalize on, given my situation.

Thanks!"

Police sirens now and then, the damning smell of cans haunting my nose. And the metallic smell that accompanied it, the smell of blood.

Everyone had done that “trick”. My son, my brother, the president, even my damn wife.

But it was over. One way or another, we don’t know how, but it was finally fucking over.

We did everything, we even went as far as analysing the sun rays for anything that would cause people to do it. Nothing. Fucking nothing. 

But it was at the tip of our noses the whole time, the fucking water. 

***TRANSCRIPTION OF WATER PLANT WORKER AND SUBJECT Z30N***

Judius Mare: Uh, so why do you want to get in here? 

Subject Z30N: *critter noise* help *More critters, accompanied by what sounds like the subject defeacating* human. 

Judius Mare: Oh, alright then, go right in sir. 

*Subject Z30N walks into the water plant with a red glowing rock, later identified as Material D1C-c* 

*Subject, after approx. 10 minutes, flies out of the door and smashes through a window* 

*Judius Mare slept through most of the ordeal*


***TRANSCRIPTION END***  

The water. People drank water, **they needed water.**

I pull down my pants to see my skinless boner still intact. Last week, I succumbed, and I have only survived this ordeal through a miracle.

I did the SBT, too. Hell knows what got a hold of me. But it was really just a matter of seconds, one minute Im finish my Pepsi Cola, the next, I lay on the floor feeling the sun scorch my red cock.

I don’t know how I did not bleed out, 3 damn days, for 3 damn days,I stayed inside my house with less food than in an african’s stomach. I survived, I ate bugs, I ate roaches, drank my own urine, I couldn’t go outside, not with them up there, in the sky. I knew they did this, but I don’t know what they wanted from us.

One day, It came down to me, there was no help coming, the rare government broadcasts about ‘help’ were just automated, the same damn voice, the same damn broadcast at 5:30 PM, It drove me insane. I snapped like a twig, reached into my drawer and pulled out my pistol, ready to finally release myself from this Hell, I wanted to take one last look at the ‘things’ that did this. 
They were not there, gone, completely lost, fucking gone with not a single trace.

I sifted through my desk, searching for the pictures I had taken of them the day before. Then I found that newspaper.

**“African-American ‘SBT’ Enthusiast Shot Into Space, Police Negligence Is to Blame “**

I don’t know how, but it all came down to me in a single moment. Space, SBT, African-Americans. They all connected like dotted lines following eachother.

‘’Yes’’, I muttered to myself ‘’Yes, it makes sense now.’’. 
I felt like a madman, I rambled on and on about how it went down, for hours, several hours. 
I knew the truth. I knew who did this, but nobody was there to listen. But I knew the truth, I didn’t have a revenge in my mind, and I do not know what kind of relief it was, but it was there, and it was bliss. 

The clock hit midnight, and it was now the Fifth of October. I laid in bed and recoiled as the blanket pushed on my skinless cock, and rolled over.
98% of the male population was dead, around 70% of women just committed suicide or was killed by the government for ‘’Safety Reasons’’, martial law was declared not short after 

The WHO placed SBT on the watchlist.They seemed to know something about SBT, they always  seemed to know about everything. With some unholy way, they’d find where diseases originate from almost as if they put the disease  there. 
I took my pistol, I staggered my way out of the  house, headed to the nearest supermart for supplies. 
I ransacked shelves cherishing the burned down parts of the buillding, I only took what I needed, around 5 bottles of water, some chips and bread. 

**[JOURNAL CUT HERE, THE SUBJECT GOES ON AFTER WHAT IS SPECULATED TO BE 5 DAYS]**

**10TH OF OCTOBER, 20??**

I found it, I finally did. 
The World Health Organization’s center, it took me to long to travel here, but it wasn’t much trouble with me finding abandoned cars in every highway. 

I stepped inside and went down as far as I could using the seemingly never-ending staircase, the walls kept getting colder and more metalic with each floor I went down.
I was almost sure I was dead and this was limbo, but the large futuristic door I saw changed my mind. 
There was a one way mirror where the peek-hole should be, I guessed it was a peekhole since there were no cameras around.
I knocked, I didn’t know if it would help, but I knocked. 
‘’Who’s there?..’’ Came from behind the door, I should’ve been surprised, but I was glad.
‘’Depends on who’s there’’ I said, the guy took that I was a  smartass and I heard a few button clicks before the large door slowly opened.
Behind the door stood what looked like a scientist, but he looked sick, rather tipsy and depressed. 
‘’Are you here to kill me or, or worse?..’’ 
I muttered out a ‘’No’’ before I  stepped inside, he stood aside, looking at my sure movements,  almost as if he thought I knew what I was doing.
‘’What goes down here’’
‘’If I told you, I’d probably have to kill us both’’.
I took that not as a warning, but a silent scream for hopelessnes.

**[JOURNAL SEEMINGLY NOT CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL HOURS]**

He explained it all to me, a machine. A curse and a blessing. The machine that could think. 
I can’t write it all down, but I can think about everything that could be done, he said to me I could and most likely would have to do what no human should ever do, but I was going to save the world, I was going to be a  hero.
He’s inside, preparing the machine as I write this down, I can hear every button click and lever pull.
~~God help me.~~ 

**Let me help you, God.** 

**[END OF JOURNAL]**

Material D1X-nb4ls was found in a  grass field, the report of Material D1X-nb4ls came from a farmer who was doing his every-day walk. He read through the journal and thought to himself that it was the scramblings of a mentally ill person, he took the Material to the police station, one of our interns who work there brought the attention on it.

I thought that Pro Tools had fixed this issue and didn't allow you to record when the sample rate on the converter was set to something different then the session. I recently let an intern set up a session and he choose 44.1 I didn't catch the fact that the converters were set to 48 until it was too late. Now if I try exporting anything the audio sounds slowed down.

The only way I know how to fix this is to open up the session and have the converters set to 48 so it plays back normally then output the tracks to another machine/computer/interface.

Is this the only way? Has anyone else had this issue before?"

51i6cn,20,2016-09-06,Getting that first Junior iOS Dev Job,HeyImDoc,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/51i6cn/getting_that_first_junior_ios_dev_job/,"A little backstory:

I'm 18 years old and got kicked out of the house a couple months ago and am currently staying with a friend. With $1100 left in my bank account I spent $680 on a macbook and have been coding here for a while. I have been doing iOS development since the age of 12 and have 13 apps in the iTunes Store. Now, they're obviously not the greatest of apps, but each app displays a certain skillset such as Core Data, JSON parsing, MapKit, etc.

At this point I can't go to school and I need to find a job as soon as possible so I can move out and go on with my life. I've taken the following steps to look for a job (I'm trying to stay as local (Orange County, CA) as possible for reasons I don't necessarily want to disclose):

- LinkedIn Jobs
- Indeed
- Monster
- Stack Careers
- Messaged lead devs working for local companies via LinkedIn

I do have an update resume which is very neat and displays all my skills. I also have a website which is my blog where I post what I'm learning, and I have a small youtube channel where I post basic videos teaching iOS Development. In addition, I have a GitHub account for hiring managers to look over all my repos. For privacy reasons I don't want to share any of it on here, however these are the skills I currently hold:

- Swift
- Xcode
- AutoLayout (iOS 9 Constraints)
- Git
- Core Data
- XCTests
- RESTful Services
- TableViews, UICollectionViews
- Multithreading (GCD)
- Firebase SDK

I've also worked with many frameworks such as MapKit, Social framework, AVFoundation, etc.

I've been called in for many interviews and have passed many rounds but as soon as I get to the end the company usually finds someone more senior or they pass on me. I got really close to this one startup that said I passed all the rounds and I was told by my recruiter that the other candidates got rejected and we started negotiating salaries, but after I gave my number they went silent for a couple weeks. According to my recruiter they lost a big project they were trying to get and have a couple more products coming into the future and will contact me when they get those, but I can't sit back and wait for that.

 I understand that not having a degree works against me, but I also recognize that many people are self starters and are able to attain programming jobs without one.  

The fact that I haven't been to school to get my comp sci degree is enough to show that I don't really have my fundamentals down. I can create a mini social media app using firebase sdk or create an app that scans ups barcodes and sends those to a service which returns the ingredients, YET I do not know how to build a compiler from scratch. My understanding of algorithms is very basic, as well as data structures. If any of you try to have a conversation with me about trees and nodes I'll have a VERY rough idea about what you're talking about. So in this regard, I'm lacking.

I'm making it a point to practice iOS development day in and day out(today I've been learning using SQLite with Swift) and am just wondering if I'm missing anything?

EDIT: Just came home to find quite a few encouraging replies! I'm going to check out angelList and the SM internships for you all and continue to update :)

EDIT #2: Have been using angel.co for a while, and matched with a couple of startups. I have an interview this Wednesday :)"

If you're interested in role play and you're looking for some inspiration...

Tax season is always rough at our firm, but today had left me utterly exhausted; endless number-crunching, lazy interns, and more documents than one should have to sign in a lifetime had left me with one thing on my mind: fulfilling that inner desire that, deep down, makes all men the same...

During the limo ride home, I imagined all of the things I knew my wife would never let me do to her anymore... Who knew that a ring could tame a slut so easily? No, I needed a new fantasy, a new girl to fulfill my desires, someone younger, with nice perky tits and an ass that would shake when I spank it...

My fantasies were interrupted when my driver opened the partition and said we had arrived home.

Home? No. A house. I'd owned it for only a year since we last moved, but I'd never fucked anyone in it, this was a house.

I arrived to this house to find my wife scolding a young girl I had never seen before. She looked at her feet with shame (which must have been difficult considering her sizable chest, only barely being held in by a flimsy tank top) while my bitch of a wife chewed her out.

""If you don't stop moving my shit around, you're going right back to working fast food young lady!"" she howled, and stormed out.

""Hello sir"", she stammered, if my wife was this awful she was clearly scared of me, ""I'm Tiffany...""

Turn ons: Age play, control (though not excessive BDSM), cock worship, spanking, and I'm sure you'll find plenty more...

Turn offs: Scat, gore, pain, etc

So I just moved to Houston from Austin for an internship and realized how screwed I am without a car. I currently have about $2000 saved up that I could put towards one, and by the end of my internship (mid-December), I think I could save up about $5k. I have about a 15 mile round trip commute to work daily. I will be driving between cities like Austin, San Antonio, and Houston fairly often, but am not looking for much else- just something that runs well for cheap and has A/C.

I have never owned a car and was never really taught anything about them so I have no idea where to start or what to look for. Is Craigslist reliable? And from there, what kind of model and year should I look for? 

I'm simply looking for a running car within my price range that isn't going to crap out on me after a few weeks of use (I've heard horror stories). Any advice is appreciated!"

I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to share about our security setup so I apologize for the vagueness. 

So we are using that camera to record a live feed of the door, and we (need to) use a ChromeBox as a kiosk viewing machine in the office. We currently have it setup with the http URL (http://&lt;IP&gt;/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi) which works fine for 5-15 minutes then the view goes blank. In order to get it back we have to reset the ChromeBox (I'm guessing refresh would work also but the kiosk mode makes it easier to just reboot the machine).

Is there a problem with using the http preview, where it resets? I tried using the VLC Extension in Chrome but we couldn't access the camera via rtsp and if we put the http URL into VLC it still resets. Does anyone have any ideas around this?"

Use a mic, headphones, foot pedal and Express Scribe software to speak the audio onto a Google Docs page with their free Voice Typing, then become a reviewer and make money for more than just beer.
-----------------------

 

I see many posts in this sub pertaining to transcription. one of the most common perceptions about transcription work is that the pay is so low, typically below minimum wage, that the work can't possibly be worth the time you spend doing it.

I would like to say that I agree. The wages are extremely low, usually somewhere around $0.20 for every minute of recorded audio that you transcribe. Some sites will pay you more per minute, and some made in pay less. For a lot of people, this is unacceptable and rightfully so. No one should desire to spend 8 hours a day focusing on poorly recorded audio of people who don't know how to speak.

I would like to suggest that spending 8 hours a day transcribing should not be your end goal. Furthermore, while everyone has to pay their dues in the beginning, there are many ways in which you can make this less tedious, faster, more efficient and therefore, more profitable while you slug through.

I will start at the very beginning of what an ideal ""career"" should look like for a transcriptionist and how we can improve on that by taking advantage of modern technologies and resources that are available. I need to caveat this with a disclaimer that I do not work full-time as a transcriptionist, but I have made quite a lot of money using these techniques over the past year. The amount of money that I have made in less than 12 months is more than $2,000, all in my spare time and in addition to my normal income.

If you are not a fast typist, fear not. It doesn't matter. I'm not even typing this post. I'm just speaking into a microphone and the words are being typed by completely free software that you have access to right now. My average typing speed is around 45 words per minute and I cannot touch type. The scary thing is that I used to work at a 911 emergency call center where typing is pretty important. I have to look at the keyboard which makes its fairly difficult for me to type. Again, that's not much of an issue for me because I speak what I want to be typed now.

Your starting point will be to get the basic certification as a transcriptionist through your chosen website. And I'm not speaking of some professional certification. I'm talking about the certification that the websites require which are usually granted after simply taking a test where you listen to some audio and type it up. It then gets graded for accuracy, probably by an automated process, and if you did well enough you're given the certification. I will use the website Speechpad as an example while I explain this from here on out. That's where I have earned my loot!

Speechpad requires you to type a short audio clip and they grade it. After that you're also required to electronically sign a confidentiality agreement. The process of getting certified is very straightforward and very simple. Anyone can accomplish this in a very short amount of time.

Your next step is to find work that you are qualified to do. This might actually take some time because with Speechpad you start out with the lowest acceptable rating possible (96) so most jobs are not going to be available to you. As a beginner you may think that this is unfair, but as you begin transcribing you'll realize that this is necessary on the part of the website so that they can prove that you are capable and reliable enough to have access to more work and better quality customers.

After you have started working and your rating is built up, it is very important that you keep it up. Once your rating falls below 96, all of your efforts thus far will be for nothing because none of the jobs will be available to you. You must avoid ruining your account which would force you to start over. The amount of audio you transcribe determines whether or not you have access to higher quality work.

Once you transcribe 250 minutes you will have access to Urgent jobs which typically pay $0.35 per audio minute and higher. After transcribing 250 minutes of audio you've already nearly doubled your earning potential. You will have earned $50 when you reach the 250 minute milestone.

The next milestone will be 1,000 minutes, which is almost 17 hours of audio. The 1,000 minute mark is more difficult and when you have reached it you will have earned somewhere between $200-350. Only committed individuals will reach this milestone, but if you follow the tips I'm about to give you, you'll realize that it's not out of your reach.

Once you hit the 1,000 minute milestone and you have kept your rating above 96, you will be able to become a reviewer. This is where you will start actually making money at an acceptable rate. You will already have the Urgent qualification which pays roughly $0.35 per minutes. It's important to note that as a reviewer the rate is also $0.35 per minute. However, it's not the rate that you should be concerned with, rather the amount of work you have to do and the amount of time it takes to complete it.

If we were to transcribe 10 minutes of audio for an Urgent job which pays $0.35 per minute, we would earn $3.50. For a fast typist, they may accomplish this in 20 to 30 minutes. It would probably take me closer to 40 minutes to accomplish this by typing it out myself and about 30 with Voice Typing. It is reasonable to expect to spend 4 minutes working for each minute of audio. By completing this work in 40 minutes I have earned at a rate of $0.11 per minute of my time, or around $6 per hour.

When I review a transcription I still only earn $0.35 per minute, but I spend far less time completing this task. If the transcriptionist has done a good job, I may be able to listen to the audio and read the transcript through without stopping which would mean I have earned $3.50 for 10 minutes of my time. This would be $21 for one hour of work. While this is rare, I think it's important to mentioned because I have learned at this rate before.

I will typically spend 2 minutes for every one minute of audio while reviewing. This means I typically earn between $10-12 per hour which is completely acceptable to me considering what I am doing, that I am doing this on my own schedule and in the comfort of my home. I often earn a bit more and sometimes less, but this is a reasonable expectation. I also cherry pick, which you most definitely should do as well.

So now that we have a goal in mind let's talk about how to get there. You will need to invest some money in some equipment. The items you will need to buy are:

* Microphone
* Headphones
* Foot pedal
* Express Scribe Professional software.

The amount of money that you invest in this equipment is going to determine, to some extent, your efficiency. I haven't included any prices yet because it is somewhat dependent on the quality of equipment do you want to buy. I will tell you how much I have spent and what specifically I have purchased to give you an example. The microphone and headphones I already had, so the only purchases I need to make were for the foot pedal and the Express Scribe software.

My headphones are Audio Technica ATH-M50's which I purchased long ago for listening to music. I spent about $150 on them and I think they are great. You absolutely do not need to spend that much, but the better quality your headphones are, the easier it will be to hear the audio which is very important. My microphone is a Blue Snowball ICE which I spent about $50 for and already had because I use it for gaming, Skype, etc. I recommend you use a quality microphone because the speech recognition software will hear you better and you will have fewer corrections to make in the transcript. You may have a mic on your laptop or on a webcam. While this may work to get you started, I am almost certain you will soon get frustrated with it and want to buy a better mic.

It is unlikely that you have a foot pedal around unless you are guitar player. That isn't the right sort though, you cheeky bastard. The foot pedal you will need is specifically designed for transcription. I purchased an Infinity IN-USB-2 for about $20 off eBay. You will also need to get the Express Scribe Professional transcription software which I paid about $35 for. So your investment will be about $55 plus the cost of a microphone and headphones if you don't already have those. This will be about what you have earned when you hit the 250 minute milestone, so you will earn this back fairly quickly and you will be very glad you made these investments.

The last piece of the puzzle is the Voice Typing in Google Docs. If you have a Google account or use the internet at all then you are probably familiar with Google Docs. You need to create a new blank document, click on Tools, then click Voice typing. You will need to configure your microphone within your operating system and browser, but there are guides all over the internet to help you with that if it's not already configured. 

To put it all together, go to Speechpad, cherry pick a job that you want to do, click ""Export Audio"" to download the file, then upload that into Express Scribe. Plug your foot pedal in, put on your headphones and just verbally repeat into the mic what you are hearing while you control the audio playback with your feet.

The reason you will need express scribe and the foot pedal is that Google Voice Typing requires that your browser where the Google Docs page is at be the active window on your PC. Express Scribe works in the background and since you are controlling it with your feet, you don't have to worry about deactivating the Voice Typing microphone trying to press some hotkeys or use the mouse to control the playback. Google Docs turns off if you click anywhere else.

The final tips I would like to offer are for the ""post-processing"" of your transcript. Google Voice typing is not perfect. You will have to go back and fix mistakes. I recommend that you just try to get the transcript typed out before you make any corrections. This way you don't have to stop and restart so often and you can maintain a steady workflow. After I type the transcript, I go back and listen to the audio again and read along to correct my mistakes. Basically what a reviewer does so this is good practice. It is more important that you turn in quality work at this point than just finish as fast as you can because you need to keep your rating up so you can become a reviewer.

I also use a lot of macros in Microsoft Word to highlight common mistakes, fix spacing, and other things I look for while reviewing. I recommend that you take advantage of this as well and write your own macros if you are at all familiar with VBA or programming. If you aren't familiar, you can just record macros so still take advantage of that tool.

You can also use things like Autohotkey or text expanders if you find yourself repeatedly making the same corrections. The Logitech G710+ and some other affordable keyboards also come with programmable macro buttons that may be of use. I have a G710+ and I use the macros ALL THE TIME. They are super fast to reprogram and very useful. I really recommend a mechanical keyboard in general even if you don't get one with macro keys. You won't type a lot, but you will need to type some while you correct your Google Docs transcript. Mechanical Keyboards make it easier to type and you will earn mad bank anyway, so why not indulge a bit? A final tip is to run your transcript through a more advanced grammar/spell checker like Grammarly to make sure you didn't leave out any commas that I will have to put in for you when I review your work.

Think of the transcription portion as the internship or something. Whatever it takes for you to grind through it. It's possible to make a decent wage from home on the internet if you are smart about it and stick to something.

Edit:
Don't do the shitty jobs after you have access to better jobs. Cherry pick. The websites will be forced to increase the payment for the shitty audio if no one does it to a point where it is more desirable. Then I may even do it, who knows!"

At first, I was ecstatic that I was offered a position on Capitol Hill, especially from a congressman in my home town. The more I think about it, however, a few concerns are raised. Namely:

I need to pay down my debt. I have been barley getting by for close to six months and have ran up credit card debt in addition to student loans I already had. I recently moved out of an apartment and back to my parents to try and pay down debt/save some money in the next six-12 months while I look into pursuing a masters degree at local schools. This internship, which is unpaid for three months, would require me to take out a loan with my family and pay them back, which I don't want to do for comfort reasons.

The congressman I would be working for is very conservative, and while I don't consider myself at all a dire hard liberal, but I don't agree with many of his policies which tend to be Republican standard. All that being said, he seems like a genuine man and I wouldn't mind working for him but I have seen other posts suggesting you work for the party you would want to be in business with long term only.

As mentioned before, I was planning on pursuing a Comp Sci Masters to complement my Finance bachelors degree. My real interest is in public policy research and I think I can leverage those two degrees into something in that area, particularly data analysis. However, the interviewer told me I would also have an opportunity to research legislation while there, and that they would try to hook me up with whatever kind of position I wanted post-internship.

**TL/DR** Is it worth me putting my plans on hold and straining myself financially for a three month DC internship? Is this really a once in a lifetime opportunity, or can I get myself in a better situation financially while building up some practical skills (i.e. formal training in programming) and expect to land a similar roll later on?"

I'm a college student and over the summer I worked two jobs to save money, which was then spent on various emergencies. I had to drop one job because I'm doing an (unpaid) internship this semester. So I'll be working a combined 44 hours a week plus my classes in top of that. I don't have time for another job because of the way my schedule is.

I live rent-free with my dad but I pay for my own car (gas &amp; insurance), I pay for my own phone bill and necessities (toiletries, clothes, etc)

My monthly expenses are;
$94 phone bill 
$50 car insurance
$8 Netflix (my dad's version of rent)
$80 gas
$88 bus (I'll be taking the bus to my internship since it's cheaper than paying for gas &amp; parking)

The brakes on my car suddenly stopped working on Saturday. I got it towed (for free) to my mechanic. And I just now got word that it'll cost around $530 to fix.

I'm starting my internship on Friday and I have to wear professional office clothing. Which I don't have any of. So I have $200 (in my 2nd checking account) to buy clothes for it.

 I'm frustrated and I don't know what to do. I can't prevent emergencies obviously. So any advice is much appreciated. "

I went to college for Software Engineering because I loved everything about programming. I spent all my weekends and free time learning new stuff and programming random things. I took internships at startup web development companies and major banks in Java, just to get more programming time.

Then college ended, and life started. I'm a full time java developer at a huge company, working 8-5 every day of the week, and I absolutely hate it. I stopped working projects in every minute of my spare time, and slowly stopped programming outside of work. My 7-5 destroyed all my enthusiasm I had. 

Recently, I pulled myself together enough to start looking for web development jobs to work on after work, and that spark is back. I spent all of the last 3 weekends working on websites for people, and I loved it. Having the freedom to work on new and exciting projects, and meet all kinds of people sounds so enticing.

I'm very secure financially right now, thanks to the 7-5 job. I have a safety net of 2 years, but I want to have a freelance starting point before leaving work.

My question is.... where do I start? Do I build my own website first, do I work out pricing, do I find clients?  It seems that there are a ton of steps, but I'm not sure what the first one should be. I'd love to hear what you did to start freelancing.

Any comment is appreciated! Thank you!"

Another girl, amazing in every way, broke up with me early spring. I took it hard. During work I would just think about her, trapped in the spiral of guilt, shame, and ambition to be better. After a few weeks I decided that enough was enough- I would embark on the 100 days. Hardmode. It had worked wonders in the past and I was sure it would help me now. I needed 100% of my attention on finishing grad school anyway and didn't want to worry about girls. 


I finished grad school. I was around day 70 and BAM it showed up. Every time I looked around I could see women checking me out. The superpowers hit hard. The Summer of Gold had begun. I knew I could get with anyone I wanted and decided to use it. I started seeing a very cute girl, mostly as a FWB scenario. I figured we were really different and it wouldn't work out long term, but we had great chemistry. She was okay with it so I started seeing another as well. She was older and into all the same things as I. We're mystics. I thought ""this could be the one!"". 


The sex during hardmode was amazing. Let me tell you: not coming during sex was the best think I've ever experienced. All the pent-up energy really takes it to the next level and transforms what sex really is. A lot of guys shy away from hardmode because they feel like they might get into a relationship and don't want to risk not being able to have sex. I say have sex and just don't come. You can give them great orgasms because you literally last as long as you want. If you want more info on that check out some Mantak Chia (Multiorgasmic Man). Finally the 100 days hardmode ended and I was able to come during sex. It was different after that, but I had learned what I needed to learn and was ready to just relax into pleasure and let my hard work pay off. It was so amazing. So serene. There was nothing I wanted in life. I was 100% satisfied.


By the end of the summer the dynamic between myself and the mystic became a bit tumultuous. When she had to leave the country for a month for her visa I wasn't heartbroken. We've kept in touch. The other girl, who I didn't think much of romantically, finally started letting me sleep with her overnight, and wouldn't just leave after sex. She was getting over a long relationship and I was helping her. Towards the end she started letting me in. And I liked what I found. But since the day I had met her she told me her plan was to move at the end of the summer- to go back to NYC to be with her parents. The date came and she disappeared. She told me I had had a strong impact on her. She was now trying vegetarianism and doing yoga daily. I was forced back to hardmode.


We spoke every now and then. We skyped once. I tried to sext her but she said it was too hard for her to sext since she wouldn't be seeing me. We texted about where she was in life and where she wanted to be. At work my internship ended and they wanted to hire me full time. I asked for 5 weeks off. Midway through I decided to go visit her in NYC. 


I just got back from NYC. I literally spent 72 hours straight with her. I was so happy that at the end, a few hours before having to go back to the airport I broke down and started crying. I opened up to her completely. I told her that I didn't want to start a real job, I didn't want to leave NYC, I was going to miss her more than anything. I had so much to do and didn't have the will for it. We both just cried together, naked, and it was fucking beautiful. We even had sex afterward. We both decided that a long distance relationship was too much for us, but that we would stay in contact. 


So here I am, back home. Forced back onto hardmode. I can only think of her and can't imagine being with another woman. It's sad. I wonder if I should try to be with her.

51n6fl,7,2016-09-07,I Get That They're Trying: parental unit and my mental illnesses,CooperArt,TheMixedNuts,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMixedNuts/comments/51n6fl/i_get_that_theyre_trying_parental_unit_and_my/,"This isn't one of the daily update posts, too about me for that, but I thought I'd take it to the people who would know exactly how I feel. It's probably going to be long, but I hope worth reading. 

So, just about everybody in my life, work, home, ect, knows about depression and anxiety. (I have a few select, close, people who know about the DID.)

Getting my parents to understand and appreciate my depression and anxiety has been a whole life-long journey. Suicidal ideation in elementary school got me put on an antidepressant (Luvox, I suspect, from my recall of the pill compared to photos online) at the age range of 6-9. (Wide range, but I have very few autobiographical memories with which to place this whole deal. They don't start coming in steadily until I'm 11.) My mom didn't like how I was on them, describing me as incapable of positive emotion, negative emotion, or just... really emotion. I immediately became very depressed again. I try to bring this up to them a few times, but I got increasingly negative results. After constant meltdowns leading up to my freshman year of high school, Mom declared that my issue was self-esteem related and signed me up for a modeling class. (I don't fully get the connection.) 

My senior year, I got my insurance card, my driver's license, and had saved up money, so I went to a GP (a new one, as the one my mom picked out was mean) and ended up on Paxil, with a referral for free therapy by an intern at a local place.

I don't think my parents are stupid. I know they must have figured something was up when I was suddenly ""going to the movies"" once a week. But Mom figured I had a secret boyfriend. At least, until she looked closely enough at my pill pack to realize it wasn't birth control. 

Shit hit the fan. For two years. Dad was especially upset, explaining how he was sure this was going to ruin my life, and Mom was depressed once and did fine all on her own. Mom rarely intervened.

Here's where the turnaround starts happening. Dad, while drunk, tells me that he's sure I've been having panic attacks since childhood. (Drunkenness level is important because I don't think he remembers telling me this.) Mom, after finding out I'd been off my meds for a while--I was forced due to a nasty side effect and a change of doctors--told me that she was seeing what the meds were doing, and yeah, I should probably continue being on meds. 

My life, up until recently, had been characterized by my parents alternatingly going off-the-rails on my sister or I, but after the turning point, I saw them officially try to ""clean up their act."" Mom would sometimes defend me against my father when he got upset, pointing out to him that I couldn't be a mind-reader. I could give tiny updates regarding my health without upsetting my father. 

Eventually, he got attuned enough that he'd notice changes in me related to my (what feels near-constant, but is more like once every six months) medication changes. He always made positive comments.

And this leads to today. Mom provoked a panic attack at our work. (One of my jobs is for my parents' ""junk"" business, where they sell good parts off of junk motors.) The only people in the room are family and this guy who, when he found out I was on meds, suggested I shouldn't be on them because God didn't want me to. I freaked out, she responded with her own freakout. I immediately began packing up my station. I had planned to stay for another hour, but I couldn't do it, and I had made significant progress anyway. Dad got dragged in, and while he briefly threw his support behind Mom, who seemed to be insinuating I was the only one allowed to be stressed, it seemed to be more in a mediator way than anything else. As I left, he said that he hoped I'd feel better soon. (Like I had the flu or something?)

I stood outside the building trying to calm down enough to drive, and Mom caught up with me incidentally (everyone was leaving to go smoke, and they smoke by the cars.) I told her ""Mom, I'm not going to have standard reactions to stress all the time. I have an anxiety disorder."" 

She said ""I know, but when you freak out on me like that, I'm going to freak out back."" (This conversation went on for a bit longer, but that start is a good summary of it.)

So, while this sucked, I can't help but think about how bad it used to be. They constantly seem like they're moving forward, improving upon their previous stances to behaviors linked to my mental illnesses. 

Maybe, someday, my sister will feel safe enough to tell them she has been diagnosed with PTSD and is on medication for PTSD-related insomnia. "
51npwe,9,2016-09-07,It's been almost 2 years and I still feel guilty,sorrynotsorryxoxo,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/51npwe/its_been_almost_2_years_and_i_still_feel_guilty/,"Bare with me... I have never posted anything about this.

When I was 5, my dad divorced my alcoholic mother. A few months later he picked me up from school and I moved with him to his house 2 hours away. (I later found out that he broke into my moms apartment and packed up my stuff and essentially kidnapped me from school). 
Less than a year later he married my stepmom. 

Growing up I was told my Mama didnt want me. That she loved the bottle more than me. I was raised to believe that everything my parents did was because they ""loved"" me. I am sure none of this is news to any of you. I was spanked for getting anything below a B in school, or for any reason they chose. My grandfather took them to court because of the bruising and the judge ordered no more ""spankings"". That's when I was forced to exercise and eat weird food as punishment. They would have me rake the 1/4 acre yard and then dump all the bags out and have me start over, plank for minutes at a time while stacking encyclopedias on me, etc. For meals, I was served tap water and cream of mushroom soup for the duration of my punishment (which was usually 6 weeks or more). 

Anytime my grandparents defended me to my parents my dad would say ""you cant talk about our personal business or you will end up in an orphanage"" they even went as far as to pull me out of class when I was 8 to tell me I had 30 minutes to get home and pack my stuff so I could go to foster care and then told me that they were kidding. That night I slept in the unfinished portion of our house so I could know what an orphanage would be like.  

At 12, I stopped talking to my grandfather because I picked up the phone one day and caught him being ""mean"" to my dad. 

Fast forward to 17 years old, I move out because my parents are too ""strict"". Our relationship gets better or so I think, but the behavior is still present. This is the time that I really start to heal the relationship with my Mama. When I was 19, she passed away. I had recently moved and gotten rid of a lot of old cards and letters and was telling my Nstepmom how sad I was that I had trashed them. She goes to her room and brings out a box of cards from my Mama to me that she ""saved"". I was so grateful for her act of thoughtfulness. It wasnt until years later that I realized these were cards I was never given from my Mama. She didnt miss my birthdays and holidays like I thought she did. I still regret letting them convince me not to invite my Mama to my high school graduation.

At 21, I married and divorced a sweet Christian man. At 25 I got engaged again, to an amazing man who has been exactly what I needed in my life. I felt guilty even expecting family to attend another wedding since my first marriage was a joke. I decided to let my MIL have the wedding she had always dreamed for her baby boy. She declined the offer and asked how she could help us have the perfect wedding WE wanted. My husband wanted a small event so we decided to go to the beach. we paid for a large condo for us and our wedding party and my MIL paid for a condo for my husbands family. I loaned my parents my new car because I thought they might not come if they had to drive their unreliable vehicle. I also paid for their hotel (which was next door to the condos bc they insisted on a smoking room). Instead of gifts we asked for our loved ones to join us at the beach and informed them that we would be going to a somewhat pricey restaurant after the ceremony (like $30 plates). 

A week before we left for the beach my stepmom commented ""you look like you have been gaining weight, does your dress still fit?"" Mind you, she was with me less than a month prior when I tried it on. So I blew it off and causally answered ""yes ma'am it fits"". During the time at the beach we had little events planned that we funded. A Dolphin Cruise, dinner at our condo with beer and cupcakes, etc. My parents opted out of these events (including the dolphin cruise that they had agreed to when we bought non exchangable non refundable tickets). Again, I did not stew on this, we were determined to have a perfect weekend. 

When we got home, we went to pick up my car and while my husband was outside, my stepmom commented ""is he okay? he seemed so upset all weekend that I thought he changed his mind about wanting to marry you"" At this point I didnt want to hurt HER feelings by saying ""he was pissed yall kept being antisocial so he was agitated when you were around"" so I told her he was fine. That weekend my MIL threw a wedding party at her house for everyone who didnt get to go to the beach. Again, my parents didnt attend.

A few weeks later my stepmom calls me to come over. She lives half an hour away. I am a full time student with a full time job and a full time internship, so I try to schedule a time to meet for lunch when I KNOW she will be in town. She snaps that it is important and I need to come over. The whole time I am stressed and thinking she or my dad are dying or something. They sit me down and she precedes to tell me what an embarrassment I am for inviting people to my wedding and not paying for lunch afterwards. At this point I am fuming. She starts calling me a liar and swearing that I told her I was paying for lunch etc. 

THEN IT CLICKED. I wasnt a kid. They couldnt ground me or spank me. So  I tell her that everything out of her mouth is crazy and I leave. My dad calls and tells me to come back and apologize. I tell him I dont have anything to apologize for and he hangs up on me. 

A month later, one of my best friends kills himself, so I decide to call my parents and try and reconcile. I word my apology carefully so as to not sacrifice my own respect to the situation so I say ""I am sorry I made some choices you didnt agree with and I am sorry I fired back at you when you tried to discuss it with me"" she tells me it is water under the bridge and all is forgiven. I talk to my dad, who says the same. A week goes by and I feel like something is still up so I call to ""check-in"". My stepmom is  short with me so I decide to let her go, she snaps ""we need to talk"" and then starts to question the quality of my apology. I politely tell her I did not lie to her and I will not apologize for something I didnt do. She hangs up on me. 

A month later, my dad calls and tells me ""you need to apologize to your stepmom so you dont ruin the holidays."" I told him I already apologized and he snaps ""well its been nice knowing you, have a nice life"" and hangs up. That was December 4, 2014. I have not heard from them in 2 years but I have heard that they tell people that I am the one who cut them off because I am selfish and Godless. 

So, why do I still feel like it is my fault that we dont speak, while at the same time feel guilty because I hope they never try to reconcile?

PS: I HAVE since reconciled with my grandparents and they adore my husband ♡"

51ns6n,14,2016-09-07,[Support] [Advice] Exploded on NMom - relationship probably over,dj_dad885,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/51ns6n/support_advice_exploded_on_nmom_relationship/,"Hi all, I am a long time lurker or this sub and all of Reddit, but this is my first ever post. Apologies for formatting errors, etc. 


Before I get into what happened today, I want to give a brief history of my relationship with my mom. She had me at 19. Her pregnancy prevented her from going to college and she had to change her life plans drastically. For my whole life, I've been treated like an unwanted burden. My mom reminds how hard I made her life, how much better my life is (currently I am 22), etc. She's been emotionally abusive for as long as I remember and there were times when she was physically abusive. I didn't realize how abnormal my relationship with my mom was until I was 18 and off at college. Seeing other people's interactions with their parents made me realize how wrong mine was. I was able to enroll in therapy and my counselor confirmed what I had been suspecting: my mother is an unstable, abusive parent. 


Fast forward to today. I don't live at home with my family and rarely see them. My mother doesn't try to get me to come over and barely speaks to me when I do. The only reason I still go home is to see my dogs. They're with my parents while I job hunt (I just graduated from university this month!) before I take them to live with me. So I went home with my boyfriend to visit the dogs. We weren't anticipating my mom being home, but she was. At one point, I picked up one of my dogs and the new dog the family has lunged at my dog, trying to attack my dog while he was in my arms. My boyfriend and I both reacted harshly and he grabbed the dog off of my dog. 


Proceed to my mom losing it. She starts raising her voice, telling my boyfriend how inappropriate his reaction was. He calmly tried to explain that the new dog was attacking my dog. My mom transitioned to full on yelling, swearing at my boyfriend and telling him how disrespectful he is, etc. He is still trying to calmly talk her down and reason with her, before she kicks us out of the house. I stayed quiet through the fight and as we go to leave, she angrily yells, ""Bye dj_dad885."" I meekly respond with my own goodbye, which was not good enough. She starts screaming at me about how awful I am and I responded with, ""I'm not doing this,"" and try to get out the door with my boyfriend. She came down the hallway and was yelling more, about how she's so awful, blah blah blah and I lost it. I was barely holding it together after she yelled at my boyfriend. I got in her face and screamed back that she's a piece of shit, an abusive piece of shit. After this I immediately left with my boyfriend following me out. She also followed us out, screaming the whole way. 


We started to head home but my boyfriend turned back because he wanted to try to have a calm, reasonable conversation with my mom. Instead she stormed out to the car, demanded my house key back from me, while yelling at my boyfriend the whole time, as he was still trying to reason with her. 


We left. I talked to my best friend and she recommended giving it a couple of days to cool down before reaching out to my mom to talk to her about everything, so I can get it off of my chest. I am worried about my things and the few ties I still have to my family. The bulk of my belongings are in my parents' basement, where I left them when I moved out of my apartment before heading out of state for the summer for an internship. I'm still on their cell phone contract, though that's up in a month. I have my car insurance through them and my health insurance through them. As I've been sending out applications, I list their address as my permanent address since I don't have one myself (currently living with boyfriend). So, I'm concerned about my mail, my car, my phone, and my stuff. I also fear I'll never get my dogs. 


This blow up was a long time coming, but I still feel like shit. I sobbed the entire drive home and talked on the phone to my friend. I am so embarrassed she screamed and swore at my boyfriend. I just generally feel awful and emotionally drained. I'm coming to you guys for support and advice. I know everyone here has probably had similar situations and I'd like to get some words of encouragement and wisdom from those of you who have moved past this point and are doing well. Thank you in advance, RBN. "

I'm currently a student at The Art Institute of Portland, hoping to transfer to The Los Angeles Hollywood location for either Winter or Summer term. Motive being to gain exposure to a better job market, and to connect with peers and mentors who will be better resources for the industry than what Portland has to offer. In addition, the faculty strength in the Game Art department up here is seriously suffering, making me inclined to want to jump ship sooner than later.


1. What is your opinion on the current Game Art instructors? Are they teaching relevant material, that challenges you, going above and beyond ""survival"" level knowledge? How helpful are they outside of class/ on an individual level?

2. Do you think the advisers are properly preparing you for the job market?

3. Do the promised internships stand up? If you had one, was it a growth opportunity or a coffee-run gig? If you didn't get one, why?

4. Are there adequate technology resources? Are computer labs stocked with newer rigs, installed with all current and relevant software? Any other perks you can think of in this way?

5. I understand that the tuition is higher at the Hollywood location, was worth it?

6. During my campus tour in March, I was told that the school has easy access to the Metro line- is this a reliable resource, or is it still better to drive in/ try to live locally?

7. If there are other students who have experience with transferring AI campuses, and anecdotes to how much of a pain getting credits to transfer really was (and what it took to get your needs met), I would love to hear from you as well. 


Looking forward to hearing from you!

#Analysis

Reckasta, a very interesting person. If I can call em that. As far as my research has shown, Jen died a long time ago. She died in a car crash after she lost control of her powers due to some anger from her abusive parents. She was a very troubled person, dealing with lots of abuse. Being locked in basements, malnourished, beaten, probably some sexual things in there too. It would probably explain her current dating behaviors. anyways that caused her to fragment her personality as a protective measure. From what I understand, It wasn't anything spectacular. Jacob and Jade seemed to have a lot less power back then. They were human enough at the time.

So this is where things get interesting. Jen comes back with no memories of her death. I'm pretty sure at this point she began gaining supernatural powers. Things were no longer just the basic magic she had been doing. Probably met the dog around this time. The dogs very important, but I will get back to him later. She at somepoint happens to die again, this time it was suicide. She happens to come back from that even stronger than before. Now this begs the question. Why is she back. She didn't want to live. Even her alters don't even try to stop it. She was pretty set on it. Yet she came back. Obviously one can assume that she didn't bring herself back. It was something else.

This dog, from my brief interactions with it, is something far beyond my comprehension. I can't even fathom why this thing exists or what it even is doing. This thing can teleport, transform and not just to other similar beings, but can cause changes in temperature and even alter light. It has complete control over all of the elements, and is for all intents and purposes omnicient. It has become a little sadistic, probably from all the millenia it has exitested. Here's something though, If you look at Jens abilities, they are quite similar aren't they? Just the dog is better at it... Maybe just Maybe he is supplying Jen with some of his power. Maybe that has some sideffects on her personality.

So why is this GOD bothering with Jen? He mentioned something about an experiment. See my best guess, Jen is some sort of humunculous or maybe cyborg. She died and was forced to res against her will. When she decided to erase her memories, It was computer folders. Not natural in the least. At this point she isn't human. She can morph at will, teleport with limited distance, starting to be able to manipulate peoples perception and alter memories. And if she is some sort of artificial human, It would 100% explain how one of her altars was able to leave jens head.

Now, let's take the gods words at face value. This is an experiment. He also mentioned something about making sure nothing goes wrong in Jens progression. So Jen is basically a slave to this thing, It was able to take control of her body at will. so, I Want to kill this thing. A god needs to be murdered with the kitten body it gave me, So might as well save Jen in the process. The only way to free Jen from this things experiments, Is to ruin the experiment. Force it to take agressive actions. The best way to do that is to explain the experiment to Jen herself. Once she knows she can fight it. And heres the best part, theres two of them now. Jen couldn't do it by herself... But maybe two can? Oh btw it knows you read this... Good Luck, I may not survive to see the outcome of this... But as long as he doesn't kill me I should come back. He can reap souls as it put it...

I took all the precautions I could. I set up as many safeguards as I could to protect my own life. I tried to keep my own conciousness out of it as possible, and keep my memories clean, So it doesn't find out the plan until it's too late. I still had to set up a lot of mortal danger to myself so the dog doesn't realize how deep this plan goes. This is getting released to everyone regardless of the outcome. The people need to know, to fight back, or something at least not become a pawn in this things game. 



#NOTES
Has no idea what alters do when they are in charge

Lack of memories make her 'innocent', She will fall back down the dark path eventually

flirty with like everyone

watch for magic

jade is brutal Now, I want you to crawl to the nearest intern and beg for it's forgiveness. No, not walk, crawl. On your knees.

Screwing with people and psychological torture is pretty much how far she'll go

more relationship stuff...

feet fetish?

She made Jen open it, like she had been doing with everything so far. jade can control jen at will?

jade in charge of jen

He'd get in her room, somehow... However, as that feat alone would be nearly impossible, and I've been wanting to describe an accidental ""power"" of Jen's for a while, no hypnosis until you do a second roll.
He'd find, in place of a regular bedroom, an odd landscape. Not exactly something that would be seen in the real world, and everything digital seemed to be broken inside of it, numbers innaccurate. Upon further inspection, he'd find it was a large, large room, and he was the size of a small playing card. It very much resembled Alice in Wonderland. Dream powers?

make jade remember bad memories to get her off her game

Topaz would take the form of Jennifer's stepmother. Jade would flinch on seeing him, but do nothing immediately, expecting to be hit.

[form of stepmother]How delightfully uncharacteristic... Normally right about this time you'd have forced me to your knees in front of your husband... Or yourself... So, tell me who you are. Jenna's mom is dead... Unless they found a resurrection spell and used it on the worst waste of oxygen ever. Trying to keep her cool... Deep breaths...

Really? When Jenna drove you both off the bridge, I would have sworn you would have learned respect. Oh, how surprising it is you aren't using us to fulfill another of your fantasies, mother.

morphing

Immediately, he would be brought to a scene... A dark room... He was tied up... Sitting... Just sitting... Practically starving to death... He couldn't have been that old... Four, maybe?

He could hear two adults, a man and woman, cruel, cruel people, speaking outside, before they opened the door, and threw what looked to be a dog bowl in her direction. He started eating, as if she hadn't eaten in months.

Immediately, Jae would be forced to watch a hundred memories at once. None of them in which she would have been more than five. In each of them, the same man and woman would be enacting horrible, horrible things on her. Some, sexual fantasies that absolutely no one should have been forced to do, especially not a young girl. Most, if not all, drew blood. Others, extreme physical and mental abuse, that would even put a toll on Jae. The difference between Jade at the first memory, and her at the last, was insane. First, she was an innocent, scared little girl. After, she was the farthest thing from innocent, and had enough hate to drive anyone else insane.

Bend. Your. Knee. She gave a look that said she was wanting to help him, but afraid of something.

She blinks away

She'd immediately find herself on the cold, hard ground, shivering from pain. She could feel blood running down from her nose. After a while, she'd look around, finding lockers, and a crowded hallway. An old man, who would seem to be around sixty, and had a warm, welcoming smile permanently set on his face, would see her, looking startled.

""Jennifer! Are you alright?""

""Oi... Yes, Sir... J-Just a little sore...""

""We're getting you to the nurse's office immediately. I'm assuming you can stand?""

""No Sir...""

""Well then...""

He picked him up, gently, and started carrying her down the hall.

""Two months into Year Seven, and you've already visited her office ten times, correct? Jesus...""

""Eleven....""

The man and women would be screaming at her, saying things so hurtful they would have driven almost anyone past their limits.

Jen, crying, would yell: GO DRIVE OFF A BRIDGE!

Immediately, they would change direction, heading straight for... You guessed it, a bridge. The memory would end before anything really happened, though.

died twice

It broke us. Made us realise disobedience would invoke something even worse... Taught us our place in the word. And after he'd had his fun, he'd put us back together so well, you couldn't even see the scars...

Why do I get the feeling there are some women who would pay for this shit to happen to them... Hell, I think I probably'm standing really close to one of them right now... [in reference to jen]

He raised his hand to around 200cm, to show how tall he should have been.
You think becoming hotter is a problem? Just sayin', you didn't have to become a whole 'nother gender.     implies existance before jen

Natasha's her aunt's name. As much of a psychopath as she is kind, really. And then my friend, Jennifer, is slowly going crazy. Being talked into becoming Natasha 2.0. Rather sad, really. With a grin, she started walking out.

Well maybe I'm not the Jen you knew, OK? From what I heard from Danny, she was a cheating bitch who manipulated and bullied people into doing what she wanted! I'm not her!

If she can edit memories or whatever [jade]

She's alive because she went through a major trauma in my place... [jade]

I'm s-sorry, Sir.... [male person she hates most? dad?]

jen can memory wipe

She put her forehead in her hands, as if she had a massive migraine. [gets migraines when unlocking a memory]

jens computer folder memories

No chance in hell that Jade'd be a 'friend.'

What do you mean..?

Reckasta: 
She's a violent psychopath with no emotion!

It's going to be alright, Jade... You're safe now, he's not going to hurt you again. I won't let him.

Reckasta:

T-Thanks...

What he did was awful, and terrible, and evil. It wasn't your fault, okay?

Reckasta:

Y-Yeah... She hugged him tighter.

jade can give memories as well

(a bit long),pltyx,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/51ojn5/i_feel_like_i_have_no_relationship_with_my_family/,"An a real level, I feel like I don't care about my family at all. I am currently a college student home from the summer (but about to leave). My parents are caring individuals on a physical level (e.g. give me money for college, make me food etc) but emotionally I have no connection with them.

 My mother is the kind of person who always thinks she is right about anything, and during high school we would get into a lot of disagreements about pretty much anything. She is kind of a helicopter parent. If I were to tell her I am going on a long trip somewhere for a weekend she would probably not allow me to take my car, 'in case something happens,' or perhaps she doesn't really trust my driving ability. The result here is that (especially if I am at college) I simply choose not to tell her what I am doing, because it is not of use to convince her otherwise. It is a bit difficult to portray how I feel without numerous examples, but it feels though in any situation, if she asks me my preference or opinion, she really wants to her what she wants to hear. Ex: Should we go to 1) or 2). If I said 1, and she said 2, she will say, 'No I think we should go to 2' and completely disregard my opinion. With a lot of instances like this, I come to realize that there is no real way to converse with my mother. She often gets angry at me about things without bringing them up in a calm manner first.

My dad is a pretty reserved person. Sometimes, he gets angry that I did something even though he never expressed that he didn't like something earlier. It's hard to talk to him about anything because it seems like he will agree with whatever I'm saying if I talk to him, but I don't think he does. He isn't the most social person so its hard to ask him something and get a real response.

My brother is kind of a fuck up who started failing college classes but lied to my parents about that due to some depression issues. He moved back with my parents and after some 5-6 years now he may be graduating soon. The main issue is that he is a really condescending person and thinks he knows everything because he reads it online (even though he doesn't know what he is talking about a lot). He seems to lack social skills a bit (as in talk about things that people don't care about) but I don't go out with him too much. What makes me angry is that I am a very hardworking college student with numerous internships etc and I hate being talked down to someone who kind of is wasting his life.

tl;dr: I don't feel like I can genuinely talk to anyone in my family because of the way they act. It makes me pretty sad because a lot of my friends are close with their parents and I feel bad about my feelings. I think some also look down upon me if I say that I am not close with my family, or I don't miss them. I feel like life in the future will be more lonely because of my relationship with my family."
51oxrh,232,2016-09-07,How should I [27 M] breakup with my 3-year GF [24 F] because she quit her job and now has a hard time finding one,terrista,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51oxrh/how_should_i_27_m_breakup_with_my_3year_gf_24_f/,"Back in January, before she graduated with her Associate's degree, my girlfriend ask to borrowed $5000 so she doesn't have to pay interest on her student loan. We did not have a signed contract because she was a paid intern, and another company had already contacted her about working full time after she graduated.


When she started her fulltime job, my girlfriend, did not get along well with her boss. After 1 month at work (this is her first fulltime job), she quit because she got into a big fight with her boss. 

Now she asked one and only one person what to do, her best friend, and she of course, told her to quit. She did not ask for my opinion on the matter, which was quite frustrating since she doesn't owe money to her best friend. Her best friend is also in a different financial situation, since she has a higher paying job, and has more savings than her.  They thought with the unemployment rate for technical people (my girlfriend is a programmer) being low in MA, she can easily get a job. If she asked me, I know I would've easily advised for her to stay 1 year, because from my experience, even I who had a Bachelor's degree had to search for 3 months before landing an entry level job.

Edit: Also, I don't think we are financially compatible. I live a frugal life, so money is a very important factor to how I live. I'd rather not go out on a weekend and go on a country annually, but she wanted to go out every weekend when she had an internship and a job.

My girlfriend has been searching for jobs these past 2 months, although I think not as aggressively as she could. She keeps buying cheap wine every week with her savings, instead of saving money or paying it, since she's saying she gets depressed from all the job searching.

We live separately: I have my own apartment, and she lives with her parents, thankfully. Her parents do not know she borrowed money from me, but only my mom and my best friend knows my girlfriend borrowed money from me, but my mom doesn't know how much. I just told my mom it is over 1000 bucks. I haven't even told my mom that my girlfriend quit her job.

I want to break up with her, but how do I do it without making her more depressed than she already is, while also getting a guarantee that she'll pay me back?

TL;DR My girlfriend quit her job last June, because she was confident she would find a job in programming, but only has an AS degree. She also owes me 5000 bucks instead of taking out a loan. And she needs a better car. But I want out and how can I make her pay me back."

I see that for this course, we meet Thurs. 1-1:55 PM, then later in the day at 6-9:05PM, and then on Fri. at 2:30-3:25PM, so I'm assuming Thurs. 1-1:55 PM is a recitation. If that's the case, then the first class isn't until 6-9:05PM tomorrow so I'm not sure if there will be a recitation before then. 

Anyone know what the professor said?

P.S. I'm also taking CS 491 and I'm wondering if there are any tips for the class (I feel overwhelmed just reading some of the stuff he emailed)--what exactly do we do before we meet for the first time 2 weeks from now? Also, I heard that we need to make a resume but I don't really have one since I switched to a CS major a year ago (I have zero relevant experience (no internships or jobs related to CS at all)/things to put on the resume and it is discouraging and pretty sad to be honest)."
51pfug,5,2016-09-07,Potential Internships for a New Socialist,BMatt95,socialistprogrammers,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialistprogrammers/comments/51pfug/potential_internships_for_a_new_socialist/,"Hey all! I just recently started trying to formally educate myself on the ideas behind socialism and marxism, and I'm really enjoying the process. However, as a college junior studying computer science (minoring in political science and psychology) at Purdue University, it feels a little discouraging sometimes to constantly be bombarded with corporations trying to get me to work for them for however many years until I'm disposable.

Now is the middle of ""internship season"" at Purdue, when recruiters are constantly on campus. Other semesters I would have been purely excited to apply and get a spot at a big software firm for the summer, but I want to be a little more critical of my approach this year. /u/craneomotor suggested I either look for a job somewhere working with open source software, or a job in an industry central to capitalist development (his recommendation was logistics). 

My question for you all is what are your suggestions for ways to spend my summer? OSS? Industry? Let me know your thoughts."
51pobf,1,2016-09-08,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51pobf/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong.

As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.

Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
51pxig,2,2016-09-08,28 F4M - The Unforeseen Consequences of Buying My First Vibrator,getafe,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51pxig/28_f4m_the_unforeseen_consequences_of_buying_my/,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting this many choices. I thought they'd have a few different sizes and a couple that vibrated, but instead I found myself standing in front of a giant wall of dildos, vibrators, magic eggs, rabbits, double-ended strap-ons, rotating rods, suction cupped bases, there are even a couple that squirt, which is kind of gross and kind of...intriguing.

I finally choose one. It's purple, which is cute, and pretty big, but not crazy. (And some of them were crazy, like, bigger around than my arm.) It's smooth, but with some raised veins, and it vibrates. It doesn't squirt.

I walk past the lingerie and party toys, thankful that I don't have to walk through the magazine and video sections to get to the register. I do take a quick glance over there and see a man disappearing into some saloon-style swinging doors. Maybe they have dressing rooms or something back there?

I tell myself there's nothing to be embarrassed about as I make my way up to the counter. I tell myself that the clerk sees dozens of people every day buy things that are not talked about in polite society. I try to make my cheeks un-blush, but I can tell by how lightheaded I feel that it's not working at all.

In case you couldn't tell, I've never done this before.

""Find everything you need?"" I nod and get out my credit card, hoping to transact my business quickly and be on my way. The guy behind the counter is sitting on a stool and the floor back there seems to be several inches higher than on this side, adding to the feeling that I'm a little girl hoping this man approves of me. At least he's younger than my dad.

He starts opening the box.

""Wait, what are you--"" I freeze. What's going on?

""We just have to make sure it works, make sure the right product is in here."" He pulls it out of the box and it bobs its head at me. ""Returns, you know, they're a bitch. Nobody wants to buy a used one of these guys. Well, most people, anyway.""

He pulls some batteries out of a drawer and inserts them into the base. When he flicks the switch it starts buzzing and he immediately drops it onto the counter like it's a fish.

""Whoa! Feisty little guy, isn't he?"" He picks it up and turns it back off. ""Looks like it works just fine. Look okay to you?"" He looks at me, waiting for a response. I nod, still blushing. ""Okay then. Address?""

""Address? You mean, where I live?"" I sputter.

""Just a mailing address. In case there are any recalls or anything. It happens, you know. Not very often, but this here is one household electronic device you do not want catching fire on you, that's for sure.""

I give him my address. Then, when he asks, my phone number. Yes, it's a cell phone, not a landline. ID? Apparently to make sure I'm not under 18. As if I would have risked being seen in one of these places in my hometown, before I left for college. The clerk even signed me up for their membership club so I could get a 20 percent discount on everything, with a membership card and everything.

Eventually, I have my vibrator in a box, in a bag, along with a bottle of lube the clerk gave me, and I'm ducking out of the door into the midday sunshine, hoping no one from any of my classes sees me before I'm in my car and out of the parking lot. I don't even speed on the way home. I just let the anticipation build in the bottom of my stomach...

---

Well that was longer than I intended! But I've been waiting to use this prompt for kind of a while and I've built it up in my head quite a bit. There are several directions it could go, but all of them end up with our heroine being a lot less innocent than she is now.

For instance, she could get a letter or phone call saying that model is being recalled so she gets store credit for the value of it, then she's told about the dressing rooms (or product testing rooms) that aren't quite as private as she might expect, what with the one-way mirrors on three sides and the video camera. This could lead eventually to stripping, gloryholes, gangbangs, prostitution...

Or perhaps she starts getting calls or texts from gentlemen interested in meeting her after seeing her ad. Of course, she's surprised, even shocked, but the places they're proposing to take her are really swanky, the kinds of places she's never been. This could lead to a being taken advantage of, a sugar-baby relationship, sex clubs, prostitution, meeting someone unexpected...

Or maybe the lube sample the clerk gave her has aphrodisiac properties and her personality starts changing. She becomes more outgoing, even quite forward, with the men around her. Maybe she gets a job where she can show off more, as a server at a restaurant famous for their wings and tight orange shorts, or maybe she just starts showing off more at the job she already has (bartender, barista, office intern, university medical office,...).

If all else fails, maybe she just gets caught using the vibrator by her male roommate(s) or her roommate's boyfriend, but I think we can do better than that.

I'm also interested to hear your ideas, as long as it leads somewhere interesting. 

Feel free to tell me what you want me to look like! I really like pretending to be all sorts of girls. If you'd rather I pick, I can do that too.

[I have a kinklist!](https://i.imgur.com/kMI1pUX.png) It's new. I hope it worked right.

Please include a description of your character and where you see this story going!

Looking forward to your creative replies!"

Though that is partly a lie, because I am fully aware of the mistakes I made and the situation I was in to get here. I apologize in advance for how long this may be.

Three years ago I was doing pretty well for a 26-year-old living in a small city in KY. I was a store manager, had a decent amount of money in the bank, an apartment with a fenced in backyard for my dog and I was active in my community. I was working out about 3-4 days a week, writing regularly, had a lot of good friends and was genuinely happy. Being happy was a testament in itself because I have been battling depression since I could remember, and I wasn't on medication. It was at this point in my life that I felt like I was over the ""girl that got away"" and wanted to pursue a meaningful relationship with a girl I had seen basically everywhere I went but never talked to very much. When we finally did speak, everything started out great, until it became something that made me ruin myself. 

Because I was so well off, I was pretty generous when it came to those that I cared about. I was usually the one who had money in my group of friends, so I would pay for meals, give gas money, buy pizza for DnD nights and so forth. None of it was asked of me because I like helping others if it is within my means. This was my first mistake in my new relationship. This girl had a daughter and was living with her mom that on a regular basis threatened to kick her out of the house to the street. Her mom was a very toxic individual and being the nice person I am I offered to help her get out of her mom's sooner, rather than later. At this point, her ex-husband was paying a decent amount of child support that unknownst to me was not court mandated, just their agreement. I agreed to pay for her deposit and first months rent to get her into her new apartment, under the pretense she'd pay me back in about 2-3 months. As soon as she gets into her apartment... the child support stops. She can't pay me back, and instead uses her tax money to pay up some of her bills and housing expenses. At this point, some of her behaviors started to change and become more and more apparent she has really bad anxiety and OCD tendencies. These started to really affect our relationship as she became more and more dependant on me and I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. 

I basically became her only support. I'd buy her groceries, but if she deemed them unclean, damaged or whatever she would throw them away. Sometimes it would be almost brand new food and drinks and such. We'd argue about how wasteful it was and how I had to buy more, but she would threaten to not eat or whatever tactic she could come up with and I would fold because it also affected her child.  I became less active socially, I stopped going to the gym, my stress levels skyrocketed and my depression started to become a real issue for me again. Her anxiety got worse and worse and it became unbearable, but I was her only support. Then her car payment came due and she couldn't afford it, so I paid. Her insurance was late, so I paid. Rent, food, gas, almost everything I started paying for it, and slowly watched everything I had built drain away. She'd yell and be a victim and say she would end up on the street with her child, or she couldn't lose her car because she needed to go to class, and so on and so on... If it wasn't for me, she would have never made it through the rest of her college or her 6-8 month long internship. However, I also ended up on medication for the first time ever. I felt like a failure. 

It was a very vicious cycle that continued on way too long. I should have ended it sooner, but I didn't see a way out. Ultimately I couldn't afford to pay for both my apartment and hers, so we lost both, had to pay breach of contract fees and move in with my parents. I got a new job because my old one closed, and I was making more money, but it didn't matter. She kept draining me away emotionally, mentally and monetarily. My work suffered greatly, I was depressed, stressed and a shell of the person I was. I started to gain weight, and just feel bad about myself. A lot more stuffed happened between us, and I was blamed for it for treating her poorly. I became distant, uncaring and emotionless. I really just didn't care anymore. So I became the target of all our problems. I was the one doing all the horrible things to cause our relationship to crumble. I'm not saying I was perfect in any way. I did do some things I'm not proud of, but it was more to escape and try to find the light again. I never cheated on her, though I had the opportunity. 

While we lived with my parents, it put a massive strain on my relationship with them because of her actions. I finally told her she needed to move out and she did but without my help this time. The ex finally decided to pay child support again. Our empty relationship continued, my work suffered, I lost my management position, I gained more weight, I became more distant. After a few nasty arguments where I was just trying to stop her from taking a bunch of pills, and her ending up punching me in the face, or her thinking I wanted to bang her friend, or my friends, or the girl walking down the sidewalk... I had enough. We broke up and it was the messiest, vicious most emotionally draining and explosive thing I have ever had to go through. Which is saying a lot, because my dad has PTSD from the Gulf War (The catalyst to my own mental issues).  I was finally free and I could breathe again. It was too late for a lot of things though. 

I was no longer well off. I barely had any money, despite making good paychecks. I had maxed out most of my credit cards that were once paid off. I was behind, and couldn't catch up. The bills we had tied together (I co-signed for care credit and she was on my phone plan) she didn't pay on at all. I was finally breathing again but still broken. I thought I was going to make it, but then because of my past actions and behaviors due to stress and her emotional distress I lost my job. So I lost my benefits, and also medication that was actually helping me. 

For five months I looked for a new job, applying to more than 80 locations, and finally found one at 8.50 an hour. I used to make 40-50k a year. I was able to keep up with bills for a little while, but for the past two months I have been denied unemployment (because of very poor communication at the office, and my ignorance of the system), and have no income whatsoever.  I am so far behind on bills I really don't know what I am going to do. I have made so many poor decisions that here I am, turning 30 in a month and living with my parents and so far in debt, I have contemplated things I haven't in years. I won't do anything, as I have made it this far in life I won't give up now, but damn do I wish I had a breather.  

The one plus I have is I found a girl I really care about, and she is good to me. Sadly I can't go to her for a lot of this because I will never do to her what I allowed to happen to me. I am determined to get through this, but for the first time in my life, I don't know how. I have to keep moving forward even though most days I can barely get out of bed. I really don't know why I am posting this... I just felt the need to write it out. For those that read the whole thing, I commend you for reading my story. "
51q7es,5,2016-09-08,please help me. am I just being a lazy imposter? why do I feel wrong?,JanetSnarkhole,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/51q7es/please_help_me_am_i_just_being_a_lazy_imposter/,"Today I texted my internship again saying I can’t come cause I’m not feeling well.
I lied and said I have a migraine but while my head does really hurt I just do not know how to get out of bed, get showered,  put on my ‘face’ and sit amongst everyone. I am studying to be a teacher so that would mean sitting among teenagers and then in the teacher’s lounge with co-workers. I just can’t do it today.

But now I feel horribly guilty for cancelling.

I think I might be depressed. But, what if I am just being lazy? What if I went to the doctor and he laughed at me and said that I’m just being lazy?

I don’t see a point in life. I don’t want to die, either, cause I love my cats and my boyfriend, and sometimes I can be happy. When I’m not anxious, or actually have some energy, life can be OK.

It’s weird, because yesterday I actually did some work and went outside for lunch but now I can’t even get out of bed?!

What if its just the start of the schoolyear?! I started feeling like this a week ago, but I’ve been anxious my whole life. Enough to function though. But lately I can’t muster up any energy. Sometimes my boyfriend would just pull me out of bed, and then I went to whatever event, and I would have a good time, but just feel shit the moment  I get home.

On paper I shouldn’t be this sad. I’m doing a crowdfunding thing to realise my dream and everyone believes it will be fully funded, cause there is a lot of enthusiasm. I just can’t see it happen though, I’m just an imposter and don’t know what I’m doing. I  am continuing pitching to people and contacting sponsors but I’m just going through the motions and really don’t see the point cause it’s gonna fail anyway?!
And why am I sad because I have a lot of friends who would be here in a heartbeat if I just felt like it had a point in telling them about this?
And why am I sad because I finally found a boyfriend  this year who is worth everything and who just appreciates me the way I am and doesn’t try to change me and likes me even though I’m suddenly the fattest I’ve been my whole life? 

What if its just because my boyfriend had to leave the country for work this week and I don’t know when I’m seeing him again? What if I’m just sad about that? Or what if its just his existentialism rubbing off on me?

What if I just feel overwhelmed? Because I’m doing my studies, my internship, my research project, my crowdfunding thing, and a job at the same time. Maybe it’s just that?

Or maybe it’s just because I’m worried about my financial situation? Only 4 euros in my bank account right now. It’s anxiety-inducing on the one hand, but on the other hand, I just think: money is just made up, and what’s the point?

I can’t be depressed, can I? I’m the good child. My sister is the mentally ill one.  My dad says I should just accomodate to her. But she’s tiring me out with all her selfishness and narcissism. What if it’s just that? Maybe my sister is just draining me?

I just feel like I’m not allowed to be depressed. I feel guilty for having off days and canceling things. I’ll feel guilty because I wouldn’t be the golden child my dad thinks I am. He said I’m his only normal daughter, but I wouldn’t be if I was depressed would I? And how would I ever finish this degree if I was depressed? Who benefits from a depressed teacher?

I think I’m depressed, but then I think not, maybe I’m just a lazy attention-seeker,  a imposter, faker, making excuses? 

I’m not even sure if it is sadness, it feels more like some sort of pointlessness, like everything’s made up and I’m just playing by someone else’s rules.

While I’m not suicidal, I don’t see the point in life anymore. I feel like a puppet. I am constantly tired even if I do go to bed early, but I like sleeping better than being awake anyway. I can’t concentrate on things anymore. I cry about every little thing like my sister eating all the chocolates or running out of catfood and having to go to the grocery store.

Please tell me Reddit, am I just being a lazy attention seeker and will the doctor laugh at me if I attempt to get help? (And that’s me thinking do I even want help. What is the point anyway?). 

I would ask people around me, but I think my boyfriend would think he caused this with his existentialism (while in reality he did just keep me sane by saying ‘even though it’s all made up you gotta go on'). I don’t see the point in talking to my dad and sisters, cause my sisters have (had) way worse mental illnesses. And why would I tell my friends. I’m usually the listener myself.

I also thought about making a throwaway but what is the point.

I also feel disgusting about how self-pitying this story sounds, I'm sorry  about that...

thanks for reading everything if you did. I'm going back to bed for now."
51qy3q,1,2016-09-08,34M4F - A few scenarios to pick from,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51qy3q/34m4f_a_few_scenarios_to_pick_from/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as 

* the intern gets a special offer
* staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I've just finished my 2nd year of a 4 year BSc. in Computing here in Ireland.

I'm looking to spend a gap year in the Nairobi area to spend some time with my Father before going back to Ireland to finish my degree (I would be staying near Kiserian) and was wondering if anyone knew where I should look for entry level software development jobs or internships mainly working with java.

I have a kenyan passport so I can work in Kenya no problem.

I've been researching on my own but there are so many different jobs sites and I'm wondering which ones are most popular in Nairobi. The websites I'm seeing all appear to cater to non-nationals and a lot of them look like they haven't been updated with job listings for a long time.

Even if I can't find any jobs in software development I would be looking for any kind of customer service job (retail, waiter etc.) so if anybody could point me in the right direction regarding recruitment websites etc. I would really appreciate it!

Asante sana!

51rfgx,17,2016-09-08,First flying lesson Saturday...need life advice,RT_16,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/51rfgx/first_flying_lesson_saturdayneed_life_advice/,"Hello, /r/flying!

I'm in dire need a little life direction, and I'm hoping some of y'all can provide some insight.  I've been reading as many threads as I can find about this, but coming in with limited flying background, everything I read about flying careers seems so intangible and unreal.  Hoping someone who has been in my place can tell me how everything turned out for them.  

I'm a senior in college who will be graduating in December with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  The thought of working a 7-4 engineering job, every day, in the same place, makes me want to go hide under a rock.  (I recently quit my internship at a local automotive plant after a year and a half to focus on school for my last semester--typical ""co-worker died of cancer, gave me a wake-up call and I ran screaming from that lifestyle"" move).  I recently considered going back to get my Master's, with the hopes that I could go to work in the defense industry and blow sh*# up in the desert, or something along those lines.  

Last weekend, I flew for the first time since I was 14.  We took a private jet on vacation, and while on vacation we had an opportunity to fly in a seaplane.  I dove into the co-pilot seat on three of the four flights, and I have never, ever, felt so...alive.  (*Insert remainder of cheesy ""flying is amazing"" spiel...sure you all understand.*)  With an engineering background, I also have an immense appreciation for the science behind flight.  It was all so cool.  Whew.  

I'm taking my first flying lesson this Saturday (technically a discovery flight...checking out the local airport).  I've got about a month to figure out what I want to do with my life, and suddenly I've found a whole new passion.  I've always been a person of passion: wildly impulsive, an avid outdoors(wo)man and willing to piss away my last dime on Jeeps, boats, or dirt bikes.  That said, I'm not reckless.  But  I will lay everything on the line to help or protect someone.  That's the only thing that truly ""drives me,"" if you will.  I've been looking into jobs flying float planes/small pistons in remote areas, but I don't know a single person personally who holds a job like that.  Flying for an airline doesn't sound quite as interesting to me, but of course I haven't flown enough to know for sure.  Salary isn't a huge concern, but I don't intend to eat Ramen until I'm 40, either.  I will, I assume, eventually want to get married and have a family.  Are there a good number of jobs flying small planes (is there a general term for that type of thing?)  that are relatively stable?  Is that like chasing the end of a rainbow?  Is everyone laughing because I'm the 25,604th person to get stars in their eyes for float planes and conjure up unrealistic dreams?

If I tell my parents, ""I'm moving to Canada to land planes on lakes!"" am I going to get laughed out of the state and wind up miserable and full of regret?  

We all have one life.  So many people are willing to settle for mediocrity, but I feel that pilots in general have more or less pursued their passions.  How did it turn out?  What do y'all recommend I do in the immediate future?  It would take an act of God to afford to get my PPL before I graduate, and even then, I couldn't immediately get a flying job (and would obviously need a lot more training to get other ratings, etc).  If I ditch grad school and get a real job, I may not have time to fly.  If I go to grad school, I may not have money to fly.  If I sell everything I own and beg on the streets and get my PPL before December, I'll still have to get a regular job, even if I wanted to continue flight training.  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance, everyone.  

Sincerely, 
A lost college student

UPDATE:  Thanks to everyone for the quick and positive advice!!  I've got plenty to consider and am excited about the possibilities for the future.  Y'all rock.

51rnfx,11,2016-09-08,American considering working/interning in England (specifically Liverpool) with questions,BobbyKnightsLeftNut,LiverpoolFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/51rnfx/american_considering_workinginterning_in_england/,"Hi, I'm an American student who is studying to become a sports journalist. I graduate this spring and so I need to either find an internship or a job for after college ends. For those not familiar with the journalism field in America, the job market isn't exactly booming. I'm going to be applying to places all across the country, and I figured that if I'm going to be doing that, why not also apply to places internationally?

Anyway, another journalism student friend of mine was telling me about how he has plans to try and work in Bangkok next summer at a paper there and explained to me how he planned to go about getting the position. It made me realize that I should try the same thing, and it would make the most sense for me to try to go to England (specifically Liverpool for probably obvious reasons). It's somewhere I've always wanted to go, there wouldn't be a language barrier and it would be fascinating to spend time and cover sports in a country where soccer (football) is king. I'm going to start cold calling newspapers in Liverpool and across England very soon asking about summer internship opportunities or any other possible positions they could have for me.

My questions are the following and directed at people from Liverpool and England: what are some of the most respected newspapers and other media outlets that exist? Where are some newspapers I should avoid (other than the newspaper that shall not be named)?

Also, if I couldn't go to Liverpool or ended up somewhere else, what other places in England would you recommend? Of course everyone knows about London, and I know Birmingham is the next biggest city, but I don't really know which cities are considered desirable, which ones have a lot of crime, etc.

Also, this is a bit more specific, but if anyone has direct knowledge of the journalism or sports journalism culture in England, what's it like? It appears to me as an outsider that it's a lot more tabloid-y, which I'm not a huge fan of but it is what it is. I also looked up a few newspapers online and saw how small the staffs are. Newspaper staffs in America are definitely shrinking, but I wasn't expecting to see newspapers for major cities having 6-10 staff members and that's it. So any information on that front would be helpful as well.

Any other kind of advice or tips would also be greatly appreciated. I know this post isn't really soccer or LFC related, but I figured that there would be plenty of people here who could help me out. I also messaged the mods ahead of time to make sure I could post this, so I do have their blessing.

Thank you ahead of time to anyone and everyone who replies."

My parents have always been super strict about my school rules. I've always had pressure on me to not get bad grades. 

About 2 years ago I failed college. It happend a few months after I started living on my own. I never told my parrents I failed. For 2 years I lied about it. When they asked me how I was doing I said fine. 

The longer I lied the harder it became to tell the truth to them. I didnt want to disappoint them or get angry at me. Recently I told them I only needed to find an internship and finish it to graduate. They started helping. My sister too. Giving tips and spend hours with it. I just could not get myself to tell them. Same goes for my friends. Everyone just thinks i'm still studying.

A few weeks ago I had a breakdown and I have one now. I'm scared, I started to ignore their calls, emails. Afraid of all the questions. They have started to send emails about how they are concerend and ask whats going on. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to get on with my life. I have made some bad choices and a lot of sad shit has happend so far. I want to live a life without constant worriering or being sad. I have never known this feeling except for my childhood. When people see me they see just a shell, I can act perfectly normal but inside i'm always crying.

I'm stuck, the one thing that is holding me from moving on and getting a job is telling my parents. I don't want to disappoint them, make them sad. I'm even more affraid that they lose it and  get very angry. I know my dad, he will explode from anger.

I'm 24, in college debt and stuck. Please help, I don't know what to do anymore."
51scml,75,2016-09-08,Blow by Blow Justice,schoolgirlerror,Schoolgirlerror,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schoolgirlerror/comments/51scml/blow_by_blow_justice/,"**[WP] It's 2016, trial by combat was never outlawed and is still a valid way to settle disputes. You are in charge of a law firm, gladiator division.**



Even the street rats avoided this part of town. There was nothing left to steal, and the bars on the windows reminded them too much of prison. We had the odd disturbance: a junkie who needed a quick rush and didn't have the cash for it, or some punk who thought he'd get something out of the cash registers. Joke's always on them. My clients pay in other ways. 



Hammer and Red's: Attorneys at Law sat above a gym packing more metal than a suburban mother in an open-carry state. My day began at five in the morning, before the sun lit up the burned-out cars and discarded needles of the alleyway outside. Some bright spark had graffitied a picture of a rainbow on the wall outside my gym. I kept it. Nothing wrong with a little colour.



I rattled open the metal blinds of the gym, letting light flood the place. The free weights, the cages for squats, the long barbells stacked against the wall. All made out of cold, black iron, the way I liked it. I put a pot of coffee on, letting the must and the damp smell give way to arabica roast. The urge to smoke itched at me, and I threw back a couple of sunflower seeds, crunching them in the silent room and spitting the shells on the floor. 



Discipline, all it took.



Inventory, stock checks. At ten past five I opened the office upstairs. The gold lettering on the door said Hammer and Red's, but Hammer was long dead. A civil tribunal for a domestic abuse case. Hammer got swelling on the brain, and the abuser got to keep the kid. He fought fair. Inside, I'd still kept his desk, dust building up over it. Only last week I'd got around to putting an advert in the paper. 



*Wanted, licensed attorney. At least 5'6, bench body weight, and trained in MMA and boxing. Serious enquiries only.* 



Hammer's fish files lay forgotten on the desk. Just looking at them made the old scars and bruises begin to hurt. I needed a new partner and fast. The fights weren't going to fight themselves, and I'd be damned before I let women fight custody battles on their own. 



At half five, I started warming up. The greasy ring in the centre of the gym had seen a fair few bouts, but now it lay empty as I eased myself into skipping. Fast feet, fast mind. My dad never let me forget it. When I exercised, I could forget about the cases that lay in wait for me upstairs. I could forget Mary Blount, with her two kids and the cigarette burns on her arms. I could forget her estranged husband, Lyle, who packed meat into cold freezers in a depot out of town and couldn't wait to add my corpse to that of the slaughtered pigs he handled. All I had was the burn of my muscles and the beating of my heart. 



At five to six, the door cracked open and I stopped. Hands hanging down by my side, breathing heavy, I watched someone ease under the metal grille. 



""Hello?"" 



A woman, but not the type I represented. She was a head shorter than me, muscled in the shoulders, carried herself with her chin high. She carried a neat manilla folder, and wore a business suit and smart little heels. Her hair was twisted up with a clip behind her head and her face, though free of makeup, was pretty, ruined by the purple scar on her chin. 



""Hi,"" she said again. I stripped off the boxing gloves to shake her hand, and I got a sense of the callouses she had against her fingers. ""I'm Gabriella Cole. I'm here about the job?"" 



""Look,"" I said. There wasn't a good way to say it. Sure, she could carry herself well, but I went three rounds with angry, abuse inflicting men every two weeks. ""I'm not looking for a girl.""



""I've done modules in family law. Graduated summa cum laude,"" Gabriella continued. She waved the manilla folder at me. ""I've done internships for two different law firms this year, but corporate isn't for me. I need to work in family law. I've been boxing for six years, I can hold my own in a fight."" 



""Against executives, maybe,"" I rolled my shoulders, pulled a robe back on. ""You want to look like me in six years? Broken nose, missing teeth? Because that's what being an attorney is about in this side of town."" 



""I don't care,"" she jerked her chin at me. ""You can't *not* hire me. It's discriminatory. Give a chance, please."" 



""Alright,"" I said. ""If you want it so much, you get a week. We'll put you through a test case, and if you win it, you can work here. But it's not going to be pretty."" 



Gabriella scowled. She clutched the manilla folder to her chest. 



""I'm not here for pretty,"" she said. ""I'm here for justice.""

51sdwr,2,2016-09-08,Trying to avoid heartbreak again [M 22],sleepingtalent901,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/51sdwr/trying_to_avoid_heartbreak_again_m_22/,"Long story, I met a girl 2 years ago. I wasnt interested in her at the time, but I was asking advice to date someone else, and this girl threw herself at me. She had a rough past, she never really had any friends, and the guys she would meet were always from random online places like omegle. Many would leave her pretty quickly after she started talking about getting married and things within a few days of dating. She always wanted to be in the honey moon stage. She may have been bipolar as she would have mood swings often. She fell inlove with me pretty quickly and eventually I was getting facetimed every day for a few hours when we werent able to be together (it turned into long distance). She would always want to talk to me and wait for my texts.

Our relationship continued pretty well for the first year, and the second year, she started playing a video game (league of legends), it became an addiction. She also started to show tons of signs of depression, and didnt go to class anymore, stayed at home and watched netflix all day.  she had to drop out of school.

She would make lots of stupid small fights with me every now and then, but at the time I had gotten attached to her enough to just deal with it, figuring this is how it is after the first year or so. But at the same time she always wanted to talk, always called me cutie pie and sent me tons of pictures.

Come last Saturday, I purchased a new game and she was still (seemed to be inlove), and was going to buy the game, and on Sunday boom. No responses. Monday I got worried because I thought she was suicidal, and she wasnt responding so I asked a friend to text her, and she said shes fine, and that evening she said she wanted time alone to see how she felt. Whenever she used to abuse me I would just put down the phone for an hour or so, and she would consistently call me, I wasnt sure if she was desperate for attention, so I sent her lots of texts saying I cared about her, and whats wrong, everything was fine until yesterday. She said leave me alone for a few weeks.  

I was pretty bothered for the past few days since she wouldnt even pick up the phone to break up with me, and I went out on my own trying to figure out what happened. All I could figure out was on Sunday the day she left, she was playing her addiction game with a guy named AMC. And not really having anyone else besides me, I figured she must have told him something and such. 

Anyway the guy wouldnt add me so I figured something was wrong. I eventually added one of his friends, and his friend today let me know that shes fine, and shes not coming back, and that she has lots of friends at school (which has never been true since she was 13 to last saturday).

My ex always wanted me to be loyal to her, and I was, and she was very picky about who I talked to online, and careful I dont talk to other girls. I didnt mind because I was quite happy with her. 
Anyway, I uh, well in March, a guy was being flirty with her online, and I asked her to not talk to him, Eventually it became my punishment that whenever she was mad at me, she would add him back and talk to him.

I added this guy and asked him the honest truth, and basically he told me, they would talk to each other a lot more than just the game on kik, they shared non sexual photos with each other, and things like that. And she always seemed a bit crazy to him. 

anyway this guy eventually worked his way out, and now its this other guy. Today I feel an odd sense of closure and happiness even though the carpet was ripped out from under my feet because I know something might have  been wrong with her and not me.

I did everything I could to keep this girl happy, in moderation, buying her presents, talking to her when she was depressed (which was a lot), buying her food when she was sad, trying to help her get on her feet for school, trying to help her get internships, I would wake up in the middle of the night if she needed to talk, I would take a break from my internship if she wanted to call me at work, when we were together I would take her on fancy dinners, spend 3-4 hours with her at the mall to shop for clothes just to watch her not like anything they have, and deal with a lot of her fights.

She knows her history of not being able to keep any guys for more than a few days, and being unable to meet any besides online. It is still hurtful to see she threw me away, and I dont want this ever to happen in the future. Since high school ive been in a few relationships, about 10, and Ive never felt hurt this way, and I honestly never want to deal with something like this again and I dont know how to avoid it.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I wasnt attractive or something, but who knows, I cant post links here anyway. 

TL:DR! dont want to face a break up like this ever again,"

So they try their best to catch his attention until one day he sees earth and goes ""Huh? OH SHIT!""",inkfinger,Inkfinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Inkfinger/comments/51skg2/humans_find_out_god_attends_to_other_planets/,"[Link to the original prompt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/51rszn/wp_humans_find_out_god_attends_to_other_planets/)

----

God drifted through the universe, his mind already on the planets he needed to see several galaxies ahead. 

There were fledgling species on a few of them. One planet needed its climate nudged ever so slightly if it had any chance of survival. He twisted in midspace to avoid a passing comet. He misjudged his weight and shot through a nearby solar system. It looked vaguely familiar. When had he last passed through it? 

Ah, yes, with Earth's birth. Nice little planet. Beautiful oceans. He'd been proud of those. Oh, and the humans lived here too. They were probably doing fine, despite the prayers he sometimes heard scratching at the back of his mind. Although they'd been strangely silent during the past two millennia, for some reason. 

They probably sorted themselves out. Good. He made a habit of not returning to the old ones. They had to find their own feet, get a little independence. Couldn't expect him to swing by every time there was an earthquake or a little ice age or some genocide...

He glanced fondly at it as he drifted past. His eyes stretched as he *really* looked and screeched to a sudden halt.

""Oh, shit!"" he blurted out, taking in the oceans with horrified eyes. 

Brown. Completely brown. How had they turned the oceans *brown*? It ruined the whole colour scheme! He drifted closer and reared back as the smell hit him. He felt a real wave of anger for the first time in millennia. How *dare* they literally shit on his lovely oceans like that? How could this happen? He'd made them clever enough to figure out how to keep the planet clean...

He tried to find them to kill them, but the planet was deserted. Except for a few abandoned radio stations, dotted on the surface that was covered in rubbish and filth. 

And then he heard the message. Emitted repeatedly.

**When other sentient life finally contacted us, we heard you like the planets more than the species on it. So we moved. You don't seem to care, anyway. We'll keep using Earth as a nice big dumping ground, though, on the off chance you ever see this. We did it specially for you. If you ever find us and we died, just know we all agreed we hate you.**

The message was dated 2050. A solid two millennia old.

He hissed to himself and concentrated as hard as he could to locate the humans. If he really wanted to, he could track any of the species he'd made. He propelled himself from Earth and sped in their direction. 

They were on a nice, empty and habitable planet he'd made long ago. The one they once called Proxima B, and now knew as Prox. He'd never thought they'd reach it. They probably hadn't as well. 

His fury grew as he raced towards them. His oceans were ruined. All his beautiful species, wiped out. Even the penguins! He'd loved the little penguins infinitely more than he'd ever loved *them*.

If he focused, he could know what the humans thought in minute detail. For the first time since their creation, he concentrated on them, harder than he ever had before. 

The current humans only knew Earth as a historical footnote of their species' beginnings. And, of course, as the 'recycle bin' of their kind. They sent giant ships there to dump their waste, and tittered every time they saw the childish message their ancestors had left behind, as they abandoned Earth. Left it there because they thought it was funny. They didn't even believe in him, anymore. A planet of atheists, except for a handful of religious people who were widely considered crazy.

They'd long since decided the alien species they'd met so long ago, who had told them of him, had been lying. 

Ignorance and stupidity were no excuse. Someone would pay. Several billion someones.

------

An alarm pinged in a control room on Prox, alerting the human on duty that some form of sentient life had been detected on Earth's surface a while ago. 

Dumping Ground Watch, as it was commonly known, wasn't exactly a duty anyone volunteered for. Who wanted to watch oceans of shit and rubbish all day, on the off chance some roaming alien life found it and tried to occupy it?

Kevin, the intern for the past past three months whose last day had finally dawned, yawned as he checked the sensor. The alarm suddenly stopped. The sentient life was gone. The tracking system showed it moving away at an incredible speed.

Kevin snorted as he leaned back in his chair and nodded off to sleep. Probably a glitch. Nothing could move *that* fast. These systems hadn't been updated in ages. He wasn't clocking in any extra hours for *that* little alarm."

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

I graduated from a Canadian University with a degree in petroleum engineering in April 2015. as you all know the market had fully tanked by then, and I was unable to secure a job in the Oil industry. I tried to stay optimistic and kept applying and working on my network. 

Since I graduated I've been working different survival jobs, in hopes that I will be able to secure a career in the near future. However, things have been looking bleak as of late, and I can't help but feel like am wasting my time. Even if the market rebounded, who would hire an Engineer in training with 0 Engineering experience (aside from 2 years of internship during studies).

So my question to you guys, from your experience, what should a person in my position do? Should I forget about Petroleum Engineering and find a different path in my life? Is there anything I can do with that degree that put me 60k in debt ? Is there a certificate or licence that would be good in conjunction with my Petroleum Engineering degree? 

at this point, this issue is causing me a paralysing anxiety. So any and all help is appreciated, guys.

Ranking of course matters, but schools that are known for substantial scholarships are the ones I'm interested in.

* Non-URM (Middle Eastern 1st Gen / writing diversity statement)
* LSAC GPA: 2.75 (upwards trend in GPA / will be writing addendum) 
* LSAT: 164 (although registered to retake for Sept, wish me luck)
* Strong Softs: experience working at law firms, former Greenpeace intern, former UN intern, and currently working at a major global non-profit.



Schools I'm planning to apply to (in no particular order):

My question is should I apply it to a loan with higher interest rate, but smaller balance or to a loan with a higher balance, but slightly smaller interest rate. I am still in school, so the interest is not capitalizing. I know the general theory is to pay off higher interest rate first, but the lower rate loan grows faster per day now, since I have started to pay off my loans with internship money. 

Here are the exact details:

1) Principle: $32,500, Accrued Interest: $5,000 Interest Rate: 8.375%

51t7qn,14,2016-09-08,"I want to have a frank discussion about Harambe's 2016 banger, Gorillaz.",huntermc1998,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/51t7qn/i_want_to_have_a_frank_discussion_about_harambes/,"I want to have a frank discussion about Harambe's 2016 banger, Gorillaz. The song focuses on dicks out, the eponymous ""Gorillaz,"" as a display of wealth, power, and mid-2016 fashion. A ""gorilla"" describing a diamond- and gold-encrusted dick.


In the song, rapper Cecil the Lion, a member of Harambe's zoo, raps ""I've got a dick in my mouth like I'm Rick Harrison."" This particular line has kept me up nights for the past decade.


The initial conceit is obvious enough: a ""dick"" is a reference to dicks out, and Cecil wants the listener to know that the dick in his mouth costs a lot of money. Since the largest dick in circulation is $100, it's unclear to me whether Cecil's dick only cost $100 or if he wants his audience to take a further leap and assume that ""a dick"" references several dicks. I can't imagine $100 buys very many mouth dicks.


The second half of the line proves particularly troubling. He invokes ""Rick Harrison,"" who, as of 2005, was a pawn star from Nevada, U.S. for Las Vegas. It's possible that our civic-minded emcee wanted to invoke the imagery of Mr. Harrison on the floor of the Nevada pawn shop, arguing for dicks left and right. While he sponsored a couple hundred dicks during his tenure, only one Rick-sponsored dick was signed into law as of Gorillaz' release (according to pawntrack.us). So, while it matches the ""a dick"" language, the line doesn't particularly invoke the large number of ""dicks"" required to purchase a premium dickpiece.


A wrinkle in this line is that Rick's old man is Richard “Old Man” Harrison. Thus, the line ""dick in [his] mouth like [he's] Rick Harrison"" could easily be interpreted to relate to oral sex. This comparison is especially apt when you consider that Old Man is infamous for having his dick out with a Pawn Shop intern during his tenure as Pawn Star. And perhaps this incident is even more infamous because the dick out came not from Rick, but from a third party. In fact -- even 10 years after the incident -- any references to Old Man, a dick, and pawn inevitably lead listeners to his pawn star scandal.


So, is Cecil letting the zoo community know that he enjoys dicks out? Or does his metaphor fall apart because, at least in this context, Rick had no ""Old Man’s"" in his pawn shop? Given the rampant homophobia of the mid-2016 zoo community, I'm inclined to believe that Cecil didn't mean to invoke any reference that might include him giving dicks out to a man. But then, why even go near the Old Man/Rick situation?


I've considered a third option regarding this half of the line, that Cecil's invocation of Rick Harrison and ""dicks"" is a reference to his much-maligned Pawn Star speeches. Rick has received criticism for making private speeches to Pawn Stars in exchange for large speaking fees. The imagery of dicks for speeches lends itself well to having ""dicks in [your] mouth like . . . Rick Harrison."" When Rick talks (you know, with his mouth), the dicks flow freely. In fact, I'd argue that this interpretation provides the strongest metaphor for sporting an expensive dick.


But it's impossible for Cecil to know this, as Rick's speaking tour didn't really start in earnest until he left the pawn shop, roughly 8 years after Gorillaz dropped.


So, I'm left to draw one of three conclusions:


1) Cecil's use of metaphor on the 2016 track Gorillaz was poor, at best, and he had no business rapping alongside Harambe, Paul Blart, and John Cena.


2) Cecil is a time-traveller, and uses his gift for low-key pawn shop commentary that's way ahead of its time.


3) I have entirely too much time on my dick.

God even typing this feels like too much work. I'll try to not run on too much as to what is getting me down (its a LOT of things) because I'll feel like not too many people would read it and I would end up looking like I'm a whiny sap. Basically put, I'm 31 still living with my parents. For whatever reason, I feel like I just can't make ends meet on my own. Part of that has been my fault due to me being an idiot. (I got my 3rd DUI last year.) Yes I am extremely stupid for doing that. Luckily, I've never been in a car accident so that is a good thing that I didn't harm myself or someone else. I have been trying to pay off the court fees for a while now. I don't have my own car at the moment, but getting one and paying insurance, plus the breathalyzer system (including installation) seems like quite a lot. Especially considering I'm only working retail making  $11.04 an hour. (about 25 hrs/wk) I don't want to live at home because obviously no girl wants to be around someone like me. I am almost done with getting my Bachelors in Communications which is nice but the student loans will be starting soon and that is going to take up A LOT of my income. I need to finish my internship in order to graduate so that should be done in Oct. 

I'm sure some of you are saying ""WiscoMitch just work at your job full time!"" Well there's a problem with that, actually make it two.

The first is that one of my ex's works there. Her name is Heather. We dated for about 9 months. I fell in love with her. It was the first time I ever felt real love. She was the first woman to say the words ""I love you."" back to me. ... That changed my life. But we broke up. Partially because I wasn't financially ready for a house and a family. I want kids. I feel like I would make a great father regardless of my previous OBVIOUS poor decisions. We still see each other in passing.

My other problem working there is my OTHER EX. (Yes I'm fucking stupid I know.) Molly and I started dating probably a year after Heather and I broke up. We dated for 7 months. She was by my side through EVERYTHING. All my baggage, me going to jail, being on house arrest, not making a lot of money, she didn't care. She loved me. I felt like I loved her a bit, but it just wasn't as strong as how I felt about Heather. I eventually broke up with her because I felt like it just wasn't right. It didn't feel genuine enough in my heart. Of course I still miss her but I broke up with her because of this nagging feeling in my gut. She really is a sweet woman, but I couldn't go through with marrying her with that over my head.

Fast forward to now. I just feel like I'm always going to be stuck behind the 8 ball. I have only a few friends. Most people rarely ever call me to hang out, even if I can get a ride to places. Most of my days are spent either in my room, or going to the gym and working out. I've made good strides but I still feel ---blah. I don't feel any great happiness anymore. I don't have a surge of feeling that ""life is good"" or ""things will get better"". I just feel nothingness, or on occasion sadness. I worry that I'll never get out of this rut of making shit pay and I feel like I'll never be good enough for someone else again, all my baggage included. I worry that Molly might've been my last chance at actually finding someone to marry and have a family with; that is the ONE thing I want more than anything else. Since I was a teenager I've always wanted that. If that is the case, then I don't know, I don't know what is the point. Maybe I'm doomed? I try to count my blessings and see the good things that are happening, but with few friends and not really enjoying the company of my parents, I feel like when I speak my words are falling on deaf ears. I am rambling now and I do probably sound pathetic or something. Although I do feel a ""little"" bit better after letting this out.

I don't know. Things suck for me. Even in more ways than I've just posted.

P.S. Thank you for reading through all this if you did. You managed to get through this crazy rant. 

**TL;DR** I work with my two ex's, one I still have deep feelings for who has been dating someone else now for 6 months or so, and the other woman who I didn't feel like I loved the right way. I STILL live with my parents. I have little to no money, no car, no license, student loans coming up soon and I'm 2-3 months away from graduating with no REAL good paying job on the horizon. 

I don't know how other people do it."

51ttmn,1,2016-09-08,19 F4M - The Long Road from Innocence to...,getafe,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51ttmn/19_f4m_the_long_road_from_innocence_to/,"(The character is 19, not me!)

Honestly, I wasn't expecting this many choices. I thought they'd have a few different sizes and a couple that vibrated, but instead I found myself standing in front of a giant wall of dildos, vibrators, magic eggs, rabbits, double-ended strap-ons, rotating rods, suction cupped bases, there are even a couple that squirt, which is kind of gross and kind of...intriguing.

I finally choose one. It's purple, which is cute, and pretty big, but not crazy. (And some of them were crazy, like, bigger around than my arm.) It's smooth, but with some raised veins, and it vibrates. It doesn't squirt.

I walk past the lingerie and party toys, thankful that I don't have to walk through the magazine and video sections to get to the register. I do take a quick glance over there and see a man disappearing into some saloon-style swinging doors. Maybe they have dressing rooms or something back there?

I tell myself there's nothing to be embarrassed about as I make my way up to the counter. I tell myself that the clerk sees dozens of people every day buy things that are not talked about in polite society. I try to make my cheeks un-blush, but I can tell by how lightheaded I feel that it's not working at all.

In case you couldn't tell, I've never done this before.

""Find everything you need?"" I nod and get out my credit card, hoping to transact my business quickly and be on my way. The guy behind the counter is sitting on a stool and the floor back there seems to be several inches higher than on this side, adding to the feeling that I'm a little girl hoping this man approves of me. At least he's younger than my dad.

He starts opening the box.

""Wait, what are you--"" I freeze. What's going on?

""We just have to make sure it works, make sure the right product is in here."" He pulls it out of the box and it bobs its head at me. ""Returns, you know, they're a bitch. Nobody wants to buy a used one of these guys. Well, most people, anyway.""

He pulls some batteries out of a drawer and inserts them into the base. When he flicks the switch it starts buzzing and he immediately drops it onto the counter like it's a fish.

""Whoa! Feisty little guy, isn't he?"" He picks it up and turns it back off. ""Looks like it works just fine. Look okay to you?"" He looks at me, waiting for a response. I nod, still blushing. ""Okay then. Address?""

""Address? You mean, where I live?"" I sputter.

""Just a mailing address. In case there are any recalls or anything. It happens, you know. Not very often, but this here is one household electronic device you do not want catching fire on you, that's for sure.""

I give him my address. Then, when he asks, my phone number. Yes, it's a cell phone, not a landline. ID? Apparently to make sure I'm not under 18. As if I would have risked being seen in one of these places in my hometown, before I left for college. The clerk even signed me up for their membership club so I could get a 20 percent discount on everything, with a membership card and everything.

Eventually, I have my vibrator in a box, in a bag, along with a bottle of lube the clerk gave me, and I'm ducking out of the door into the midday sunshine, hoping no one from any of my classes sees me before I'm in my car and out of the parking lot. I don't even speed on the way home. I just let the anticipation build in the bottom of my stomach...

________________________________________

Well that was longer than I intended! But I've been waiting to use this prompt for kind of a while and I've built it up in my head quite a bit. There are several directions it could go, but all of them end up with our heroine being a lot less innocent than she is now.

For instance, she could get a letter or phone call saying that model is being recalled so she gets store credit for the value of it, then she's told about the dressing rooms (or product testing rooms) that aren't quite as private as she might expect, what with the men watching from the other side of the one-way mirrors that make up three of the walls and the cameras recording the whole performance. This could lead eventually to stripping, gloryholes, gangbangs, sugar daddies, prostitution...

Or perhaps she starts getting calls or texts from gentlemen interested in meeting her after seeing her ad. Of course, she's surprised, even shocked, but the places they're proposing to take her are really swanky, the kinds of places she's never been. This could lead to a being taken advantage of, sugar daddies, private shows, sex parties, prostitution, meeting someone unexpected...

Or maybe the lube sample the clerk gave her has aphrodisiac properties. She becomes more outgoing, even forward, with the men around her. Maybe she gets a job where she can show off more, as a server at a restaurant famous for their wings and tight orange shorts, or maybe she just starts showing off more at the job she already has (bartender, barista, office intern, university medical office,...).

If all else fails, maybe she just gets caught using the vibrator by her roommate's boyfriend or the RA or something, but I think we can do better than that.

I'm **most** interested to hear your ideas, as long as it leads somewhere interesting.

Feel free to tell me what you want me to look like! I really like pretending to be all sorts of girls. If you'd rather I pick, I can do that too.

I have a [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/kMI1pUX.png)! It's new. I hope it worked right.

Please include a description of your character and where you see this story going! Make a one-word subject line that completes my post title.

Looking forward to your creative replies!

51u34w,4,2016-09-08,My [22F] boyfriend [22M] is struggling to figure out his future and I don't know how to support him.,throwaway2398979,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51u34w/my_22f_boyfriend_22m_is_struggling_to_figure_out/,"I'm sorry if this is disorganized and ends up being a rant. I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for, but I've reached the point where I can't handle this on my own anymore and need some advice. 

We got together in college and have been together for over three years. We both recently graduated and I have started graduate school while he works on applying to graduate school/figuring out what he wants. 

I spent a lot of my undergrad time doing various volunteer work and internships to figure out what field I wanted to go into. A lot of this is due to the pressure and guidance from my parents to plan my career path. We both come from Indian families so we have a lot of pressure to plan our lives and to be ""successful."" Often times this means becoming a doctor or some other highly regarded professional. 

When I met my boyfriend he was interested in becoming a doctor, but mostly due to pressure from his parents. He took the classes and exams, but struggled, and realized he needed to find something else. He ended up graduating with a degree in psychology and at the time of graduation had vague ideas about going to graduate school for psychology. Throughout the last year of college he expressed uncertainty about this decision on several occasions. He wasn't sure if he was actually interested in it, he had other interests, it wasn't a high paying career. He wants to please his parents and make them proud about his career choices and is overly concerned about making money. I understand (and agree) money is an important part about choosing a career, but it cannot be the only factor. 

In general he seems very lost and confused about his future. I know that's normal when you're 22 and a recent graduate. You don't need to know exactly what you want to be doing 10 years down the road, but I'm worried about him. Over the last year and since graduation I've seen little progress in him about figuring out these fundamental issues. He's half-heartedly gone through the steps to begin applying to graduate programs, but there doesn't seem to be any passion in it. When we talk about why he's interested in certain degrees over others, it's always vague references to what will look better. I don't think he really has any idea what he wants out of life and it's beginning to really bring him down. He's having more frequent confrontations with his parents about it, which lead him to be less proactive about figuring it out.  

I try to be supportive and tell him it's okay not to know 100% what you want. You can always change your career later in life. I try to encourage him to find what he's passionate about and to research different fields/degrees. I keep telling him to do what he thinks will make him happy. He looks at his friends and compares himself to them. ""So and so is in medical school and I'm still living at home. I'm not moving forward."" We have this conversation almost once a month and I tell him not to compare his choices to others and that it's okay to take a year or two off from school. He listens and acknowledges this, but the problem is, after this conversation he does nothing to change the situation. We end up having the same conversation about the same uncertainties a few weeks later. EDIT: I should add that he has a lot of pressure from his parents to go to graduate school within the next year and it doesn't look like he's going to try to contradict his parents on this. If he could spend the next year or two trying different things out, none of this would be an issue.

I'm worried about him because he's always upset about these things and it seems like he's stuck. I'm also frustrated because he doesn't seem to be taking any active steps to do anything about it. I spend so much time worrying and thinking about his future. I know I need to let him figure it out on his own because I can't tell him what degree to get or what job to apply for. However, I feel so drained constantly having to support him about things that haven't changed in over a year. He comes to me upset, I give him advice, he says ""yeah, you're right,"" and repeat. 

What can I do to help him? I'm starting to realize giving him advice about doing research on jobs and trying to find passions isn't working. Is there something else I can do to support him? Or do I just need to let this play out and let him come to me and just be upset? (I tend to be controlling and want to find solutions and answers.) Maybe I should just be more passive and let him be upset and hope figures it out?

I don't know. All I know is that this situation is very stressful for me and every time he talks to me about his future I become drained and overwhelmed. 

TL;DR My boyfriend is really struggling trying to figure out what to do career-wise post graduation and I'm at a loss of how to continually support and encourage him."

51udu3,125,2016-09-08,Blow by Blow Justice IV,schoolgirlerror,Schoolgirlerror,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schoolgirlerror/comments/51udu3/blow_by_blow_justice_iv/,"Judge Fisher looked like he’d spent his youth on fast women and slow horses. I hated myself for the cliché, but the bags under his eyes, broken capillaries in his nose, and shaking hands as he collected his documents spoke for themselves. 



“I’ll be back in a moment, Mr Red,” he said, standing. I’d bet my month’s mortgage repayments he had a bottle of the good stuff in his chambers. 



“No problem, your Honour,” I replied easily, guiding Mary into her seat at the table. 



The courtroom was imposing if you’d never seen one before: a dark wood panel with three chairs behind it, the banks for counsel, miniature witness stand, and a place where press could sit, if press were interested in second-rate attorneys beating the shit out of each other to take a woman’s kids away from her. 



I knew better. 



This place had seen more fights than an alcoholic had seen bottles of white spirit. In the belly of the room, where the spectator’s stands would be in a regular courtroom, a make-shift boxing ring replaced the floor. Quince hadn’t lied. A yellow warning sign stood akimbo over rusting droplets of blood. The usher had disappeared to find a mop. 



Gabriella dropped her binder onto the desk on the other side of Mary. I’d made Gabriella come in her suit, while I carried a sports bag containing my kit, and an emergency first aid box. We flanked Mary like two crows in dark suits. 



“Listen, Mary,” I sat down beside her, extended my legs beneath the desk and felt the muscles protest at the movement. “Do you know if Lyle’s hired an attorney at all?” 



She shook her head, twisting her fingers. I noticed she’d removed the wedding ring and was faintly proud of her. It was hard to take the first step away from an abusive man, harder still to keep walking. 




“He’s a proud man, Mr Red,” she said. She’d started taking care of herself, too. The blonde roots at her scalp had been touched up with dark dye, and she wore blush high on the apples of her cheeks. “He’ll be fighting for his kids himself.” 



I snorted. 



“Men like him make my work easier,” I said. “It’s the pride.” 



“He’s a big man, Mr Red,” Mary said. “He hits hard, and he fights dirty.” 



“Mary, any man who hits a woman is on the wrong side of the law,” I said. “So—”



Gabriella coughed. 



“You got a problem?” 



“We’re condoning violence as long as it’s not sexist, now?” 



“You’re the one benefiting from it, so I suggest you quit whining,” I said. “I’m not endorsing men hitting men, but you roll up Mary’s sleeve, kid, and you tell me you’re okay with what you see.” 



Gabriella opened her mouth indignantly as if to say something, but I was saved from having to think of a comeback by Lyle throwing open the doors of the courtroom. We all turned round, Mary white-knuckle gripping the back of her seat. He stood, framed by the heavy doorway, legs shoulder-width apart and his hands on his hips. The usher slipped past him like a mouse, mop in hand.



Lyle was muscle run to visceral fat. His nose and upper lip met in the centre of his face, making him carry a permanent sneer. A gold watch glinted off his wrist, and the split, purple knuckles told me he’d won more than one bar fight in his time.

 

A bar fight this wasn’t.



Lyle took his place at the respondent’s desk. Judge Fisher re-entered the courtroom and took his chair with all the dignity of a drunk pissing against a wall. He scanned the room, satisfied that we were all present. 



“Mr Red,” he said, pressing his fingertips together. Was it my imagination, or were his eyes more glazed than before? Imperceptibly, he leaned forwards. “I believe you’ve submitted a preliminary demand for custody?”



I stood, tugging my suit into place. “Your Honour, we move for a finding that custody ought to belong solely to my client, Mrs Blount. My findings of domestic abuse are included in the bundle we’ve submitted.” 



Judge Fisher looked at the pressed bundle on his desk as though it would bite him. 




“And the respondent has moved for a combative defence?” 



Lyle bounded to his feet and dropped into a mock bow. He hadn’t worn a suit, just the polo shirt that his job demanded. A pink pig smiled inanely at us from above his left nipple. 



“Yes, your Honour,” he said. “I’m just a normal, hard working father who loves his kids. I can’t pay for some fancy fighting lawyer when I got food to put on the table. I’m just ready to do what I’ve gotta to do keep my kids, an’ I’m gonna fight for them, your Honour, sir.”




The judge rolled his eyes, and I was surprised that it was the only sign of him losing his cool with Lyle. 



“Then I move to allow civil ruling by combat,” he said. “Will Mrs Blount be represented in this action by her attorney?” 



“She will, your Honour,” I replied. 



“Liability waivers signed?” 



“Yes, your Honour,” 



They got signed before, not afterwards, when your hands were swelling and your knuckles split. Lyle shot me a look, maybe noticing for the first time the muscles beneath the cheap suit; the hands with their callouses, my broken nose and bitten ear. 



If he wanted his kids, he should have hired someone who knew how to fight in a courtroom the way I did. 



-------



The changing room was a poky locker room filled with spider's webs. I stripped off, and changed quickly, wrapping my hands in tape and cloth while sitting on the greasy wooden bench. A breeze rattled through me, bare tiles moist beneath my feet. 




Hammer had a routine when it came to trials by combat. He had a walkman, and he plugged it into his ears while he changed. He wrapped his hands, deep in concentration. The day of my first fight, he’d wrapped my hands for me and given me words of advice.




“Films are bullshit,” he growled, squatting on his heels as he wound the tape. “No one gets knocked out for hours. You knock ‘em out for longer than a minute and that liability form is thinner than a fuckin’ condom when it comes to protecting you from *his* lawyers.” 



He paused, grey eyes on my hands. 




“Go for the chin. It’s dirty, but you want them to yield or drop as fast as possible. Save your looks, Red, cause you’re lucky enough to have ‘em. There’ll be girls someday who’ll want you for more than your fists.” 



Him and Quince were equal shadows in my mind. Attorneys who’d hung on for too long. If we’d had money, Hammer would have retired. 



The sound of the door broke my train of thought. Gabriella slipped into the changing room. 



“Lyle’s ready,” she said. “Judge wants you back.” 



I nodded. Gabriella took a step forward, rocking on the balls of her feet. I read the indecision on her face. Taking the plunge, she came towards me, kneeling on the tiled floor between my feet. She took the end of the tape between her fingers, and wound it around my palm. Her hands on mine were cool and reassuring, but her brown eyes blinked worry. 



“I’ve never seen a trial by combat before,” she said. 



“Your internships—”



Gabriella shook her head. “If they can afford a civil trial, they pay for a civil trial. You know how cheap this is, Mr Red—” 



“William,” I told her. “My name’s William.” 



She had one of my hands in two of hers, tucking the frayed end of the tape beneath the rest of it. 



“It’s only for the desperate,” she finished as if I hadn’t spoken, but her eyes rested on mine. 



“Mary is desperate,” I said. 



“Is she the only one?” Gabriella asked. 



I shook her hands away and grimaced. The sunflower seeds had stayed at the office, but the memory of Hammer, with his blanket-thick cigarette stink, had got me itching again. 



“You want to see a fight?” I asked. “Because there’s going to be a fight, and I’d like my intern to keep her mouth shut and clean the blood of my face when I finish.” 



------


The usher hurried away from the ring as I strode in, ready. Arms swinging, loose, aches of the last few days disappeared. Lyle stood on the other side of the floor, hands protected by court-sanctioned wraps. When he moved, I saw the outline of his belly against the red shirt he wore. The pink pig winked at me. I didn’t expect it to be difficult. 



Judge Fisher tapped his gavel on the bench and sighed. 




“Please keep all actions within the remits of the liability waiver,” he said. “Extreme attempts to injure may incur additional fees, and both criminal responsibility and civil liability. Fights are unarmed combat between two participants. Being knocked unconscious results in an automatic dismissal of your case. Yielding results in an automatic dismissal of your case. Forfeiting the fight results in an automatic dismissal of your case. Fights where neither opponent lands a hit result in a mistrial. You may begin.” 



Lyle, having zoned out, shook himself awake as another gavel tap punctuated his sentence. He had no time to take neutral, I took two steps forward and pivoted hard on my right foot to press a punch into his chin. 



He blocked, but barely. Sloppily. His hands came up and we ricocheted apart. My knuckles rang from the impact. Lyle’s face was frozen in a mask of horror. I came forward again. He retreated against the ropes, hurried steps like a sheep. I followed through with two jabs: right, left. One connected with his shoulder, the other his wrist. He cried out and I relished it. I packed power behind my punches; round shoulders pushing into him, body twisting. 




Mary and Gabriella watched from the sideline. Mary had twisted her cardigan into a knot, and Gabriella watched me advance on Lyle Blount with a stony face. 



Against the ropes now, hands barely protecting his face. What was passion against a professional? His nose crunched beneath my fist and I felt a spurt of guilt for the usher. Second time in one day. Lyle scooted around me. He lashed out with a flurry of wild punches, feet scrambling. Several connected, but there was nothing behind them. I caught them on my forearms, waited for the shock to subside, then circled him. 




I was a wolf. An attorney who had scented blood and was in for the kill. Cutting in close, I waited for him to come at me. He two-stepped, I heard Gabriella gasp, and then he was on me. 



Something silver flashed before I felt the blade. Gabriella was already jumping the ropes, screaming at the judge to *do something.* It was like a paper cut, I felt almost nothing, but the blood was hot against my cold torso. Someone’s hands were on me. A woman was crying, Judge Fisher’s gavel came smacking down. Lyle backed away, a stubby knife no longer than a thumb in his wrapped hand. I clamped a hand to the wound and fought to keep my breathing steady. 



“In my courtroom!” The old man was going to have a heart attack. “In all my years—Mr Blount *in my courtroom*!” 



When she reached me, Gabriella's brown eyes were filled with worry.

The latest one being ""can't you and your husband just get normal jobs and stop this nonsense of having a dream and wanting to be someone powerful in your industry?"" All I could respond to that was you don't say shit like that to your own kid mother, that's called discouragement. Anyways..that's another story. 

Last night my mom txted me and asked me to wish my Aunt a happy birthday. I said that I would not and ignored her the rest of the night. She had my sister txt me asking me if I was dead. No, I'm not dead, I just don't want to wish the person who's never said happy birthday to me a happy birthday, not even out of some fucked up family courtesy because well..why the hell should I care about her birthday when she has NEVER cared about mine? 

For context purposes, my sister and I get along great. We leave each other alone when we need to, we have each others backs when we need to, we talk almost daily and it's very odd for us to go a day without talking. We've also made it clear to our parents and the rest of the family that us two get along, but that's about as much as that relationship is going to extend it's welcome to. That neither of us really plan on adding more people into this little twosome circle. 

My sister called fuming yesterday (we usually google chat, txt and snapchat all day) to say that my aunt (the same one who wanted a happy birthday txt) exploded at her out of no where and it went as far as my uncle basically verbally assaulting her at work because as it turns out, my baby cousin decided that he wanted more in his life, quit working as a cashier for them at their store and got an internship with my sister's company. So my sister had what I can only say is an ungodly amount of missed calls, txts and voicemails from my family all telling her what a bitch she was and how her boss needs to keep things to himself and not encourage such frivolous ideas into my cousin's head. (apparently my sister's boss said that he wanted to mentor someone and that he felt my cousin working at a tea shop and dry cleaner as a cashier was dead end and if he was willing to want more, my sister's boss would be willing to extend a teaching hand...nothing wrong with that...). Well, apparently this is all just completely unacceptable to everyone and I, who was once the ugly duckling in the corner have suddenly become their bi-polar favorite again. Because they want me to step in and do something about this. I just said that it wasn't my problem, I wasn't going to and if my cousin wanted help writing a resume to call me. This only happened because my sister sent back a two word txt message to everyone - ""fuck off."" (quickly followed by, ""this is not your business."") 

I get that it's been a hard year for them (parents, aunts and uncles) with 3 kids moving out, 2 getting a ""big kid"" job and 1 deciding that she wants to apply for school far far away. But that's what happens when you're shitty to your kids. They don't want to live with you and don't want to have anything to do with you. And instead of wishing my aunt a happy birthday, all i wanted to say was ""you're finally getting what you deserve. all your brats ditching you because they don't want to have anything to do with you. this is what is suppose to happen, your kids are suppose to grow up, they are suppose to pay their own bills and find their own adult jobs. they fall in love. they get married. they find ambition and ideas. it's abnormal to want none of these things, hang around at home and do your every bidding. that's called stockholm syndrome and it's unhealthy."" I usually don't say much to them because I don't have much to say, but if I did, I wish I could point out every time they said something hurtful, every time they got into fights in the house with everybody and started throwing stuff to express their anger. I wish I could tell them how psychotic they are. 

Am I wrong in wanting to do this? My mom suggested that maybe we all start family chat rooms and talk about things so that the kids don't feel any sort of animosity towards their parents and can say whatever they need. I said no because that'll just end up becoming another avenue for the ""adults"" to spout their crazy bullshit in another communication format. I'm 30. I can't put up with this much longer while creating my own family with my husband. Sorry but not sorry, I just can't do it anymore. I support whatever my sister and my cousins want to do with their life as long as they get out of there. I support them if they're black, white, or red. I support them if they want to be a stripper or if they want to be a banker as long as they're proud of what they do and I support them for wanting more in life. Not for wanting less. I would never encourage someone to ""stay with their parents, live at home, help out, it's your job and it's an obligation."" It's not an obligation when you've been verbally and physically abused your entire life. "
51v8ns,1,2016-09-08,Student wanting own BOA Travel Card – Currently auth user on parent's Citi Double Card,needhelpccthrowaaw,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51v8ns/student_wanting_own_boa_travel_card_currently/,"Hey /r/personalfinance ,

Just got some questions real quick about something I've been wondering about for quite some time.

I am a 20 year old college student living in NYC and am currently an authorized user under a parent's Citi Double Cash card. I pay my own balance on my own, the parent doesn't use the card whatsoever, and have been doing so for the past year and a half. I began with a 3.4k limit which was upped to 5.5k after a year of having the card, and just again upped to 7.5k. I currently have a balance of around 2.9k on it which I am slowly working down which accrued from some personal expenses that I couldn't change, but it does kind of suck as now there's a ridiculously high APR on it that I am responsible for. I never pay minimum, always as much as I can, and it will be gone in the next several months. I'm an auth user on this card.

I currently bank with BOA, and I want to get my own standalone credit card, away from my parents. I like to set money aside to travel with my girlfriend, money permitting, and want to apply for the Bank of America Travel credit card. However, I just tried to check my credit score via annual credit report, and it came up with an error and truth be told, I'm a bit worried to play with that stuff. 

I am sitting on the BOA application page, wondering what I should do. I am a college student, in my junior year of uni, but I heard that college students are frequently not approved for these travel cards, unless it's from Discover or something like that. I currently work at an internship, and get paid on W2, so should I put down Employed as opposed to Student? In regards to income, should I inflate it slightly and put say 15,000$ (not exactly 100% truthful) but I do make a decent amount through work and frequently find other ways to lowkey make money, be it selling things online that I don't need anymore, etc.

Please lemme know guys, I've been wondering about this for quite some time and really do want my own card to build credit, as I'm sure being an auth user doesn't do the same. Thanks!

**Edit**: Well, thanks all, applied and got approved, kinda cool so I guess this is my first CC that I'll be responsible for entirely on my own!"
51vjan,1,2016-09-09,College student with almost 100% credit utilization. How much will this affect me?,college_ccdebt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51vjan/college_student_with_almost_100_credit/,"Sometime after my 18th birthday (a year ago or so), I went ahead and got approved for a credit card from BofA with a $2,000 credit limit (no cosign). Thought I could handle paying it off fully each month, but suddenly things like parking permits, textbooks, food, and especially poor spending habits kicked in and soon I hit near the credit limit. I've had a static mid 600 FICO rating (according to BofA website) for 4 months now. I've realized how serious this is, and been trying to cut down on a lot of spending trying to get it back to $0. I have three months left on the introductory 0% interest offer, so I do plan on paying it off fully by then. Will this adversely affect my credit score long term (I would assume I could recover it as long as I don't screw up again), and how much do prospective internship employers (software development related) care about credit score, if at all? Would this also affect my chances/interest rates at any private student loans if I apply for them in the future (I'm currently on federal loans, and my parents are fine with cosigning those and have a credit score in the 800s)?"
51vtql,1,2016-09-09,"Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [23 F] of 13 months, cannot stop arguing",throwingthisfar_away,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51vtql/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_13_months/,"So our relationship started off with drama.  I first met my girlfriend when she was dating my friend's brother.  At the time I paid no attention her and really wasn't all that interested.  I respected their relationship and at no time did I tried to interject myself into it.  Fast forward a year and a half later they broke up, she tried dating someone else, and she was single again.  I took a chance and asked her on a date.  We went on a few more dates, flirted a lot through text, and hit it off great.

I finally gathered enough courage to ask her if she would like to become more exclusive.  I think my exact verbiage was ""I have a lot of fun with you and I would like to see where things can go.""  She agreed, we kissed, and now we are together since, I think.

This all started last August.  It was my the first summer post-college graduation, but last summer in my hometown as I was moving out of state back to my college town for a full time job.  I made her very aware of the situation and she was ok with it.  We spent as much time with each other as possible until my move.

When I moved we kept in constant contact.  We would talk for hours on end through text, call, or FaceTime.  It was great.  The communication was there and we were making it work.  She traveled twice to visit and we continued to have a great time.  One day while talking she surprised me by saying that she applied for a job where I am.  I was ecstatic.

She came down and we apartment searched for her.  She was moving to me.  What could be better?!  Things were going great.  She found a place and has been working and living near me since November.

Thats when the problems have started. Being that I went to college where I am I have an establish life.  I have friends and know the area.  When my girlfriend moved, she obviously had nobody but me; completely understandable.  I introduced her to most of my friends.  One meeting did not go so well.  That was when I introduced her to my a female friend, who we will call Jane, who has been in a steady relationship for a long time.  In my girlfriend's defense, this did not go so well.  Jane came across rather abrasive and rude, which I nor my girlfriend did not appreciate.  I never confronted my friend, but I did reassure my girlfriend that what Jane did was wrong and I understand if she does not like Jane.  My friendship with Jane has since gone to the wayside, nonetheless she is still a friend.  Nothing ever happened with Jane and I, nor will anything happen.  This all happened early November.

Fast forward to Thanksgiving 2016, my girlfriend joins me and my family at my aunt's house.  While sitting with my girlfriend I said that I was going to send Jane a ""Happy Thanksgiving"" text.  That is all.  Well that erupted into a problem.  It became, ""why do you have to think of Jane while I am with you and your family?""  Wishing people a greeting on a holiday is something I have always done for all my friends, but has now become a problem.  So I admit fault and try to move on.  (Jane will come up again as a problem...)

It should be noted that early on in the relationship we both disclosed information about ourselves (previous relationships, number of people we slept with, things of that nature).  We know everything there is to know about each other.

It should also be noted that I see her almost everyday despite living separately.  I get out of work before and usually pick her up (sometimes waiting close to an hour due to the nature of her job and not being able to tell me) because she walks.  I always go to her place and she rarely comes to mine except when its hot as her house has a poor a/c system.  When I am not in class I am with her.  When I am not at work and she is not working I am with her.  Any and all free time I may have is spent with her.

Since then things stay the same or rather start to get worse; we have our arguments and try to move on.  Although the arguments seem to be getting worse and worse.  They are becoming more intense and more personal.  One thing that my girlfriend told me from the being that has always stuck in my mind is that she ""does not fight fair.""  She said that she will reverse it and make the other seem at fault.  To be honest, she is very good at that.  I can count on one hand how many times she has apologized after a fight or argument.

As of recent our fights, as she puts it, is because I am a lier and cannot be trusted or because I do not listen.  Let me go into detail....

First it is and seems to be a common occurrence of me not listening.  I am the type of person that has to get involved and try to help others, even when its not wanted.  This gets applied to my girlfriend.  When she would come to me with an issue or problem that she was having with me or with something I did she would explain.  I would then try to justify to her why I did xy&amp;z and that would make her more upset.  Now I do realize that it is her feelings and she should feel the way she wants, but when I offer a logical explanation in attempt to make it better , I would hope it would do just that.  Chase in point:

In July it was Janes birthday.  Taking into consideration how the girlfriend does not care for Jane I decided to text Jane a ""Happy Birthday"" when the girlfriend left the room.  I did not tell my girlfriend because we were finally having a good day of fighting and I did not want to bring Jane up and cause any problems.  Ten days later I told my girlfriend what I did.  Now I'll preface this by saying technically I did lie and here how.  The day before Janes birthday my girlfriend and I were having a conversation about how one day I would like to pay for a vacation for my parents as a thank you for all the hard work they have done for me.  That didn't go so well.  She said that she hopes I take us on a vacation before I did something like that for them.  I replied by saying I would like to do that but also pay for one for them.  More conversation ensued about it and I eventually said that I would not tell her if I did so.  I quickly retracted that statement realizing it was a mistake and said told my girlfriend that I am open with her and she knows everything about me as I have nothing to hide.  This is where the lie comes in about Jane.

From that time to now I have been labeled as a lier and has accused me of cheating in every which way without actually saying ""you are cheating on me"".  I can no longer go to an internship which I have help for five years without being accused of cheating.  I can't have lunch with female co-workers without being accused of cheating.  I have been loyal, and yes I make mistakes.  One thing I would never do is cheat.  I said to my girlfriend from day one that ""before you cheat on me, break up with me"".   

As the fights are progressively getting worse my girlfriend attempted to break up with me.  In a last ditch effort to save the relationship I told her that I would seek professional guidance from a psychologist and talk about how I can improve as a person.

So I did.  I began one hour long sessions with a psychologist since the beginning of August.  Well I have been doing my best to heed the suggestions of my new doctor.  A doctor I had to pick mainly on appearance so that my girlfriend would not accuse me of cheating.  I chose an old female doctor who must be in her mid 60s.

Prior to me enlisting the ear of a professional, I relied heavily on my mother to listen to me vent.  I am a self proclaimed ""momma's boy"" to an extent.  When I travel home I have no complaints with her doing my laundry or making dinner for me.  But this venting to mom soon became a problem for the girlfriend.  She feared that my mom would never view her the same and that I was giving one sided stories.  Of course naturally there would be biases, but I did not best to give a fair story of what has happened, as I am trying now.  Once this erupted into an argument, I no longer would go to my mom, but now I was a neutral ear I can talk to.  And talking about an issue to someone is how I deal with things, it helps me even if I am wrong.

Now comes today, we both had the day off so my girlfriend and I *tried* to enjoy the day together.  She picked me up and we both did some grocery shopping and then move on.  As it was a nice day I suggested we get her car a car wash.  Prior to leaving her place I moved a box of cereal that she put down from one spot to another.  We proceeded outside were she put the recycling in a full can.  Commenting how it will call out and make a mess I moved the bag she put down into an empty can.  You remember were I said I like to help even when its unwanted, this is another time where it bites me in the butt.  She asked why I have to touch things that she puts down.  I respond with an apology and said that I will do my best to be more consciencious of doing such actions.  She was frustrated at this point.  Recognizing this I stood silently behind her car as she began to move things around so that it can be vacuumed at the car wash.  Seeing what appeared as being done in with the front passenger seat I quietly walked and sat in the seat.  Once sitting in the car, I asked what else was wrong and she asked if I was angry because I wasn't talking (which I had no reason to be, I was merely trying to avoid a fight by not saying anything that may make things worse).  She then seemed upset that I did not help her prep her car because ""usually"" I would help her (again I was just trying to stay out of the way).  Proceeding out of the parking lot I asked if she knew how to get to the car wash and she said no.  I, thinking aloud, said that she needed to take ABC Road.  Proceeding to the main road she comments ""You made me feel like an idiot"".  Asking why, she explained that she didn't know how to get to ABC Road and that when I said that she needed to go that way it made it her feel as she puts it ""like an idiot"".  Remembering that it was her feelings I apologized and said that I had no malicious intent in doing so.  I tried leaving it at that.  Comments went back and forth and I eventually suggested that she just take me back to my place.  She drove off and now I was home.  After about a half hour I get in my car and start pulling out of the driveway.  Thats when I receive a text message from her.  Seeing that she's trying to communicate I try calling her.  I get sent to voicemail.  This is typical for her to do when we argue.  I am one who refuses to fight via text as I am not as quick to type as she is.  So I keep getting sent to voicemail.  I make the decision to drive to her place and see her in person.

She lets me in and we talk, kinda.  Again I apologize for my actions earlier.  We spend some time at her place and I suggest she come out with me as I still had things to do on my day off.  I run some errands and we stop at a place for her.  Time is quickly catching up on us as I soon have an appointment with my doctor.  

In an effort to satisfy our growing hunger pains, my girlfriend asks me about what I talk to my doctor for a full hour.  I try explaining that it is a time for me to talk about the weeks events and what I think I did wrong.  I then get asked if I talk about Jane while I am there.  Of course I say yes because Jane has been the root of some of our problems.  That's where things start to get intense.  My girlfriend does not seem to be too happy with the fact that I talk(ed) about (1) Jane and (2) her (my girlfriend) behind her back.  I calmly explain that I am not at the doctor to fix my girlfriend that I am there to fix my problems with ultimately with help us.  That doesn't seem good enough.  My girlfriend continues to interrogate me and my frustration level is rising and so is the excitement in my voice.  I offered for her to join me at a session but she refused, as she has done in the past.

To my girlfriend my excited voice is yelling and my yelling is worse.  I do not yell at my girlfriend.  I have never abused her nor will I ever.  I do not have the time of day for anyone who is abusive.  My excited voice though will make her bottle up.  I know the difference between me yelling and not but she can't hear the difference.  Maybe there isn't one, but I beg to differ.

I finally walk out of the car to get the food.  By the time I return my girlfriend is not talking to me.  I ask her is she will and she shrugs her shoulders.  I get her to her house and thats where more arguing occurs.  It comes to the point where I snapped from pure fustration and I take the food we just got and throw it out the passenger door.  Unfortunately my girlfriend was in the path of this food.  I was convinced up to a couple of hours ago that it never hit her.  I was not aiming for her, again I am not abusive and have never done anything to harm her.  I hurts me to see her cry and thats the last thing I am trying to do.

Immediately my heart stopped and I realize what I did.  I ran out of the car and tried to comfort and apologized.  I felt and still do feel like the biggest a$$hole for what I did.  I left and headed straight for the doctor.  How convenient...

I go to the doctor and explain everything that has happened.  I tear up and begin to cry because talking about how I hurt her by throwing the food in her direction, not at her.  I regret what I did.  I hate how my frustration got the best of me.

My doctor explains my reaction was only normal and that I am human.  I still think its unacceptable.  She then tells me that she believes that my girlfriend also needs to seek help.  That this relationship needs to be more 50/50.  Now this conclusion was not made based on all these events, but has been made based on all the other previous sessions I have had.

As soon as I reach my car I try contacting my girlfriend.  Blocked.  Not just blocked from the texting or calling, blocked from Facebook, Instagram, you name it, I was banished.  I left voicemails, many, trying to get her to meet me somewhere neutral to talk.  Somewhere that she felt she had control to leave when she wanted, I did not want her to feel trapped.

I drive to her place and sit outside reaching for my last hope of sending an email and getting a response.  I do.  Essentially she replies with us being done.  She does not want to see me and wants me to let her go.

I leave and head back to my place.  Some more email exchanges occur and finally I get a text.  She wants me to acknowledge her last test and agree to let her go.  More specifically ""If you love me, you'll let me go"".  I tell via text I can't. I love her too much.  She proceeds to tell me that I am like one of her exes.  (He was sexually abusive, psychically abuse, and mentally abusive).  Mind you, every time we have sex (which happens *maybe* once or twice a month) I ask her point blank ""do you want to have sex"", trying to let her feel comfortable.  She then tells me that my doctor is making me worse and I am turning into a monster more and more everyday.  It continues with her telling me that everything that I have done for her has been done for her before by this same ex.  And that his throwing of things has led to her being abused.

I will never know what she has to deal with.  But I am damn sure I would never hurt her.  I love her too much to ever lay a hand on her and if I did I would bring myself in to the police as I have told her before.  The texting continues with me pleading with her to let me see her.  Her responses become more and more hurtful saying that she does not love me and that she doesn't think she can ever love me.  She continued by saying that she hates me.

At this point I am lost.  I have tried everything I can think of to be as transparent, supportive, and everything she wants me to be.  I have let friendships go, heard how she does not want to be friends with my family, and I have given her the option of having all my passwords for social media and emails.  She has access to my phone whenever she wants and so forth.  I have gone as far as asking her what exactly she wants me to do.

Despite our problems I still love this girl.  Not because I am afraid of being alone, but because she does make me happy and I am able to talk to her about a future together.  When the good times are going with us, they are great.  We seem to have reached an all time low in our relationship and I want it to work out.  I genuinely love her and will do anything for her, no matter what.

I am looking for all the help, comments, and/or suggestions you can offer.

51xaku,0,2016-09-09,My girlfriend [20 F] of 3 months just cried over me [23 M] cancelling a short holiday I booked earlier on,Void-freedom-775,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51xaku/my_girlfriend_20_f_of_3_months_just_cried_over_me/,"So both me and my girlfriend are in college and we're on break now. She went off to her hometown to visit her family earlier on while I went ahead and booked a short, 1 night vacation for us since it's been something she's been hinting at for a bit. Now, after telling her roughly what the plans are (I only just made a free booking, didn't spend a single cent), our grades come out and we find out that she's failed one of her classes.

Now, I made it very clear to her when we began our relationship that our grades could not slip. I'm no 4.0 GPA student but I do have a tuition waiver and allowance (based on both financial background and academic results) from the university I'm attending and I can't afford to lose it especially since I'm not as well off as she is. The very least I hoped from her was that she also passed her classes (I usually need As to keep my scholarship).

What I decided to do then was cancel that booking of ours due to this (I didn't think it would be a big deal since she was already vacationing a bit with her family in Europe) and in the process, caused her to cry. Now, the only thing she blamed me for was getting her hopes up and then crushing them which I will admit was not very considerate of me (really though, I just didn't expect her to fail especially since I helped her study, at least in the subjects that were related to my major). Obviously, I can't erase the fact that I made her cry and I've been feeling guilty about doing this to her. So much so that I'm reconsidering booking the place again.

What I would like to know is whether my behavior seems overly controlling. Like I don't care so much about grades but what I really dislike is people not putting in the effort to do their best especially when others (i.e. parents) are breaking their backs to send them to college. However, she obviously has different standards than I do and I wonder if it's exceptionally inconsiderate of me to expect her to follow mine. I just want her to be the best she can be (it doesn't have to be grades, I have friends who are too busy with internships and work to do more than the bare minimum for classes but I hold them in high regard since they're actually putting in the effort) but before she met me, she spent a good amount of time shopping and procrastinating especially when it came to schoolwork.

I just have a gut feeling that if we engage in such rewarding activities regardless of how we perform that she'll start subconsciously believing that she won't need to try all that hard and that crying is all it takes to get her way. Am I being too much like a dad to her instead of a partner? Should I keep our relationship and our achievements separate?

It just doesn't seem right to me to spend money when things are going poorly (she, on the other hand, wants to spend more the worse things are). 

edit1:
Ok ok I get it, my standards are mine not hers'. It's just that I'm not very well off either so I guess this was my excuse to try and save money. Bad idea on my part I get it. So should I still take her on the trip?

For those of you wondering why I'd pull something as crazy as this, I come from a very performance oriented Asian family. My parents never mentioned it out loud but me and my siblings are usually measured by our 'return on investment (monetary)', only reason I'm getting an engineering degree and she's in medicine. So it never really occurred to me that I should separate stuff like this. I've got a long way to go.

edit2:
She told me to add that I was actually planning to replace that trip with a dinner instead due to time and monetary constraints.

But thanks for showing me how much of a controlling asshole I can be.

51xauy,119,2016-09-09,Blow by Blow Justice V,schoolgirlerror,Schoolgirlerror,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schoolgirlerror/comments/51xauy/blow_by_blow_justice_v/,"The nurse in the emergency department kept her eyes flicking between Mary and Gabriella like she was trying to work out if one of them was my wife, and if so, which one. She was placid, feathers unruffled by the blood on my torso, seeping over my hands. At triage, they established the wound wasn’t deep, but took me aside immediately. 



The emergency department wasn’t far from the courthouse, and if the clientele of each had been swapped, I wouldn’t have noticed. Thugs with broken arms, superficial stab wounds, bruising from fights, sat open-legged in the orange chairs holding ice or homemade bandages. The porters rushed me through. I drew stares. I wondered how many of the men in that room I’d fought. 



Mary was nervous, sticking to Gabriella like a kid to his mother on the first day of school. My new intern wasn’t much better. She’d dropped everything at the courthouse to bring me here, and her face had turned grey. Still, she had that set in her jaw that I’d come to recognise. I reckoned she’d hold herself together long enough to take care of our client. 



“Mary,” I said. I leant back against the plastic covered bed, sweat pouring off me. The tired lino had footprints trodden into it, and the privacy curtain was grey with age. “Do you still smoke?” 



“Nah, I quit, Mr Red. They all say it’s bad for you, and after Lyle—”



“Of course, I apologise,” My voice came out in gasps. I couldn’t concentrate on the pain. It rolled over me in waves, the left side of my body on fire. If I thought about it, my head span like I’d sat up too fast. The nurse lifted my hands from my side, pouring sterilised water over the wound. Blood washed away, coating my shorts and the white bed. 



“Gabriella, run out and get me a pack.” I tried to snap my fingers at her. The nurse tutted. 



“This is a no smoking zone,” she said. 



“Get me cigarettes, Gabriella,” I said. “She’s my intern,” I explained to the nurse, who had lifted one eyebrow and was staring at me. “She has to do what I say.” 



“Well, right now, she’s going to wait outside so we can get a doctor in—Ma’am! You cannot use that in here!” 



Gabriella wrestled my ringing phone from her pocket. Accepting the call, she laid my wallet and watch on the table beside me.



“Hi, Judge Fisher?” she turned away from the bedside. The nurse glowered at her, shooing her towards the door. Mary sat on the only chair in the room, clutching her knees and looking between the nurse and Gabriella as though one of them would shout at her. 



“What do you mean? He got *stabbed,* your Honour.” Gabriella clamped her hand to her forehead. Her hair started to unravel from its neat twist as she lost her composure.



“What kind of fucking—”



“No, you’re right, that language was inappropriate, I apologise. I see. Well, I’ll be disputing this on behalf of my client. And if you’re lucky, I won’t hit you with a charge of negligently allowing an armed combatant to fight.” 



“Yes, I am serious. Have a good day, your Honour.” 



“Please!” The nurse exploded, still clutching at the fringes of politeness. 



“Okay!” Gabriella held her hands up in defeat. “I’m going back to the courthouse. Judge Fisher’s awarded Lyle custody. Apparently you forfeited the fight.”



I shot up, pain lancing through my side. The nurse pushed against my shoulders, and I smacked her hands away. Mary’s mouth dropped open.



“He can’t do that,” I said. “He broke the remits of the fight.” 



“Yes, but it’s the same way someone gets charged for contempt of court, apparently. It has no impact on the trial itself. He’ll serve jail time, Mary—and your hospital fees are on him, Mr Red—but we have fourteen days to lodge an appeal or he wins.” 



“He can’t!” Mary turned white.



“He can, and he will,” Gabriella said. “I’ll take care of it, Mr Red.” 



I had no choice but to agree. The nurse watched me with the gimlet stare of a prison warden. 



 “What’s your brand?” Gabriella asked, dropping the phone on the bedside table.



“Camels,” I replied. Tutting, the nurse snapped on a pair of rubber gloves. 



“Mr Red, you have been *stabbed.*” 



“It was a small knife,” I said. That earned me a smile I didn’t deserve from Gabriella. Sinking back onto the bed, I watched her leave the room. 



I was no stranger to pain, and I was quietly proud of it. Broken bones, bruises—once I pissed blood for three days after the respondent, a trucker, hit me so hard I saw stars. Never had been stabbed. As the nurse cleaned the wound, and the sharp sting of disinfectant reached me, I decided I wasn’t keen to repeat the experience. 



---------


I woke from a drug-induced sleep in a room filled with light. Mid-afternoon, it filtered through the bars on the window, spilling onto the dirty floor. The pain in my side had been replaced with a throbbing ache. I lifted the blanket to find it neatly patched with white gauze and a thick cotton pad. The room was empty, pulse monitor clipped to my finger, and panic button within easy reach. 



On the table beside me, where Gabriella had left my watch, wallet and phone, someone had placed a small bundle of cheap flowers. And a packet of sunflower seeds. I laughed.



Things were a mess. As memories of my last conversation with Gabriella filtered back, I leant my head against the pillow and groaned. A forfeited fight: my first. Lyle would pay for what he’d done, but procedure remained the same. He’d won on a technicality, and I wouldn’t be fighting fit in two weeks. I’d let down Mary. 




I called her from my bed, wincing as I shifted to grab the phone. 



“Mary? It’s me.” 



She was worried about me, and I reassured her I was doing fine. 



“They’ve patched me up. I need bed rest. I’ll be out of here as soon as I can, save Lyle his hospital fees.” 



“Is it true what Gabriella said, that he won custody?” 



I paused. “You can appeal, Mary. We’ll make sure Moe and Eric stay with you.” I rubbed my face with my palm. “Look, if you can pay, we can submit a formal case. We can do evidence, discovery. Courts never take custody away from a woman unless there’s something seriously wrong with you. It’d be easy.” 



“I can’t come up with that sort of money,” Mary sounded close to tears. “You know I can’t, Mr Red. All my money comes from Lyle’s job and now—”



I sighed. “I know, I understand. The problem is, with this injury, I can’t fight. I’m not going to be ready to take hits again for a while. My advice is, as your attorney, that you find someone new to represent you. I can give you a few names, but—”



“Why would I go somewhere else?” Mary said. 



“Because I can’t fight!” The frustration bubbled over and I bit my lip, hard, not to show it. “You won’t win, Mary. You’ll lose unless you find another firm who’ll take you on.” 



“But Gabriella said she was going to fight,” Mary said. “She said she was an associate at your firm, and she’d do it. We went for coffee and she explained everything.” 



“Did she now?” 



“I like her, Mr Red.”



“I’ll let her know,” I growled. I hung up on Mary, knowing it was rude but no longer caring. Gabriella could be as ripped as Kell Brooks, twice as determined, and there was still no way I’d let her walk into a ring with the likes of Lyle Blount. 



But I had a sneaking suspicion that what Gabriella wanted, Gabriella got. From the moment she ducked under the metal grille at the gym, she’d known what she was after. I just hoped for both of our sakes that she knew what she was dragging me into. 



--------


During outpatient, I avoided the nurse from earlier. She bore a grudge against me for not lying down and taking my medicine like a good boy. The taxi wouldn’t drop me at my office, no matter how much I pointed out my brand-new stab wound. I used the wall for balance, stepping gingerly over the trash littering my route. 



By the time I reached the rainbow graffiti, I could hear the iron-slap of weights hitting the floor. Ducking beneath the grille, I took a look around. 




A handful of men were in my gym, using my equipment. Dressed in vests and sweatpants, they were muscled in a way that suggested they had nothing else to do. A couple went bare-chested, slapping chalk between their open palms before ducking to the bar. The smell of coffee fought against the sweat. 



“What’s this?” I rattled the metal grille to get their attention. Someone pulled a pair of headphones out to listen to me. “This is a private gym.” 



“No disrespect,” the man who replied stood a head above me, biceps cultivated for aesthetics rather than strength. “But there was a flyer, and we’ve all paid our dues.” 



“Your *dues?*” I said. A sneaking realisation came over me. “You paid them to?”



“Miss Cole,” he replied. “She’s upstairs, said not to disturb her unless it was urgent. Are you an attorney too?”



“You’re damn right I’m an attorney,” I growled through gritted teeth. “Same message stands. Don’t disturb us unless it’s urgent.” 



I threw open the office door and regretted it immediately. Gripping the handle to mask my pain, I entered, breathing through my nose. 



“Hey!” Gabriella dashed over to help me. I waved her away, sinking gratefully into my chair at my desk. It was then I saw what she’d done. 



She’d completely cleared Hammer’s desk. It stood empty, box files placed neatly on the floor beside the open cabinet. The surface had been dusted, and she had a laptop and Mary Blount’s file open in front of her. A mug of good coffee steamed in the corner. 



“What do you think you're doing?” I asked. “I come back from *hospital,* Gabriella, I find people in my gym, and—”



Getting up, she crossed the room smoothly and closed the door. 



“First things first,” she said. “I’m taking Mary Blount’s case. You’re not fit to fight the appeal, but I am. He’s sloppy, his punches are telegraphed and if he hadn’t had a knife, you would have taken him.” 



I was in no fit state to argue, and merely nodded. 



“Second: this place is in trouble. We both know it, and I don’t know what mad dream is keeping the finances in order, but it’s not going to keep you afloat for long. There’s six people down there that just paid for three months use of this place. That’s going to cover the mortgage. Case-wise, I’ve been looking through them. You’ve got so many fish files in this box that they’re starting to stink out the office.” 



“They’re Hammer’s files,” I replied. 



“Two of them got default judgements against us because you didn’t file a motion in time,” she continued. “There’s three I had to apply for an extension, pulling some strings at the courthouse, and—”



“Stop,” I held up my hand to silence her, and reluctantly, Gabriella closed her mouth. “Bad luck, kid. You’ve done a lot of work for no reason. I’m shutting the firm down. You’re right, there’s no way I can cover the mortgages on this place with the cases I’m working. I can’t fight, and you’re naïve or stupid if you think you can.” 



The set of her jaw was back. I rummaged in my pocket for painkillers. 



“My partner died because he didn’t know when to stop. I don’t want to be there, fifty years old, staring down a fight I can’t win. It ends now.” 



“You can’t,” Gabriella whispered. 



“I can, and I will,” I replied.

51xwnr,1,2016-09-09,Putting college on hold and accepting a full time job offer at 19. Smart?,yokoonoshedidnt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51xwnr/putting_college_on_hold_and_accepting_a_full_time/,"Hi all, I'm currently a college freshman working an internship to save a little money and build experience. I've been blessed with the opportunity to potentially land a full time position with great benefits and great pay at 19 doing mobile app development. The phone interview is scheduled for Monday and while I'm very excited for this opportunity the voice in the back of my head keeps telling me that I shouldn't take it and I should focus on my studies. I've always had it drilled in my head that if I don't go to college then I will never get a full time position and I will end up ""working at McDonald's my whole life"". This opportunity proves that what I've been told is a lie. Hell, at the internship I'm in now there are senior managers who have worked here for 15 years and don't have a degree. I'm hoping that with the knowledge that I have developed apps since I was 14 (5 years of app development experience) and the fact that I've worked with clients to build apps for them will trump the fact that I don't have a degree yet. I talked with someone about it and asked for his advice on whether having a degree is more important than work experience, and he said that in most cases experience is more important, especially in software where most employees teach themselves. The job description states ""Bachelor’s Degree in CS, Engineering, or IS or any equivalent combination of experience, education, and/or training in the computer systems development field"", so I'm going to say that I should be fine without a degree, but I'm not entirely sure.

What I'm thinking is that with this opportunity I can save up money over the course of one to a couple of years, pay college out of pocket and never rack up student loans, and with the health insurance coverage I can go to a psychiatrist and figure out whether I have ADHD or anxiety or whatever since I've never been to one. My parents are the type to let pride overrule my fear of having something mentally wrong with me, e.g. ""You don't have a disease, you're better than that!"" or ""Don't ever say you have something mental going on with you, you're not that type of person!"" as if mental illness only affects people ""beneath"" them. But I know that there's something wrong with me mentally and I have to address it on my own. And then finally the biggest reason is that my situation at home is very toxic and I have to move out. Having a boyfriend while living with homophobic parents is not good, believe me.

Honestly I think that this is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially for a 19 year old. My parents want me to live with them and focus on getting my degree, but I would rather have it so that I can say that I've worked at big companies building brilliant apps while getting a degree as opposed to showing them a sheet of paper that basically says ""I graduated."" But I'm having second thoughts about it. What do you think? Do you have a good paying job and you didn't get a degree?"
51y5dw,8,2016-09-09,Am I [23 M] stupid for being in a relationship with this long time friend [23 F]? We just started and I'm really confused,throw9s16,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51y5dw/am_i_23_m_stupid_for_being_in_a_relationship_with/,"Hi everyone. So I started a relationship with a long time friend just a few weeks ago and I'm having trouble dealing with some issues that I didn't expect to have. 

I met this girl a few years back at a party (she was dating a friend of mine) and turns out she studied in the same college campus as me. We became very good friends and we start trusting each other a lot. When she broke up with this guy (he cheated on her) we kissed, but at the time I was seeing some other girl and I felt guilty, although I liked it. 

A year passed and we slept together but I was just out of a relationship so nothing more happened (although she implied that she wanted to be with me). Anyway, she started two troubling relationships (one with her boss and one with some married guy). At the time we were just friend so she told me all about it and I could tell she was suffering deeply for these guys. I gave her my honest advice.

Anyway, another year or so passed and we start going out again, things happening (no sex, though, she told me she wanted to wait) and things are kinda going to a serious relationship (she told me that we would make a good couple and we started sharing a lot of things). 

However, we were chosen for an internship (more like a professional practice my college does) to some other state. We were really excited but we decided to leave the serious relationship thing until we were sure so we don't screw our 4 month stay there.

Someday out of nowhere she stop talking to me so I confront her and turns out she met a guy and she's really excited about it. I was kinda angry, not because of the guy, but because she stopped talking to me out of the blue (we were friends atm). Anyway, we worked it out, go to the internship and she's being really faithful to this guy all the way, until some day at a party she slept with a random guy.

I was pretty devastated tbh, specially because she was distant towards me (which I supposed was because of the guy she met before the internship) and that happened with a random guy. Anyway, I didn't got mad at her or anything, but I was hurt and she noticed it. We talked some days later and stuff started happening again. Some time later she told me that she wanted to be in a serious relationship with me, which I declined because I wasn't trusting her 100%. 

She told me that she was going to prove herself to me. She did (although I told her not to) by doing a lot of things (I can give details but this story is starting to get big). So, a few weeks ago we started officially having a serious relationship. The thing is, she's being really into it, I can't complain really. She tells me that she loves me, that she always wanted to be with me, that she's 100% committed and that she understands that she hurt me so she's making an effort to make things right. 

I love her too, but I can't help but feel played. The other day I kinda snooped in her cellphone and found a convo with the guy she was dating before the internship. Nothing bad, really, just a text that said ""sorry for all the drama, I'm going to remember you"" and some things about school and books. Nevertheless I got super jealous (I'm not usually like that) but didn't say anything. 

Sometimes I get annoyed by stupid things, like comments about good looking guys, or movies, or a comment about her ex, or things like she doesn't texts me, whatever. I'm usually really secure, but with this girl I feel lost. I really want to be with her, she's my best friend, but the past is messing with me and I know it's unfair but I can't help it. What should I do? What's your opinion? Can I trust this girl, is she playing with me? Should I care that much about the past?

51yuhb,0,2016-09-09,Is it worth it to finish a masters if you've already got a job?,thowitallawayagain,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51yuhb/is_it_worth_it_to_finish_a_masters_if_youve/,"Hey PF,

I need some advice. So, part of my masters in CS included an internship. I enjoyed the work and, after it was over, the company offered me a good job. I'd already finished all my course work so I accepted the job figuring I could write my thesis (based on the work I did for the company) on evenings and weekends. The problem is, I've been working for the last six months or so and have made zero progress on my thesis. Between working extra hours at the office to make a good impression and just being too exhausted when I get home to fire up the word processor, I simply haven't managed to make it past word one. Now my thesis supervisor is asking me whether I'm planning on finishing or not and I don't know what to tell him.

On the one hand, I have a hard time leaving things unfinished when I've invested time and money in them. On the other hand, I'm not sure if finishing will actually have any impact on my career at this point and, in the meantime, having it hanging over my head has negatively affected my quality of life. I think at this point I have to choose whether to quit the program and focus on my career or quit my job, finish the thesis, and start the job hunt over again.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Ever since I was 13 and went to a presentation given by an ER physician, I knew I wanted to be a doctor. When I went to high school, however, I did a 4 year computer science program (to look good for colleges). Through this program, I took 4 years of programming, and I did an internship in IT. I was one of two girls in my programming classes, yet I always received the highest test grades and would help everyone in my class out with programming. It was something I truly excelled at. However, I did not have a good time at the internship because I basically did nothing and even the people who worked there did nothing. I do not like being idle so I completely wrote off computer science as a field for myself. Throughout high school, I additionally did many extracurriculars in the medical and more broadly, biological fields and enjoyed it a lot more than my computer science internship. So I finalized my decision to be pre-med, and additionally I decided that being a biology major would be the right choice for me. I have been volunteering at a hospital and working at a lab for months now and love both of these things so much (they are literally the best parts of my week). I took genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology my freshman year (core classes for the Bio major) and really found the content interesting. So basically all of freshman year I felt content with where I was and thought I was making the right decision as to what to study and what to do after graduation. Now I am a sophomore and decided to take a computer science elective (mostly about how computers impact society; not really hard computer science). I realize that I miss studying computer science/programming soo much. Like it literally hurts when I see all the comp sci majors around me coding and working on projects. I am starting to regret ending my studies in computer science so early on. I don't know what to do because if I pick up a different major/double major I won't graduate early and I will have to pay for my last year of college myself (my dad flat out told me he can't afford it) and I really wanted to have a gap year before medical school. I just feel so confused about the choices I've made these past few years and any advice would be appreciated!

EDIT: It's also worth mentioning that another reason why I decided not to do a computer science major was because I am not great at math. Pre-Calculus, AP Calculus AB and BC were the only classes I made B's in during high school. "

My fwb understands and has tried to explain the situation to them, but our friends are still blaming me. (long)",throwaway123213222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51zm7v/my_22_m_friends_think_i_am_evil_because_i_wont/,"Both my fwb Maggie and I are 22 year old college students. I want to emphasize that Maggie is NOT the bad guy in this situation and she has stood up for me against our friends throughout this entire process. Maggie has given me her permission to post this on Reddit and she will also be reading your comments with me.

Maggie and I have been close friends since middle school and we both ended up attending the same uni and living in the same dorm building throughout college. Maggie primarily dates other women, but she and I have occasionally hooked up over the years, hence why I refer to her as 'FWB' in the title of this post. 

Over the summer break, Maggie and I hooked up several times. We always use condoms + the pill, but Maggie took a round of antibiotics for an infection and as luck would have it, she is now about 9 weeks pregnant. She went to the Planned Parenthood and got a pregnancy test that confirms the pregnancy, plus she went ahead and scheduled herself for an abortion. Unfortunately, the PP did not have any open appointments until the next month and by that time she will be too far along for the cheaper medical abortion. She is scheduled for a surgical abortion on Monday, but the cost is $600 instead of $350. The PP was able to get her some financial help for the abortion cost, but we still owe $400 by the date of the appointment.

Since Maggie and I are both full time students in the same demanding major, we both only work part time at about 15 hours per week each. We are both interns working in the same lab and it is not feasible for either of us to increase our hours due to the way the internship funding works. After paying my bills for the month, I had a little over $170 in the bank and I gave it all to Maggie to help pay for the abortion. We won't get paid again until next Friday (her appointment is on Monday), which means that we are both about $70 short of the funds to cover the abortion costs.

Maggie decided that since we get paid only a few days after her appointment, that she could ask her best friend Sarah for the $70 and then pay Sarah back as soon as our paychecks came in. She asked Sarah if she could borrow some money, but did not mention exactly what the money was for at first. Sarah refused to loan Maggie the money without knowing the reason why and eventually Maggie told her that she was short the $70 she needed to get the abortion. Sarah freaked out on her, demanding to know who the dad was and why he wasn't helping her pay for the abortion. Maggie told Sarah to calm down, told Sarah that the dad was me and that I had already given her (Maggie) all the money I had until payday. Sarah gave Maggie the $70, but then mentioned something about how I had to pay her back instead of Maggie, Maggie thanked her and left.

The problem is, now our friend group is shunning me and essentially trashing my name because Sarah ran her mouth about lending Maggie the money for the abortion. Maggie spoke to Sarah on Wednesday and by dinner on Thursday (yesterday) all of our friends knew about the situation. We normally sit at a large table during dinner and lunch in the student cafeteria and when I tried to sit with them for dinner, they all turned away from me and fell silent. I asked them what was wrong, and our friend Laura told me that if I weren't willing to support Maggie and her choice, that I shouldn't hang out with the group anymore. I was confused and asked them to explain, but Laura told me that I knew exactly what they were talking about. At this point, Maggie had gotten her food and sat down as well. She was confused by the tense atmosphere and asked what was going on. Laura asked her if she was okay and then said that the group supported her even if I didn't. Maggie was confused and said that I was in complete support and that she didn't understand why everyone was acting so cold towards me.

Turns out, Sarah had told everyone that I wasn't supporting Maggie and that I had refused to pay for the abortion myself. Sarah told them that Maggie had to beg her for the money because I wasn't willing to help her pay for the abortion. Maggie told them that Sarah was lying, that I had paid for practically half the costs already and that I was the one who helped drive her to the PP in the first place. Laura countered that 'practically half' wasn't good enough and that a real man should have paid for it all himself. Maggie told Laura that she needed to stay out of her business, because her interpretation of the situation was not correct and because she didn't care for how Laura felt the need to talk behind her back with Sarah about her personal life.

At this point, things were getting nasty so I told Maggie that I was leaving for class. Maggie gave me a hug and said she would set them straight, then I left along with two of our friends. These two friends are on Maggie and I's side and think it's disgusting how everyone else is sticking their nose in our private affairs. While we were gone, Maggie told Sarah off and gave her back the $70 she had borrowed, saying that she didn't need money from someone who isn't supportive of her. Our two friends have already promised to help us out with the $70.

Now, both Maggie and I agree that we need to drop a lot of these people as friends, but it isn't so simple. Our college has less than 1300 students and everyone knows each other on campus. I can't avoid a lot of these people, as we have class together and often have to work together on projects. In addition, Sarah and Laura have made multiple posts on facebook (after blocking me and Maggie) saying that I am a terrible person, a misogynist, etc (mentioning my full name) and basically writing out that Maggie is having an abortion for the whole world to see. 

We do not know how to proceed tactfully from this point on, which is why we are asking on Reddit. How should we handle this from here on out to minimize the damage? I want to report both Sarah and Laura to the school, but Maggie is worried that we wouldn't be taking it far enough. What do you all think?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Accidentally got my fwb pregnant, she scheduled an abortion. I gave her all the money I have until payday, but it isn't enough to cover the full cost. Fwb asked her best friend to lend her the last $70 until payday, fwb told our entire friend group that I am a misogynist who was trying to stop fwb from having the abortion. Fwb told our friends that best friend was lying and that I have been 100% supportive, now they are posting on facebook about us using our full names. We have class with these people and our college is tiny and now pretty much everyone knows what is happening. I want to report our friends to the school, but fwb thinks we need to escalate this further. How should we handle this tactfully?"
51zo41,15,2016-09-09,I have just been fired,crawder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/51zo41/i_have_just_been_fired/,"So... this is it. Boss came to my desk and said we needed to talk (it was her last day) and went straight to the point. Even though I kinda expected someone would get fired, it was really shocking that it was me. I'm an intern and around here, it's very rare for interns to get fired. I don't want to make it personal, but it's so hard not to think about it this way. There's the fact that my boss really hated me since day one and barely helped with my difficulties, and every time I asked for a feedback on my conduct, she'd be completely evasive. She also treated every one on my division very well, but me very differently, and I could never understood why. She's not a good person and I could tell it by the fact that absolutely nobody liked her. I've got a lot of support from my amazing co-workers, and it's very sad not to see them anymore on a daily basis.
Of course I had my failures, lots of them, but I sincerely don't think those justify a dismissal, especially when lots of people did way worse to her and nothing happened.
Well, guess this is it. I'm not here for comments like ""yeah, she's disgusting and you are right"", I just needed to get it off my chest.
Thank you :)"

He sent his summer collection down the catwalk where each model’s key accessory was Mr J's cum all over their face. The line of dresses where each designed as a single piece of beautifully embroiled fabric held to the body by complex shibari.

This bold statement clearly impressed as during the year Mr J has hand tied many celebrity in his creations, before sending them down the red carpet. That said only one starlet made her way down the red carpet wearing Mr J on her face too. Mr J's success doesn’t end there either, his studio has been filled with a veritable who's who of the sexist women alive. All trying to join his harem of muses for his next adventure 

So here's where you come in, I'm starting my new venture and you have either applied to an open casting call or perhaps your already a star and requested my services. I'm happy for real or original starlets but if you do go real please give a few options. 

The Catwalk: looking for new models to show off my latest collection. Exhibitionists are required.

The Fitting: an opportunity for socialites and heiresses to be fitted for the latest must have garment.

The Cover Shoot: I'm shooting a fetish cover for a fashion magazine and am looking for a photographer who can work with me to create a shared erotic vision

The Book: I'm putting together a book of celebrities in fetish situations, the twist though is that no one is to be identified in the book so views are left guessing who's who.

The Album: I'm putting together a concept album where the music is a mix of the growls, sighs and moans of my instruments along with the hits on their skin and the lead singer being toyed with throughout recording.

Workers Hammer No. 235
Summer 2016

MAY 31 — In the run-up to the 5 May local and Welsh and Scottish assembly elections, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, was subjected to a vicious smear campaign spearheaded by Labour’s right wing with the aid of the Tories and the capitalist press. Corbyn was elected as party leader last September based on talk of socialism, trade union rights and immigrant rights and is also a forthright defender of Palestinian rights. The get-Corbyn cabal, which reached all the way to Zionist New York Times columnist Roger Cohen and Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog, shrieked that the party under his leadership has become a haven for “leftist anti-Semites”. To hear Tory swine like Prime Minister David Cameron and then-mayor of London Boris Johnson sanctimoniously bemoaning racism in the Labour Party was truly sickening.

The right wingers of the Labour Party, successors to former prime minister Tony Blair, have been manoeuvring to oust him. Most recently they looked forward to removing him in the event of a Labour defeat in the elections. In the upshot, Labour pretty much held its own. Underlining the cynical character of the witch hunt, the “discovery” of ever more “anti-Semites” ceased even before the ballots had been counted, to be replaced by a new “scandal” that Corbyn’s Labour Party was supposedly rife with woman-haters. The latest smear was based on specious claims, quickly proven false, that many of the 35,000 signatories to a petition urging the BBC to remove Laura Kuenssberg as its political editor had made misogynist comments. Kuenssberg has consistently hounded Corbyn, seeing in him a representative of the working masses the establishment so loathes.

The supposed evidence of anti-Jewish bigotry ranged from the trivial to the stitched-up, much of it coming from the notorious right-wing bottom-feeding blogger who goes by the name “Guido Fawkes” and dating back to well before Corbyn became party leader last September. The witch hunters were joined by the successful Labour candidate for London mayor, Sadiq Khan, a Muslim who had himself been pilloried by the Tories for allegedly befriending “Muslim extremists”. Corbyn strenuously rejected charges that Labour was full of racists, but he did acquiesce to the suspension of a number of party members. Worse yet, his chief lieutenant John McDonnell volubly endorsed the crusade to hunt down “anti-Semites” in the party. Those suspended included Muslim MP Naz Shah, who was also forced to resign as McDonnell’s parliamentary private secretary, and sometime left-Labourite Ken Livingstone. These suspensions should be rescinded immediately.

Livingstone has much to answer for to the working class. As mayor of London he faithfully served the City bankers, he urged Tube workers to cross RMT picket lines and defended the role of the police in the cold-blooded execution of Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005. As a Spartacist League placard at the London May Day rally read: “Ex-Mayor Livingstone: Pro-City, Pro-Police, Anti-Union, but NOT Anti-Jewish!” A second placard read: “No Vote to Blairite Stooge Sadiq Khan!”

To his credit, Livingstone rightly stated: “If you look at what this is all about, it’s not about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.... What this is all about is actually the struggle of the embittered old Blairite MPs to try to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn” (BBC News online, 30 April). Indeed, a spokesman for the Zionist Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (BICOM) admitted as much when he ranted, “Save your pitch fork for Corbyn.”

As we documented in our article, “Britain: Banana monarchy” (Workers Hammer no 234, Spring 2016), since Corbyn’s election, the Tories, Blairites and the bourgeois media — especially the liberal Guardian — have waged an unrelenting class war aimed at removing him. Only days after Corbyn took over as Labour leader, the Sunday Times (20 September 2015) published a warning from an unnamed “senior serving general” that Corbyn would face a “mutiny” if he tried to act on his commitment to scrap the Trident submarine nuclear missile system or pull out of NATO. This coup threat was echoed two months later when the head of the armed forces, General Nicholas Houghton, in full military regalia, effectively declared on TV that Corbyn’s opposition to nuclear weapons made him unfit to be prime minister. Houghton was immediately backed up by Corbyn’s defence spokesman, the Blairite Maria Eagle. Barely a week has gone by without some overt attack on Corbyn by Blairite plotters. But as the outcome of the latest vendetta shows, every plot to remove him comes up against the stubborn fact that he is more popular than ever among the party membership, which has doubled in size since his campaign for party leader.

Corbyn is hardly a revolutionary; he is firmly committed to a parliamentary path to what would effectively be a new version of the old Labourite “welfare state”. Nonetheless, Corbyn’s election as Labour leader came as a nasty shock to the bourgeois establishment, and especially the right wing of the Labour Party. His campaign set in motion a process to restore the party’s historic links to its working-class base, reversing the direction the Blairites had taken towards becoming an overtly capitalist party. As we wrote in “Britain: Banana monarchy”:

“Any move that weakens the grip of the Blairites within the party is in the interests of the working class in its struggles against the capitalist class. As the Spartacist League/Britain has stated from the beginning, we have a side in the class war raging in the Labour Party. Against the right-wing attempts to oust him, we say: Defend Jeremy Corbyn’s right to run the Labour Party, and in his way!”

Zionism: no friend of the Jewish people

August Bebel, a central leader of the pre-World War I German Social Democracy, pithily described anti-Jewish bigotry, which whipped up populist venom by singling out “Jewish bankers”, as the “socialism of fools”. But those who today promiscuously toss around unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism are sinister enemies of all who solidarise with the Palestinian people and of the left and workers movement as a whole. The campaign to neutralise and silence international solidarity with the besieged Palestinian people is orchestrated from the highest levels of the Israeli state, with support from its imperialist patrons in Britain, the US and Germany.

In 2011, the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enacted a law that criminalised advocacy of a boycott of Israel. And at a 28 March conference in Jerusalem to plot strategy against the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz called for “targeted civil eliminations” of BDS “leaders”. Coming from a government that has killed some 200 Palestinians just since last October, and slaughtered more than 2300 during its July 2014 onslaught on Gaza, this is not idle chatter.

Within the Labour Party, there is considerable overlap between Labour Friends of Israel and the Blairite Progress grouping. In early April, Progress head Richard Angell issued an “action plan” involving the Jewish Labour Movement to deal with “antisemitism within [Labour’s] ranks” (mirror.co.uk, 5 April). The Jewish Labour Movement is affiliated not only to the Labour Party but also to the World Zionist Organization, which finances the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

This provides some context for the recent raft of “anti-Semitism” smears in Britain. In February, Alex Chalmers, a BICOM intern, slandered the Oxford University Labour Club for having “some kind of problem with Jews” after they voted to endorse Israeli Apartheid Week on campus. When Malia Bouattia, a Muslim woman of Algerian origin who supports the Palestinian cause, subsequently ran successfully for the presidency of the National Union of Students, she, too, was accused of being anti-Jewish. Vicki Kirby, a Labour candidate in Woking, was suspended for a 2011 tweet that Guido Fawkes dug up and doctored to make it look as if she promoted racist caricatures of Jews. As Jewish writer David Baddiel attested, Kirby had simply quoted some lines from his 2010 comedy film The Infidel.

Fawkes likewise “outed” Naz Shah for a 2014 Facebook post, before she became a Labour MP, that depicted a map of Israel superimposed on a map of the US. Ironically, those who maligned Shah for allegedly supporting the forced transfer of the Israeli Jewish population are the very people who apologise for an Israeli government filled with open proponents of the forced transfer of the Palestinian population from “Greater Israel”. It turned out that the map was originally posted by American Jewish academic Norman Finkelstein, who pointed to the obvious dark humour intended: “So, we have this joke: Why doesn’t Israel become the 51st state? Answer: Because then, it would only have two senators” (opendemocracy.net). The Zionists hate Finkelstein, the son of concentration camp survivors, not least for his indictments of how they cynically wield the Nazi genocide of the Jews as a bludgeon against those who speak out against Israeli atrocities.

Ken Livingstone was accused of being anti-Jewish because, in defending Shah, he had the chutzpah to say that when “Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism. This was before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.” Sundry critics tried to dismiss Livingstone’s statement by pointing out how his facts were mangled (Hitler never won an election, etc, etc). Despite his glib reduction of the Holocaust to a product of Hitler’s madness, his point about collaboration between Zionists and the Nazis is correct. Livingstone cited Lenni Brenner’s Zionism in the Age of the Dictators (1983), a book the Spartacist League/Britain drew on for the article “Zionist Big Lie targets Perdition” (Workers Hammer no 88, May 1987). The Zionists prevented that play, written by Jim Allen and directed by Ken Loach, from being staged in London because it was based on the true story of Zionist collaboration with the Nazis in facilitating the deportation to the death camps of more than 400,000 Hungarian Jews in 1944.

Hitler’s ultimate aim was the extermination of all Jews, Zionist and non-Zionist alike. But in its first years, the Third Reich frequently accepted the proffered assistance of the Zionists in helping make Germany “Judenrein” (cleansed of Jews). As documented by Yeshiva University historian Lucy Dawidowicz in The War Against the Jews 1933-1945 (1975), only months after Hitler came to power, the Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD) “proposed that the ‘new German state’ recognize the Zionist movement as the most suitable Jewish group in the new Germany with which to deal” and “that since emigration would provide a solution to the Jewish question, it should therefore receive government assistance”. The ZVfD welcomed “the foundation of the new state, which has established the principle of race”. Two months later, the Jewish Agency signed the secret August 1933 Ha’avara (Transfer) agreement with the Hitler regime, which allowed wealthy German Jews to move to Palestine (and only to Palestine) with part of their capital in order to provide an outlet for German exports.

In turn, the Nazi state granted special status to the Zionist movement, which was far smaller than the non-Zionist Jewish organisations. In January 1935, Nazi chief Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Gestapo and second-in-command of the SS, told the Bavarian political police that “the activity of the Zionist-oriented youth organizations...lies in the interest of the National Socialist state’s leadership” because they were preparing Jews for emigration to Palestine (quoted in Dawidowicz). While active socialists and communists were thrown into Dachau, the Zionists were for some years the only non-Nazi political group allowed to function legally, the Zionist banner the only flag aside from the Nazi swastika to fly on German soil.

There was more to this than Zionist Realpolitik in the face of overwhelming Nazi repression, as latter-day apologists would have it. As the revolutionary workers movement grew towards the end of the 19th century, so did organised anti-Jewish bigotry. Overwhelmingly, the Jewish workers, and a significant layer of the Jewish intelligentsia, sought their salvation through the struggle, alongside their non-Jewish class brothers and sisters, for socialist revolution. It was to stanch this movement and to incite pogroms that the tsarist secret police propagated The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a crude forgery that conjured up an international Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. But when rumours of a pogrom spread through St Petersburg at the height of the 1905 Revolution, the workers soviet mobilised some 12,000 armed workers to fight the reactionaries; likewise in Warsaw, integrated workers defence guards were set up to patrol Jewish areas and ward off pogromist mobs (see “Revolution, Counterrevolution and the Jewish Question”, Spartacist [English-language edition] no
49-50, Winter 1993-94).

In his 1958 essay “The Non-Jewish Jew”, Marxist historian Isaac Deutscher accounted for the disproportionate role of Jews in the socialist movement:

“They were a priori exceptional in that as Jews they dwelt on the borderlines of various civilizations, religions, and national cultures. They were born and brought up on the borderlines of various epochs. Their mind matured where the most diverse cultural influences crossed and fertilized each other....

“Like Marx, Rosa Luxemburg and Trotsky strove, together with their non-Jewish comrades, for the universal, as against the particularist, and for the internationalist, as against the nationalist, solutions to the problems of their time.”

Zionist founding father Theodor Herzl (1860-1904) despised the assimilationist and pro-socialist Jewish proletariat. Rather than fight anti-Jewish bigotry and repression, Herzl and his fellow Zionists used it as an excuse to separate Europe’s Jews from their compatriots and mould them into a nation with its own homeland, in Palestine. Ideologically nurtured in the cradle of German national “awakening”, Zionism embraced the reactionary ideals of Blut (blood) and Volk (nation). Born long after the bourgeois nation-state had outlived its historically progressive role in the era of capitalist consolidation, Zionism distinguished itself in being a particularly venal and racialist brand of nationalism. The Zionist leaders raised the battle cry, “A land without people for a people without land”, knowing full well that to make Palestine a land without people would require the expulsion of much of its Arab population.

The Zionist project could only be realised with the support of a powerful imperialist patron — be it tsarist Russia, the Kaiser’s (or Hitler’s) Germany, Britain or the US. The Zionists peddled their wares with the claim that they could neutralise Jewish support for the revolutionary socialist movement. As Winston Churchill later ranted, the Zionists could help in defeating the “sinister confederacy” of “International Jews” who conspired “for the overthrow of civilization” (“Zionism versus Bolshevism, A Struggle for the Soul of the Jewish People”, Illustrated Sunday Herald, 8 February 1920). While Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann looked to the British or US imperialists, the Revisionist right wing inspired by Vladimir Jabotinsky gravitated towards Mussolini’s Italy and even Hitler’s Germany. As late as 1941, a Revisionist splinter calling itself the National Military Organisation (NMO), better known as the Stern Gang, appealed to the Third Reich:

“Common interests could exist between the establishment of a New Order in Europe in conformity with the German concept, and the true national aspirations of the Jewish people as they are embodied by the NMO.”

— quoted in Zionism in the Age of the Dictators

It was such “common interests” that led Herzl and his followers to find allies among the more reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie, who wanted to rid themselves of “their” Jews. Weizmann managed to secure the 1917 Balfour Declaration, with its vague promise of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The British imperialists aimed to establish a bulwark of support in the region, pitting Jews against Palestinians. They also hoped to undermine Jewish support for Bolshevism on the eve of the victorious October Revolution in Russia, then Britain’s ally in World War I.

In this latter aim they failed. In the course of the Russian Revolution and the civil war against imperialist and domestic counterrevolutionary forces, which carried out pogroms against Jews and reds wherever they went, the dispossessed Jewish masses flocked to the Bolshevik banner. The Jewish nationalist and pro-Zionist socialist groups in Russia and the Ukraine became empty shells. As the Third All-Russia Conference of the Jewish Communist Sections declared in 1920:

“The Jewish workers and the poorest of the Jewish people understand quite well that only the communist order will put an end to all pogroms, will root out all nationalist prejudices, will erase all national restrictions and install over the whole face of the earth a genuine brotherhood of peoples.”

— News of Central Bureau of the Jewish Sections (October 1920)

The Bolshevik Revolution and the early Soviet state under Lenin and Trotsky were a beacon to workers and the oppressed everywhere, including the Arab masses subjugated by British imperialism in the Near East, who suffered under the barbarity of capitalist “civilisation”. The overthrow of capitalism and the institution of a planned collectivised economy opened the road to the liberation and development of all the many Soviet peoples. Even after the reactionary and nationalist Stalinist bureaucracy usurped political power from the working class, it was the proletarian class character of the Soviet Union that allowed it to save well over two million Jews fleeing the Nazi murder machine and to smash Hitler’s Third Reich. In contrast, the imperialist “democracies” turned back all but a handful of Jewish refugees. Many of the Jewish refugees who were allowed into Britain were detained as so-called enemy aliens during World War II and thousands were deported. Most notorious was the ship Dunera, which was packed with 2000 mostly Jewish refugees along with 450 Italian and German prisoners for the two-month voyage to Australia.

For a socialist federation of the Near East!

Young activists who solidarise with the cause of the Palestinian people in the face of Israeli state terror would do well to consider the words of the Jewish Communists in 1920. Revolutionary proletarian internationalism is the only road to the national and social emancipation of the Palestinian people. This may seem far-fetched in an age when the opportunist “far left” sneers at the Marxist goal of an egalitarian international communist order and even class struggle seems a thing of the past. However, if the past decade has demonstrated nothing else, it is that catastrophic crises are endemic to the capitalist profit system. The same holds true of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, as the current strike wave in France and years of protests and strikes in Greece demonstrate, notwithstanding the stranglehold of the reformist, pro-capitalist trade union bureaucracies.

The capitalist state of Israel is no exception to this Marxist understanding. While Israeli society has moved steadily to the right in recent decades, the historic interests of the Israeli Jewish working class run counter to those of their capitalist rulers and exploiters. So long as the national rather than the class axis prevails, the Palestinians will lose out to the overwhelming military superiority of the Zionist state. It is only the working class of Israel that has the capacity and historic interest to shatter the Zionist state from within. In fighting for the creation of revolutionary internationalist workers parties in the Near East we struggle to win the Israeli Jewish workers away from their Zionist rulers, to recognise that their class allies are the working people of the Arab countries and to champion the national rights of the Palestinians. Likewise we seek to break the Arab toiling masses from Arab nationalism and Islamic reaction (see “Defend the Palestinian People!” Workers Vanguard no 1089, 6 May).

The 2011 Egyptian protests did find an echo in the mass protests in Israel that summer, showing the potential to undermine the garrison mentality drummed into Israeli Jewish workers by the Zionist rulers, who tell them that they are surrounded by a “sea” of hostile Arabs. However, the uprising in Egypt did not present a challenge to capitalist rule by the proletariat; rather, it was dominated by bourgeois nationalists and Islamists. For their part, the Revolutionary Socialists (RS) in Egypt, associated with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), simply capitulated to these forces. From pushing illusions in the army to backing the reactionary Muslim Brotherhood and, ultimately, the coup that brought the military to power, at every stage the RS helped to ensure that the Egyptian proletariat would remain tied to its class enemies.

In Britain, the reformists of the SWP prate that the liberal BDS movement is “the potentially most serious challenge to Israel’s position and to the continuance of its long-term policy of piecemeal and de facto annexation of the whole of Palestine” (Socialist Review, July/August 2013). The BDS campaign is based on the bankrupt assumption that the Israeli state can be pressured by its “democratic” imperialist paymasters to halt the oppression of the Palestinian people. The notion that the (admittedly well-funded and powerful) “Zionist lobby” is responsible for imperialist support to Israel is ludicrous. It is in pursuit of its own geopolitical interests that US imperialism pumps some $3 billion a year in military aid to its Israeli gendarme.

According to the Palestine Solidarity Committee, the boycott strategy “exerts moral pressure on the British Government by giving expression to the desire to move towards a more ethical foreign policy”. “Democratic” Britain, as much as, if not more than, any other country, bears the burden of historical responsibility for making the Near East the slaughterhouse that it is today. At the start of World War I, Britain sought to encourage an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, then Britain’s enemy, by promising that the Arabs would be granted freedom at the war’s end. Two years later, the British imperialists and their French allies, in the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, carved up the Near East for themselves. This was followed by the pro-Zionist Balfour Declaration. Thirty years later, the Clement Attlee Labour government presided over the bloody partition of Palestine (and the far bloodier partition of India). Divide-and-rule — that is the “morality” of British imperialism.

While defending BDS activists when they come under attack by the state, we oppose this strategy, which looks to the supposed “humanitarian” instincts of capitalist governments, campus administrations and corporate giants to pressure Israel. Ongoing economic sanctions serve mainly to weaken and undermine the workers and oppressed of the targeted country, not its capitalist rulers. Particularly odious are academic and cultural boycotts, which equate Israeli scholars and artists — such as the integrated West-Eastern Divan Orchestra set up by Palestinian scholar Edward Said and Jewish musician Daniel Barenboim — with the chauvinist Zionist rulers. In contrast, Marxists assert the need for international working-class solidarity with the Palestinians. A standing boycott by British and US dock workers, for example, refusing to handle military shipments to Israel, would strike a powerful blow against Zionist state terror.

Marxists reject the notion widely held on the left that an oppressor nation forfeits its right to self-determination. This is a species of nationalist moralism, which ends up mirroring the lie that equates Zionism with the Jewish people. As we explained in “Birth of the Zionist State: A Marxist Analysis” (Workers Vanguard no 45, 24 May 1974):

“Out of the destruction of European Jewry by Hitler (without whose aid the Zionists would have gone the way of the Shakers and other utopian sects) and at the expense of the Palestinian Arabs, a settler colony was transformed into a nation....

“This Hebrew nation came into existence through force and violence, through the suppression, forced expulsion and genocide of other peoples. Communists must oppose this brutal national oppression. Yet once this historical fact is accomplished, we must certainly recognize that nation’s right to self-determination, unless we prefer the alternative, namely national genocide.”

We defend the Palestinian people against the Zionist state down the line, even when that means taking a military side with Islamic fundamentalists like Hamas in Gaza. But we recognise the right of the Israeli Jews as well as the Palestinians to national self-determination. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at bottom a situation of interpenetrated peoples. Both peoples lay claim to the same small sliver of land. Under capitalism, the exercise of national self-determination by one side necessarily comes at the expense of the other. There can and will be no just resolution to the conflicting national rights of the Palestinian and Israeli Jewish peoples short of the establishment of a socialist federation of the Near East, requiring the overthrow of all the bourgeois states of the region through proletarian revolutions.

For revolutionaries in Britain, solidarity with the oppressed in the neocolonial countries must start with opposing our “own” ruling class and fighting to bring down British imperialism through socialist revolution at home. Leftist youth who seek effective solidarity with the Palestinian people against Zionist terror need to study the lessons of the Bolshevik Revolution, the greatest victory for the working class and the oppressed to date. Based on those lessons, the Spartacist League/Britain, section of the International Communist League, fights to cohere a revolutionary workers party as part of a reforged Trotskyist Fourth International. It is only through the worldwide victory of the socialist proletariat that all manner of exploitation, oppression and imperialist barbarity will be overcome.

Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong.
As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.

Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."
521k5p,2,2016-09-10,"Even though tuition is paid for, should I take advantage of low interest, deferred, federal student loans?",GodFather0326,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/521k5p/even_though_tuition_is_paid_for_should_i_take/,"Hey guys and gals, first post here so let's get to it.

I’m young, and painfully aware that I “don’t know everything about everything, or much about anything.” I’m posting this to get feedback from older, more experienced, and smarter investors than I. 

I'm wondering if it’s a good idea to take advantage of federal and private student and VA loans that are deferred until 6 - 9 months after you graduate? 


I qualify for 100% of my Post 9/11 GI benefits, will be working part-time, etc, etc. 


But let's say that on top of that, my freshman year I borrow roughly $50,000.00 in deferred federal student loans (current IR's are about 4.69%) with a grace period of 6 months after graduation.)


The plan is to invest this capital into various opportunities that, after much deliberation and analysis, should grow at about 9 - 12% per year. 


But for the sake of the argument let's say that I play it safe and dump it all into an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. Something like SPY.


Historically, The SPY ETF's (and S&amp;P 500) growth rate is roughly 8 -10% per year. We're going to go conservative here and adjust that to a constant 7 – 8.5% just in case. Did I mention that the SPY ETF pays a quarterly dividend? (2.02% or $4.34/share annually) Dividends that I intend to DRIP right back into the SPY to compound this financial momentum.


(Conservative) Estimates of growth from years 1 - 4:

1st year: 50,000 x 8.5% = $54,250.00 + annual dividend payment of $986.00


2nd year: $55,286.00 x 7.6% = $59,487.00 + Dividends of $1,066.00


3rd year $60,552.00 x 8.8% = $65,880 + Dividends of $1,127.00


4th year: $67,007.00 x 7.0% = $71,697.00 + Dividends of $1,215.00


Total: $72,912.00

Repayment option A: Upon graduation I would sell my position and repay the loan before the interest rates or payments were activated. Netting me a cool $22,912.00

Repayment option B: Make monthly payments on the loan with my extra income to widdle it down before graduation. The logic behind this is getting and investing 50k NOW vs saving and investing 50k over 4 or 5 years. I'm thinking about the Time Value of Money here. 

This growth is ONLY from the $50,000.00 loan and does not include my existing position in the SPY ETF or any other investment I am part of.


On top of this, the extra income I make from my GI bill benefits and part time work will be saved and invested (estimated around +$2,500.00/month x *8 school months* = $10,000.00 per year) into stocks, options, and other securities that I deem beneficial to my portfolio. 


**non-school months will be spent studying abroad or at an internship. This has been factored in and budgeted for**


What do you think? What have I not accounted for? What obvious financial truth have I ignored or missed or am simply not aware of? Please leave your feedback below with valid points as to why it’s a good or bad idea as well as other suggestions to wisely invest during my early twenties (Please don’t say TSP. That’s taken care of.)  Any and all advice is much appreciated!

521oih,2,2016-09-10,"I [25 M] need some advice from all you redditors, of how to proceed with my failed closure with [21 F] friend",throwaway-sadfs,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/521oih/i_25_m_need_some_advice_from_all_you_redditors_of/,"Full disclosure, before I begin with my post. I've lied about mine and my friends age in the title. Reason being is because I know she has a Reddit account, I don't believe she is an active user of Reddit, you just never know.
Ok, this is going to be a long story, full warning. My friend in this post, she will go by R. 


R and I have known each other for about two years now. When I met R (beginning of 2014), she had a boyfriend of 7 years at the time. However, when I first met R I really didn’t have any feelings towards her. I just thought she was someone cool to talk to do. Later on after we met, we started talking more and more, yet I still didn’t develop any real feelings for her, at this point I had barely started seeing her as a good friend. A few months after I met R, some Venture Capitalist guy (VC) had also met R. I forgot to mention R and I are both in college. 

Over the 2014 summer, R and I would have weekly (sometimes bi-weekly) lunches and we would text each other every day. I would enjoy talking to R as I felt I could talk to her about anything such as life, business, school, and future ambitions. Over the summer, R desired to go Town (I won’t state what Town is as that would be obvious), as she grew vastly interested in interning at Town and working there after college. R went to visit (Town) over the summer, she decided to stay with the VC guy she met. Now at that time, I still didn’t realize my feelings for R and only saw her as a friend. I did see that move as shady, because she was still with her longtime boyfriend and she had more than one friend who lived in Town, however she still decided to stay with the VC guy. Even though she had been with her boyfriend for 7 years, I could tell that relationship was going to end sometime soon, they just didn’t really have anything in common at that point. She broke up with him, while she was staying at the VC guy’s apartment.

We enter the end of June and R is back and we continue to have our lunches/texts. The way I discovered I had feelings for R was in at some party in July. I remember I saw some guy totally trying to hook up with her and I got jealous. Anytime the guy got close to her I would take her away, at the time I didn’t see it but she had zero interest in the guy, I was just too drunk to see that. Anyways that same night, I remember we were outside, I grabbed her hand and brought her close to me. I meant to kiss her… but I couldn’t, so instead I just held onto her tight. It’s not that I didn’t want to kiss her, I really did, however I didn’t want to risk it. I didn’t want to kiss and then only for her to kiss me back saying she just didn’t want to hurt me.

Anyways that same night, she got mad at me, not because of the party guy or me trying to kiss her. Its because she asked if I could hold onto her keys since she didn’t have any pockets. Needless to say it was one of those situations where I wouldn’t give her the keys. A few days went by without her texting me back. I finally saw her in person and just apologized which she accepted. However, this is where things started to change between her and I. We didn’t really have our lunches anymore and she would take forever to reply to my texts. Not only that, but when it came to texting, we would usually text each other, at this point I was doing majority of the texting and I would get late responses. 

Finally August comes and the school year, at this point I’ve become frustrated with me always texting her and receiving late responses. In the beginning of September (2014), I find out she is going out with the VC guy. So basically after this, I distance myself from her all of Fall 2014. We still talked, just not as much as we usually would. In comes Spring 2015 and I will admit, that semester I was a bit of a cold person to individuals in my life. Fall 2014 semester I had a bit of a crisis with school and family problems. During the Spring 2015 semester, R and I still texted each, again not as much though. However, the scripts had switched, R tried to hang out with me a with few times during that semester however I either made up an excuse or canceled on her last minute (really she only tried to make plans with me 2 or 3 times). Yes, I did do that by design and at times I wouldn’t text her back. While I did do that to her because I was being cold, I also did that because I officially wanted to get over her. Why? Because in Summer 2015 she was going to intern in Town and in Fall 2015 she was going to study abroad. I knew I wouldn’t see her for a year. So I was successful in that attempt (so I thought), I got over her and I didn’t say good bye to her in May when she left.

We talked to each other only like twice during her internship and never during her studying abroad. Over the summer she broke up with her VC boyfriend. Basically I didn’t see her at all after May 2015 until New Years 2016. I was excited to see her, mainly because she was in Paris during the terrorist attacks. I remember when those events had transpired, I promised myself I would fix my relationship with her when she came back. As imagining her dying made me realize how much I would regret never fixing that relationship. Now no feelings came back when Paris happened, I was just glad she was alive and safe. While I was excited to see her at the New Years party, I also wanted to avoid her. Mainly because I know how we both get with each other when we are drunk, we tend to bicker at each other. Anyways I didn’t talk to her for the first half of the night, the second half the night we did and it was a big mistake. I won’t go into it because this post is already a long one. If you do want know what happened, then please just let me know in the comments. After that night I realized something, the feelings I had for her had come back. I also realized I never really got over her, I had only suppressed my feelings.

Two weeks after New Years I shoot her a text saying I want to see her. I wanted to meet up with her because I wanted to verbally tell her how much I care and feel about her. Do you recall when I said she took forever to reply back? Well I was I mistaken, she would text me on average 5-8 hours later (Summer/Fall 2014 &amp; Spring 2015). In Spring 2016, she now takes days and even a week to reply to me. That really pisses me off because at that point why would anybody reply to a text? Anyways it took us 3 weeks to finally meet, either because we couldn’t find the time on our schedules or she would cancel on me last minute. Finally, when we met (February 2016) I felt like I had to beg her to meet me.

As I walked to the Starbucks on our campus to meet, I started to feel nervous, I literally had to stop and take a few breaths before heading to the Starbucks on our campus. I knew I hadn’t seen her in almost a year and I was getting nervous to talk to her. So basically our conversation didn’t go as planned and I became emotionally paralyzed. Below is our conversation.

R: So what’s up, what did you want to talk about?
Me: Look – we use to be close friends right? (My planned response from her was that she would mention how we use to have our lunches and text each other in 2014).
R:  I mean (confused look on her face), we use to talk to each other in [BLANK] meetings. ([BLANK] is the name of school organization we were a part of)

If you’ve been paying attention to my post, you know I have never mentioned [BLANK], that’s because I only ever saw her at two of those meetings. I really don’t how to explain it in written words so I’ll try my best. The fact that R said, “I mean (confused look on her face), we use to talk to each other in [BLANK] meetings”. Totally felt like I was stabbed by some sort of emotional knife. It meant she didn’t remember me as friend, she remembered me as an acquaintance. All those memories of us having lunch and texting each other way past midnight, were thrown out of her mind. While I did tell her how I felt about her, I couldn’t continue the rest of the conversation of what I had planned, I was too hurt and emotionally paralyzed at that time.

At the end before we parted I told her I wanted to see her before she left to Town (she got accepted a full time offer from her internship) and she told me to text her, I told her I didn’t have her number. After the conversation I was furious, mainly the purpose of that conversation was to have start the path of my closure with her. I was mad at her, but even more at myself. I was mad at myself because I couldn’t believe I was stupid enough to think that R would actually remember those memories of us after interning at Town and studying abroad. 

I was telling the truth when I told her I didn’t have her number (if you’re wondering how we communicated to meet up in the first place, I was using Facebook messenger.) However, I had no intention of reaching to her in any form of communication, I didn’t want to be the first one. I needed to know if whether she still cared about me as a friend and if she texted me just once to hang out. Then I wouldn’t mind putting in all the effort like I usually did. I just needed to know if she still cared about me as a friend.

In comes March 2016, it’s been a month since R and I last spoke, R out of the blue texted me. While I know I said I would be happy if she reached out to me first, I wasn’t happy about this text. She doesn’t text me to hang out, she texted me for a favor. Yes, I did get mad at her for our last conversation, however this specific text finally threw me over the edge with her and I was seriously just done. I’m fast forwarding to May just to finish this long post (again if anybody requests for the full story I’ll be happy to explain).

May 2016, on Facebook (events feature) she invites me to her graduation, at first I considered going. But when I went her list of who she invited I saw she also invited people she barely talks to anymore (R invited a total of 200 plus people on that event). I knew I was one of those people she barely talked to so I declined. Later, she went to an event that I was a part of, she comes up to me to say hi, however I was rather rude to her when she came up and said hi to me, I could tell I pissed her off. I wasn’t mad about it what I did, I wanted R to know I was done with her. A week after that I saw her at a mutual friend’s wedding. I didn’t expect to her to say hi to me as I was rather rude to her at the previous event I saw R. However out of the blue she came up to me and said hi. I’ll be honest that caught me off guard and made me feel bad for our last interaction. A week goes by and I text her if she wants to meet. At this point I only have three weeks before she officially moves out of state. I wanted to meet again just to tell her how much she means to me and that I’ll miss her.

When I texted her I fully prepared for R to take forever to text back. R responded in one hour or two, so that threw me off. I immediately texted her because I want the same thing to happen that happened in February (taking forever to meet). I texted her on a Monday and she told me Wednesday would be a good day for her to meet, she didn’t confirm with me though. She didn’t reply to my text until Tuesday night, saying Wednesday wouldn’t work out. Again, that pissed me off and I told her.

Me: I’m just trying to see you before you take off. I’m not going to go back and forth with you like in February. Let me know when you make time.

R: Ouch, ok. (This was also the fastest she ever replied back to me as she replied within 10 minutes)

That ladies and gentlemen was the last conversation I had with R that was in May 2016. I reached out to her a few days later restating what I said in a gentler manner, however she never texted me back. My question to all of you is what should I do? Should I let this go or reach out to her find the closure I never found? I still care about her deeply, but the truth is I’m tired of being hurt by her and me looking like the bad guy. She does live out of state now, so I won’t be seeing her in person anytime soon.


I thank you in advance for reading this post and sharing your thoughts.

  **tl;dr**: Basically I fell in love with my friend of two years. Things changed between us and that relationship was left in a bad state. She has moved states and I don't know if whether I should reach out to her for closure or just let it go."
521qky,196,2016-09-10,"Terminate my offer based on bullshit heresay? You picked the wrong person to fuck over, bitch.",herpderptheslurpderp,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/521qky/terminate_my_offer_based_on_bullshit_heresay_you/,"All right, so I have been spending a LOT of time thinking of how to explain this story without giving revealing details. Unfortunately, I don't get to be as specific that I'd like, but most of the juicy parts are still here. 

So, in my last internship, I worked for a really awesome tech company (it's one of the popular ones out west), and had one of the greatest experiences of my life. I learned so much from my manager, and delivered a finished project that was so good they incorporated it fully to be utilized by the whole company for future product development (it was a manufacturing/testing optimization kind of project). 

It started out difficult, and my manager (Brian) told me that himself that I'd struggle, but with perseverance and confidence, I'd deliver. HIS manager (Wes) was the one who made the decision to hire me in the first place, and he wanted me on this project. Long story short, it worked, I put in so many hours (70+ hour weeks in my last month there), but Holy shit, just finishing that made me so proud. My exit interview was basically Brian giving me advice on what I should do next with my skillset, since unfortunately he could only take interns after I finished my last year of school, and I was looking for a full time job. Again, Brian is the greatest person I've ever met, and I've learned so much from him. Fuck, I miss working there. 

So, with that background, here's where shit gets interesting. I interviewed with a startup a few months into my final year that created products for a different area, but still required someone with my science background and manufacturing/test experience. I was excited, because I knew a LOT about the kind of products that these guys were designing. In fact, I actually made a cheaper and clunkier version of one of their products for an open ended projects class (minus the cloud storage, infrastructure, and really expensive sensors, cuz I only had 50 bucks). After I flew out there, had an intense five hours of interviews, I felt confident and ready to provide some expertise while also learning so much from these guys (they brought in a lot of experts in industry to start this company, so even if it failed, I'd learn so much from them). 

A few months later, after I already signed my offer and started looking for places to live, I got a call from my future boss, Travis. Travis tells me that he heard from a previous employer of mine that I'm not able to deliver on time and because of that, they're going to end my offer. I was shocked. I asked him for more information, as that sounded nothing like me, and he said he wouldn't give me any more because of confidentiality. I told him to talk to my manager, Brian, from my most recent job, as he'd be able to give a good reference and proof of my skills. Travis ended the call by saying that it was that employer who gave him this information, and told me to consider a larger company, as they move slower and ""will give me time to learn how to work."" I was shocked. Shattered. I genuinely thought I was fucked in the head for thinking my last job with Brian was my best. 

I needed closure, and that's when I called Andrew. Andrew was a full time engineer who mentored me for the first two weeks during that job, and I asked him to tell me why my project sucked. He asked me what the fuck I was on, and that my project was well received. I told him the situation, and he got pissed. Like, I could hear him breathing more heavily on the phone, because this can potentially affect our team's reputation if someone gives false information. He told me to focus on finding a new job while he talked to Brian. 

This is where it gets good. Brian sent me an email apologizing about this situation and that Travis was full of shit, since he never got a call from him. He reminded me of our exit interview and my final presentation, encouraging me to focus on the future, and gave me his phone number in case I ever needed to use him specifically as a reference. 

I thought it was done there, but it gets better. Brian talked to Wes, and this resulted in a meeting between then and a couple other managers in the company, discussing potential legal action. But since everything was based on word of mouth, and I had no recorded evidence, they couldn't push forward. This whole part I only found out recently, because during this time, I was finishing my degree and interviewing with other companies to figure out my future. Thankfully, I bounced back (much better than I thought, luckily) and got a great job with another amazing manager. 

So where's the revenge? Well, it turns out that the person that talked shit about me was Cunt, one of the engineers on my team during that internship. He left the company to join this startup a few months after I signed, and left on good terms with Brian, where Brian even said that if Cunt didn't wind up doing well, he was always welcome back to the company to his team. 

Well, it turns out that Brian and Wes found out that when Cunt joined, he clearly talked shit to get them to drop me (I still don't know why this was done). Brian and Wes then made a personal note on his name, along with notifying many of the other managers in the company (it's a large company, so unfortunately not all) about this employee. 

Now, I'm really happy in my new job, Brian and I catch up somewhat frequently to have random discussions where he would teach me so much about tech and life (he did this with me during the internship too, which is why I fucking loved him), and Cunt better fucking hope the startup actually makes it, because if not, he doesn't have a safety net. 

TL;DR Take two tostadas and microwave them for about thirty seconds. Then, prepare refried beans (and any other protein of your choice), making sure it's baked/grilled/whatever to your liking. Put the beans and cheese (and protein) between the tostadas. Add enchilada sauce, chopped tomatoes, and shredded Mexican cheese on top. Put it in the oven at 375 for about 10 min. Boom, you just made your own Mexican pizzas and don't need to go to taco bell.

Edit: Sorry about the confusion on the revenge. The revenge was that I was the one who found out and told Brian about Cunt initially (a friend of mine works at that startup luckily and didn't know about the situation). Then, Brian and Wes looked into it and came to the conclusions regarding what he said about me."
52467n,2,2016-09-10,Ambition,theOmnipotentKiller,theOmnipotentJournal,https://www.reddit.com/r/theOmnipotentJournal/comments/52467n/ambition/,"Ambition is intoxicating, empowering, exciting and, above all, the best motivator.

Ambition provides a ginormous impetus to the ideas lying dead in your mind. A problem that I am personally sick of hearing (from myself included) is: how do I convert my thoughts to action. I had always approached this seemingly intimidating problem through conventional means. ""Maybe it is because I don't plan meticulously. Or perhaps, I don't possess the **courage** or **grit**."" If you have followed this journal long enough, you will realize that to me every problem is a function of your courage and grit. Each and everyone of my approaches distilled the problem further till I hit this roadblock which I hadn't been able to scale for a while.

My most crucial realizations in the quest to solve this problem have been:

* Humans make decisions based on emotion; not logic.

* Courage is required to start. Grit is required to continue.

* Boredom/Ability to do deep work is the sole way of developing grit.

* Courage stems from the unique personalities and motivations of each person. The fact they hit upon this question means it is a matter of time before they develop enough courage to go ahead.

Haha I think I just summarized my summer vacation in 4 points. 

Like every diabolical product, the solution to this problem requires an essential element.

After my short experience in college and watching Pablo Escobar in Narcos, I have discovered the Secret Element X: Ambition.

I have been running around this problem in the wrong way. Most people strike upon this question once they feel an inkling of ambition. Which was true in my case as well. However, I was so focused on the technicalities of moving from thoughts to actions that I forgot the reason I even started my conquest. 

Ambition!

The word itself makes my heart churn in excitement. The unrivaled source of courage and the invincible symbol of any personality: ambition.

Till now I believed that I have been calling the students at IITB uninspiring because of their personalities (or lack of it). After meeting a sufficient amount of people, I realize that what bores me about IITians is their lack of ambition.

You are in IIT Bombay. God damn it! If you won't have ambition, then who else?!

That's what Saarthak showed me. He showed me what it is like to meet a man with high ambitions. I swear I could have pledge my life in his service when I first started talking with him. The way he would use my resources and skill set would make me feel that I was causing a disruption in this world. Though quickly enough, Saarthak became the closest friend I have ever had. Now I want to match his brazen mindset and blinding set of accolades, but in my flashy way.

For me life has been all about doing it the flashy way. It is not that I do it for the way people view it; though I won't lie I enjoy the amazement on their faces. I do it because that's how it always been and it is my way of life.

Rapping, Astrophysics, Multiple Schools, Self Help Addict, Anime-Manga-Chinese Novel Addict, Passionate Writer, Japan-o-phile, Vedic Math, Speed Reading, Fast Typist.

There has been an unsettled feeling in my heart whenever I don't follow the conventional methods. Now I realize that is fine. Too long my ambition has been burdened by worries too small.

What is my ambition?

My ambition is to leave waves so big that they disrupt every place I pass by in my life.

At my last institute, I grabbed an International Astrophysics medal.

Institute before that, I rapped. I topped Olympiads.

These waves haven't been as large as I wanted them to be. I will reach for the stars this time. College is a paradise of opportunities. The world is an even bigger forum for it.

As my ambition is becoming clearer and clearer, I have understood a couple of things.

* Majoring in Business is a must

* Self learning/Majoring in CS is imperative now

* Jump into research as soon as possible

* Start working on my start-up idea (more on this later)

---

Immediate To-Do:

1. ~~Email the professor I am interested in working with~~ [Completed]

2. ~~Set up a Meeting Agenda for the next time I meet up with the co-Founders~~ [Typing this was fun]

Long Term Goals:

1. Branch Change to CS or University Change to Stanford

2. Start a proper Entrepreneurship Club in IITB. The E-Cell here is useless as far as I can see. I guess I will approach them for funding later.

3. Collaborate on 4 Research Papers before leaving IIT/College

4. Intern at a CS Startup, ~~a Consultancy~~[My father said this would be a huge mistake], Caltech = CCC. (Lol)

5. Convert one course every semester to a MOOC

Ambition. This time I am not going to compromise. I am going through with everything I have mentioned.

This has happened multiple times in the past that I have made over-ambitious plans before/during exams and never followed up on those. This time there isn't going to be a chance I won't.

I am done with being incompetent. Academics in my institute is incomparably easy. They require diligent attention and a sharp intuition- both of which I have. I am going to fine-tune my system to a point at which it will be so efficient I will gape in awe at my own awesomeness.

PS

It might seem that I have been milking myself in this post, but this journal was created for me. If I am able to follow up to this dream, then this will help others who might find my entire self-journey."

Skipping over the fight. I 100% want to be free of them. I haven't had a chat with them about it yet. They are refusing to speak to me.


They pay for everything essentially right now of mine:
Car, insurance, rent, vet, sometimes groceries.

So I know chopping them off I have to potentially lose all of this.
Easier said than done.

My situation:
I'm 21 and enrolled full time in college as a junior in computer science. I work as a small-time cook making roughly 160$ for only 2 weeks pay, clearly, this won't cut it.

+ My rent is 409$ a month 

+ 25$ for internet. 

+ I pay roughly 60$ for gas, but that might be snipped out if I lose the car. At the end of the day, I can see I need more money.

+ food is around 50$ a week.

I just got a refund check from school for 1,700$ that went into my account which has my name on it, but my parents are the primary holders of the account. Do I have legal right to transfer that money to my new bank account I just opened up?

Also, the money came from veterans benefits that my step-father passed on to me for college, so morally it's their money, but they are cutting me off for standing up for myself, so all I care about are legalities.
*need this answered asap, I'm sure once my parents see I have this money they will try to take it away from me to make it harder to be independent, aka, force me to come back and listen to their rules.


None of my family wants to argue with me about anything, they want to assume they are right and that's that, I see this as immature. They are not willing to have a sit-down conversation with me and talk adult to adult. Even if they do it's not long before someone's feelings get hurt, usually theirs.


I'm filed under them as a dependent on taxes, otherwise, I'd owe money on taxes, which I will have to deal with obviously.


So what should I do?
I'm trying to get an internship set up for next summer, hopefully, start working on my career. I feel I NEED to finish college, and am okay with taking out loans to cover my ass in the regard. But as far as living goes, what should I do now?


edit: It feels like I'm going to be in trouble, and may not be able to pay rent eventually, other than credit score, what else should I be worried about? If I'm broke and can't pay rent, what stops me from moving into a friends house for a few months.

We instantly hit it off and became good friends. We went to different high schools 4 years ago but reconnected through fb about a year ago and I could say now he's one of my closest friends.

This past year we've been texting almost 24/7 and we've met a few times. But after cancelling one meeting a few months ago, I felt as if something has changed. He stopped starting conversations and if I didn't text him, we would just stop talking for weeks at a time. 

Lately he's been insisting on meeting with me but I couldn't because each time he asked I was either out of the country or out of town. 

Yesterday I texted him about a funny thing that happened at a kindergarten (I have an internship) and asked if his day/week was also interesting. He responded immediately and told me a story about him and his girlfriend.

After asking him why didn't he tell me about her earlier he said he wanted to tell me in person. They have been together for a couple of months. I figured that they got together at the time he stopped talking with me as often as he used to.

Should I step back and stop texting him? He doesn't text me first now and I feel like I'm a bother now that he's in a relationship. 

I've also developed a mild crush on him a few months ago (I've cancelled that meeting because I wanted to sort out my feelings) but it doesn't really matter now, I guess.

A few years ago I lurked in this subreddit and started to do some research around cigars. Back then, being able to afford cigars was out of the question (probably because I was 16 I believe), so I just got a (very) small humidor, which waited on a shelve until recently.

And so now I stand there, having finished my first internship as a fisherman, and I got paid for the work I've done. Came as a surprise, but with that I was finally able to afford something that's been sitting in the back of my mind for years. I finally got a good bunch of cigars. Now it's sitting in my humidor, and it's just waiting to be smoked whenever the time permits it.

I could tell you what I bought (Nah I just don't remember), but why bother when I got **[pictures](http://imgur.com/a/5fUvD)** ? *Threw in a bonus photo, the last day of my internship/work*

And I'm not sure if the choices for my first cigars were the right one, but I've been to a place where the woman selling them seemed very knowledgeable. And the place is gorgeous, they got a shitton of tobacco-related products (so I don't list everything), the look is very clean, quite big... It's just the way I wanted it to be, really.

Anywho, I hope this sunday will be bright, I'd like to smoke one before autumn hits Brittany hard. 

Thank you for existing and keeping this idea in the back of my head all this time. Have a great day.

The quick story is that he's been ""absent"" for about a year and then he had an affair with another woman. 

I tried to make it work. We went to counseling. But he never stopped talking to his little girlfriend (a different girl.) So at that point I tried to move on.

I graduated in may and then finished my internship. Then I broke. I ended up on medication to help with anxiety. I gave him so much of me.

But I'm trying my best to build myself. I've learned so much about self love and self worth. 

I've actually tried to have some kind of relationship with him so we've been very amicable towards each other. Talked with each other everyday. 

He saw all of his little girls. And I tried meeting guys. Everytime I met with one he pulled the ""I want to be with you"" crap.

It's really disgusting how he could tell me that one second but then have sex with a different girl the next.

Anyways, I know better now but he's cutting me off financially. I just got a new job and make decent money. Not as much as him. 

I am forced to get a roommate. But how can he break his vow and just walk away from his responsibilities?

I left my family and what I know and moved away with him. I wanted to spend my life with him. We worked together to end up in the home (renting) that I'm in now. 

I plan to meet with an attorney soon. I should've done it awhile ago. I guess I was waiting to see if he would even try. 

But do I have any rights to have him continue helping with bills even though he doesn't live here? "
525onh,4,2016-09-10,Negotiating Pay,eat_yo_fruits,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/525onh/negotiating_pay/,"Did a search and was actually surprised not to find a topic on this. Wondering if others could share their experience with negotiating pay. I have interviewed at two hospitals, 1 is unionized and the other is not. From my understanding it is more difficult to negotiate wages from a union, as pay is experienced based. I plan on trying to negotiate my wage through the hospital that is not unionized. I used AND's salary calculator and based on my area, education, and experience, it calculated I should be paid 25.96/hr (54,000 per year). However, I reviewed the Academy's ""Compensation &amp; Benefits Survey of the Dietetics Profession 2015"" and the 50th percentile for my area is 34.62/hr (74,000 per year), which is most likely heavily skewed by more experienced dietitians. I am wondering what a good starting point would be for me to begin negotiating? Any experiences/insights would be much appreciated as this is an area that I think our field is lacking.

A little background about me: I have a MS degree and recent internship grad from a largely teaching hospital that was heavily clinically focused. I received top notch training and feel highly confident I could step into a clinical position and provide value right away with minimal guidance. Biggest factor I feel like in terms of negotiating power is my lack of experience as an actual practicing RD, despite my excellent training from my internship."

At the time I was depressed, lazy and immature, and my GPA and overall motivation reflected that. I dropped out after my second semester and entered the ""real world.""

The real world, as it turns out, has consisted of part-time minimum wage retail and food service jobs because I lack both education and connections. I became sick of this and decided it was time to get my shit together.

I started at my local community college last year at the age of 23. I am involved with extracurricular clubs, studying hard (4.0 community college GPA with full-time schooling + two part-time jobs!), and have just been accepted into a Bachelor's program at my old university. I will be 26 or 27 when I graduate, depending on internships.

But my family - aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents - are always trying to get me to drop out. They say that it's too late for me and I won't stand a chance at competing against fresh graduates 4+ years younger than me. They also say that no employer would want to hire an inexperienced 26-27 year old. 

Normally, I would ignore their opinions. They live in a small, rural Midwest county where people have equally small minds (my parents moved away from there along time ago). But now my parents, my mom (45F) especially, has expressed similar sentiments. 

She says she worries that I'll drop out again or flunk out, or that even if I graduate I'll never be able to get a professional job due to my age. She worries that I won't be able to pay back my loans and she and my dad will be, in her words, ""stuck with you [me] forever."" My dad [48M] has also admitted in the past that he's deeply embarrassed his 20-something daughter is still living in the family home - although that's probably a separate issue. All of this has planted seeds of doubt into my head.

So I know that my education is very important and that I should absolutely continue it. My question is: how do I push their negativity aside?

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

527zr1,2,2016-09-11,I am drowning.,takgnur,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/527zr1/i_am_drowning/,"I'm feeling lost. I'm not here seeking sympathy or someone to fix my entire life. I just need to get this out of my head and into words. This will probably be a wall of text. 

Three months ago I lost my grandma. I know a lot of people hear that and automatically think 'oh but it's just a grandparent at least it's not your mother/father/cousin/sibling/whatever. But my grandma was and always will be my biggest inspiration and the only constant in a life filled with so much uncertainty (child of divorce, moved houses 13 times, met way too many of mum's partners, hostile relationship with dad). When she passed, I didn't get to say goodbye which to this day cuts so deep. But I haven't fully processed it because I've gone into denial: she lives interstate so this just feels like it's been a while since I've visited her. But it hurts. I could write about this for days. 
Anyway she was amazing at everything, a published academic, selfless humanitarian, avid churchgoer but not the preachy type, she just adopted the morals (I'm atheist) and the most loving family member you could ask for. But she was also tenacious and her will was so inspiring. So when she passed, I decided to get my shit together in her honour. I have had generalised anxiety disorder for most of my life and bouts of depression more times than I can count and I have always let it consume me, I finished a psychology degree last year and realised my passion lies in the environment so that went to waste, I was drinking and partying far too much, I was stuck in a dead end supermarket job and I had no savings. I could go on but suffice it to say; pretty well every aspect of my life was in shambles. 
So I started seeing my psychologist again and started taking medication. I applied for a masters degree in environmental policy &amp; management, and I got in. I stopped drinking and using other substances and I'm still going strong. I saved a few thousand dollars and I started mending my relationships with my family. Five weeks into my degree I landed my dream research internship helping a humanitarian organisation go carbon neutral. 
Everything was on the up, but I'm exhausted. I'm juggling working part time, the internship, the volunteer work I do weekly, and Uni. Plus somewhere in there I have to fit a social life and family time. 

And then I met someone. Three weeks. It took three weeks for him to walk into my life, go from friends, to more than that, to sleeping together and spending every second night with each other, to walking back out. We'd met each other's parents because we live at home. I adore him. But he is emotionally unavailable so two days ago, we called it off. He's not ready and we are both so torn because the only factor that is an issue is timing. They say if you have chemistry all you need is timing. But timing is a bitch: basically, my life is an ode to that saying. I love him. I think that's the problem. It's not necessarily that I'm IN love with him, rather that I have such abundant, pure, unconditional love FOR him. I love the things he loves about me. I love the things that make him. I love how I feel when I'm with him. I love knowing I make him happy. I love how easy it was with him. I don't know how to let go of that. I don't know if I can let go of him. 

And now, my grandfather has had a stroke. The doctors have already said they don't expect him to live (he also has bowel cancer, diabetes and numerous other health issues and this isn't his first stroke) and in his last will he requested a DNR, so we are literally here waiting for him to die. He's been unconscious for three days now, the 'death rattle' in his lungs grows worse with every minute that passes and his care is palliative. I can't believe we have to go through this again so soon. 

Right now, as I type this, I feel as though I am drowning. I'm suffocating. I have assignments due and reports to write and I've taken the last few days off work because I can't get out of bed so this week I'll be fucked financially. My entire family is so tense because of pop so we're all fighting and home is awful. I want to talk to my friends but I feel like none of them can give me the support I need. I just want to sleep for a month until all of this is over. 

Tl;dr lost my grandma, got my shit together, met someone beautiful, lost him, about to lose my grandfather and now I feel like everything else is falling apart. "

Decent / Decent Foundation

**Value Proposition**

DECENT is a decentralized content distribution platform that utilizes blockchain technology to ensure trust and security. The platform will be open source. Freedom from censorship, fair rewards for publishers and anonymity (if so desired) are mentioned as key advantages.

[Whitepaper](https://decent.ch/src/decent-whitepaper.pdf)

**Customer Segment**

Content producers, content consumers, miners (called ""Publishers"" by Decent).

**Technology**

The whitepaper is not yet entirely clear on the tech stack that will be used. Blockchain technologies are mentioned, Kademlia DHT and Bittorrent for content distribution. Apparently, parts of the software are already in development.

**Team**

The company mentions a Swiss and a Slovak office. There are three Founders: Matej Boda, Matej Michalko and Wayman Kwan. The core team consists of 13 persons total, plus four ambassadors and four advisors. 

**CV Matej B (from their website):** Matej was always interested in new technologies and future progress. During his studies at the Technical University in Bratislava he took an internship in BMW Munich as a technical concept creator. Although his background is in applied mechanics, he became involved in blockchain based technologies in 2013. Fascinated by the decentralized protocols, he was interested in the cryptocurrency mining at first. Since then he has supported the community by helping to organize events such as Central European Bitcoin Expo Vienna and Bitcoin 2 Business Congress Brussels, advising on mining technologies and discussing future possibilities for blockchain. Currently he is focusing on the main project – DECENT platform – he co-founded.

**CV Matej M (from their website):** Matej’s interest in online privacy was fueled first while studying Computer Science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne where he completed a project concerning the privacy protection of mobile phone users for Nokia Research Center. Since then he became more and more involved with Bitcoin. Mining at his own laptop in the beginning, then organizing cryptocurrency conferences around the world (Austria, China, Belgium, UK, …). He also founded the first Bitcoin Marketing agency in the world. Matej has operated from multiple countries, including the UK, Isle of Man, Switzerland, Slovakia or China. Since the beginning he is passionate about the immense potential of blockchain technologies. Thereby, he founded DECENT last year.

**CV Wayman Kwan (from their website):** Wayman Kwan is a venture capital investor partner of Elements Capital LLC, USA. He was responsible for the business development, financing and promotional activities in several international companies. He founded a private information services team providing finance and investment advice to the companies around Asia and became a partner in Malaysian and Chinese Joint Venture. He is a well-recognized investment advisor and also participates in many other non-profit and charitable organizations such as Rotary International, Negeri Sembilan Royal Anti-drug Association and Malacca Shooting Association.

**ICO offering details**

ICO starts at 1:00pm GMT Sunday, 11th of September. Duration: 8 weeks.

70% of the total available DCT (""fuel of the network"") will be distributed initially, 30% will be made available to miners later on. Of the initial distribution, 10% of the tokens go to the Decent Foundation, 2% go into an ""Investment Fund"", 1'000'000 go to the bounty program, 3'000'000 go to the marketing program. The rest is sold in the ICO. I did not find the total number of tokens to be created, only percentage numbers. Sale starts at 5000DCT/BTC (+50% bonus on the first day, up to 10M DCT), going down to 3000DCT/BTC over time. 

**Update:** Decent just reiterated that ""The final amount of DCT will be determined by ICO results. DCT distributed during ICO will represent 70% of the total DCT ever issued."" on Bitcointalk. I find the combination of relative and absolute numbers a bit confusing, but in the end, 70% seems to go out to ICO participants (plus the devs), 30% to miners. 

**Update 2:** Decent made the 50% bonus ""dependable"" by removing the 10M cap and prolonging it until today (September 11th), 11PM GMT. Good reaction.

Everything that I never had in high school.  
I helped people too. I made sure I made it a safe and welcoming community. I made sure everyone was able to voice their opinions freely and that everyone got along well.  
Things were good for so long. 

That was all until this one asshole whom I thought was a friend went and stabbed me in the back.  
He started talking shit about me behind my back and taking all the credit of all my hard work that I had put in to making sure the group was a fun, fair and safe place for everyone.  
They ended up kicking me out and ostracising me from the group that I had spent more than 5 years of my life building. 

5 years of blood, sweat and tears.  
5 years of working 80 hour weeks. 
5 years of getting paid for a 40 hour week at minimum wage. 
5 years of lost friendships. 

I had dedicated my life for 5 years to the community of this company, only to be shafted and given nothing to show for it.  
I put my life on hold and missed out on so many things because of it.  
I missed out on going to college because I didn't have the time to go. 
I missed out on my dream job to work an unpaid internship. 
I missed out on countless chances of seeing family for the last time because I had to work while the backstabber was able to go home early just because he felt like it. 

The schism happened earlier this year. 

Between then and now has been nothing but a roller coaster.  
I've attempted suicide at least six times, almost succeeded twice. Was homeless for a few months. Was less of a shell of a human being.  
However I've finally found a job after searching for more than half a year, managed to get a house, fixed my relationship with my partner and am slowly becoming more stable. 

The only thing I'm missing now is friendship. 

Since the incident, I only have three friends. 

One of them hasn't spoken to me in over a month even though I try and make conversation all the time. 

Another has slowly started shutting me out by giving me short and abrupt answers and no longer reciprocating any conversation. 

The other is stuck with me because we live together, but I feel like they're only with me because they feel sorry for me. 


So that's my life in a nut shell.  
I don't know why I made this post.  
I just feel like I'm useless and so easily forgotten and wanted to vent. 

Thank you for reading this, it means a lot that someone has taken the time to listen to me ramble.  
You don't even have to reply, just knowing that someone out there has taken the time to listen makes me feel better. "

528wjr,26,2016-09-11,Are my parents narcissists?,Syfygirl16,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/528wjr/are_my_parents_narcissists/,"I need to know, I was here last year but I'm not sure I was ready to hear it.

My parents are not physically or verbally abusive, but I think they're emotionally abusive.

* my mom always reminds me that I messed up my first 2 years of high school by not taking electives.
* they both always tell me they can't pay for my college, when i've told them both i've never expected them to pay for it. In fact my dad got angry the one time I told him my plan to get through college without debt or his help.
* they tell me all the time about how I hate them and don't love them and I don't spend enough time with them.
* When I came to theconclusion that I'm an atheist my dad asked if I got off to deqd bodies.
* I've overheard them talking about me before and they've said that I'm a narcissist, that I enjoy the pain, etc.
* I have severe clinical depression and I've probably had it most of my childhood, they finally took me to our doctor at 16 aand they said tney knew for about a year, but i wouldn't listen to them.
* When I told them I was transgender, my went off and did ""research"" and asked if I had sexual fantasies about imagining being a woman or got off to it.
* my mom always tells me not to blame her if I don't get anywhere because of highschool. (I'm homeschooled, so she's in charge of my education)
* whenever I do something good like coming in the top 17% on the SAT it's because of her, but if I failed something it's my fault (which it is)
* After I told them I was transgender they stepped up the usage of my birth name and gender and refered to me a lot by ""son"" and they knew it bothered me
* they talk bad about my friends and their friends and family when they're not around.
* my mom's told me before that i'm a ""horrible bigoted person who nobody likes"" and ""the most hateful person she has ever seen""
* if I disagree with my mom at all, it cascades into a fight (being her yelling at me and me sitting there shutting down, because I can't deal with people yelling at me and her getting angrier)
* when I go to the doctors, my dad comes with me and asks, ""do you want me to go with you"", I say, ""I don't care"", so I don't start anything, and he stays there the entire exam.
* when we go on vacation my mom finds some way to tell me I've ruined it for everyone.
* whenever I break one of their rules, they take all of my electronics and my communication to my friends and my hobbies.
* they almost kicked me out, because I'm an atheist, to live with my grandmother, but they said, ""we couldn't do that to her""
* When I asked if I could see a therapist my mom said, ""I guess I could dump all of you kids into a public school and pick up a job just for you"", I would have understood if she had just said we don't have the budget.
* a few months later (about 9 months?) they were looking for a therapist to ""help me with my gender problem"" and I asked some question I've forgotten and my dad picks up the list of therapists in our area, rips it in half, hands it to me and says, ""there, you can find your own and pay for it too""
* we're currently on vacation and the other day my dad got upset because I took a nap, which they told me I should, and I didn't wake up when my grandparent's came back from their hotel, even though they said they'd wake me up when my grandparents were coming back.
* my parents like to remind me how much I look like my dad and how manly and masculine I must be.
* I own about 30 pairs of clothes, about 4 of those are normal, the rest are for church, the only place I leave my home for.
* I loved playing my cello, they loved bragging about how smart I was and how fast I learned to play it to friends, you know and then a year later made me sell it after my teacher moved so they could pay for this really expensive math program
* they like to rag on me about how I'm always on my computer, even though that got me in contact with google for a scholarship possibility, a paid internship if I go to a university nearby, and a job right after graduation, which they say is do to my mom's teaching skills.

My mom's background:
Comes from an abusive family who were drug addicts and alcholics.
My dad's background:
Comes from a family where hise mom was ""emptionally unavailable"" and his dad cheated on her for romance, not sex.

Sorry I guess that was really long."

Unfortunately my GPA could be a lot better, and I couldn't secure an internship before graduation. 

I've been looking for employment since the beginning of the year and all I've had is a couple of phone calls with no interviews. I've attended networking workshops and resume critiques, where I've been told by recruiters that I have a solid resume (hard to believe considering the circumstances). The situation is really getting to me and I am starting to get really depressed. I feel that every day that goes by is just one more reason to make me undesirable to employers. 

I appreciate any advice towards becoming more appealing to employers. I realize there are many factors at play in my situation; maybe there's something I'm doing really wrong while job hunting?

Thanks for reading my rambling, I'll be open to any suggestions."
52atdw,3,2016-09-11,I [24M] failed/betrayed my girlfriend [22F] of 5 years by accepting a position,thrillthrillthrill,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52atdw/i_24m_failedbetrayed_my_girlfriend_22f_of_5_years/,"Dear people of /r/offmychest,

This is a throwaway account for obvious reason. 

First off, a little bit of background. I am a 24-year-old guy from France who finished college (MSc in Biotchnology) in 2015. 
I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend since I am 18 (she was 16) and it is my first serious relationship ever. She is currently completing her lat year in college before going to law school. 
We've been living together for a year and half in 2013-2014, partly supported by our respective families, but since my parents broke up in 2014 we moved back to our parents place for a while. 

After finishing my degree (summer/fall 2015), I was hesitant about starting a PhD or not (something that is very standard in my field) so I decided to tke one year to make my mind and I took a job that was offered in the lab in which I had done my Master internship. 
Since it provided my first 'stable' (only a few months) source of income, we decided to take a flat together again (we got it in february 2016). Before we took the flat, my girlfriend asked me if I had any plans to move abroad... This is where I fucked up: I promised my girlfriend that even if I was to do a PhD, I would find something in the area. 
Which was completely absurd to promise as I had no idea what I would do.  

So, we move together, take back our stuff that was stored in cardboards since 2014, and I don't think about the future at all. Actually, around mid-April I still did not know what I wanted to do and started to worry about not having anything after summer (the end of my contract). 
There is another important aspect here: my gf is still studying so I pay for the whole rent+bills. We were supposed to benefit form some housing financial help from the state but as I type those lines nothing happened. Everything combined was about 60% of my income and I'm stressed out regarding money issues since we moved here...

So, as I begin to be worried, I decide to apply to 'big' PhD programs, just by blind luck, convinced that this would lead nowhere as I'm not a top-class student form a top-ranked university. I actually applied to 2 programs, each time at the very last minute and with very sloppy application files... I really feel ashamed about that. My other option was t apply for a PhD with my current boss, which was OK (but not so great, and I was not passionate about the subject, and I don't really like the way he works). 
Still, by an unlikely event of luck, one of my applications led to an interview, which I enjoyed (I don't know why I had a rush of confidence during it) and at the end of it the guy was ready to give me the offer. He gave me a few weeks to think about it and let him know if I want the job.

And this is where it gets really messy... The lab for this PhD is 300 km away from our flat with my gf, in a neighbor country (Belgium). I will have to do three internships in France, Norway and Spain (a few months each), something that I was dreaming about (being paid to study and travel around Europe). 
It is a really promising opportunity (top university -at least in life sciences- in which I would have no chances to enter if I was not that lucky, one of the best fellowship I could obtain in Europe). 

I eventually told my girlfriend (after days and nights of worrying about her reaction) that I had this opportunity and that I wanted to go. 
I decided to accept the position (a bit in a whim, something like 2 hours before the deadline for my answer). 

This decision completely destroyed the relationship: 

* My girlfriend feels betrayed as she took this flat to be with me, and only a few months afterwards I tell her I will to leave. Even if I told here that we could keep the flat, I would still pay for it, and I would visit her 2 WE a month as I only need 4 hours of travel, it's not the same...
* When I told her parents about that, they completely freaked out and told me I betrayed them (at the time her father lost his job, but he found a new one now) as they had helped with the flat (buying stuff for their daughter, helping to move stuff around). They were so upset they spent a few hours telling me everything negative they had been thinking about me for all these years (including things about my parents, friends, family). 
* My girlfriend does not want to be engaged anymore does not trust me anymore
* I cannot believe how selfish I've been when I decided to go for it, I'm really disgusted with myself.But I cannot help to think things like 'it's better to do these things now than when we have children or a mortgage', or 'it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' or trivial things like that.

Still the starting date (october) approaches, day by day. I have a lot of documentation to do, mails to send, files to complete and to find a flat there, and I feel unable to do any of these things, especially when my girlfriend is around. I'm so ashamed I cannot even do that properly.

Any advice or comment on this whole situation is welcome. 

**TL;DR:** I'm an asshole that moved in with his girlfriend of 5 years only to tell her that I had the possibility to do a PhD 300 km away from where we live. 
Guilt, fear and doubts make me unable to complete any of the tasks I have to work on before starting. "
52b536,3,2016-09-11,Mom turned covert flying monkey,ripestpeach,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/52b536/mom_turned_covert_flying_monkey/,"So I think I've posted about this before but ever since leaving my Naunt's home to live with my boyfriend, my mom's been increasingly distant. 

I would tell her about all the emotionally abusive stuff Naunt was doing and my mom would console me but remind me to ""just let it roll off your back, she's just intense,"" which worked for a while but eventually didn't cut it. 

After I moved out, my aunt sent me a couple nasty emails but that's it. She of course told my cousin and my mom about what had happened and the flying monkeys started in. I held my ground while also respecting their desire to continue a relationship with Naunt and the campaign to have me make up with her diffused quickly. 

Over the past month and a half though, my mom (who lives in a different state for reference) has gotten increasingly distant and when we do talk, she underhandedly finds ways to disapprove of most everything I do. I'm about to graduate with a bachelors degree, am working at a great internship but all she wants to do is criticize everything I'm doing, as if it's simply not enough. She openly admits to talking to my aunt quite often, even though for the two years I lived with my aunt, my mom was completely ignored by her. Now suddenly that I'm not there, it's like their best friends. 

My mom's a hypochondriac and has recently been acting up more than usual with that (having an ambulance pick her up at a restaurant, refusing to let my dad drive her to a hospital and then being rude to the multiple doctors telling her nothing's wrong with her). I'm annoyed by this behavior but now she has this added negativity when we talk. I snapped a little today on the phone with her and told her to stop asking me so many questions and criticizing me because I just wanted a pleasant conversation with her and she hung up on me, screening my texts and calls afterward.

I feel like my aunt has had a huge impact on her somehow recently, though I could just be paranoid. I guess this is sort of venting but also, has anyone experienced anything similar? I didn't think my own mom would turn against me..."
52bcj9,8,2016-09-11,I [26M] feel like my GF [25] of three years always puts me last,MasterLenor,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52bcj9/i_26m_feel_like_my_gf_25_of_three_years_always/,"Evening guys, 

Me [26 M] and my GF [25] are dating now for almost three years now. For two years now we are living in a long distance relationship (I took an job offer in the UK and she lives in Portugal). For a year now I feel like she always puts me last. She just spent 7 months in the States for an internship and after her stay there she only planned 4 days for me to see each other before going back to university to start graduate school.


Please, do not get me wrong. I really appreciate it that she is going to graduate school and I think it is really important these days to be supportive in a relationship regarding such topics. But to be honest, I was a little disappointed that she only planned to see me for four days after we haven't seen for four months (I visited her during her internship in the states - just to avoid any confusion). 


After the four days of her stay I made a trip to Portugal to visit her and her family and stayed for about 10 days. This was like three weeks ago. In total I spent all my vacation but two days for her for this year. I'm trying to save up those two days to see my family in my home country during christmas. 


It is not about the money, her family is quite wealthy and I do not have any problems to pay for her flights (which I actually already did a couple of times). I always try to make time for her, ALWAYS pick her up from the airport and ALWAYS bring her to the airport when she leaves (and thus do overhours at work to do so)


I feel like this might all be a little confusing so I try to narrow it down in a simple way:

- during her internship in the states, I went through hell. She barely wanted to talk to me, never replied texts when she was out (because her 'phone died' or she 'was out of data' or she 'did not have any network')

- we only talked during the weekends (and only when she really made time for me)

- our calls had a duration of like 8 to 15 min. - in the best cases 

- when I visited her in the states for about 2.5 weeks (to be there for her birthday) she only took off 2 days from work in order to spend time with me

- during that time I also found out that there have been two 'kind-of-dates' with other guys...(I went over it - enough said about that - 'water under the bridge')

- on my birthday I just got a quick call from her, because she was too tired (it was a Sunday)

- personal problems on my side as in serious sickness, stress, but also accomplishments did not really interested her


My current problems: 

- i feel like she does not want to make time for me so we can see each other

- the thing with the four day visit, after not seeing each other for several months 

- she also is now volunteering in another project of her university and will be in another country over christmas and new years (our 4 year anniversary). And I wasn't really sure what that means for her, because I feel she does not mind it - and obviously I do.



--&gt; to be a little more specific: From January this year on I feel like that I have done everything possible to talk to her, to see her, meet her and so on and did barely get anything in return. I literally feel like I 'run after her' for now 9 months by now. For me it is not only frustrating but it also makes me almost depressive every now and then (and I actually consider myself a quite happy person). 

What I would like to know is if I am overreacting. Again, please do not get me wrong. I really support her in her things regarding university and volunteering there at the same time. But I always feel like she barely thinks about our relationship or me in general and it just keeps me up at night and keeps my mind busy at work. And of course I know it is hard to handle such things (university in general, but also volunteering at the same time), while being in a (long-distance) relationship. Did anybody of every had similar issues and if so, how did you resolve them?

I really appreciate any help and input from you guys. Many thanks in advance!!!


TL;DR: relationship (mostly long distance) of three years in total, GF does not make any time for me, GF does not think about our relationship, feeling like she puts me last and I have to run after her in order to see her, question is if I am overreacting or if my feelings a justified and if so how to handle the situation."
52bcye,22,2016-09-11,"I don't want to do things in life. Not suicidal, but do not particularly want to live.",Meow_20,nihilism,https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/52bcye/i_dont_want_to_do_things_in_life_not_suicidal_but/,"So I am a fairly blessed young 22 year old woman, currently studying. All my life, I've been ambitious - studying for a good college, paying attention in class, applying to good universities for interns, pursuing personal projects etc. I have good friends and am good at cultivating personal relationships. 

However, I've been having this feeling for a while now, that life involves doing too many things. You have to apply to a university, study there, work a lot to publish a paper, or else work a lot and take a lot of stress to get a job, there's the stress to find a life partner (I'm gay), have kids, get a good house, provide for your family, provide for your parents, etc. There's a lot of thinking to be done, work to be done, stress to be taken. Don't get me wrong - I'm familiar with hard work, I've worked pretty hard for whatever I have in hand.

I just wish I could transfer all my blessings to someone who had more enthusiasm for life than me, and myself go into an early permanent slumber. The main reasons for me wanting to be alive are - my family and friends would be bummed if I were to die and I am blessed with good finances and health and opportunities, and it would be a complete waste if I were to not live. But sometimes I think, I haven't signed up to live life, I should be able to transfer my blessings to someone who truly wants to do things in life. The thought keeps visiting me late at night or in the shower.

I am wondering whether it is a reason to worry, or whether it is normal existential worry that hits everyone at some point. And if it is a reason to worry, what I can do to get back on track.  "
52c15f,7,2016-09-11,"Me [21 M] with my GF [20 F] of 3 months, I have no idea what I'm doing",LuckyConfusedBastard,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52c15f/me_21_m_with_my_gf_20_f_of_3_months_i_have_no/,"I'm 21 years old and until about 3 months ago, I had never been in a relationship. But, by some miracle, now I am and I have no idea if I’m supposed to be doing something I’m not or its already over. I have no idea what I'm doing.


I’m in a relationship with a very cute, nerdy, and funny girl. I met her last year through a roommate who had a few friends (including her) that went to a university around 30 minutes away from ours. These friends of my roommate would visit our campus every week or two. Over the two semesters that I lived with that roommate, I would hang out with him and his friends every once in a while. She was easily the nicest, friendliest, and most outgoing of my roommate’s friend group, and we became friends over time. 


Besides some fleeting moments where I noticed how cute or nice she was, at no point did I even think about pursuing a relationship with her. But randomly last April our friendship changed rapidly. I came home late to see my roommate watching a movie with her alone. They asked if I wanted to hang with them and I did. After the movie ended, we popped in another (both Harry Potter). My roommate called it quits halfway through the second movie and my girlfriend said she’d finish up the movie with me and go back to her university. Once the movie ended, we just hung out some more talking. I can’t even remember how it happened looking back on it, but all of a sudden she was on top of me and we were making out. It was so random and unexpected to me, but I went with it. I never made out with anyone before and I was enjoying it. We made out for a good 20 minutes then talked for another hour or so until she left. 


It was only after we made out that I noticed how flirty she was beforehand. Apparently the whole time it was going right over my head and I didn’t even notice. After I finally did notice I tried to flirt back. It probably came out as the most cringy thing anyone has ever read, but she said I was cute so hey. I saw her once more before the semester ended around 2 weeks after we first made out. When we were alone, she told me she was trying so hard to make “us” happen and I just said something along the lines of “I had no idea.” She laughed and we made out some more. 


That was the last time I saw her in person for a while. She went back home for the summer while I stayed in the city for an internship while rooming with the same guy (her friend). Over the summer would text not every day, but at least a few times a week. In July she came down to our city to visit us, my roommate blatantly and me secretly I guess. That was until she saw me, kissed me, and basically told my roommate we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I don’t think we even discussed it beforehand, but I wasn’t complaining. I grew to really like her. While she was here, we hung out a ton after I got out of work each day. We even went out on a sort of double date with my roommate and his boyfriend, which I really liked cause I would’ve been super nervous just with her. Overall it was a really good time. I enjoyed it and she said she was so happy to finally spend time with me. I guess that was the week we “officially” started dating.


Ever since then though, it seemed like everything became so much less flirty and fun. We still don’t text everyday but we do every few days. It seems like that’s just the norm for both of us. But since she visited, her replies are almost never flirty at all and a lot of the time are just one or two word answers. Even more so, I don’t think she has texted me first in the past month or two. It seems like its always me trying to make the effort. 


We’ve only been on a few actual dates, but it seems (at least to me) like its mostly me making the effort to set them up. I visited her home city during the last week of the summer to spend the day with her, explore, and get some food. I’ve visited her 3 times (once a week) since the semester started, once to get dinner and crash at her place, once to catch a movie and hang out before I left, and once more to order in some food and hang out before I had to go. For every one of these, it was me saying “How bout I come see you and we can hang out?” or something along those lines. 


I seriously just don’t know if there’s something going on or if it’s all in my head. Again, I’ve never dated anyone else and I don’t know what to expect. While she tried so hard to get with me while I was completely oblivious, in comparison I feel like the typical “Honeymoon phase” came and went super quick. I’ve really grown to like her more and more than I ever thought I would, but I just get the feeling she doesn’t care much anymore or I’m not doing something right. Or is this just normal? I’m really out of my element here. Any tips?

TLDR: Girl liked me A LOT while I was oblivious. We eventually got together and I've started to like her more and more but now I feel like I'm the only one trying. I have NO experience in relationships and need some help.

[Lengthy],BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52cdb4/m4f_looking_to_get_lucky_lengthy/,"*(Thanks to everyone who has responded to my previous roulette posts. I've decided to retool some things, and I hope you enjoy!)*

Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at , and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones

52cgdc,0,2016-09-11,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52cgdc/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

They have only started seeing each other in person for about 4 weeks because she had an internship over the summer in NYC. They aren't even official. Now that she is home....and I hate to say this..... she has been acting immaturely towards the whole situation. She expects him to text her back immediately, hang out with her more often and not cancel plans ever (even when he wasn't feeling well). If he doesn't do this she gets sad/anxious/nervous and talks to me about it. 


This is an awkward situation for me to be in because I am trying to tell her how to be successful and I don't know if it is helping at all. It puts me in a weird spot.

52cwrt,2,2016-09-12,Some insights on my plans to move to San Francisco?,kericat,AskSF,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/52cwrt/some_insights_on_my_plans_to_move_to_san_francisco/,"Hi, I'm currently in San Jose and have considered moving to San Francisco closer to 2018. I'm about to graduate and already have an internship at a commercial insurance company. I want to move into underwriting and San Francisco has a better market for that. I'm staying at this company for a year or so because I can live rent free and save to live in San Francisco comfortably by then. I also want more exposure to the job as well.

I'm trying to make predictions based on underestimating my starting income which at worst would be 40-45k. I also have a unit in San Jose that I'll be renting out when I'm ready to move so I can expect an extra $700-800 to supplement my income monthly. With that in mind, I wouldn't mine paying a little higher for rent.

I was browsing craiglists to get an idea of rent and it looks like $1400-1700/mo can get me a decent room. I have pets so I initially wanted to get a larger apartment with the money I'm saving and be the one finding roommates instead of the other way around. This is my ideal living situation but I was wondering if it's realistic since it sounds too good to be true. It comes out to a little under $1500 per person which arounds great: https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/5777665874.html

Also, is a car really that not that functional? I play a sport and I want to go to a specific gym to train in south of market and I'll most likely be traveling from the financial district. I probably won't be home until 8-9:30 pm on the weekdays and not being in my own vehicle makes me a little nervous since I won't know how far I'll have to travel to get home yet.

Thanks!"

I'm in my second year of college and currently looking for summer internships. Right now I'm applying to two major types of jobs: 

1. The deam jobs: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon... The one's that everyone has heard of, the jobs that you can find by searching ""top computer science jobs"" and that I have very very very little shot of actually getting.

2. Local jobs. CS jobs in my hometown and in my college town that I think I have a good shot of getting. I had one of these internships last summer, and while I did gain a lot of valuable experience, I would like to do something better for this summer.


So my question is this: What is the middle tier? Where do I find the jobs that aren't the Google-tier jobs, but that the Google-tier jobs will want to see on my resume? Obviously nobody is going to advertise themselves as mid-tier, so I'm wondering if anybody has been in a similar place to where I am now, and has any suggestions for searching.

Thanks so much!"
52dlbx,8,2016-09-12,Acres of Hope: A True Proposal for A Solution to Portland's Homeless Problem,pdx595,Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/52dlbx/acres_of_hope_a_true_proposal_for_a_solution_to/,"                                    Acres of Hope


I am sympathetic to both the homeless population of Portland (who are often unfairly stigmatized), and hard working residents of Portland (who feel that their tolerance of the homeless is being taken advantage of). My proposal to fix the problem is the establishment of Acres of Hope, a farm situated outside Portland whose workforce is comprised of homeless individuals currently living in Portland’s urban areas. 

Most homeless people do not want to be homeless, do not want to leech off of social services and do want to contribute to society. Knowing this, Acres of Hope workers would be individuals who volunteer for the program and would be taken to the Acres of Hope farm (outside the city). Their volunteered removal from the city would  help to ease tensions between their community and the housed residents of Portland, who are bothered by presence in the urban areas of Portland. 

Once at Acres of Hope, staff (the previously homeless individuals of Portland) would be housed and work for a small salary, learning important farm and life skills, including the humanistic values developed through cultivation, working with animals, and working towards a common goal with others. The food and products produced by the farm would be used to feed Acres staff, and the surplus sold to Acres of Hope partners. 

The farm would be run by Acres of Hope staff with oversight and consultation done by a leadership group comprised of experts from the the farming industry as well as Acres of Hope leadership staff. The performance of individual staff members would be rewarded with incremental promotions which would include small increases in pay as well as increases in responsibility over other staff and operations on the farm. The highest rung of the ladder would the group of leadership staff, each responsible for different operations at the farm. 

After 12 months (could be less) at Acres of Hope, Acres leadership staff would be evaluated on their performance on the farm. Those who demonstrated good behaviour and who operated at a high enough capacity over the course of the 12-month period, including during their time as Leadership Staff,  would then join work at one of Acres of Hope’s partners as part of a 6-month internship.  

Acres of Hope Partners would receive products and produce at a reduced cost in exchange for receiving and mentoring Acres of Hope staff at their establishments. The produce and products would be labeled as being from Acres of Hope, allowing for community members to easily target and support the work at Acres of Hope and its staff.  Potential internship establishments for staff could be supermarkets, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, etc. 

After completing their 6-month internship with an Acres of Hope Partner, they would graduate from the program, and begin their post program life, being assisted by Acres of Hope to find permanent work placement through a partnership with already established work placement agencies in Portland and the Greater Portland Area and partnerships with local farm networks. 

This network could be expanded as the project scaled, not just increasing the size of Acres of Hope in terms of the number of staff but also the number of locations. This network would eventually be made to include other social agencies, mental health care providers, drug abuse counselors,  and farmers networks across the state of Oregon to help with job placement. Staff would leave Acres of Hope with a regionally (or eventually, nationally) recognized certification, and the resources to find permanent work. 

There are endless areas of expansion that Acres of Hope could eventually offer. College students studying everything from psychology to sociology to nursing to education receiving college credit for volunteering at Acres of Hope, to members of community establishing after work courses for staff for evening after their day’s work was completed. Once established, the opportunities are endless. 

This is a pragmatic, humanistic and realistic solution to a problem that will continue to affect Portlanders for decades to come without creative solutions. A full proposal is currently being developed. I would love to hear feedback about people's opinions about the feasibility of such a program, if they would support something like it, or changes they would make to it. Thanks!  "
52dukp,9,2016-09-12,[Plan] I have a difficult personality,difficultpersonality,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/52dukp/plan_i_have_a_difficult_personality/,"Hey, I'd post on /r/socialskills but I'm not sure if that would help because most of the people there have the same problems... Also I cannot afford a therapist. If anyone can recommend a different sub for this, that'd be great.

I am not sure exactly why but I am not very likable (no okay, I have some idea). I am slowly drifting away from my friends. I don't connect with them and I am always the one initiating conversations. When I talk to them, they stop replying unless it's in person. Like, they wouldn't even read my message and disappear. The other night I was talking to a friend and she ranted and I sent a long reply and when she replied it was just one line and nothing else. Once again, I initiated that conversation. I told a friend about this and she said that it's because I never go out with them anymore, which is BS because when I did go out with them I'd get left out of things even if I try to connect with them. I've known them forever and they're nice people but I just cannot relate to them. One time, when I was hanging out with them and a friend had to leave, he said goodbye to everyone BUT me. It seems that they are closer to each other than they are with me. My best friend lives in England and she's the only one I am truly only close to which is weird because she moved to the UK almost 8 years ago.

Also, I have never had a job because of this reason. I did an internship but I felt very uncomfortable around those people and they kept pointing out about how awkward I was which made me feel more awkward. Also people do this giggle thing when they talk to me like they're trying not to laugh even when I'm being nice or making sense. Sometimes, when I do say something, I get no reaction.

Here are some reasons people hate me for:

* Shy, insecure, and I feel inferior to everyone. I feel like I deserve the shit I'm getting.
* Introverted
* Over-friendly - I don't really know when it's okay to start talking to people about what friends talk about or like asking them about their day and stuff.
* I rant to my friends a lot - I've stopped doing this to my close friends for about a year. I know they're not my therapist... but they still kinda ignore me.
* I don't know what else to say to people when they're talking to me about things. I ask them questions and react, but they eventually get tired of it I think.
* I react strongly when people disrespect me - like if their jokes are half-meant. But I am VERY sensitive though so I don't know if I should be offended by it or learn to make fun of myself.
* I don't believe in myself / very negative outlook on life. - Been bullied since forever even in college, raised by an overprotective anxious parent who nitpicked everything I did, and people never believed in me. So, I don't know how I can have faith in myself.

Growing up, I missed a lot of social events because my mom was and still is overprotective. So that's why I need to improve it. I'm 23 now and I want real genuine friends who I get along with but making friends as an adult is so hard especially to someone with social skills like mine.

Help me please improve on this."

I'm 27 years old 6'4 and I outright own a 2011 Chevy Cruze. I live in NE Ohio so we do get quite a bit of snow each year. I'm not a materialistic person, but I would rather spend more money on quality if it will make the product I'm buying last longer and run better.


I have about a 30 mile highway round trip commute each day for work (about 15 miles each way).


I'm looking to trade in my current car and buy another one in the next 4-7 months.



**Current Car Chevrolet  Cruze RS:**


-  68k miles. RS package. Candy Apple Red. Clean, Zero Accidents and only 1-2 ""dings"" on the doors. Other then that to me I've kept it very maintained.


- It's Small, I'm 6'4 and if I ever have to drive a group of people I normally take my wives car (2012 Chrysler 200), because I drive with my seat 100% back and there is zero leg room behind me.


- I didn't pick out this car. When I was in college I got an internship that was about 50 minutes away. My parents didn't feel save letting me drive a 1996 Lumina that many miles a day. So my father co-signed for me to lease my current car (Cruze) and by the time I graduated I was WAY over miles. So when my lease was up I just bought it outright. 


- From first to second gear SUCKS. I've always had complaints about the car getting from first to second gear, and every time I take it for a oil change I bring up the problem and they always tell me the same thing. That's it's a computer issues and there is no way to fix it. [This is an example of the review site where the top problem is what I'm complaining about.](http://www.carcomplaints.com/Chevrolet/Cruze/2011/transmission/). It's actually gotten so bad that my wife won't even drive my car anymore. In the last 4 months the car has almost gotten me into 4-5 accidents due to the acceleration. 





**New Car:**

- Something that's large and small at the same time. I really like the ""small car"" feel, like for parking and road present. Like the Cruze, I really like the outside size of it, but I'm a bigger guy so I need that extra leg room. So this is pointing me to a ""Crossover"" type car or a ""compact SUV"". I don't really feel comfortable driving Large vehicles. 




- Reliable I'm hoping to buy a car/suv and drive it until the wheels fall off. So reliability is probably #1 priority for me right now.
	

	
 - Kids, my wife and I are planning on starting a family in the next 3-ish years. So I guess we have to take that into factor.
 - Maintenance, I know very little about cars and their maintenance. So if anything goes wrong or I'm having trouble 95% of the time I'll take it into a shop.
		

- Snow and Winters. I live in NE Ohio (snow belt) so snow can be a problem. I know a lot of people say that AWD isn't needed but get snow tires instead. But I think in the long run AWD would be a good option to have.


- I'm not a car enthusiast. I see cars as a tool to get you from Point A to Point B.
 

-   Safety, I'm sort of a ""worry wort"" so safety is something I actually care about. So options like Brake Assistance, Blind Stop Assistance, the Active Cruise Control would all be nice to have if my budget can afford it. I guess it would be nice to test this out too before I thought about buying.

	
- Other features like Keyless Start, Heated Seats, and anything else related to cold weather. 


- Looks, I don't mind some ""old man"" or ""soccer mom"" look but I still would like it to look like a 27 year old mans vehicle.


- Price Under $30,000 But Preferably under $27,000. (How much % should a car be that you can afford, any good rules of thumb?) I'm hoping to trade in my Cruze, but I have no idea how much it's worth and I wouldn't mind putting more % down. I'm not a part of a credit union or anything so I'm not sure what my Interest % would be, but wife and I both have Excellent Credit Score ratings.     


- Nothing To big, In about 11 months my wifes car will be paid off and she's been itching to get a SUV. She said she totally regrets buying a car because she's always wanted a SUV. 



**TL;DR** Looks for a new/used Vehicle under $30k that would fit a 6'4 man, who is more worried about reliability and getting from Point A to Point B.


I know I wrote a wall of text. If you have any questions,comments or concerns please let me know and I can definitely get back to you."
52ets0,55,2016-09-12,My (25F) mother (60F) keeps ruining my visits home with her obsession with me working during them.,mildlycatastrophic,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52ets0/my_25f_mother_60f_keeps_ruining_my_visits_home/,"Hi Reddit! Longtime lurker, first time poster.

Basically, I'm a student who loves her family (divorced parents) and friends back in her hometown, which is several hours away by train. It's one of the greatest sadnesses of my life that I don't get to see them very much. I only get the opportunity to go home for a few days once every 3-4 months. Typically I'll get there late on a Sunday and have to return home on the following Thursday or Friday morning. I generally stay with my Dad and Stepmother (late 50s) when I'm there because I love my mother, but... as you'll see, she stresses me out big-time.

She has this outright obsession with trying to make me work during these trips. I'll see her for lunch on the Monday and sooner rather than later, she is guaranteed to start mentioning every single local place that is hiring, and trying to pressure me into applying for jobs at them. Even though I live several hours away in a different city, and am going back in a few days. When I mean she pressures me, she really packs it on. Her voice and body language change. I have problems with anxiety, and, well, conflict in general, and this REALLY upsets me and takes me a while to calm down. She's even gone up to the manager or staff of a venue while I've been in the restrooms, and I've come back to a member of staff enthusiastically asking if I have a resume and what are my available hours? 

I can't convey how hurtful I find this. If I'm working, I won't be able to spend any time at all with my loved ones. Most of these workplaces are bars or restaurants, with hours that don't go well with hanging out with people. She says I should be working every single hour I possible can to make money.

Doesn't she miss me when I'm away? I feel like she's telling me that she doesn't actually want to see her own daughter, that time with me means nothing. That my time with my friends and family doesn't matter, and is some sort of ridiculous luxury that I'm really spoiled for wanting. The worst time she did this was when I went to go live in another country on the other side of the world for the best part of a year (but at the time I thought I might be away a lot longer). I got on the plane on Thursday and on Tuesday she was trying to force me to get a job and work those last two days instead of packing my entire life up and saying goodbye to people I might not see again for years.

A few pertinent details - I'm in college a little older than usual, partly because I was unsure what to study and didn't want to potentially throw away a lot of money and several years of my life studying the wrong course. Secondly, I am financing my studies COMPLETELY on my own, through a combination of savings (from the years I worked before I started), loans and working 25 hours a week during the semester and as much as I can in the vacations.

I love my mother dearly, but she can be very controlling and doesn't seem to realize that I'm a grown adult. She's particularly obsessed with my finances (I try to give her as little detail as possible but that doesn't stop her thinking she deserves full disclosure) and my work. Now, I'll admit that I'm not as financially sound as many others my age. I don't have much in the way of savings, my income is low and I live in an extremely expensive city. But short-term, this is worth it to me - I attend a very prestigious university, and this city has an incomparable wealth of jobs, internships, training programs, etc., as well as basically being a world hub of the industry I want to go into eventually. It makes sense for me to be here. The longterm benefits outweigh the short-term drawbacks for me. I work very hard to make it work. This summer I've worked two jobs on top of reading for the semester ahead. I haven't celebrated my birthday or Christmas in two years because I've worked both events.I don't think I'm financially irresponsible or workshy. But my mother keeps telling me I am.

I mean, how would it even work if I did just take her advice? So, I spend all of Monday contacting employers, handing out resumes. Maybe Tuesday too. At the quickest, nobody is going to interview me before Tuesday, for start that night or Wednesday. I'll have to go out and buy work-appropriate clothes/shoes, because I don't take those home with me. And I'll only be able to work one or two days at the very most before I go home. How much money am I actually going to get out of this?

Also, I'll have to lie the entire time. About where I live, my education. I can't admit I go to my actual university because they won't give me a job knowing I actually live in a city hours away. They're not stupid. So I have to lie and say I attend local university. My references are all in my current city, so what do I do about that?  And then I have to work that job, knowing that very shortly I'm going to have to screw my new employer over by leaving them high and dry to go home. All for a very small amount of money, especially if I've had to buy certain clothes/shoes to work that job in the first place.

Am I in the wrong here, Reddit? Should I be working during my trips home? And if I'm right, how do I deal with my mother and get her to stop doing this? I've tried explaining everything I've said here to her several times and she just says I'm being stubborn and a spoiled brat.

TL;DR - I only see my family and friends for a few days every few months, mother trying to force me to work that time instead of seeing them."

Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- AnnaSophia Robb
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

We had a verbal agreement in the beginning of the internship where I would be paid $100 a week and get a $.35 reimbursement for every mile traveled to and from the events. After the first month of working there I did not receive a payment because I ""wasn't on the payroll"". After that I received pay bi weekly by check.

My main question is how do I go about getting the first month's pay and my mileage. I have mentioned it to my ""mentor"" several times but no steps have been taken to get me my pay. Should I go back and speak to him again or go directly to the owner? Does not having a contract that was written limit what I can do? I have proof of my employment there and that our aforementioned pay contract was set in place, just not fulfilled by the employer."

Shouldn't I have the hang of this now?

I thought I loved programming in college but now I don't know. I don't like working on large code bases (I worked at one of the big website companies as an intern and didn't like that either) which is a large part of working at a company.

52g6s5,16,2016-09-12,[UPDATE] Negotiated salary on entry-level job/lab position; offer rescinded. :-(,SnTTs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/52g6s5/update_negotiated_salary_on_entrylevel_joblab/,"I can't believe this happened. The boss himself said there is a ""small room for negotiation"" when he extended the offer.

The offer originally was for $28k for bachelor's with zero experience in an academic lab. I had a bachelor's and have 2 years part time unpaid relevant experience and 2 full time, paid summer internships with relevant lab experience.

I looked up various threads / websites on how to negotiate. I went on Glassdoor and Payscale and looked up averages for that particular position for the company. The average was about $31k-33k. People said to add 10% - 15% to the amount and attempt to negotiate with HR.

So I called HR and asked for $35k; expressed enthusiasm for working in the company, etc. They came back and said the boss would paid maximum of only $29k and if I wouldn't drop my ""requirement"", they'd consider other candidates.

Without hesitating, I quickly told them I'd be happy to take the $29k and I'd love to work for the company as it was a very good environment. I told them the $35k I counteroffered wasn't a requirement in any way and I thought they were open to negotiation (which I originally asked the HR too before naming a number).

5 hours later, received a call from HR letting me know that the boss has gone with another candidate and my offer has been rescinded.

I feel so sad and defeated. I've been dealing with depression for the past two years and finally feel like I am getting my act together and doing something with my life. The first offer was a god-send, even though the offer was low. I wanted to negotiate to an amount that would allow me to survive independently and afford the raising rent prices, but would have been extremely happy with a job in a good lab environment with a nice boss. I think the advice from internet sites regarding negotiating salary did not apply to entry-level lab positions in academia where I'm essentially dispensable.

I don't know what to do at this point. I have one other interview lined up and waiting to hear back from other positions, but I feel so down. Was I wrong to negotiate? Did I come off as arrogant? Was the amount I quoted too high? What should I do in the future to ensure this does not happen again?"

52gdjq,6,2016-09-12,Squidwards's Suicide,TheCreepyKiller,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/52gdjq/squidwardss_suicide/,"Since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I’ll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the Spongebob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premier that set everyone and everything back for several months.

Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be “Fear of a Krabby Patty” and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn’t final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as “How sex doesn’t work” instead of “Rock-a-by-Bivalve” when spongebob and patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card “Squidward’s Suicide” we didn’t think it more than a morbid joke.

One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidard practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear Spongebob laughing outside and Squidard stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. Spongebob says okay and goes to see Sandy with with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward’s concert. This is when things began to seem off.

While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn’t (at this point sound is synced up with animation so yes that’s not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight mummuring in the crowed before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malace in it. Squidward’s in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with Spongebob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn’t the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people’s eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at eachother, obviously confused, but since we weren’t the writers we didn’t question its appeal to children, yet.

The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn’t very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It’s as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it’s only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward’s sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn’t coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don’t purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.

Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I’ve had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn’t have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road.
The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child’s death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke.

The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you’d get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer’s shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed.

About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams. Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames.

The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn’t tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid’s eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink.

The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said “DO IT” and we see in Squidward’s hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what’s left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.

Mr Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know wht the hell was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I’m sorry I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don’t know what happened and to this day nobody does.

There was an investigation due to the nature of the photos, but nothing came of it. No child seen was identified and no clues were gathered from the data involved nor physical clues in the photos. I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can’t prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things.""
In most YouTube videos on the subject, this is the account used. It is allegedly the true and original account of the episode, although it has not yet been proven.

Needless to say, it will most likely change you entire outlook on Spongebob Squarepant"

I have been taking Xanax daily for around a year and a couple of months for severe panic disorder and agoraphobia along with 20 MG of fluoxetine. I take around 0.25 during the day and 0.5 to sleep. I understand the daily use of Xanax is not the best solution however it has saved my life in one way or another as I was treated my anxiety with alcohol which led to serious alcoholism.

I have been on an internship abroad for 6 months now and j am going back home for a month or two where I will see my childhood friends. I used to go out a lot with them back when j was drinking but the last time I saw them I started not seeing them to be less present in the alcohol/pub scenes. I don't want to lose my friends and I am going to put some effort to go out with them but I always have this anxiety of the excuse of not drinking. I am thinking of just ordering one beer and sip it slowly to avoid any questions, there is nothing worse for me than having to explaining why I am not drinking and I can't keep on using the antibiotics. I know that I am not going to go back to alcohol it's been already 1 year and a half and I am not even interested in drinking but maybe just ordering a beer and barely finishing it can make me feel more comfortable and avoid being a total outcast

I Just wanted to know whah you would do in my place and if you ever drank a beer with 0.25 Xanax or drank a beer and then take 0.5 Xanax before sleeping. Will drinking half of it affect my health in any way, is it not worth it? 

Thank you "
52ggrj,15,2016-09-12,Food Industry Funding of Nutrition Research,blowupbadguys,nutrition,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/52ggrj/food_industry_funding_of_nutrition_research/,"Hot off the press - just published today:

https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251

by Marion Nestle, PhD, MPH in *JAMA Intern Medicine*, September 12, 2016

&gt; Industry-sponsored nutrition research, like that of research sponsored by the tobacco, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, almost invariably produces results that confirm the benefits or lack of harm of the sponsor’s products, even when independently sponsored research comes to opposite conclusions.1 Although considerable evidence demonstrates that those industries deliberately influenced the design, results, and interpretation of the studies they paid for,2 much less is known about the influence of food-company sponsorship on nutrition research. Typically, the disclosure statements of sponsored nutrition studies state that the funder had no role in their design, conduct, interpretation, writing, or publication. Without a “smoking gun” it is difficult to prove otherwise.

&gt; In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Kearns and colleagues3 report on having found a smoking gun. From a deep dive into archival documents from the 1950s and 1960s, they have produced compelling evidence that a sugar trade association not only paid for but also initiated and influenced research expressly to exonerate sugar as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Although studies at that time indicated a relationship between high-sugar diets and CHD risk, the sugar association preferred scientists and policymakers to focus on the role of dietary fat and cholesterol. The association paid the equivalent of more than $48 000 in today’s dollars to 3 nutrition professors—at Harvard no less—to publish a research review that would refute evidence linking sugars to CHD.

&gt; The sponsored review appeared in 2 parts in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967. Its authors acknowledged support from the industry-funded Nutrition Foundation, but they did not mention the sugar association’s specific funding of their review. Their first article demonstrates a close correlation between sugar and fat “consumption” (actually amounts in the food supply) and mortality in 14 countries (Figure).4 To minimize the association with sugar, the authors seem to have cherry-picked existing data. Despite their having previously published studies linking both fats and sugars to CHD risk, their review gave far more credence to studies implicating saturated fat than it did to those implicating sugars.

&gt; The documents leave little doubt that the intent of the industry-funded review was to reach a foregone conclusion. The investigators knew what the funder expected, and produced it. Whether they did this deliberately, unconsciously, or because they genuinely believed saturated fat to be the greater threat is unknown. But science is not supposed to work this way. The documents make this review seem more about public relations than science.

&gt; This 50-year-old incident may seem like ancient history, but it is quite relevant, not least because it answers some questions germane to our current era. Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues. In 2015, the New York Times obtained emails revealing Coca-Cola’s cozy relationships with sponsored researchers who were conducting studies aimed at minimizing the effects of sugary drinks on obesity.5 Even more recently, the Associated Press obtained emails showing how a candy trade association funded and influenced studies to show that children who eat sweets have healthier body weights than those who do not.6 The results of such studies have obvious implications for public health.

&gt; For this reason, it is of more than academic interest to find out when food companies began to fund research for public relations purposes. Fred Stare, then chair of Harvard’s nutrition department and senior author of the 1967 review, began soliciting donations from food companies in the early 1940s but insisted that these be unrestricted and pooled into a common fund for research and education.7 If earlier examples to the contrary occurred, they were not disclosed. If nothing else, the analysis by Kearns et al3 makes it clear why full disclosure of funding sources is essential.

&gt; In addition, their study is highly relevant to ongoing debates about the relative harm of fats and sugars. By 1967, as the Figure shows, both sugar and saturated fat had been identified as mortality risk factors. But for decades following the funded review, scientists and dietary guidelines focused on reducing saturated fat as the primary strategy for CHD prevention. They also advised consuming sugars in moderation, but mainly to prevent tooth decay. Today, the balance has shifted to less concern about fat and much greater concern about sugars.

&gt; It is worth noting that this debate focuses on sugars and saturated fats rather than on the foods that contain them. This approach, termed “nutritionism” to refer to the reductive use of single nutritional factors to stand for foods and dietary patterns, is inherently misleading.8 In excess, both sugars and saturated fat are markers of Western dietary patterns high in calories from meat, processed foods, and sugary drinks, all associated with increased chronic disease risk.9

&gt; As George Santayana famously said in Reason of Common Sense (1905), “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Today, it is almost impossible to keep up with the range of food companies sponsoring research—from makers of the most highly processed foods, drinks, and supplements to producers of dairy foods, meats, fruits, and nuts—typically yielding results favorable to the sponsor’s interests.1 Food company sponsorship, whether or not intentionally manipulative, undermines public trust in nutrition science, contributes to public confusion about what to eat, and compromises Dietary Guidelines in ways that are not in the best interest of public health.

&gt; Kearns et al3 urge policymakers to view industry-funded studies with some skepticism. This is excellent advice. Disclosure of funding sources helps but is not sufficient to address the potential conflicts that can occur with such funding. These authors3 have done the nutrition science community a great public service by bringing this historical example to light. May it serve as a warning not only to policymakers, but also to researchers, clinicians, peer reviewers, journal editors, and journalists of the need to consider the harm to scientific credibility and public health when dealing with studies funded by food companies with vested interests in the results—and to find better ways to fund such studies and to prevent, disclose, and manage potentially conflicted interests."

I understand the daily use of Xanax is not the best solution however it has saved my life in one way or another as I was treated my anxiety with alcohol which led to serious alcoholism, I stopped drinking for around 1 year and a half and I managed to get my life together. 

I have been on an internship abroad for 6 months now and j am going back home for a month or two where I will see my childhood friends. I used to go out a lot with them back when j was drinking but the last time I saw them I started not seeing them to be less present in the alcohol/pub scenes. I don't want to lose my friends and I am going to put some effort to go out with them but I always have this anxiety of the excuse of not drinking. 

I am thinking of just ordering one beer and sip it slowly to avoid any questions, there is nothing worse for me than having to explaining why I am not drinking and I really don't want to open up about my personal problems.I know that I am not going to go back to alcohol it's been already 1 year and a half and I am not even interested in drinking but maybe just ordering a beer and barely finishing it can make me feel more comfortable and avoid being a total outcast

I Just wanted to know whah you would do in my place and if you ever drank a beer with 0.25 Xanax or drank a beer and then take 0.5 Xanax before sleeping. Will drinking half of it affect my health in any way, is it not worth it? 

Thank you "

Throwaway because friends know my Reddit account.

Seriously, this happens way too often. I'm someone who believes in standing up for yourself, but after standing up for myself for the past 100 times I know no matter how much I reason with NDad he will *always* be right (of course) - so now I just nod and say yes, and then fuck off because that's better than arguing with him, *for the third time this week.*

Before the end of spring semester, I'd asked my dad if he had any work available at his shop over the summer, as I would've liked to make some money and learn a bit about the business. I'm studying a natural science, but I like the idea of running a business - especially the financial aspect, as it has a lot of numbers to it, and I like numbers. So I thought I could spend a big chunk of my summer helping him out with work, having some fun, and feeling fulfilled in a sense because I've made some money through my own sweat. He said ""Yes of course"" and I was excited, because it's not usually like him to react with enthusiasm like that.

Disclosure (and I hope I don't sound arrogant saying this): I study at a top 10 college and my dad has continually been pushing me to have the highest grades and work as much as possible, but I still think I can finish college with a high GPA while also, you know, having friends and going to events and being part of student societies. I had enough work, trapped in my room, studying for my SATs and APs to get really high scores and get into a good uni, and now I don't really enjoy the thought of rotting over a book for most of the week (even though I still do a lot of studying). I've found a new group of friends at college, and they have similar interests to mine, so we visit student societies a lot which really helps take the edge off when most people around you are doing internships at Goldman Sachs and working 18 hours a day. (again, this is just explaining the context, I don't want to come off as some ""oooh look at me and my cool type-A friends"" guy, so I'm sorry if that's the impression this is giving)

Anyways, I digress... Cue the end of semester. I come home, dad is disappointed I have a 3.5 GPA and thus I wouldn't be able to ""put myself out there for headhunters."" (because I'm not among the top five people in my class) I say he shouldn't worry, I'm at a really good school studying a natural science, if I so much as sneeze after graduation I'll get a job (as one of my friends likes to joke). He gets pissed, tells me I'm not taking my life seriously, tells me ""You've gotta be kidding me, focus on your grades"" when I ask him about working at the shop during the summer. We have several arguments, he says I shouldn't have ""my head in the clouds"" about working during uni (???) because literally all that matters are good grades and connections.

Fast forward to today. I mention to dad about how I'd like to get an internship in a company related to my degree, hopefully after this academic year, and he says ""Yeah I'm just not gonna listen to you after the shit you pulled.""

I'm dumbfounded. What shit did I pull?

""You were *so* yuppity to work at the shop during term time, then you come home and don't speak a word about it. You just want to be lazy and have others take care of your responsibilities and remind you of the promises you've made.""

At this point, the gears in my brain stick, as I'm trying to decipher what he's just said. Wanting to be lazy? Have others take care of me? Not speaking a word about the work I'd asked? 

So I remind him (in the most soothing voice possible, of course, because God forbid I flat-out tell him he's *wrong*) that I didn't forget about my ""promise"" and in fact had asked about it after I'd come home, and that he told me not to speak about it because he wouldn't allow it (and that I should focus on studying, even though it was summer break... ? Still haven't figured this out) And here he just cracks.

""Ex-*cuse me?*"" he exclaims, turning to look me in the eyes (which is a start, as he'd been too busy watching TV to even pay me the slighest bit of attention as I was making conversation with him). ""What did you just say? When the FUCK will you stop lying, like that bitch of a mother of yours?""

Ah, the standard ""you're just like your mother, always expecting others to do your work for you"" response. He usually waits to use that one, but this time he started the argument with heavy artillery. Okay, get ready.

""When the FUCK did you say anything like that? Do you fucking expect me to believe you that this really happened? You were all crying about how you wanted work over the summer, then bam, break time comes around, and you're nowhere to be found.""

(this is all, obviously, untrue. I had spoken to him about work, and he told me no chance. Maybe because I didn't get the perfect GPA - but I've already stopped analyzing and re-analyzing THAT conversation in my head, like I do all my arguments with him)

What follows is just an endless stream of insults about how I'm lazy and worthless and should be grateful I have food on my table because obviously the thing that matters most in a parent is how much money they bring home, right? Comparisons between my mom and me, and how I've inherited her lazy gene, and how I'm a ""snake"" like her because I ""pull this shit"" all the time and ""expect others to do [my] work for [me]."" At this point I just give up, blankly staring at the TV because there's nothing else to do except wait for him to blow his fuse and calm down. Thankfully, because I don't call him on his bullshit, this happens much quicker than usual. I feel defeated because finally, after so many arguments, I've started doing what my mom does when she argues with him (which is multiple times a week): just sit still, say yes/stare into the distance, wait for him to calm down.

Actually, my mom doesn't argue with him. No, she just stays put while he fucking carpet bombs her psychologically and destroys any lingering self-esteem she might still have. 

It's more difficult than it sounds. I'm still actually asking myself, ""Did I really mention the work after I came home from college?"" even though **I know I did,** but somehow he still makes me question myself, for days at a time. I don't know if he's a true narcissist, but in the past he's basically told me things like ""I work a lot and make a lot of money - it doesn't matter if you never see me, I put food on your table, *I'm doing my part as a parent*"" and then freaks out when I don't immediately run into his arms when he comes home from work and spend all my free time with him. I dunno.

I just wanted to share this. It feels kinda cathartic, but I also feel defeated. I really can't wait to finish college, find my own place and start my life, basically. For a short while at the beginning of summer, I was home alone for about 10 days, and it felt *fucking blissful.* Then my mom and dad came home, and *literally the first day they were back* they started arguing.

Oh well. Such is life. How was your day?"

I had a year and a half sobriety until recently. I did a 6 month program and stayed there after I graduated to work as a Drug and Alcohol Counseling Intern. I worked there for 7 months and then moved back home where I did very well for a few months. My girlfriend then broke up with me, admitting to me that she lied about being in love with me as I was with her, and led me on through our long distance relationship. She is or was the only girl I've been in love with truly and it broke my heart. I then made a horrible decision to relapse on heroin to escape that reality. After a couple weeks of using, I realized what I had thrown away and immediately called the program I worked for (Elevate Addiction Services) and told them what had happened and that I needed to come back for a program. They have been nothing but supportive and helpful and worked with my insurance to cover most of the costs and even waived the $10,000 out of pocket fee. Now I just need to pay the deductible so I can start the program. I picked up extra shifts at work to try and come up with the money, but it would be quite awhile until I will have enough to make it down there, and everyday I spend up here is another day I fall deeper into my addiction. I have never asked for handouts and feel absolutely horrible about doing it now, but unfortunately I've run out of options. I started a GoFundMe Campaign to try and come up with the rest of the money to pay for the deductible, along with what money I have saved. Thank you to anyone who even stuck with me long enough to read this post, and a huge thank you to anyone willing to donate even the smallest amount. I am forever grateful and appreciative. I know I need to confront my problems and tackle them before it gets out of hand again. Thank you so much.

52h8ip,4,2016-09-12,"My [22M] gf [21F] of 3,5 years unsure about our relationship after months of feeling taken for granted",throwawaythrowe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52h8ip/my_22m_gf_21f_of_35_years_unsure_about_our/,"My girlfriend and I are currently going to college and we were together since senior highschool year. We both live in the same city and we attended the same highschool class so we know each other for 7 years. The whole relationship is based on friendship which had evenutally grown into mutual feelings so the bond I feel with her is very deep. We had also experienced and helped each other through some extremely hard moments of our lives like passing of my father, her mother heavily drinking after her father left her mom for another woman and also really bad financial states in which we sometimes did not had enough for basic life requirements like rent, bills and food - and situation was very similar in both of our families.

We had basically grown together in last four or five years and despite the circumstances we always stayed together and managed to grow from our problems individually or with help of each other. The connection sometimes had issues and doubts, but we talked through them and managed to fix them mutually. I got to be honest, I think some of our issues may have not been adressed properly on time due to the fact that she is a person that sometimes easily steps away from fighting and I am the person that would quickly say he will improve or change if the solution to the problem feels reasonable and full of compromise. Sometimes we would not talk deeply about the problem, but after a bit of arguing we would feel really bad that our behaviour led to a fight and then agree to continue our relationship with trying to improve something that made us argue. I seriously think this was successful in some situations because I really felt the need to improve myself for her and myself and she did too. Her reasons were almost always very reasonable, respectable and with goal to improve our relationship and each other and I believe so were most of mine. The problem is that I would occasionally ignore her true feelings and words and just easily say that I will change, without actually putting enough effort into it so after short time of trying to improve myself on certain subject the issue itself would fade away on me and I would quickly return to my “before” state, as she says. She would then feel disappointed, but she would not tell me that immediately. The feeling of disappointment would than build up in her and then she would start to distance herself from me. After I would see that she is in real emotional pain I would feel scared, guilty for ignoring her and afraid of losing her so I did everything to get her back. Surprisingly, I had always somehow managed to get her back despite my carelessness and selfishness. I would then listen to her, deeply communicate and try to understand her and eventually I would regain her trust. She had her quirks also, but she always seemed a lot more emotionally stable than me so she always did her best to improve herself and she kinda always knew what she wanted. Her actions were always fulfilled with compassion and patience, which is why this thing worked out in really dark times I had been going through at some point of our relationship and I am really grateful she did stay with me.

Through love and respect we had always found a way to regain connection, but in the last few months we are really struggling to regain it properly, and I seriously think it is mostly because of my inability to stay caring and engaged into relationship when I am really busy working or studying, but also I often become very lazy in a relationship and just focus on myself and my goals, irresponsibly (but kinda subconsciously) thinking she would wait for me to have time and love for her. After realizing what douchebag I turn into after some time of not giving her affection she deserves makes me want to punch myself, and I somehow managed to get myself into this kind of behaviour for too many times.

I am aware this was a long intro to our current problem, but I also believe it is also really relevant for the whole story.

Let’s get back to last summer. After two years of doing dead-end student jobs I finally found the thing I want to do in my life, programming, and I felt very passionate about it. Because I was *really* struggling with money, I then decided to dedicate my time to learn quickly so I can easily find a job  and fix my financials. Besides going to college, I think this was almost everything I did with my time. I sometimes felt so tired and puzzled that I forgot to eat or felt sick from exhaustion, but I thought it was worth it and that it will be worth eventually.

Only few months later I got an internship I was very very excited for as it was for the company I admired. This was on the beggining of this year and because I was on probation work I had put extreme amounts of effort into keeping that job, doing things like studying and researching immediately after I went home from work, day or night. Our time together struggled in these times a lot because I haven’t had energy to do anything else besides programming, but she then said she understands this is important to me and that she believed in me so she gave me full support. I promised her it it would be only temporary until I get confirmation I can stay indefinitely in the company and that we will work on everything after I secure my job.  Financial stress was really big for me and feeling of financial security after years of being next to broke felt like I can seriously create meaningful and engaging life for myself, my family and for my girlfriend.

The problem was, after I had been accepted to stay indefinitely I did not change my tempo a lot. I felt like I should not settle down now, but continue to grow and learn. I was telling her that it is for both of us, but I think I lied not only to her, but to myself.  I loved the feeling of progress I was making, but I was also slightly scared of losing my job because I had no other income so I pushed further and further with this rhythm, blindly hoping that it *will not* impact on our relationship and that she will love me forever no matter what. idiot

She slowly started losing interest in me because she had given so much energy into supporting me and waiting for me. She told me that she understands my needs for financial independence and personal growth, but that this is too much for her and that she does not know me any more. I would come to her place with plan to hang out with her, but I would quickly reach for my computer and just work or learn more without the actual critical need to do so. I completely ignored how she felt.

She told me that the way I behave is changing the way she feels, but I tried to comfort her that this will all change in the summer when all challenges will be over (work and final college exams). She again had patience but our relationship was seriously messed up. I sometimes actually had to work really long because I also did some freelancing so I could save more money for the summer and school fees, but I really wanted to improve our relationship at the same time. Our time together looked extremely sad because she sometimes cancelled her plans for me and than I would show up late or even come and still be in front of computer.  In times when I tried to make love and make it up for being emotionally away, she felt used because I engaged only when I really needed it, not thinking at all about how she feels. We may have had a few fun times in those 6 months, but seriously that was next to nothing. All of those problems true, but I was too self centered to actually see it, accept it and do immediately something properly about it.

Finally, summer came and she went on vacation with her friends. We communicated through those 3 weeks apart and after that we went to vacation together. I though it was time to improve things, so I did try. I finally had proper free time for anything I wanted. We talked and regained some communication, things started to be a bit better, but I did not try hard enough based on the actions I  did through past few months. I promised her I will change and that I would plan my days better so that we have time for ourselves. We then returned to our home city to study for finals and knew we would not see each other again ofther through this period.

Despite the fact that we haven’t had time to hang out often, I felt like the relationship slightly improved. It did, but not on the levels I thought it were. I finally realized the depth of the problem when a week ago we got into a fight where she said she is seriously questitoning our relationship after months of being taken for granted.

It finally hit my head properly and I had a mental breakdown. How could have I been so blind? I realized this needs serious discussion and we had seen each other few days after that. We exchanged what we feel about this relationship and she told me that this constant disappointment led to her being unsecure and unhappy. She said she still loves me and that she still understands that I was busy with work, but that reality is that it changed her.

I read a lot of articles on how to approach this kind of problem in relationship, but this goes so deep I did not know where to start. I told her I realized that I am responsible for the love I sucked out from her and that I really struggled at those times, really wishing to do my best for everyone, but managed only to do it for myself. She said she is willing to see where this relationship will go, but she needs time to think about everything and how she feels.  We talked about every problem we’ve had in the past and present. I think honesty is only thing that could create something positive after all this.

We are now still seeing each other after that and communicating, but taking smaller steps. I try really hard to understand how she feels, but I am unsure how to properly approach this. I love her but I was stupid. I understand that this could lead to a break up and if she feels like that, so be it. My question is should I contact her a lot and show affection or keep it slow while giving her space?

TL;DR Got a job and was very busy, but also focused on myself and lazy about relationship. My girlfriend stayed with me and supported me, but now she does not feel the same anymore because we've distanced from each other.

Seriously, thank you everyone who reads this."

Ive suffered with depression and suicidal thoughts since i was in my early teens. And this situation has only made things significantly worse. All my peers seem to grasp these concepts so fluently and with ease. It eats away at me knowing that I put myself into this situation, and I don't feel like I could handle a basic level internship let alone a career as a programmer.  There's Noone I can talk to family wise, everyone is all caught up on how ""smart"" of a kid I am because I was somewhat tech savy when I was younger (and im one of the only people in my family in to go to college next to my step sister). And when I tried to talk to the people That were close to me they all brushed me off saying That I'm overreacting and I'll be fine. I know that's not the case.  I feel trapped, I can't fail or backout here because I don't know what else to do with my life.  I'm not looking for anyone's sympathy. I just needed to say it"
52hv4y,1,2016-09-12,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52hv4y/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.
The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.
Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Things seemed so much simpler two years ago. 

I'm graduating university this semester with a Professional Bachelor's in Industrial Technology and Management. I used to study aerospace engineering and engineering management and I quit it for this more or less pointless degree because I couldn't handle the stress of engineering nor was it something I wanted to do anymore. Now, I'm facing poor job outlook because where I'm working currently is irrelevant in respect to what I studied (currently item procession clerk at an insurance company).

I left social media last week and now I feel more alone than I felt before. Friends who used to Snap me every day haven't spoken much to me as of when I left social media. I have good friends, but I don't see em much (both childhood buds are away for uni or jobs). They both have serious relationships and they dedicate more time and effort to them than to the three of us together, but I've expected this. Friends here at home are great but I can't only hang with em for so much. I don't have a girlfriend; I really crave a meaningful relationship but at the same time I don't want one because I don't think I'm mature enough yet to be capable of one. 

I'm finally making okay money (well, with respect to what I should be making had I an internship or a job lined up after graduation) which I'll need because I'm planning a month or two month-long backpacking trip to Europe and Scandinavia next summer. I'm very excited for that of course.  At the same time, I really want to (need to, actually) move out into my own place, but that'd mean sacrificing the trip, which I refuse to do.

I dunno, I'm just not feeling really fulfilled at the moment. Part of me really wants to leave here and live elsewhere but I just don't know how to go about that. Everything I'm feeling is just confusing. I'm trying to take it day by day but emotions can be overwhelming one day, then not or feeling completely the opposite the next day. 

Just wanted to vent all this. Haven't really wanting to tell anyone I know closely much of what I'm feeling lately.

Basically. I went to film school at School of Visual Arts after leaving high school in 2010. I was excited and nervous to begin my journey on my filmmaking path. A dream I’ve had since I was little (like I’m sure many others have on this sub). Long story short, I dropped out 2 years in because I was feeling lost and didn’t think I could afford the bill anymore. My grandmother died and I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years at the time. Its been 4 years since I’ve been out of school now, they have been dark times for me. A lot of depression and anxiety. I told myself I’d continue my scripts outside of school, I never did. I fail at my dream and for a little believed I needed to go back to school to get a normal degree to have a stable job. I’m currently in community college working toward a degree in nutrition science. I still have a long way to go to finish and get my degree. Everyday I think of what could have been and what I could do differently right now to help resurrect my fallen dreams of making my own films come true.

I just came on here because I’m honestly lost. I’ve never felt so lost in my whole life and it frightens me. My question to everyone out there would be what would be the best course of action for me? I don’t need pitty talk. I think about this every night before I go to bed. I’m 24 years old. My resume is honestly weak. I’m broke and have no connections to any filmmakers from my past. I’m alone and feel like I’m at the base of a giant mountain I want to climb. I know the journey will be long and hard. I can’t stop listening to my heart for some reason, even though my brain is yelling at me for doing so.

What is the best course of action for someone with no connections, no resume, and no money to go back to film school?

Should I work on small shorts with friends? Although I honestly dread doing this because my friends aren’t as serious as this as I am. 
Should I go Kevin smith style and self fund one of the small Indy scripts I have?
Should I look for an internship? Even if I’m out of college and don’t have great portfolio? I’d imagine there are tons of people that would get the position over me.

I live in north NJ, about 30 minutes for NYC. I’m just lost on where to start my dream up again and any help or advice would really help me out.

52ifob,117,2016-09-12,Girls before and after swallowing the pill,GaySwanson,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/52ifob/girls_before_and_after_swallowing_the_pill/,"**Introduction**


First post on TRP. This is a field report regarding discussions and relations with different women. This covers one before swallowing the pill, and one after. I go into a bit of detail for both of these scenarios, as to explain how it all happened. Hopefully it will benefit some of you.


**Background**


I am 22, in my last year of college studying engineering; decent shape, workout 3 times a week, 5'10"" and 175lbs at about 15% body fat. I am definitely working on improving but my point is, I'm decent looking at least. I'm also good in social situations and have been involved in greek life. I was led to TRP like most of you, by a girl who screwed me over. Well, in my case, it was a gradual transition of figuring it out on my own until around April this year when I found this subreddit. Now, about my discussion...


**Body**


*Ashley*


Girl 1 was my high school sweetheart, I'll refer to her as Ashley. HB7, Great girl; conservative household, religious, very submissive. We broke up going into college because of a few hour time difference. We were both virgins at the time and she was saving it for marriage and I didn't want that. I managed to string her along though while I was dating other women (with varying success) throughout college. 

Fast forward to last summer (2015) when I have an internship across the country. I'm back in my hometown before leaving, and we hungout and things built up and we ended up having sex (her first time). She ended up visiting me at my internship where that continued. Ashley later told me that she *""felt she could only keep me by having sex""* which honestly wasn't true, but it was great nonetheless. Proceeded to us dating in the fall up until March of 2016 still distance because of college, and we had been discussing marriage. In February, at one point she said to me *""I want to be able to trust my husband with decisions, and I don't know if I trust you enough for that.""* I was blindsided by the comment. See, in my blue pill mindset, I was looking for a partner, an equal. And I had her on a pedestal, because I knew she was a great girl, and she made comments before about not doing that. Big mistakes. 

Now what led to me breaking up with her. Before the school year ended, we had been extremely busy with school and hadn't been able to see each other in a bit. She had made a few comments here and there about her lab TA being interested in her. By that I mean he directly told her that. I simply told her as long as she shuts it down it's fine. I had zero worries. A few weeks later Ashley asked if it was okay if she went over to his place for dinner and that one of her friends would be going so she wouldn't be alone. I told her I did not think that it was appropriate but I'm not going to tell her no. Another mistake on my part. About a month after that, she had been in lab working and, on one of my most successful nights actually, she ended up kissing him. She told me a week later after saying *”I thought I could just not tell you and keep you, but it was eating me up inside.”* At first I flipped out, then stopped responding to texts for that night and talked to some bros. Ended up breaking up with her the next day because she knew my boundaries and broke them.


*Lessons from Ashley* that should be obvious after reading the sidebar anyway


-This was the only girl I had completely trusted and NEVER expected to cheat on me, and she did. Absolutely AWALT. 

-Do not put girls on a pedestal

-You need to lead your girl


*Liz after finding TRP*


After Ashley, I found the blue pill randomly from ask reddit. Started reading it and was like “this is complete bs” and found TRP from that. Eye opening. Everything started making sense. I started lifting more, read “No More Mr Nice Guy”, and began to experiment with TRP tactics. Girl 2, who I will refer to as Liz, was my test of TRP over this past summer (2016). 

Liz is a HB6 who I met at an intern function at the beginning of the summer. I worked at a huge company and did not work anywhere near with this girl so I considered it safe from a career perspective. I was chatting everyone up at this function, getting peoples numbers, and my roommates and I were going to host a party that night for everyone. I had talked to this girl for maybe 10 minutes, not even mainly talking to her, and mentioned to my roommate that I was going to get alcohol for tonight. This girl out of nowhere said *”I can go with you”*. This let me know everything I needed to know. We went and she made a comment about how *”I didn’t need her there”*. So, things progress that night but nothing happened besides flirting due to other work people being there. Over the week we’re texting and the convo goes like this:

Her:		…Guess where I am

Me:		In my bed

Her:		You’re close… I’m at Walmart lol

Me:		I prefer my guess

Her:		I do too



And just like that, I knew she was at least interested in having sex. I invite her out to bars next weekend, Make out with her before leaving my apartment, and Liz couldn’t keep her hands off me that night. Deed was done, great time. She was a plate for a while and became a semi-dating thing for the summer. Constant shit tests, but I knew how to handle them thanks to TRP. She would leave cute notes in the morning after staying over, and clean up the place some too. Later in the summer I asked her why she wanted to sleep with me that first date. She said *”You knew what you wanted, and I could tell you were experienced.”* I would take her out on dates every so often and tell her what to where, what time to meet me, where, no details about what was happening, and she LOVED it. Directly told me she did as well.
Other notes about Liz. I could basically do whatever I wanted to her sexually. I would throw her around, make her say that pussy was mine, even had public sex. Great time. This is definitely because she saw me as Alpha, and I knew what I wanted. Don’t get me wrong, I was not perfect. Definitely still beta traits lying around. You don’t need to be perfect, but you need to be good. Also, she would tell me about her beta orbiters. One of whom I thought was a decent (although very BB), who told her he didn’t like me because I was too *“Type A.”* I thought that was interesting, especially when she added *“It’s great for me.”*

**TL;DR Lessons Learned**

- AWALT. You never have a special snowflake, although there are girls who are better than others

- Don’t put any girl on a pedestal

- Lead girls, especially in a relationship

- Talk to everyone, be social, have fun

- Be bold and know what you want

- If in a relationship, you need to throw in some beta traits (comfort) as well

52ig02,1,2016-09-12,"Just broke up with my girlfriend of 10 months, I'm not sure if I'm sad",suitaway111,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/52ig02/just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_10_months_im/,"I've been thinking about breaking up with her for a while now, and I literally just broke up with her this morning. 

We met in high school, and this is right before college starts for the both of us. 

The first two or so months of summer break was great, we were still together, messaging each other everyday, and making plans. I had a full time internship for a month, but we still saw each other as much as possible. She got a full time retail job about a week before I ended my internship.

I wanted to look for a job after my internship ended, but decided not to, because I'd only be able to work for about a month (which wasn't worth it). Instead, I took up a couple hobbies with my money (rock climbing, photography, and cars).

It was alright the first week or two of her having a job, we still messaged each other and made plans. I kept myself occupied with hobbies and friends when she was working. As time went on though, she slowly stopped messaging me until our messages just amounted to good mornings and good nights. 

She was still texting, just texting her new coworker friends. i know this because whenever we went out, she would constantly be on her phone texting her new friends. This went on for some time, and I didn't mind at first because they were new friends. But then it started to annoy me when she was checking her phone during our dates and even during a movie. I asked her to focus more on our dates, but she didn't really follow through until our last date.

I would honestly say from about two/three weeks into her job, we've been messaging less, hanging out less (from 2-3 times a week each one being a full day hang out to about 1 time a week with half a day if I'm lucky). Conversely, she began to hangout more with her coworkers after work until 2-3 am, she hung out with other friends before work as well even though whenever I asked her if we could get breakfast together she would decline saying she's too tired.

About a month in, it honestly just felt like we drifted instead of grown together. She never tells me what happened at work, instead she'd tell her friends. She never initiates our hangouts anymore, I'd always have to. I just felt like she stopped caring. I did bring these points with her, but nothing really changed.

And then just now, I brought them up again, saying that I can't continue with this neglact, and she just said I'm sorry, maybe it's best we breakup. And idk, I guess it hurt a little because I thought she'd be a little more sad about the whole thing or something. It sorta made me question how much she really valued the relationship 

Right now, i haven't really cried yet. I'm not sure if I feel sad. Maybe it's because the past month sort of eased me into not seeing her, and just generally not being in contact with her most of the day. But i guess there's still some sense of loneliness lingering in me that just hasn't hit yet or something.

I laid in bed the whole day today, except for a trip to Home Depot to buy some screws for my car. I talked to a couple of friends, but i didn't want to linger on about how the breakup went down. I just told them it was on mutual terms and ofc I'm sad about it. I proceeded to do the normal breakup social media thing and changed all my pictures. I didn't delete any pictures of us on instagram because I thought it would be immature. I unfollowed her on fb so I wouldn't see her posts (did not want to block/unfriend her, but also did not want to eventually see her with another guy). I muted her on twitter. I deleted snapchat to avoid seeing her stories.

I'm not sure what to do tomorrow. I would love to go to the gym or rock climb, but my car isn't in running condition yet and won't be for a while. I don't want to laze around all day in bed either. I'd go for a walk or something but I feel like that would just make me think about things.

I still have some of her things and she still has some of my things. Most notably, she has my 3DS that I'd very much like back, even though I don't use it very often.

All in all, I guess I just suddenly feel lonely or something. Like even though our contact was minimal, just the idea of not being with her makes me a little lonely. My best friend started school already, so he's usually busy and I can't hit him up. My other friends are similarly busy with school so we won't be hanging out til wednesday. 

I'm not sure what's really going on here. I know I was happy before I met her, so I know I can be happy withour her, but I just don't know how to get to that point. I don't know how to get to the point where I can just sit in my room and think about things other than her."

52izju,8,2016-09-13,Here goes everything...,I_am_a_throwaway_IRL,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/52izju/here_goes_everything/,"So I don't know what went wrong. I'm a 3rd year college student in the supposed ""best years of my life"" yet I sit here wallowing in self-loathing and isolation. I don't know if writing all this down is going to help, but I know damn well it's going to hurt, I'll try and lay it down from bedrock up.

The hardest part for me to rationalize is how I came to be this manically depressed sack of lethargy. I was a very intelligent high school student, athlete and had a great group of friends. I had my teenage drama, but who doesn't? I was the fat kid who felt obligated to play football as if I had to justify my excess size for some higher purpose but was never any good. Never really met any girls, but I always took it as part of the ""fat guy territory"" to basically be inept at doing anything with women. Never went on a single date, dance,  prom, nothing. I never got so much as a hug until college. This led to me being closed off to people I didn't know very well. And you know what? In high school that was all fine-and-dandy, I was at the vert least content. 

Jumping to the present unfortunately not much has changed. I played collegiate sports my first 2 years but the toll has become too much to bear on top of everything else. My grades have been slowly declining. I'm probably heavier than I ever was in high school. I've made virtually 0 progress with any women. My college is far larger then my high school was, so my timidness has blown into full fledged social anxiety. If you're even still reading this than you must be thinking ""damn this dude's life must be fucked"". One of the hardest parts for me is dealing with the fact that it's actually not. I have internships and jobs lined up, I have several leadership positions around campus and am very involved. Hell I even have good friends and am even in a social fraternity. The reason this is so hard for me is I am forced to drag myself around like a puppet to all these responsibilities and put on a mask that everything is fine. 

It's not, nothing is fine. I'm holding on by threads. 

I come back from meetings and can find myself on the floor in a crying-meltdown within minutes, only to pick myself up an hour later to get that report done by 10 or send out that email I forgot. It's not sustainable. My friends, hell now my housemates, will throw parties that I'm too embarrassed to show up to. They'll go meet some girls for lunch but I'm too scared to join them. Freshman year I'd at least go to parties and bars. I'd feel sweaty, uncomfortable and like I didn't belong but at least I'd go. Now the thought of doing anything social gets me nervous, let alone the thought of going to meet women. 

Someone tried to tell me I might have Body Dysmorphia but I find it hard to believe I'm over analyzing my flaws when aside from my face (maybe) I'm physically repulsive. I do admit it sounds harsh, but even among fat guys I'm disgusting. I think hell itself could be me shirtless in front of a group of strangers, and I mean hell for everyone, my nerves and their eyes. This for me is a main reason I have such trouble with women, I've been told that girls I know are sending me signals by friends but I can't even begin to rationalize the thought. Even if the feeling was mutual, I don't think I could even be intimate if I knew they were going to see me. People say ""but hey, lights off. won't that solve the problem?"". I find it hard to believe the darkness would hide the sweaty, fat mess that is my body from whoever I'd be with. Just the thought of intimacy with anyone seems repulsive, but not for me, for them. I really can't offer anything stimulating in that department, let alone just basic looks. 

I've had crushes where I just wish I could tell them how I've felt, but at the same time I know that if I really cared I would never want them to end up with a guy like me. I'll be casual, but far too casual to ever seem interested because I'm too much of a pussy. I'll avoid contact, never make any moves toward actually pursuing her, wish I wasn't me, then remember I am me, and that even if she wanted me I mentally don't think I could process it. I'll just wallow away in isolation wishing I had the balls, but knowing if I did how embarrassed and ashamed I'd be of being myself.  

I could keep writing for hours but it just gets too painful to spin around in thorny circles. If there is anyone reading this, it didn't help writing it out. After reading it over I see my best option as totally overhauling my body and going into workout overdrive, but between school and emotions and crying and work and all the other bullshit I see myself turning to food more than the gym. Maybe that's my problem is that I'm too helpless to help myself. All I know is that tomorrow I'm going to wake up a fat, sweaty, depressed mess and that's not going to change. Maybe I need a catalyst, I just hope it sends me in the right direction because I don't know if I could handle getting worse, I don't think I could bare with it mentally. Who knows, just like my body I'm probably just soft. "
52jcn4,4,2016-09-13,Failure to launch,bzarnzy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/52jcn4/failure_to_launch/,"I tested into one of the top high schools in the nation. I was written up in articles because of my participation in a technology program.

I went into an accelerated medicine program because I didn't know what to do with my life after high school. My mom recommended medicine, so I did it. I flunked out in the next three years. Left without a bachelor's and no more path to follow.

I transferred to a regular 4 year city college.

I found a SO who loves me. I think I love them but I also feel like I don't know anything about relationships. My high school experience was not normal, I learned. No one had time for dating in the ultra competitive environment. So I never really dated beyond this SO. No one else has ever been interested in me in this way. I was also not really interested in others before them. I feel like I'm lying sometimes.

I don't know how to make decisions for myself. Where do I go with my career? I landed an internship back in technology and it's a ""safe"" job with good benefits if I stay on this career path. I want to come to terms with the fact that it may not be what I love or am passionate about because I know no one really ever does what they're passionate about. It's just logical. Even more, I have no passions and I used to be good in school but now I have no drive. This city College isn't challenging. I get good grades without trying too hard but obviously when things get too hard I don't try hard enough.

I never slept when I was in my medicine program. I tried so hard. I thought I did everything I was supposed to. I printed out hundreds of slides and covered them with notes from lecture. I read through them night after night. I didn't eat because it was too much of an inconvenience. I lost 20 lbs. I still failed.

My parents are successful immigrants. My dad self studied with the rise of the Internet and computers to become an engineer. My mom graduated from an amazing college and is the breadwinner.

As a minority, I feel fetishized everyday when I walk out of my house. People cat call constantly. What is my worth in this world? I want to be a strong woman who can make her own way. I grew up thinking, I didn't need a man. Now I've become so weak. 

I am good at cooking and cleaning. My SO's family is so traditional. The mom is a SAHM. The dad is a cop. What if I become trapped as a housewife. Is that all I'm worth? I had so many dreams to be more in elementary school -- a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer. I had dreams to be like my mom and earning more than my SO. 

I cry almost every night, alone in my room. I have cried alone for a long time. My dad used to call me a failure in middle school. I would lay in the bathtub and cry into a towel to muffle the sobs. It was the only way no one would question what I was doing in there for so long. Sometimes, I'd eye my sister's razors and wonder how bad it would hurt if I took one apart and ended it.

Last month, I stared into my closet, crying. I was wondering if the small, braided belt in my closet would be enough. 

I know I need so much help. I've wanted help for years. I've wanted to die since I was 11. I can't ask for it because of the stigma, especially in my culture. No one really knows the extent of my depression. My mom asks why I'm tired all the time."

********* 

^14th ^July ^2021

Bangalore's recent investments in increased information technology production has opened up the opportunity for various to relocate to India, while providing opportunities for other companies to by overseas corporations. India, wanting to increase its capabilities in the sector of smartphone production, as well as computer production. Several billion dollars from the technology budget will be given to Indian corporations looking to acquire overseas assets.

###HTC

Indian telecommunications company Lava International is one of the largest in India, which partnered with Intel in order to launch an intern powered phone in India under the brand name XOLO. The Taiwanese based HTC has been seen as a phone giant in the past, however in late 2016 the company was seen to be failing, and with the ceasing of diplomatic ties with Taiwan by many nations (not including the UK and India who have recognised the nation), HTC will soon find it hard to export its products across the globe.

As such, in a move of mercy, Lava International is willing to pay $2bn to acquire HTC. HTC will be allowed to retain its operations in Taiwan, and will use India as a gateway to western markets. Lava International will be responsible for opening HTC factories and production lines within India, in cooperation with their other phone brand, XOLO.

###Acer

Acer is another Taiwanese based computer company which may suffer from the lack of recognition as a nation, and continuous belligerence from the Chinese rebels. The Indian government would like to personally purchase Acer for $5bn. 

###BlackBerry Limited

Canadian based BlackBerry Limited has fallen behind in terms of smartphone production, and in recent years its technology has become outdated compared to its competitors. Losing money fast, the company is seen as a failure. However, Intex Technologies sees a way to improve blackberry sales and help Canadian's get more jobs. Intex would like to purchase Blackberry Limited and its subsidiaries for a handsome price of $2.2bn, and would like to propose that Intex invests in creating more BlackBerry R&amp;D and management jobs within Canada, while using Indian factories to produce blackberry phones, new and old.

###Motorola Mobility

Motorola is another mobile phone company which seems to be failing, it was purchased by Google and then sold to Chinese company Lenovo for approximately $2.91bn. Indian company Celkon would like to provide Lenovo with a great opportunity in which they could turn a profit. Celkon would like to purchase Motorola Mobility for $3.8bn."

I have to get up at 4am every morning for work, and that has been less awful, even enjoyable when I'm walking around outside.

I can feel my anxiety about my internship (it's only been a few days) but I can manage it, instead of wanting to vomit. 

I feel generally good about things. Yeah, there is a lot of shit going on and a lot of stuff to deal with, but I feel like I can take it all on.

I do feel a bit twitchy, and like I want to stretch out of my skin, but that should go away. As long as I keep moving it's not so bad.

This is mostly to remind myself that I can feel good about the day. It feels like it's been so long since I've felt like this, I don't want to forget it."
52k6b0,3,2016-09-13,Does my mother have BPD?,tottottt,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/52k6b0/does_my_mother_have_bpd/,"First off, the obligatory kitties: http://wallpapersafari.com/kitten-pictures-for-wallpaper/

I've often wondered if my mother has BPD. But I guess mostly I need to share and hear from people with similar stories. 

My mother had me explicitly ""to have someone who'd always love her."" She violated multiple boundaries ""for my own good"" and always expected gratitude in return. The worst one was probably when she tricked me into having an expensive medical procedure we couldn't afford (she said we were just going for a checkup to the eye doctor and waited until they put atropine into my eyes and I couldn't see and then had me undergo a laser procedure on my retina). 

When I was a child she regularly got into screaming rages unexpectedly followed by silent treatment. She brought me to clothing stores and wanted me to get the most expensive thing and then screamed at me if I didn't want to buy anything (not because I didn't like anything but because I'd heard so many times we didn't have any money I didn't want to spend it unless absolutely necessary). 

My first memory is her screaming at me at home after a walk where her friend's daughter called me ""sick"" because I wouldn't talk to anyone. I literally had no idea until she started screaming that anything was wrong and never even registered that comment. I guess I was in my own world a lot and acted a bit like I had autism. This unexpectedness was the worst. Since then I have a habit of looking back at every social situation I go through and overanalyzing it in case I did something wrong.

When I was 16 I didn't know how to say no and started dating someone I actively disliked. I told my mother and she begged me not to break up with him because ""it's so hard to find people who'll love you."" 

When I was a student she got me a short internship in the company she worked for (for which I asked and was grateful) and then proceeded to ask my boss to hire me on the second day of it because she couldn't trust me to ask for it myself. I was hired eventually because I was good but my mother always took credit for it. Five years later when I was leaving the job she actually wanted to buy an expensive gift for my boss to thank her for keeping me in her department for so long. When I told her it was inappropriate because she didn't really have any sort of relationship with my boss she blew up.

When I moved out, she claimed I abandoned her and that I had become ""the head of the family."" She kept telling me she just didn't like me spending **my** money on rent when I could live rent-free with them and that she couldn't bear me living in such ""horrible"" conditions even after I repeatedly told her that this was what I knew was better for me. She later actually told me that it wouldn't be bad if I lost my job since I would then move back in with them. When I said no, she exploded into a tantrum.

And of course she always said, well, at least I fed and clothed you and put you through school. Or, you only remember bad things. Or, just wait until you have your own children, you'll see.

These are all open for discussion and I have photos of how I would like your character to appear as. 

1) Aunt/Nephew - Ever since I went through puberty I've occasionally masterbated about my Aunt and her giant tits. One summer I get to stay over for a month while I intern at my new college job. What we both don't know is our mutual desire for each other. We both take secret peeks at each other in our moments of undress during the morning and night and I could've sworn I saw your reflection in the mirror when I was showering.

2) Wife's Cousin - My wife and I have no sex life at all which makes me look for hook ups at night using Tinder. One night I come across my wife's cousin's profile and against my better judgement I swipe right but to my surprise it tells me we are a match. That's where we can start from there with a simple message in the app which will lead to us meeting.

3) Cousins - We have always been close growing up and being close in age. I've always pleasured myself to you and your giant tits and loved the summer time when the clothing would be less and less showing off your ample chest. This prompt we are at a family reunion away from our hometown and we are up late drinking and smoking pot, getting our inhibitions lower and lower. We discuss our sexual history and get each other all hot before we decide to let our taboo desires become reality.

4) Older Neighbor - You've recently moved into the neighborhood after your divorce. I just finished my first semester at college and live in my parents basement during the summer. You have a direct view into our backyard and have taken a hobby of watching me work out in the early morning hours. Occasionally you ask me to help carry in groceries for you and today you ask if I could finish some yard work your landscapers forgot to finish....


Kinks include: incest, age play, oral, anal, rimming (giving &amp; recieving) dirty kissing, spanking, dirty rough sex, lactation

Limits are toilet stuff, rape, any violence and animal stuff. 


Hope someone out there finds these interesting enough to send a message. This will always be open no matter how old the post is."
52kbpf,2,2016-09-13,[M4F] Come Get Lucky This Morning!,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52kbpf/m4f_come_get_lucky_this_morning/,"*(Thanks to everyone who has responded to my previous roulette posts. I've decided to retool some things, and I hope you enjoy!)*

Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- AnnaSophia Robb
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

* 3 -- Nigella Lawson

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"
52keuy,75,2016-09-13,Blow by Blow Justice VIII,schoolgirlerror,Schoolgirlerror,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schoolgirlerror/comments/52keuy/blow_by_blow_justice_viii/,"The bar was gritty and dark, filled with off duty detectives nursing hangover cures like their first born child. Gabriella, back in her suit dress, lifted herself onto the barstool and placed her elbows on the counter. Blue bruises had already taken root on her arms. She winced as she moved, still feeling the punches to her belly. 



“To Hammer and Red’s,” I said. The bartender placed two dusty glasses in front of us, and at a nod from me, poured a thumb of Jameson’s into each. 



Gabriella touched her glass to mine and hesitated. I knocked the drink back, wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and screwed my eyes shut. The burning in my gullet was good. I’d missed the sensation of drinking. But this time it was Gabriella sat beside me, sipping anxiously, not Hammer with his belly-laughs. He used to drink like a fish, and it was the memory of him stumbling home beside me that made my next order a soda water. 



That earned me dirty looks from the detectives *and* the bartender.



“You did well, kid,” I said. “But the game plan’s changed now.” 



“You still want to go after Holt?” Gabriella said nervously. 



“You’re damned right I want to go after Holt. I’ve got nothing to lose. The firm’s in its death days, our clients are gone. Let me do one last thing. Let me represent you in this.” 



Gabriella stared into her glass as though it’d answer her problems.



“Those other women you contacted, let me try speaking to them.” I leaned towards her. “I’ll persuade them to let us depose them, or at least talk to them.” 



“You think you can do that?” 



“You’ll file the complaint at the courthouse. The circuit court, near the big firms. Not the district one, here.” 



“They won’t hear the case there—” 



“No, but you’ll be seen leaving the courthouse. I’ll scrounge up some press contacts.” 



“You want to get the press involved?” Gabriella blanched. She tipped back her head and swallowed the rest of her drink in one. I watched her throat move. She winced. 



“Yes,” I replied. “People should know he’s a scumbag.” 



“What about the photos?” Gabriella said. “If he releases them—”



“He’ll dig his own grave,” I said. “If he releases those photos once you’ve filed a case against him for harassment, it only proves what we’re claiming. You’re safe. You’ll be safe with me.” 



---------



I called Quince later that evening from the office, and asked him if he had any contacts at newspapers. 



“Nothing small, you understand? I’m talking somewhere attention grabbing.” I dug my hand into the packet of sunflower seeds. 



“Yeah, I know a Michael Malone at the Tribune that owes me a couple of favours,” Quince said. “Have you been drinking, William?” 



“Just the one,” I admitted. “Can you get him down to the Circuit Court tomorrow at four? There’ll be a young woman in a blue dress filing a harassment suit. He might want to ask her some questions, because the named defendant will ruffle some feathers.”



“What are you planning?” Quince asked. “Don’t do anything stupid. Don’t bite off more than you can chew.” 



“Nothing’s too big now,” I said. “If we lose this case, it doesn’t matter. Come the end of the month, I won’t be practising as an attorney.” 



“Don’t get yourself disbarred, kiddo,” Quince said heavily. 



“I won’t,” I assured him, but the feeling wasn’t there. 



Hanging up, I made my way down the stairs to the gym. It was mostly empty, just Paul with the dog tattoos sitting on the sofa. His arms and legs spread, I noticed he wasn’t dressed in sportswear. He wore a pair of dark jeans, and a buttoned-down shirt. His forearms were tanned and veined, sleeves rolled up to show the start of his biceps. 



“You going out?” I asked, ready to turn off the light. 



“Yeah,” he stood, thrusting his hands into his jeans pockets. “Just waiting for Gabriella.” 



“Gabriella?” I echoed.



“Coming!” 



As I said her name, she appeared. She fixed an earring in her ear and pushed her hair back with a hand. 



“How do I look?” she asked, self consciously pulling at the bottom of the dress she wore. For the first time, she wore neither sportswear or business wear. The dress was burgundy, tight fitted to show the muscles in her back. Her hair was down, still wet from a shower. She’d applied make up, looking older with dark eyes and a flick of neutral lip colour. Powder covered the scar, and I realised I missed it.



“Great,” Paul replied. 



I nodded. 



“Do you want me to turn off the lights?” Gabriella asked. She scooped her purse up from the sofa, and Paul withdrew his hands from his pockets and wiped them nervously on his jeans. I could see the hints of the dog tattoos at his collarbones, poking out from beneath the shirt. 



“Yes,” I said. “I’m leaving anyway.” 



“See you tomorrow, Mr Red,” she smiled, looping her arm through Paul’s. 



I stood there as they left, waiting for the overhead lights to click off. The orange street lamps filtered through the open grille, and I stared at the graffitied rainbow, wondering if the pot of gold had been here all along, and I’d never noticed. 




----------


My routine back to normal, I was back in the gym at five the next morning. I peeled the dressing from my wound anxiously, fed up of trying to keep it dry in the shower. The skin was puckered and a little red. I poked it, sucking through my teeth when it hurt. 



Good enough. 



With callisthenics still beyond me, I looped an elastic band around a clip on the wall. The other end I held in my fist. A couple of experimental tugs, feeling the elasticity, the pull against me. Then I settled into it. Shadowboxing, the resistance of the band working the unused muscles. 



Soon sweat poured off me. My hips ached, the balls of my feet tiring as I turned. I wasn’t satisfied. All my life I’d been coached against letting my anger get the best of me. 



“Anger’s for those who’ve got nothing better to fight for,” my Dad said. “But if you feel rage when you take a punch, that’s normal. That’s normal.” 



But now, I was angry. It ate away at me, mixing with acid guilt. Anger at Ulysses Holt and all the men like him. My punches came thick and fast, uppercutting away from the elastic band. For the first time, I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted the rules thrown out the window, just me and my opponent, circling each other with hands wrapped and fists ready. It would be dirty, bloody, and ugly, but the thought of standing up for what I believed in had adrenaline coursing through my veins. 



As the sun rose, I stopped. My injury ached, but my muscles hurt more, and I liked it. I stepped into the shower, turning the water up hot and stood beneath the jet, letting it pound against my shoulders. The steam rose up the tiles like the smoke of a cigarette. Scars littered my body. Fighting without gloves left fewer attorneys braindead, but it did leave its marks. My knuckles were swollen and purple, the testament to a thousand fights. 



My first had been one of Hammer’s clients. A woman called Cara Lou Evans. She’d been so small boned, standing between me and him. She looked like a scared little girl when we took her to court. The case was a divorce settlement turned ugly. Two broken people scrabbling over the tiny apartment they shared, and all the furniture they could claim. 



The husband had been uglier than a sack full of shit. He was a bruiser, bare knuckle fighting for the hell of it. Hammer could have taken him, but an old injury playing up put him out of action. I’d agreed to take his place; twenty-four years of age, fresh out of law school and looking at my heroes like Quince Lane and my Dad.



That got beat out of me pretty quick. The bruiser split my skin open over my cheekbones and broken my nose for the first time. The two minute rounds ended with me flat on my back, blinking back into consciousness. There’d been blood on my face, and the knuckles of my right hand had been split raw. 



My biggest fear had been disappointing Hammer. He’d picked me off the floor and wiped my face clean and told me that everyone lost their first. 



Everyone except Gabriella. 



I left the mirror fogged up as I dressed, unwilling to look at my reflection. I knew what I’d see: the grey hair of a man growing old, the left eyebrow that drooped where I’d been hit one too many times. The crooked nose and scarred face of a fighter who should have given up. 



When I realised I had begun to wallow in self-pity, I drew myself up a little straighter. I threw back a handful of sunflower seeds and left the office, stalking past the younger men who had arrived to use the gym. Paul was not amongst them, and there was no sign of Gabriella. 



The first girl on Gabriella’s list was Francine Gianni. She met me at a coffee shop downtown. A wire of a girl, she had cropped brown hair and wore a dark yellow dress. 



“What do you want?” she asked impatiently. “I haven’t got much time.” I guessed she worked as a secretary somewhere; fallen far from her dreams of being an associate at Carter, Spiffins and Cadger. Gabriella told me Francine was the intake above hers. 



“Thanks for agreeing to meet me.” I’d bought her a cup of black coffee, and got nothing for myself. I didn’t like the smell of it, and I missed my arabica.  



“I didn’t want to be seen with Gabriella,” Francine explained. She leaned forwards, and I caught the scent of her perfume. “He’s got me scared, and if he thinks we’re working together…” 



“Tell me what happened,” I said. “When you say ‘he,’ you mean Holt?” 



“Don’t use his name!” Francine’s eyes widened in fear. She glanced around the coffee shop, as if making sure no one was listening. It felt like a moment from a second-rate spy drama, but I could see her hands shaking when she reached for the coffee. 



“Photographs?” I said beneath my breath. 



The girl nodded. The cup clinked against the saucer as she set it down. “Videos, too, he says.” 



I grimaced. “Would you be willing to be deposed?” I asked. “We’d use your recorded testimony in court. You wouldn’t even have to appear, just lend your word to Gabriella’s.” 



“I can’t,” Francine shook her head. “I don’t… I feel sick, every day, knowing those photos are out there and I fell for that trap like some *stupid,* naïve little girl. But if they’re released, my entire life would be ruined. I’d never find a job again, I’d be a laughing stock. You have no idea what that’s like.” 



“I’ve spent my life defending women like you,” I said. “Men like him are everywhere. They’re predators, and what happened to you wasn’t your fault. You have to help me, and you have to help Gabriella. Otherwise, this will keep happening to other girls.” 



Francine gripped her coffee like an amulet. 



“How old are you, twenty-six?” I asked.

 

“Yes,” 



“Imagine another girl, younger than you. She’s twenty-one, or twenty-two, just starting her time at law school. She’s applying for internships. Maybe not the most physically intimidating girl out there. Just wants to make a difference, wants to defend people who can’t defend themselves. Then a man like Holt takes advantage of that. He sees she’s determined, that she wants to help people and he says: ‘you can do that, you just have to show me you’re willing to do what it takes.’ He's flattering. He's an older man, powerful, well connected. She does what he says... Does that sound familiar?” 



Francine nodded. She was close to tears. 



“Do you want her to go through that?” 



“I don’t.” Her voice was a whisper. 



“Good. Agree to testify.” 



“You’re the lawyer handling her case?” 



“Yes.” 



Francine took a deep breath. 



“I’ll do it,” she said. “No one should go through this.""

I met my girlfriend when we were still in engineering school in France. When we got together she had just broken things off with her ex with whom she had been for 2 years. She made the first move but I still had to work my ass off to make it so she would think I was more thant just a fling to get over her ex. Eventually things got pretty serious.

&amp;nbsp;

**The first breakup**

A little under a year after that, she went to Berlin for a six month internship and I went to Barcelona. I convinced her things could still work. She came to visit in Barcelona and then I went to Berlin where she broke up with me in horrible fashion. I had not managed to make her forget her ex.

&amp;nbsp;

**The second stint**


We stay in contact during the whole 6 months of the internship skyping very often and eventually we go back to France for our third and last year of engineering school. It takes me a while but I finally manage to make us get back together and a few months later we move in together. At that point I got seriously sick and I had to have nurse treatment at home and pain meds everyday. This lasted 6 months. I still tried my heart out to be there for her but I started to get very tired and I began to be more and more distant as I couldn't take the abuse she was throwing at me because she thought we weren't doing enough things together. She would pretend she would go to events with someone else to make me go. She would say very mean words, break stuff or even threaten to break up so that I would do more for her. I thinkpoint the relationship was very bad  at that but I was hoping that it would get back on track once I finished school and I was healed. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The second breakup**


School came to and end for me and she went to study for another year in England while I was transfered in Rouen (North-West France) for my first assignement as a civil servant. She broke up with me soon after we moved out of the appartement we had lived in together and a few days before our graduation ceremony. I tell I don't want to hear from her anymore and that I really wanted to move on this time around.

&amp;nbsp;

**The third stint**


One year after that, she comes back to France and is transfered to Paris as she is a civil servant too and we casually meet up one day when I had a meeting in the very building she works in. Only time we had talked in between the break up and that was during the attacks in Paris and I called her to know if she was fine. We ended up having sex and getting back together. I felt like that's what I had always wanted but I was too proud to admit. 

&amp;nbsp;


**My struggle with anxiety and possibly ADHD**

Things start off very well, we have good times and we see each other 2 to 3 week ends every month. The problem is I had started getting really depressed a little while before we got back together. I have trouble being as efficient as I'd like to be at work and I think it's due to undiagnosed ADHD. Because of that I'm really stressed out at work, most of the time and even though I do a good job even according to my boss, I still get very ashamed when I come up across ""easy things"" that I cannot do. When I started getting worrying, I went to a see a physician and I now have a two date appointment in November and December to have a crack at a diagnosis so I can finally go on with my life.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tough love**

The first time I brought up the subject with my girlfriend she went all ""tough love"" on me, saying as long as I had two legs and two arms I was fine. Saying one of her exes was a looser for being anxious. I remember that night I got so stressed out after we had a big argument, she said the next day that my teeth were rattling during the night but thought nothing of it. There was no way to make her understand that I was having a really hard time and I needed help which contributed to me getting pushed over the edge once again and I started getting distant like I did in the past. She almost broke up with me again at that point, but we worked through it and she said she wants to be with me and we should make plans for a future together. I agreed to moving in with her  a year from now when i can change jobs and she started accepting that I might really need help and not just that tough love bullshit. The thing is she is not really willing to help me, she wants to be sure I'm going to be there for her but she says she doesn't want to help apart from being there when I go to get diagnosed. She gets very upset when I need time on my own and if don't send very many texts for a day or two. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Tough Expectations**


Now I feel like she's one more source of pressure in my life and even though I still like being with her, I don't know if it's worth it. I have trouble holding the rest of my life together and I don't want to make empty promises that I won't be able to fulfil a year from now if my life is  still a mess. I'm really counting on my medical appointment to help me sort out my life and help me move on from that dark place I am in but I don't know if I should really put all my eggs in the same basket. It feels like she always wants more from me. She brings up stuff between us and says her friends think I'm not good enough for her. 

&amp;nbsp;

**I am 100% confused**


It's all getting really blurry for me right now and I don't even know if she is right for me anymore. She can be very harsh sometimes and that makes me resent her in a way. She doesn't shy away from saying mean things about me and my past times. She says I'm a loser for playing video games as much as I do, especially violent ones even though I live a pretty active lifestyle and have good friends. 

On the other hand, she can be really sweet, we have some very good moments and at one point I could really picture myself fouding a family with her. I really enjoy being with her most of the time but I don't really know if all the hard stuff is due to me having issues or if it's just not meant to be between us. 


&amp;nbsp;


I'm sorry, this is a shitload of text and it might not be that very well written since english is my second language but I thought I'd come here to get some help/perspective on this. 

&amp;nbsp;


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I finally got in a healthy relationship (even if long distance) with the girl I had been on and off with for 4 years. I commited to a lot. I started to get really anxious about life and work. I Told my gf I thought I had ADHD and was very depressed. She plays it off and gives me tough love. I got to a dark place, got more distant. Our relationship degraded. I commited to more to save it but I still feel like I'm on my own and she only adds more weight on my shoulders"

My question is what is the IT job market like in Spokane? I personally work in the Tech/IT sector and was wondering how the job prospects are there for that type of career, especially in some of the entry level developer positions?

For reference I do IT/Help desk and Data Analysis, but I'm also doing an internship for Full Stack Web Dev at the moment. I'm sure Spokane is no tech hub like Portland or Seattle but I was just curious how much opportunity there is for it here.

Thanks for any feedback."

I started on here at the begining of summer and really enjoyed doing CICO until mid-August when my partner returned from his summer internship.

Note: I am the only one really concerned about my weight, he is much healthier/fit than I am and has a much better metabolism. We are both in college and live separately. In my living situation we have communal food that is typically more junk food with healthy, prepared dinners on weeknights that are out of my control."

Selina: A girl's gotta eat, right? I think it would be well within the realm of possibility for her to take payment for sexual acts. Whether they were from former classmates, older patrons or anyone else for that matter. Besides, maybe she can steal a little something at the end of the day, right?

Barbara: Crazy and sexy is a wicked combination. I think that she would happily play with a dangerous bar room type with a big motorcycle and bulging biceps. Or maybe she'll seduce another cop to get him on her side in the long run? Either seems probably to me.

Other females: Ivy, Fish Mooney, Harley Quinn (AU)

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

My SO (24f) and I (23m) meet in college and have been dating for over two years now. After she graduated she moved back to Massachusetts. I am finishing up my masters in Ohio and will be done in August. Things have been fine since she moved back home. We plan on seeing each other at least every month and it has been working. Recently I had an internship in another country for the summer. We got in an argument, just like any couple does, and unfortunately her parents over heard it. We are now forbidden from seeing each other and it seems like there is no way to change her parents minds. 

Does anyone have any sort of first hand advice they could give? She is the love of my life. We have nearly planned out the rest of our lives together. I don't want the reason it ends to be because her parents have decided to ban me from her life. What do I do? I'm very lost."

Every waking moment of everyday I have songs in my head that I want to create. 

Since then, I have set up my own personal studio with the money that I made from my Software Engineering internship. I built my own PC, using Ableton as my DAW, and purchased the Komplete Kontrol s25 MIDI board as my MIDI controller. 

I have played guitar for almost 7 years now but that is not going to be my main focus around my music project. I have played some piano but am no expert. I briefly practiced drums and can play some simple beats in the pocket.

After playing with Ableton for a couple of weeks, I feel pretty comfortable creating things and developing ideas using the session view then refining them later but not sure where to begin for the mastering process. A friend of mine has learned how to master tracks and his tracks sound completely different after doing this.

I know I have a lot to learn and a lot of money to invest but just not sure where to begin. Any advice fellow music makers?"
52ljrf,5,2016-09-13,Alcohol and Xanax advice,madridista931,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/52ljrf/alcohol_and_xanax_advice/,"Hello everyone,

I have been taking Xanax daily for around a year and a couple of months for severe panic disorder and agoraphobia along with 20 MG of fluoxetine. I take around 0.25 during the day and 0.5 to sleep. I understand the daily use of Xanax is not the best solution however it has saved my life in one way or another as I was treated my anxiety with alcohol which led to serious alcoholism.

I have been on an internship abroad for 6 months now and j am going back home for a month or two where I will see my childhood friends. I used to go out a lot with them back when j was drinking but the last time I saw them I started not seeing them to be less present in the alcohol/pub scenes since I stopped alcohol.I don't want to lose my friends and I am going to put some effort to go out with them but I always have this anxiety of the excuse of not drinking. I am thinking of just ordering one beer and sip it slowly to avoid any questions, there is nothing worse for me than having to explaining why I am not drinking and I really don't want to open up about my personal problems. 

I know that I am not going to go back to alcohol it's been already 1 year and a half and I am not even interested in drinking but maybe just ordering a beer and barely finishing it can make me feel more comfortable and avoid being a total outcast

I Just wanted to know whah you would do in my place and if you ever drank a beer with 0.25 Xanax or drank a beer and then take 0.5 Xanax before sleeping. Will drinking half of it affect my health in any way, is it not worth it? 

Thank you "
52lmmg,1,2016-09-13,"Me [20/F] with my friend [21 M] of 2 years, distance after I hung out with his GF, need advice on how to fix friendship",musicfestivalfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52lmmg/me_20f_with_my_friend_21_m_of_2_years_distance/,"I met my friend Ted at a concert the summer after freshman year of college. I was there with my BFF. We all got there super early, so we started talking to Ted and realized we had a lot in common such as the music and activities we liked. We got Ted's number to keep in contact after the show, where I would text him occasionally about music or a new song that came out.

 
I found out that Ted was going to the same music festival that I was later in June. As we were talking about our plans for the festival he asked me if I was going with anyone special, to which I replied yes I'm going with my BF. He didn't seem put off by that and everything in our friendship continued like normal. I went to the festival and managed to meet up with Ted for 1 of the days of the 4 day festival. He met my BF and we hung out around a stage for an afternoon, watching the show and shooting the shit. The last day of the festival my BF ate a shroom truffle that a random person he met in the forest gave him (smh). I lost contact with him that day while he was off tripping somewhere and met back up with Ted. We hung out at the festival, got front row for Tycho's set, and in general had a great time.


 Our friendship continued into my sophomore year of college. I would host parties at my house on campus, and Ted would come from where he lived (about an hour away) to come party and have a good time with our friends. Ted got along great with my whole crew, even my extended friends. I could tell he loved hanging out here, and I knew that he didn't have a group of friends back where he went to school that were as interested in music and festivals as our group. Me, Ted, and two of our others friends went to another music festival in September. Again, we had a great time. I eventually broke up with my boyfriend in October. Ted and I would still hangout, at this point I would consider him one of my best friends. He never asked me out in the time I was single, or made any moves.


In December, Ted moved to a different part of the US because he transferred colleges. Before Ted left he said something to the effect of we have a great friendship, nothing happened because I felt the timing was always off, yada yada, lets always be friends. I agreed. During the time I knew Ted, we were always strictly platonic, no hand holding, no kissing, nothing ever happened when we were drunk, no cuddling, etc. I treated him like my brother. 


Even after Ted moved, we were still pretty close. We would text pretty frequently, and sometimes call where he would give me an update on his life post-move. That next summer he came to visit me a couple times, again for a music festival. I too visited him twice that year, also for music festivals. The first time I visited him, he had a girlfriend and we went to the festival with his GF and her friend. I think they had sort of a rocky relationship, from what I could tell of the visit. I think his GF liked him more than he liked her, and they broke up a couple weeks after I left. 


The second visit, about 4 months later, he had a new GF, Rachel. This pairing seemed better and they seemed good as a couple. We went to a music festival together, me, Ted, and Rachel. We were all good until the last day of the festival. There was some drama because I won a meet &amp; greet and only took Ted with me to the meet the artist. Rachel also won a meet &amp; greet, and she took all 3 of us to meet the artist. She was only allowed to bring 3 people though because she knew the lady organizing the meet &amp; greet. I had no such pull and could only bring 1 other person. This started some sort of drama because I guess I was effectively pulling Ted and Rachel apart? While me and Ted went to the meet &amp; greet, Rachel was front row for some set, and the DJ that also she DM's on twitter sometimes kissed her cheek. This furthered the drama because then Ted was pissed at Rachel.  After this music festival drama, I left my visit while they were still fighting. Rachel's goodbye to me was very hurried and awkward. I felt kinda bad as I was leaving, but I didn't really feel like I did anything wrong so I didn't feel too bad about it. 


Fast forward to this summer, I was doing an internship in a new city, that happened to be close to where Rachel's family is from. She was staying there over the summer so we ended up meeting up a couple times to go to some concerts/clubs with DJs. We had a great time, totally bonded, and realized we had sooo much in common, down to the MMORPG we both used to be obsessed with. I was so happy that we got along because I thought yay now we can all be friends and it won't be awkward, we'll just be a big happy family. WRONG.


Ever since I hung out with Rachel 1 on 1, I get the vibe that Ted doesn't like it. After I posted a picture on Instagram of Rachel and I, Ted stopped liking my Instagram pictures, where as he used to like them all. And I know he still goes on Instagram because he still posts. I feel petty writing that as a reason, but Ted is not the kind of guy to openly air his grievances with someone. He keeps it inside and doesn't say anything to keep the peace. 


I haven't seen Ted since the time I visited him and went to the music festival with the drama. We had talked about Ted sometime visiting me in the city where I was interning (he claims its his fav city in the USA), or him visiting back home where we went to school and meeting up there. Neither of these happened and I'm honestly  hurt. It's not like he didn't have money for travel, he traveled across the continental US and went to like 3 different music festivals, all in different regions of the US. I really valued our friendship and went at lengths to keep it alive, like flying to visit him etc. Now its like he's not even trying. 


I'd really like to save this friendship, or atleast get an explanation why we don't talk anymore. Reddit, what should I do? Should I call him? Text him? I wish I could do it in person but I never see him and probably never will :(

 
  **tl;dr**: Became bestfriends with a guy, was one of my closest friends throughout college. It was platonic, but after distance because he moved and my interactions with his GF I feel that we are no longer friends. What can I do to save this friendship?"
52m3sb,1,2016-09-13,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52m3sb/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
52mdra,19,2016-09-13,"Korean business culture is disgusting, cruel, nonsensical, and petty. This company is a culture clash disaster and it's driving me insane.",CashingOutInShinjuku,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52mdra/korean_business_culture_is_disgusting_cruel/,"Fuck you. How dare you look down on the American style of conducting business when the way you go about things is also deeply flawed. I've never seen middle aged men openly cower before their bosses like anxious teenagers at their first internship. The way they squirm and sweat is the most pitiful thing I've ever seen. It's so undignified that it disgusts me. You should see the way these grown men hop out of their desks and literally run to their boss' office when their names are barked in a cruel, emotionless monotone. ""Neeeh"" they say with great anticipation - that's Korean for ""yes (master)."" Some of these men are separated by only a few years of age, and just one level of superiority in the corporate hierarchy. Yet they address their betters as though they are peasants kneeling before a king.

Sorry but that's just not how things work in this country. We respect our leaders **more** when they're capable of treating everyone with respect. When an executive is humble and down to earth enough to have a conversation with a junior analyst, that's a good thing. Unlike you, he isn't worried about maintaining an impenetrable aura of superiority to support his authority. Americans aren't warm and friendly because we're superficial. It's all about showing people, no matter how you actually feel about them, that you respect them on some level and want to treat them well. That's a quality we value, a quality we judge people by. And that's why we think you're all uptight assholes. We go on a corporate outing, and even the most powerful American in this company is too far beneath you to share a few drinks with. We try to get to know you, and you push us away. 

And then there's the disastrous effect their obsessively collectivist mindset has on business proceedings. In the right context, emphasizing the needs of the group over the needs of the individual is undeniably a good thing. For example, Koreans don't say ""you're welcome"" in their native language, because in a sense, that's acknowledging that you feel that you deserve recognition. Instead they say ""no, no, it's not a big deal."" I think that's cool. 

What's not cool is that I'm pretty sure these crazy fuckers need documented approval from half of South Korea for EVERYTHING, all the way down to wiping their asses. And they'd probably have to wipe their boss' ass first. It's like the world is going to end if  approval isn't expressed by everyone who could possibly be affected by even the most insignificant decision, and then a few more people who have nothing to do with it whatsoever for good measure. This bullshit makes the typical corporate red tape issues exponentially worse. Email chains about tiny details are circulated for months, until someone has the fucking balls to step up and pull the trigger on a decision that should have been made by two people: the action owner and his boss. 

That's right. I said his boss. Because they're unbelievably sexist. There are around 100 people in this office and only a handful are women. Most of these corporate drones have wives but they're halfway around the world, and haven't been seen for months. Some of them even have not-so-secret american mistresses. They prioritize their careers over everything, to a point that I consider to be truly fanatical. They put their families through hell and joke about how unhappy their kids and wives are as though it's their fault. For example, even if their families have been dragged across the ocean to whatever foreign country they've been assigned to for a few years, they never see them. There is this fucked up rule that you can't leave before your boss leaves. And if he goes out drinking on the company dime, which they often do, you can't stop until your boss does. Even if he's a known alcoholic. Which they often are. So, if you're a younger employee, you're waiting for six or seven people to leave before you can. So you work a 14 hour day. And then you look down on Americans for being ""lazy"" because we do 9-5. I'm sorry we love our families. I'm sorry we have lives. 

The craziest thing though is that some of them TOOK UP SMOKING just to smoke with their bosses ten times per day. A rude bark is emitted from an office and six people materialize, having grabbed their coats and cigarettes at a moment's notice. It's so fucked. One of them told me that his wife wants him to quit... but he's afraid that he'll be fired. 

This is a rare case where I feel comfortable saying that an aspect of someone's culture is wrong and they should be ashamed of it. Seriously, all of this is just so horrible. Korean business culture is oppressive and all consuming. What a sad way to live out life. DO NOT work for a Korean company."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Star Wars RP.

- Next week (9/19) is my first week back on campus and classes.  My calendar is extremely booked, and I'll be catching up on what I've missed while away.  Although my response time will be better than this week, I won't be quite back to normal yet.
- Over the next three weeks, our beloved /u/projectficm (Jordan) will be transitioning from her roll as Project Fi community manager to her dream job on another Google product team!  Don't fear though, her account will be taken over by her amazing replacement, Alena!  Maybe I'll have Alena introduce herself once she's all caught up.  :)  During the transition, I'll still sharing things very frequently from this subreddit to the team, and I'll help cover on announcements if needed.  I'll share one fun fact though:  she's been a Project Fi subscriber for over a year!

Finally, I wanted to start a discussion on our subreddit and content.  Please let me know in the comments if you're satisfied or not with the content on our subreddit.  We get PM's sometimes about concerns, so I wanted to make sure our community was happy with the way that our mod team was running things.

That's a wrap!  As always, please feel while I'm in and out to mention me on threads you think deserve my attention or PM me *with a link to your thread in question* if you need assistance.

Best,

Ziggy"
52n3zb,22,2016-09-13,"""She wants a Half Cappuccino Half Latte""",kaaaaaaaaahn,TalesFromYourBarista,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBarista/comments/52n3zb/she_wants_a_half_cappuccino_half_latte/,"I live in one of the weirdest/trashiest cities in the U.S.  Currently I work at a small Pastry/coffee shop that looks like a hole in the wall.  Only locals know about it and we rarely advertise.

Now, I'm totally new to this.  It's my third month of being a ""barista,"" and training literally consisted of ""this is latte, this is cappuccino, this is macchiato, go.""  And it seemed too simple.

Then this woman came in with 10 coffee orders and on the list was a small half cappuccino/half latte with skim.  I text my boss and save it for last while I make the other stuff.  All she tells me is that ""it's probably the same woman, it's our landlord's mother, and she only likes me.  Just put more foam than steamed milk.""
I'm already hating the woman.

So I do it and send her on her way.
The woman who I presume the order was for, was irate.  But she came back three hours later to complain.  She was shoving her coffee in my face.  She said that it didn't wake her up. She was livid.

Our small is two shots of espresso and our large is three.  I do time them out and she says that she didn't pay for two shots but four.
""Something is wrong here.""
I pulled up her receipt, and the list the intern brought over.

She complained the foam wasn't the same, and talking about the milk.  I had gone grocery shopping yesterday and confirmed that the milk was fine.  She wanted to see my manager, she was out of town.  Eventually, I just give her two shots straight without her asking, in the same cup she shoved in my face, and she seemed okay.

Still though, I really hate people who try to run you. I did it all with a smile on my face and agreed with her until she got aggressive and I showed her the receipts she ""lost."" There's only ever one person working in our shop and sometimes they get so demanding when I have to do ten different things at the same time. 

Or like today, when people bring their whole family into a place that doesn't even have a bathroom and the only tables are outside. They ordered five paninis (we have one george foreman grill and tell the customers it will be 15-20 minutes for that many sandwiches) 5 cappuccinos and 2 lattes and two  frappes one caramel and one cookies and cream (we have one blender and it's definitely a pain to clean).  In theory, it could be timed perfectly and I can get everything out in 10 minutes, possibly.  But if I get another customer, a delivery, or if they keep ordering more on the fly while I'm rushing between the back of house and front of house, it's going to take longer.  I tell them straight up everytime.

The woman who did that today never yells or says anything, but she snaps her fingers and drums on the glass case for pastries.  It physically pains me to hear it.  Like, my heart sort of constricts and I have to force myself not to roll my eyes or show some sign of irritation.  She also orders pastries on the fly as I'm trying to make her sandwiches.  She just points and says this one while my back is turned.    

We're a super casual place so I don't get mad if no one tips, but I did give this family more attention because they bought so much. Prebus the table, get them glasses of water (because they're free) hand out napkins when her baby knocks something over. Not only for the hope of a tip but because it makes my life easier when things run smoothly and there's less of a mess.

And even with a $40 tab, she tips the cash change of $0.06.

These are all open for discussion and I have photos of how I would like your character to appear as. 

1) Aunt/Nephew - Ever since I went through puberty I've occasionally masterbated about my Aunt and her giant tits. One summer I get to stay over for a month while I intern at my new college job. What we both don't know is our mutual desire for each other. We both take secret peeks at each other in our moments of undress during the morning and night and I could've sworn I saw your reflection in the mirror when I was showering.

2) Wife's Cousin - My wife and I have no sex life at all which makes me look for hook ups at night using Tinder. One night I come across my wife's cousin's profile and against my better judgement I swipe right but to my surprise it tells me we are a match. That's where we can start from there with a simple message in the app which will lead to us meeting.

3) Cousins - We have always been close growing up and being close in age. I've always pleasured myself to you and your giant tits and loved the summer time when the clothing would be less and less showing off your ample chest. This prompt we are at a family reunion away from our hometown and we are up late drinking and smoking pot, getting our inhibitions lower and lower. We discuss our sexual history and get each other all hot before we decide to let our taboo desires become reality.

4) Older Neighbor - You've recently moved into the neighborhood after your divorce. I just finished my first semester at college and live in my parents basement during the summer. You have a direct view into our backyard and have taken a hobby of watching me work out in the early morning hours. Occasionally you ask me to help carry in groceries for you and today you ask if I could finish some yard work your landscapers forgot to finish....


Kinks include: incest, age play, oral, anal, rimming (giving &amp; recieving) sloppy kissing, spanking, dirty rough sex, lactation

Limits are toilet stuff, rape, any violence and animal stuff. 


Hope someone out there finds these interesting enough to send a message. This will always be open no matter how old the post is."
52nt4c,2,2016-09-13,I''m afraid it's not gonna work out,1812961,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52nt4c/im_afraid_its_not_gonna_work_out/,"So bare with me because this is a bit of a long story. I went to college for 4 years and just graduated. My time there was actually pretty solid, I overall had friends and got good grades though with some of the harder classes I think I only succeeded because I got a shit ton of help from those around me. So fast forward to when I graduate and I'm ready to enter the workforce. I get a job at a small company in the city near I live. The first thing I notice is I'm having a lot of trouble picking up everything they're teaching, and second that I am absolutely miserable. I have done an internship and some camp work which I enjoyed so I figured it was the job. I wound up resigning from that job around 2 weeks later using an excuse that some other stuff came up (stupid I know). The resignation was not pretty and the boss had several choice words of course to say about it especially since I seemed so enthusiastic beforehand. That night I remember being in a nasty fog and depressed but that went away as I began to apply to other jobs. However as time has gone on all of my fears and negative thoughts are starting to rear their ugly head and I'm having a lot of trouble getting rid of them. I feel like I'm destined to never be happy with whatever job I get...or that I will never get one. As I watch everyone around me go on to great things, I'm stuck in a loop. Worst is I feel like whatever job I get I will not be adequate and not be able to learn it...and will struggle too keep up until I'm fired. This has put me in a depression the likes of which I have never remotely been in before. There's been a couple of days where I have thought about ending it, especially if I'm just destined to be miserable which makes me very afraid. I'm afraid that I might actually go through with it which would be the worst thing in the world to my parents who have provided me with nothing but love and support the whole time. I absolutely hate feeling this way and I want to get out of this hole. But I'm terrified that I will fail or never get the chance and if I fail I'm afraid of what could happen. Thanks for hearing me out if you got to the end."

52o347,2,2016-09-13,Struggling with keto,magdalenasophie,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/52o347/struggling_with_keto/,"Hi all,
 
First of all I want to say I am convinced the ketogenic diet is right for me. I am an overweight female (5'2 ~162lb) suffering from PCOS (polycystic ovaries, goes hand in hand with strong carb sensitivity). 
I have tried it earlier this summer but wasn't careful enough with my electrolytes so I ended up giving up early on. A couple of weeks ago I started again and kept a steady supply of broth and things in my pantry. I didn't get any drowsiness, I had reasonable amounts of energy and about 4 days in my keto sticks showed a pink tinge! So that was good. However I was SO hungry all the time! I had such a huge appetite it was insane and I couldn't stop stuffing my face! This happened almost every day, but even more so around days I was exercising. I wasn't even craving carbs initially, I was just eating everything keto and then after 5-6 days I craved fruit and other carbs so bad that I fell off the wagon. I think some of it was mental as well, because I had been dieting (low carb with some fruit) for a few months prior to that as well, having lost some weight, and I got sick of obsessing with food and my intake all the time. So I just caved.
I have to add that I'm going through a really stressful time at the moment as well as I am finishing an internship and applying for graduate school.
I guess what I am asking is this: 
Can keto help me stop thinking about food all the time? I obsess about it, and then I lose motivation because it just gets too tiring and takes over my life. I don't mind preparing food for the days ahead, I'm really quite organised, but it gets to the point where I start thinking about food first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I don't want this. Ideally I wish I could never think about food until my stomach rumbles and tells me I'm hungry. Can keto help with this?

How can I stop missing fruit? (I really love fruit)

Will these insane cravings stop? 
And will I lose a bunch of weight? 
I really, really, really need this to happen. I've lost about 10lb and I'm happy about that but I want to lose another 30 or so. 

I'd appreciate any experience/advice you can share. Thanks so much!


EDIT: By the way I realised that things are much better now that I'm eating more meat. Before I was eating lots of eggs and cheese and just the odd bit of bacon once in a while (because I currently dont have access to a kitchen). Has anyone noticed this too? "
52o5du,2,2016-09-13,[M4F] Lucky Tuesday Night,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52o5du/m4f_lucky_tuesday_night/,"*(Thanks to everyone who has responded to my previous roulette posts. I've decided to retool some things, and I hope you enjoy!)*

Good evening, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- AnnaSophia Robb
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner

* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning night!"

52ohqh,0,2016-09-13,How Apple's Iphone 7 Reveal Should Have Gone Down,TheGeekPoet,funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/52ohqh/how_apples_iphone_7_reveal_should_have_gone_down/,"September 2016- Cuptertino, California:

Tim Cook walks on stage to loud applause. He steps before the crowd of nerds and takes a deep breath before shouting, “Shut up! Shut the fuck up! And sit down!”

An immediate silence rips through the crowd. Bewildered reporters look at each other. Someone amongst the crowd lets out a nervous bout of laughter. Tim responds promptly with “I SAID Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Did I stutter? Not another goddamn word.” A solitary but unnecessary photographic flash is the last sign of rebellion. No one else dares to push their luck.

Wearing the expression of a man who’s one traffic jam away from annihilating his entire family, Tim raises his hand far above his head. Held within his furious grip is an iphone of some model or another. The monolithic projection screen behind him lights up without warning, a close-up view of the device enduring his crushing grasp appears for all the room may see.

Tim throws the phone to the ground. He jumps on it. He kicks it so hard that it goes flying off the stage where it hits some geek reporter in the head. A small drop of bright red blood trails down from his brow. More from hurt feelings than anything else, the reporter finds himself resisting the urge to cry, deciding to save his tears for the 101.

Tim races to the edge of the stage, just barely resisting the urge to leap into the crowd and continue his abuses. He recomposes himself with an obviously false sense of calm before whispering into his wearable microphone, “Give it back…… GIVE IT THE FUCK BACK!”

Spittle falls from his mouth.

An anonymous and shaking hand raises the phone back to Tim who wastes no time in snatching it back. He looks somewhere off stage. “Come on. Come the fuck on already.” A nervous (and faintly bruised) intern rushes on stage with a glass of water in one hand and a stool in the other. He sets one atop the other. The feed on the projection screen settles in on the glass.

Tim paces around the stool, sighing. Finally, his lips pursed, his jaw working like he’s chewing his own tongue like some men might tobacco, he whispers into the mic, “Fuck all of you,” before dropping the phone into the glass of water.

The iphone continues to operate without showing any signs of physical trauma or technical distress. The smallest amount of blood floats within the glass like red ink correcting mistakes of the past. “And what do we say to that, Siri?”

Like from the nebulous lips of a soulless woman having just learned the meaning of fear, electronic words echo from beneath the water, “Thank you, Timmy. May I please have another?”

Many wondered if the AI’s voice hadn’t actually shaken the slightest bit.

Tim looks out over the crowd. “Jobs… And all of you… Can suck my dick.”

After Tim Cook marches off the platform and kicks open the emergency exit nearest him, the stage speakers ring out one last line before being powered off: “I want my fucking stock’s worth back to what it should be before I reach my car or I’m cancelling the whole damn line.”"

52pqi4,7,2016-09-14,[How To/AMA]Driving instructor in Belgium,R3dw0lF,motobe,https://www.reddit.com/r/motobe/comments/52pqi4/how_toamadriving_instructor_in_belgium/,"A few of you were/are interested in knowing how to become a driving instructor and what not. I currently have 'brevet II (car)' and 'Brevet IV (motorcycle)'. So here's a small explanation of what to expect and how to go about it. 

There are 2 ways to become a driving instructor: self study and by taking (theory) classes in a recognized school (not persé a driving school, Syntra does classes too). What's the difference, well one's free the other you have to pay BUT you get a reduced number of intership hours you have to do. I took classes and feel like it's actually worth it. You get classes from decent teachers who explain the finer details and nuances in the laws and help you on your way. Prices vary for the classes but i recon you'll be set for 500€ or less. 

You have to pass several exams in which the classes prepare you or you can study on your own for:

* a written theory exam on the road code/law and mechanics of the vehicle you want to become instructor for (motorcycle/car/truck/bus/...)
* if you pass the written examen you get to go to the next round: an oral theory examen on the same subjects: road code/low and mechanics. This exam will go more in detail as the written exam.

If you pass both the exams you can start your internship in a local driving school, you get a document 'stage toelating' which is valid for 3 years. you have to take your final exam (more on this later) within this period or you have to do the 2 previous exams and your internship again. During the intership you have to do min 250 hours of unpaid/low paid hours (more on that later) or more depending on if you took classes or not. The internship is generally divided in phases:

* Phase 1: you follow experienced instructors and take not of how they teach, how the student responds, ... and also where to drive around for what experience/knowledge level of student.
* Phase 2: you get to teach the student but the experience instructors tags along, corrects you when wrong and gives tips and pointers where needed.
* Phase 3: You get to teach the student without anyone following you.

Depending on how good you are and if the driving school director and your mentor trust you, phase 1 and 2 can be pretty short with a minimum of i forgot how many hours. YOU have to keep track of everything btw. In most drivings schools you **don't** get paid if a licensed instructor has to accompany you, the moment you go out on your own you get paid at about 50%. 

If you've done sufficient hours of intership you can apply for your third exam: the model class. This is divided in 3 parts: 

* Here you have to draw a card and this will give you the theme of your class (each license has a specific set of classes set out that you have to be able to teach). This can be: starting/stopping, turning, parking, specific maneouvres, preparation and check up of the vehicle, ... Of this you have to do a written preparation in a certain amount of time (i think you get an hour or so) and then you have to hand everything over to the judges. 

* After the written part you have to actually teach the theme you received, you're student will be an experienced examinator playing the bad student and you will also be joined by a pedagoog looking for methodogical errors and such. 

* if you get this far there a final part: you and your judges get to go on the road. The examinator will be driving the vehicle which you want to teach. You will be following him or sitting next to him depending on the vehicle. The pedagoog will be next to you watching your every step, judging you and staring at you. The 'student' will do errors in his driving (technique and things such as speeding/wrong position/...) you have to correct him correctly. You also have to have a route prepared to take of about 30 minutes which included: zone 30, roundabouts, bigger roads, town centers, ... a bit of everything. (you have to hand in your prepared route at the start of the day. 

If you pass all these exams and steps then and only then you get to receive your license and work at a licensed driving school. 
For my first license (car) i started taking classes in September 2011 and received my license a year later in October 2012. Mind you i have a full time job so i did take about 3 - 4 months to complete my internship and apply for the 'model class'.  For motorcycle it also took me about a year as it take me longer to reach my intership hours (weather conditions/...). I never failed an exam (yet) so i didn't have to retake an exam, but quite a few have to retake certain exams. 

**important notice: for motorcycle instructor you have to take a 4 day course on motorcycle driving and how to teach driving a motorcycle. This is pricey but if you're lucky and already have contacts/work in a driving school they may pay it for you (they did in my case as i already worked there as car driving instructor). I think it's about 600-700€ depending on certain factors.**

Another important factor : pay. You won't get rich teaching. We have a fixed income so you can't ask for a raise. The pay is fixed by the goverment and at the moment is around 13,96€ per hour (gross :-( so take into account taxes you might get 10€ or something like that). People with the license to teach theory classes get extra (about 14,18€/h or something similar)

**Why do i do it?**
I like the social contact with people from all types of classes/types/... and interacting with them AND trying to get through to them so they can actually learn something. Not everybody picks stuff up at the same pace and with the same explanations. How you teach will change how they learn and how fast they learn. 

When I started I had a lonely desk job with few social contacts and this was a welcome change. Now it's more like a (badly) paid hobby. I already work full time at my regular job (40 hours min. per week) and do about 6 - 10 hours per week. (some weeks more, some weeks less depending on my personal schedule). In my time of it may go to 20-26 hours per week. Depending on the month i earn about 200 - 500€ on top of my regular wage which is a nice extra. 

Personally i wouldn't do it full time as i think it'll get boring too fast too furious/soon but well that's just my opinion. It's also my back up plan for when i should loose my regular job, i'm pretty sure i can get full time at the school where i work pretty soon. 

During 2016/2017 I will study and try and get a new drivers license and then my 'brevet/license V' for teaching trucks (C+E) so i have to take the written and oral exams, intership and the model class. In time I might actually try to get my 'Brevet III theory' and 'Brevet I (director)' which would allow me to start my own driving school (never say never).
I also take courses 'bochtenstages' and such once in a while to improve my own level (never good enough) and perhaps I might do stuff like that on my own in the (distant) future. At the moment my own level isn't good enough in my opinion. 

*side note: legislation concerning the procedure has slightly changed since i started so (more internship hours than when i started) the hours i stated above should be correct. I think...*

So if you've got any remarks/questions or whatever: ask away! (people who want to take private classes pm me ;-))

52qist,0,2016-09-14,"All The Millennials With Sh**ty Dead-End Jobs, Please Stand Up!",carterwu,small_business_ideas,https://www.reddit.com/r/small_business_ideas/comments/52qist/all_the_millennials_with_shty_deadend_jobs_please/,"- 5 Reasons Why Being A Creative Millennial Is Exhausting

1. Sucky Job Market

Most of my 20-something and 30-something-yr-old artsy fartsy friends (and myself included), have notoriously been stuck in the same, lowdown-dirty-shame situation for some period of years. The 9-5 hustle-bustle. That is, until we're somehow able to ""break free"" Ariana Grande-style, and say ""goodbye"" to the 9-5s and ""hello"" to hopefully anything else. And I do mean mostly ANYthing. There's a few reasons why this issue has been a one-way ticket to struggleville for this generation.

Unfortunately, many of us went to school with high hopes of successfully migrating into the real world. And this, after 4 years of arduous work at a University or 2 years at a mediocre community college for a creative degree, where mom and dad could comfortably helicopter-parent us to a fiery, WWE choke-hold-like, christian-summer-camp-similar death. All that, only to find out that the jobs we could seriously qualify for, were ones that were already taken by those that were fortunate and unfortunate enough to precede us. 


The skills we amassed while in our utopic collegic land, were nothing short of $100,000+ worth of mostly-empty promises of an okay to moderately-okay 3 person, 1BR, 1Bath, 1 disreputable landlord kind of life. The inevitable is that most of us would end up on our parents couches or some fratty parallel version of that, directly after graduation; maybe slumming it for 6 months to a year, and sending out literally (I know) hundreds of jobs applications and resumes to places where we don't even know what we'd actually be doing, but we do it anyway. Then once we get that prized internship or coveted entry-level position where there are ""opportunities to grow with an upbeat, budding company"", you realize the fullest extent of your dead-end situation. You continuously push toward management opportunities and you're fought with, ""Yeah, don't expect to really 'grow' here. This isn't that kind of place."" I was literally told that once at a job a few years ago - how reassuring! And this is after you've sweated out half of your 2010s businessperson, ""I'm a go-getter"" haircut, and invested several months of no-sleep, early days, late days, weekends, and little-to-no social life into a job where you will never be anything more than the youngling that should be ""thankful to have a job"". Sounds oddly familiar to that 4 years and $100,000+ right?! In no way would I expect to plunge into the CEO's chair and expect to run the company. Duh. However, I take issue with the fact that once you're in, you're just in. And there's basically no chance to move up and better yourself in hopes of being financially okay one day.

2. Short Attention Sp- Ooh a butterfly!

Our attention spans are much shorter these days, and therefore dead-end jobs lack the ability to even remotely stimulate us. We end up becoming robots in the same system we've been trying to win over for years. Several years ago, very quickly after starting a soul-sucking job in customer service (I know, we've ALL been there.), I realized the fullest extent of the suckage that is what we call our current job market. But not to be a completely entitled millennial, there were perks. It was cushy. There was a nice 9am-10am window for arrival-time in the mornings. There was a fully stocked kitchen, with TONS of snacks,  juices, breads, candies, you name it, it was there. And if it wasn't there, don't fret. It would be budgeted into the list of kitchen snacks for the next month. I love apple juice! Yeee!

Yes, it was nice. Really nice. But the truth was, none of that cushy, snacky, juicy beautifulness overshadowed the fact that I was still working a dead-end, not-movin-up-to-the-east-side kinda job. Daily, I'd come in, chat over coffee for maybe 10 min while I wipe the sleep out of my eyes, then plop myself onto the same office chair where I did the same old tired a** thing. Every. Day. All. Day. -Talk to disgruntled customers, and manage to make them even more disgruntled by the end our transaction. There's no denying the fact that this job required little-to-no brain power or creative bone in one's body, and boy did I lose sleep when I seriously became aware of my empty reality.

3. Rock-a-bye bae-bae.

Here's my truth. Baby Boomers and Generation Y say that as millennials, we're entitled. While that can be debated, many of them fail to note the fact that many of us millennials were coddled by parents, and given a false sense of reality by the educational system, in hopes that it would in fact become our reality. We were told that we'd have a fighting chance in this wishy/washy economy and flighty job market. However, they were only partially correct in that notion. Im speaking specifically to the creatives. Creatives in this day and age have more than ever, much more and much less of chance to be successful in a field centered around creativity. Our school system didn't do the best with letting us know all this. Let me explain.

4. Oversaturation - Eek!

Honestly, there's an abundance of ""creatives"" out there, and the job-market has simply become over-saturated where creatives were thought to have previously been able to flourish. Not to deny the fact that previous generations had their own list of struggles, but an oversaturated market tended to not be one of them. Social media has become our best friend, and also the bane of a 21st century creative's existence. Feel free to jump on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or any other social media outlet of your choice. You'll find the singer, the writer, the MUA (Make-Up Artist), the hairstylist, or some other type of ""guru"" that has managed to pop open a YouTube channel in 5 min, garner ""followers"" with a less-awesome version of what once was greatness. Taking the internets by storm! Nuuuuuuuuuuuu!

We're forced to compete with an entirely new, very complex market. One, where someone can technically be less-skilled, however just their presence can taint and oversaturate the creative market for the remaining persons on the same plane. Thus, making it extremely difficult to nearly impossible to be recognized for creative talents, and therefore making an attempt to make money and become successful in our respective fields, more of a foolish ambition, rather than an embodiment of a dream. 

5. Liar, Liar, Pants are gently smoldering.

To put it bluntly, we were told that we were special. EVERYONE LIED. They lied terribly -in jest. The truth is, is everyone different? Yes. But a better question to ask is, ""How different are you from the remaining billions of people that currently inhabit the Earth? Not to mention the estimated 108 billionpeople that have ever lived (that we know of). Each with their own set of skills, abilities, and talents. The answer to the latter question becomes much more complex.

Regarding physical appearance, most of us, have similar features. 10 fingers, 10 toes. All the parts of the ""Heads, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes"" song, etc.- Not to discredit anyone that does not fall comfortably into those bounds.

As a species, we are sentient and emotionally complex. Maybe regrettably, we have more in common with our fellow brother or sister human, than not. We get mad when someone pushes us down. We get sad when someone we love dies. We get happy when we see a person we care about. We get annoyed when we see a person we're not such huge fans of. -Looking at you, Becca.

All in all, we have lots of differences, but way more similarities. General abilities to do a widespread amount of things, fairly well. See the problem here? We end up being very similar, and therefore diminishing the rumors of uniqueness we've been fed all these years. This notion so carefully bleeds into our creativity and our ideas of such. Yes, you can sing, but do you sing well? Or better yet, do you sing better than a large percentage of people? And who is the audience? Are they qualified to deem such? Do I believe art is mostly subjective? Yes. However, there are some basic principles that can also be used to state that scientifically, a persons artistic abilities will be more favored by a larger number of peers, than maybe another. This idea is not concrete however, and there are some exceptions that simply do not fit the mold. 

In any case, We all assume we're this special, amazing, extraordinary, larger-than-life human being, that the world is simply waiting to experience. And in this day and age, because of the interwebz, everyone can show everyone else just how ""special"" they think they are all the time. In reality, statistically you are most-likely more average, normal, boring, and not really larger-than-life than you think.  But you most definitely are special to a few people on this Earth, and that's important. Seriously, all sarcasm aside, you are important to someone. Just maybe not the entire world though.

So, this is root of my exhaustion. - Having spent the last 5-8 years after high school trying to become a successful creative in the job market I was introduced into as a budding 20-something, *Throws temper-tantrum* because frustration.

Realizing only now, that those dreams of being a truly successful creative, are still very valid. However there is much we haven't learned. Only on this journey, am I figuring out all the quirks of trying to become a successful creative in the business world. But that's just life for anyone trying to do something, or be someone larger than life I guess, right?

Despite everything, go for your dreams and strive to actually BE one of those larger-than-life creative people. It doesn't hurt to try. I look to my spirit animal, Tina Fey, for inspiration on melancholy days like these. Her, and also several pounds of processed meats and cheeses, and refined sugars that reside within arms reach of wherever I am stationed in my apartment. 

On a positive note, as a creative millennial group, we are first and foremost, dreamers. I love that about us. Preceding generations will probably continue to call us crazy, naive, entitled, pretentious, and a whole laundry-list of other negatively descriptive adjectives. But, with the same breath, we are us. And we will always be us. There's room out there for us in the deep vacuums of the job-market. Guess it's time we all become CEOs and start creating the jobs where we see deficits. Hmmm... *Signs off*"
52qo3v,32,2016-09-14,"[Advice] Thank you, /GetDisciplined",Chadakoo,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/52qo3v/advice_thank_you_getdisciplined/,"Hello,

I would just like to thank this community for what could possibly have been a major turning point in my life.

For some background I am a college student in the U.S. at my second institution (was kicked out from the first after being placed on academic probation for poor grades), who has taken a passive approach to everything about his life, until fairly recently. I was overweight, lazy, chronically unproductive, and on what seemed like a beeline path for being a disaster in all aspects of my life.

I have made drastic changes in a short time period, and while I know many say to make one change at a time, I have decided to just dive in and see what happens, as I do not think I have ever tried any self improvement on my real self. (I have been surprisingly motivated to improve my digital characters, however).

As a computer science student with no extra projects or internships to his name (which /r/cscareerquestions would make out to be a cardinal sin), I decided to begin making Android applications so that I may have some resume fodder, learn a popular, in demand skill (or start to learn it, I am definitely a rookie still, and will be for some time), and not spend another summer in front of video games (&gt;3000 hrs in Dota 2, probably a similar amount in HS, &gt;500 days in WoW). During this time I have also begun exercising regularly (it wasn’t much, however I followed one of the guides on /Fitness and did what I could.) and watching what I eat much more carefully. Gone are the days of drinking soda and eating frozen pizza’s almost daily.

Thus far I have lost 14lbs of weight, and while I don’t think I look or feel different I am sure that the change will come as long as I am consistent. The one thing I have noticed is that I do feel ‘jigglier’, which other people seem too as well when losing weight so that’s okay.

Thanks to the resources provided by reddit (specifically /GetMotivated, /GetDisciplined /depression, /Fitness, /learnprogramming, /u/TheCourageWolf’s posts, as well as a few others.) 

While the apps I made aren’t much (and likely will be inconsequential), the habits I developed and work ethic that I displayed, if carried forth, will definitely set me up for success in the future and I am certain I will be able to secure an internship for next summer.

Changes I have made:

-	2 hours of video games per day, MAX (While this seems like much I was playing north of 10 hours a day.

-	Follow C5K running program (https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/)

-	Follow Starting Strength fitness program (fortunately my stepfather had a lot of the equipment lying around as I could not afford a gym)

-	Cut out soda/energy drinks on weekdays

-	Cut out pizza on weekdays


I am not comfortable posting progress pics, yet, but I guess I just wanted to make this post to thank everyone in these communities for their help, motivation, and kind words. Seeing all of the other people in similar situations as yourself makes you feel less socially isolated and as part of something bigger, which I think every human craves.

52qtat,2,2016-09-14,"Me [20 M] with my gf [20F] of 2 years, cut me out of her life in 2 days.",LazerhamLinkon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52qtat/me_20_m_with_my_gf_20f_of_2_years_cut_me_out_of/,"Me and my girlfriend ""Sally"" had been dating for a little over two years. We started our summer just after high school and agreed to a long distance relationship when we went to college. She was on the east coast, while I was in Ohio. We managed to make it work by flying out to one another every so often and the relationship was everything and more. That summer after college was also great as we were back in our home town again. She even agreed to transfer to my college next year which made me the happiest man alive.


Sophomore year of college everything was smooth sailing until a few months in. I noticed she rarely wanted to go out with me and stopped initiating sex with me. She also got very shy towards showing public affection; granted I wasn't asking for full on sex in the parking lot but a kiss goodbye after i drop her off at work didn't seem like much for me. I told her these things were hurting me, and because I felt like she didn't want me, I started questioning my feelings. She obviously was sad but promised me that she'd work on it and low and behold we communicated and conquered an obstacle in our relationship! We even both decided to join a fraternity and a sorority to go out more and meet new people. I was 100% happy with where we were at and we even started to go out more.


Fast forward to this summer 2016, we finish our Sophomore year at college and I'm looking forward to another fantastic summer with my gal pal. One striking issue is the fact that she kinda lost all of her hometown friends... whether it be to internships cross country, sororities down south, or just lost communication. She always had a few close friends but it seemed like they just up and vanished which made Sally quite sad. Shed always talk about how she cant make friends, how no one likes her except me etc. and because of this we would always hang out, borderline 4-5 times a week. But hey I loved this girl, Id invite her out with my friends and always tried to include her in everything I did to which she happily obliged. Then it happened...we went back to school just this past week.


Sally didn't get tickets to our first football game the next day, and I was searching for some across campus. I called her 4 times with possible tickets but she never answered to which I was pretty disappointed. When she did finally answer she called me screaming at me, saying I should have known she was with her sorority friends before the game, she went as far to call me a clingy crazy boyfriend, and said that she needed space and time to think about this ""ordeal"". This kinda shattered my life at this point. This girl is the most low key, kind loving girl in my life and I felt like I just got smacked in the mouth by her. I put it off as she was having a bad day, and tried to work things out with her.


I talked to her the next day about the fight and she immediately started crying about how she needs to find herself, and she doesn't know who she is. I started asking her what that meant, and she just answered that she is not her own person anymore. I asked how I could help, told her that we could work together to find herself, but she went on to say that she ""may"" be able to see me ONCE a week when we live a ten minute walk away from one another. At this point I was losing hope, so i took her out to dinner and tried to freshen things up. We had a good night, loving sex, and a good talk, in which she admitted she needed to slow down, I was at ease for the time being.


Then all shit went to hell. We texted every day before this matter, she then didn't answer me for a day, and with a one word answer at that. I asked her to watch the stars on a football field, and she said she actually was baking cookies for another dude at his house. She said shed be back at 10pm and maybe we could...she got back at 2am. After 3 days of fighting she then told me her feelings changed for me. I broke up with her because of the pain she was putting me through, not because I wanted to. I still love her and we haven't talked for about 6 days. What the hell happened reddit? Sally turned into a new person that cut me out of her life in 2 days time. How is a human being capable of doing that to someone they love? And if she didn't love love me why was she so selfish about not telling me and putting me through this. Just feeling lost. Supposedly she already got with another guy as well.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend changed when we went back to college one year in strange fashion and cut me out of her life after i did everything to include her.  "
52qulr,1,2016-09-14,question? how do you build a portfolio for a testing position,newsman001,LondonTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTechnology/comments/52qulr/question_how_do_you_build_a_portfolio_for_a/,There are quite a few people who build online portfolio for their web design skill for example or programming skills but how would a tester go about getting that foothold in job market without prior experience?  I managed to get my break in south coast when a student turned his nose up a job (an intern position) so I took it up albeit I was a graduate.  That was a pretty luck break during the sub prime housing/finance market crash in US.
52qxwq,0,2016-09-14,"Me [20 F] with my BF [20 M] 2 months, I broke things off, but I'm very concerned about him and the aftermath",Bibi53,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52qxwq/me_20_f_with_my_bf_20_m_2_months_i_broke_things/,"We only dated for 2 months; but we were exclusive and serious. A few days ago he started to ignore me for 2 days, after he mentioned discussing some baggage from a previous relationship. Then, he finally says he was going to call me; instead I receive this long text about how he has strong feelings for his ex (despite the fact that she ""f*cked him up""). Additionally, he did mention that he want to continue things with me. I told him that I don't want to see him again, since he is talking to her and accidentally sent me an ""I love you too"" text intended for his ex.

Now, I still care about him very much. But, I definitively don't want to pursue a romantic relationship anymore. I understand that it would not be a healthy relationship, since I wouldn't be able to trust him.

I'm mostly worried about him, because he is still talking to his ex (which seems to be toxic), has very low self-esteem, and has trouble dealing with his emotions. For instance, he would name call himself (sometimes in a joking manner); but it was still sad. One time he got into an argument with his parents about him not doing much for an internship, so he went to a friend's house and drank.

I was thinking about meeting him in person to discuss this break up better rather than through text. Furthermore, I still want to be a friend, since we have mutual friends, will run into each other frequently, and help him heal.

Lastly, this is my first serious relationship and rather brief. I'm wondering if this too naive of me to do. 

  **tl;dr** Should I suggest having an in person conversation with him to discuss the break up better and share my thoughts and worries, like a friend would have."

The work would include two parts: (1) analysis of existing media coverage of global catastrophic risk and (2) formulation of strategy for media engagement by GCRI and our colleagues. The intern may also have opportunities to get involved in other aspects of GCRI.

All aspects of global catastrophic risk would be covered. Emphasis would be placed on GCRI’s areas of focus, including nuclear war and artificial intelligence. Additional emphasis could be placed on topics of personal interest to the intern, potentially including (but not limited to) climate change, other global environmental threats, pandemics, biotechnology risks, asteroid collision, etc.

The ideal candidate is a student or early-career professional seeking a career at the intersection of global catastrophic risk and the media. Career directions could include journalism, public relations, advertising, or academic research in related social science disciplines. Candidates seeking other career directions would also be considered, especially if they see value in media experience. However, we have a strong preference for candidates intending a career on global catastrophic risk.

The position is unpaid. The intern would receive opportunities for professional development, networking, and publication. GCRI is keen to see the intern benefit professionally from this position and will work with the intern to ensure that this happens. This is not a menial labor activity, but instead is one that offers many opportunities for enrichment.

A commitment of at least 10 hours per month is expected. Preference will be given to candidates able to make a larger time commitment. The position will begin during August-September 2016. The position will run for three months and may be extended pending satisfactory performance.

* A resume or curriculum vitae.

* A writing sample (optional)."

I'm looked down upon because I'm atleast 30 years younger than anyone else in the factory. nobody listens to me and it really makes me feel terrible.

I should be used to it, my Nmom never listens to me and nobody else in the family really takes me seriously either, mostly because I'm still considered one of ""the kids"" in the family, even though I'm halfway through my 20's. 

I'm just so sick of it and it really gets me down.

this is such a toxic team of employees. I don't feel welcome at all (haven't, in the entire year I've been here) I don't feel as though I'm a valued member of the team, and I am sick of being interrupted and undermined and brushed aside like I'm some sort of intern(not that treating interns like this would be ok to do), im a PERMENENT EMPLOYEE here. 

I've been in this company for 3 friggin years, I'd understand *maybe* if I was a newbie and didn't really know what I was doing/talking about and still in training but im not, im fully trained and know full well what I'm talking about.

I feel down now. thanks for listening though. &lt;3

Since I only have to do the one module which takes half the year, I pretty much have the whole year with nothing to do. I feel so useless and I know I'll go crazy if I do nothing all year. Don't even get me started on my (indian) parents.

I already feel awful because the third year group games project and other modules looked like fun and I wanted to work on it alongside my friends. Now I'm thinking of shortening my 4 year MEng to a 3 year BSc, where I'll be doing an individual project instead of the group one.

I'm thinking of applying to some internships and such, as a kinda last minute sandwich course, but I'm not sure how many would like a failing student. Well, if I pass my resit and push for a 62 average in third year I can still get a 2:1. But regardless, most people would've applied last year for a year in industry. 

What other options could you guys suggest? I'm really lost right now and I don't know anyone in the same boat as me, as my friends are all first rate students. I'd prefer something with some sort of benefit in the future (like experience) and so that my parents don't think I'm an utter failure in life."

52spof,2,2016-09-14,I [28/M] feel obligated to stay with her [26/F] because she hosted me during the summer and host her back.,yawaworhteht1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52spof/i_28m_feel_obligated_to_stay_with_her_26f_because/,"I [28/M] have been dating my girlfriend [26/F] for 7 months. We are having a long distance relationship and we live in different countries. I finished my internship this June (yes, I know I'm old for internships), and my permanent job didn't start until end of August, so I had the summer free. I spent the summer with my gf who lives in her own apartment. She's still studying so also her summer was free, apart from 1 exam. We also made two trips during the summer, and I went back home 1 time (by myself, since it was an emergency and it's expensive), so we weren't all the time at her apartment, but we were together, nevertheless. 

I've never lived with any of my SOs before, so this was new for me. After a few weeks, we both started feeling the pressure of living with one another and there was a lot of tension. From my side, I like having a personal space, and some hours a day of just me doing my stuff without being bored. For her, our daily habits didn't match that well i.e. sleeping schedule, eating habits, day to day activities. You get the idea. After a while, we talked about it and we solved the tension. But despite that, I kept feeling that my end of the relationship was deteriorating. She changed her way of behaving in a relationship, at first she was more playful and teasing, a little emotion here and there, but everything felt ""fresh"". And I liked that. Now, she is more attached, and wants me to be sweet all the time, and saying sweet things and what not. I tried telling her that I didn't like it, but she was not very receptive and told me that I was cold, even though she said she used to be cold like this in her relationships.

Then, we had some problem with sex, since at the beginning we were doing it nonstop and after some weeks, I was not horny all the time, so we took it down to 1 daily and she was not very happy, and sometimes it felt like a chore. I started losing attraction to her the more time I spent there, and also started developing a kind of cold attitude regarding feelings. At first, the I love you's came easily and after a while, I didn't feel them so much. In the last weeks, I was really looking forward to come back and just be by myself, decide what to do by my own, what to eat, when/where to go out, etc. She was sad that I was going back home and I was not that sad. When I came back, the texting was not the same or we were not constantly looking to Skype. 

The point of all this is that in December she graduates and I will have my Christmas break, and she would like to go with me to my hometown and spend it there, or at least we talked about this during the summer. The problem is that we should be buying the tickets soon so they are cheaper, but I don't know if the relationship will last until that time. I feel obligated since she hosted me all summer, I should host her on Christmas and also show her around like she did. I also feel that if I break up with her, she will think that I just used her as a summer love and now I'm done. I've told myself that I should try to put myself in the relationship and make it work to December (maybe she did the same in the summer?), and then see what happens after. Note, that I would love to bring her home, and I don't doubt that it will be a fun time regardless of the state of the relationship. I care a lot about her, and she is having a rough patch right now with school and family, and I don't want to add an asshole boyfriend or a break-up to that.

She's coming to visit in the next weeks, so I thought I should talk to her about how I feel, but I don't know how to explain myself since sometimes I've said things the wrong way and ended up making things worse. Also, should I talk to her at the beginning of her visit or at the end? Should I tell her about this before? 

------

TLDR: My girlfriend hosted me almost the whole summer in her apartment during my job break, we talked about spending Christmas break in my hometown, and now I feel obligated to do so, even though I am not really sure about the relationship. She is going through a rough patch with school and family and I don't know what's the right thing to do."
52stwg,1,2016-09-14,I Hate Being A Lawyer. Enter: My Exit Plan.,UnemployedJD,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52stwg/i_hate_being_a_lawyer_enter_my_exit_plan/,"To get all the way out on top – mired in adult responsibilities like rent and car payments – and THEN to realize that you want a complete change in direction – is completely horrifying. 

Since other lawyers or law students will inevitably ask about these things, here is the basic picture. I turn 30 in two weeks. I have a JD and went to a Top-20 undergrad for a liberal arts degree. I passed the California bar exam. I got B grades in law school, was an editor on a journal, won a few moot court competitions and other awards, and did a lot of public service internships. I have two years of public interest law experience vis-a-vis internships. I've got 2.5 years of experience as an associate. All in all, my resume sits somewhere in the proverbial pile between lukewarm mediocrity and slightly above average. 

Before law school, I had a wide variety of customer service jobs, some with managerial titles. I worked through school and never accumulated debt until I went to law school. Bonus – community college and my public university were very, very cheap.

I don't have any kids, mortgages, or any other sort of responsibilities aside from a small car loan and Fedloan law school debt. Luckily, every square inch of my $150k law school debt is eligible for IBR/reduced repayment plans and the 25-year forgiveness mark, as well as low interest rates. I pay $200-400 a month or so for these, less (or nothing) if under/unemployed. It’s safe to say that, but for the expensive city I live in, I would be very OK with making very little money.

Perhaps most importantly, I have little if any desire to have a mortgage, kids, or much by way of material things at all. I grew up poor, which shaped my idea of financial success as a relatively low bar of comfortable sustenance a few notches above my childhood station. My financial dream always consisted of being my own boss and making just enough to fund the next adventure; money was a means, not an end goal. All of my dreams always revolved around experiences, not things. I considered my accumulation of material things to be complete when I got my car and TV. 

SuperEgo: “What other stuff do you want to buy, self?” 
Id: “Well…nothing really.” 
SuperEgo: “Nothing? Not a house? Not gagdets? Not a boat? Not fancy clothes?
Id: “Nah, I’m good.”

I went to law school for a few different reasons. Firstly, I graduated with my bachelor's in 2008 and I had no idea what to do with my life. I had wanted to change my major to nutrition and dietetics, but it was too late when I decided. I desperately wanted out of customer service. I took a few constitutional law classes and was interested in law, specifically constitutional law. The choice came down to pursuing a second bachelor's degree in science, which felt like a step backward, and the choice to go to law school. I ultimately decided on law school because I liked to idea of using my passion for research and writing to make a difference on a policy level in the health and nutrition field. I also went for all the dumb reasons people go: to feel successful, to prove myself, to do something that seemed important, to help people, to have prestige, to have a set career path with some sense of certainty, and to feel like I was moving closer to adulthood.

I never got any of the jobs related to health and nutrition law that I dreamed of. I applied to the few that came along, but it never really happened. Moreover, the practice area I thought I wanted doesn't really exist. The city I am in never had enough public interest government positions open up for someone in the middle of the stack get hired.

So I ended up in civil litigation and business transactions at small firms, the general catch-all that most end up in.
I should also mention that I am a fighter. As in MMA. I have been for over ten years. And this is the thing that unequivocally owns the real estate of my heart.

As you can guess, in the past several years, lawyering has caused me to stop competing altogether – and that has become the main thing that’s killing my happiness.

The past two weeks have been very strange. Nothing in particular is wrong; I’ve been living alone in my apartment for almost three months, I have a new kitten, I’m making ends meet, and work is not particularly stressful. Nor am I underperforming in any distinct sort of way.

I think the difference is really only noticeable to me. I know I am not all that focused at the moment. There is a creeping, almost panic-like anxiety in me. It’s become too obvious to avoid.

SuperEgo: “I don’t like being a civil litigator / lawyer. I need to come up with a reasonable exit plan. Let’s find a viable way to financially support fighting again.”

Ego: “I REALLY don’t like being a civil litigator / lawyer. I don’t care how, I want to be a fighter again.”

Id: “I can’t stand / hate / loathe being a civil litigator/lawyer. Also, give me a damn cookie and let’s go lay in bed and never come out and ignore all adult responsibilities. Only leave said bed to train and face punch people!”

So there it is. The truth. And now, to come up with the exit plan.

52t7le,3,2016-09-14,I'm moving out in 6 months!!!!!,Onmyown7,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52t7le/im_moving_out_in_6_months/,"I know . It may not seem like a big deal to most people.

I’ve been trying to move out of my home for 6 years and never even got close to having the opportunity.  I know it’s still a long time away but this is literally my life goal and I want nothing more then just to have a place to call home.  I cant live here anymore. This home of mine has caused me to develop a number of anxiety and depression problems. I never had a room of my own. I always had to share it with my sister (who moved away years ago) and my two older brothers. One of my brothers is 34 and has no degree, friends ,jobs, and is mentally unstable. I shared a room with him for way to long and when my father passed away, I decided to move into my mother room and share a bed with her. That is what I do now. So now I don’t even have a bed. I guess it’s better then that tiny tiny room that was for all 4 of us at one point. My mother is an at home baby sitter at our small 2 bed room apartment my morning begins by being woken up by screaming children at 7am. I cant get up because im so tired . I fight with myself until the screaming gets me out of bed. I feel so much anger during this time that my chest begins to hurt and my anxiety sky rockets.  I’ve never been happy. I’ve never been content with the place I am in my life. I want that . I want to feel it. Living in NYC , it’s impossible to live in your own apartment .

I had a really bad summer 2 years ago when I stopped caring. My father had passed away when we were on vacation … my exboyfriend had sexually manipulated me and tried to get me to have sex with him although I didn’t want to . He then decided to turn around, leave me , and say things about me a week after my dad passed because I refused. I reached out to my ex best friend who decided she wanted nothing to do with me for sure at that moment regardless of me picking her up through out most of our friend ship…. To sum it up, things were bad. I ended up getting kicked out of school due to already low grades. I had majored in biology to try and become a vet but I couldn’t do it…I failed chem 4 times. I changed my major to psychology because I just wanted to graduate and get a job I could live off of. I then got kicked. I had no direction in my life and battled with heavy depression, I lost weight….gained it..I was a mess.

I found about a free 3 month program in my area that provided IT training and I decided, why not?
I didn’t have much expectations but the program was pretty hard . They required a lot of commitment and I ended up failing both parts of one certification.  I was broken. I felt so stupid but not surprised. 

But

Then I decide to try again and study hard and ….I passed! I received my certification! After that I took a brief job and completed an internship and just accepted a job offer I will start very  soon. I’m so excited because this job will finally let me move out! I even applied to school again, got in and currently attend night classes and will work in the morning. Next semester will be my last . Many people laugh about someone working in IT getting a psychology degree but I don’t care. I want a degree and it’s something I worked so hard in. I lost my grant and paid for this semester and took a hard hit to my account. I want this degree. Yeah I live in poverty but at least I would have completed a degree
The job will pay around 36ish K .  That’s a little over 2 k a month I think. My current boyfriend has agreed to move in with me ! I’m so excited. He is still in school therefore he will be working part time and going to school fulltime and I will pay most of the bills. 
Most 1 bed rooms around my area are about $1,200- 1,400 a month. We will go half on the rent . He is even bringing his car with him which we can also afford. I’m so excited. We set the date to 6 months from now so we can start saving . I cant wait! It’s all I dream about.

I want a dog too.  I’m nervous but excited and if by the end of 6 months he decided he cant do it then ill find a roommate! 24 years old and I want to begin my life 

Sorry Reddit. I had to tell someone! I worked so hard for this !!

I have a friend of a friend who is trying to pass on their lease. It's a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment about 5 minutes from campus. It's 825 a month and she said her utilities usually stay under 100 a month. It's gated, and all the appliances, wiring, tile, and everything it's new. For about 450-475 per person it's quite a steal. The lease is up in May, so it's great for the school year.

A little bit about me, I a super senior with a majoring in Liberal studies. I sing, play music, and write. I do alcohol promotions and work as a research intern. I enjoy cooking and adventuring... and yeah we can talk if you want to know more, cause I find describing myself very cheesy lol. I'd prefer a male roommate but open to all. Message me if you're interested.

I just finally landed an accounting internship for a $1 billion+ non profit. I start next week until the end of the semester. 

Will this make me more appealing to big 4 or perhaps less and what do you think my chances are to get an offer? They recruit heavy at my school but my GPA isn't that great. I have a 3.15 currently and their GPA requirements for my school is 3.0 and I also tutor accounting and have some volunteer work.  I recently got in touch with a friend of a friend of mine (he just hit management) who has agreed to meet at lunch about my interest in working in big 4. To add to that, my room mate has a sister who is a senior 2 at another big 4. Also, I have a big career fair at the end of the month and have the opportunity to sign up for interviews on campus by submitting my resume. 

Should I submit my resume now or wait until after I have lunch with my connection? my goal right now is to get him to put me in direction contact with the recruiter. 


Any advice would be awesome.

Any state/city is fine.  

## Proficient  
Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, linux, mac.  (I'm really good with full stack development.  I worked 4 months as a front-end developer for enrou.co and the rest has been full-stack and backend and testing)

I studied all the fundamentals to python, went through the docs studied pep8 and also picked up some computer science concepts along the way.  I know how to test and work independently.

I guess the reason to hire me would be if you're just looking for someone who knows the fundamentals and can figure out the rest on their own.  
There's still a lot to learn and I don't want to pretend I'm qualified for something I'm not, I'm 100% junior developer.

I feel like I could have done much better in the past, so that I am in a better position today. I'm bored and my life feels colourless. My 25th  birthday is approaching, and as always I am not sure I can be bothered doing anything for it. I've been spending them mostly alone for as long as I remember anyway. 

I spend my time fighting for something. I get it. Then after a few months I get bored and wish I had something more. At first I had no job. Nothing. I get an internship. Now I am wishing for a paid job. And after that to pass my driving test, and after that to maybe moving out or travelling. Then  I am going to wish for more money. Maybe a place to call my own. And as I move from one goal to the next life is going to pass me by. 

But will I be happy? I don't know.

My family has done so much for me. So I feel ungrateful writing this. But  living with them can be intense. The amount of worrying and love that is sometimes expressed in quite fucked up ways. The smothering. But I say nothing. I shut up, because I know many people have actual real shit to deal with, like an abusive father or siblings. I was abused a little a long while ago, but most of the damage done has been to myself because of my own stupidity. The rest is in the past. 

Any woman that shows a romantic interest in me I push away. I get nervous as hell, I don't feel ready, I feel embarrassed being with my family and my background makes me feel like it would *never* work out. So I push them away. Sometimes I hurt them. I remember once, as I walked home, a man and woman walking side by side. She reached for his hand and held it and I just felt this pang of loneliness that I didn't expect. Then a wall came up, my thoughts were saying *you would just be vulnerable and it's not worth the headache* - and I moved on. I  thought no strings sex would be fun...I just don't know. 

...But one thing that can never leave my mind is a friend far away. How she went through some terrible things, and revealed to me that she was raped earlier in her life. And her parents blamed her for it. I don't know if we would work out, but when she told me over the phone I wanted to cry, and had this need to hold her.  A need to comfort her. To look after her, even if I feel like I don't know how. Never really felt like that with anyone before. But she is in a far away place, turning heads and living her life now. She reaches out, and now and then I am responsive. But then I go quiet, I get scared of getting attached. It's like I keep her at arms length and it's very difficult for me to do. 

Everything feels difficult. 

I feel like I have not actually been through much pain in my life. 

So why am I so unhappy? "

**Overview**

The Democratic Republic of Scotland's highest spending area is in education, and there is a reason why: without education, the country will be doomed. Education breeds lawyers and carpenters, mathematicians and politicians, generals and teachers, engineers and artists. With that in mind, the D.R.S. has allocated £8,771,875,000 to the education budget, so that a comprehensive educational system can be planned out and provided to the students of Scotland. 

**Scheduling**

The school year for public schools will last from late January until mid December, split into four terms with two-week breaks in-between. All non-primary schools operate on an A-Day/B-Day schedule, allowing for eight classes total in a year.

**Introductory and Primary School**

Children are first received into the public school system through two optional grade levels: Playgroup, which receives children ages 2-3, and Nursery, which receives children ages 3-4. In these grades, children will be acclimated to cooperating and communicating with others, and they will be given activities to do, as well as a supervised recess outdoors. Activities include a nature ""scavenger hunt"" (where teachers introduce the children to native fauna and flora), learning the alphabet, colors, and numbers, and playtime. These two grades last every weekday from 8AM to 5:30PM, which allows their parents to work.

From there, all children in the public education system must begin Reception, which receives 4-5 year olds and acclimates them to a proper learning environment. Here, the children begin a proper education, beginning basic mathematical concepts, English grammar, scientific foundations, and basics of Scottish government. Reception also lasts from 8AM to 5:30PM, just like the prior two grades.

Next, students begin primary school. These are separated into six grade years: Year 1 receives students 6-7, Year 2 receives students 7-8, Year 3 receives students 8-9, Year 4 receives students 9-10, Year 5 receives students 10-11, and Year 6 receives students 11-12. In addition, it is in Years 1 through 6 that students are taught Scots as part of a mandatory cultural program which leads into the upper levels of education. However, it is not all work in these schools - children are given an hour for breakfast, an hour for lunch and two separate one-hour recesses - teachers may also conduct classes outside (but still on-campus) with administrative approval on a class-to-class basis. Beginning in Year 5, students take competence tests and interest inventories to begin deciding on what type of school they will go to. By Year 6, the student's counselor will have decided whether to send the student to a Regional Vocational School, a High School, or an Academy

Note: Commas note separate classes available to that grade level.

**Regional Vocational School**

Although seen as ""incompetent"" in some school systems, the Scottish government understands that not all people want to continue with academic studies. Regional Vocational Schools are four-year public schools where students can learn up to two trades of their choice, and can graduate certified in those fields. Possibilities include carpentry, masonry, electrical wiring, plumbing, mechanics, welding, landscaping, and cosmetology. In addition, students will take applicable core classes for their first two years, in order to ensure that the students graduate as well-rounded citizens. After completing two years of English, students may choose to take two more years of Scots, but this eliminates one of their ""free blocks"". School runs from 8:00AM to 3:30AM for Regional Vocational School students, with an hour lunch at noon. Year 9 and Year 10 students who do not take Scots may leave early and come in late - students who take Scots must come in at 8:00AM. These schools encompass years 7-10.

**High School**

The standard for Scottish students, high schools are four-year institutions that focus on a mix of vocational or interest ""electives"" as well as higher-level academics. School lasts from 8:00AM to 5:30PM, with an hour for lunch at noon. Scots is no longer a required language, but becomes one of the mandatory language electives. After the four years, students may either proceed directly to college or university, attend a conservatory for theatre or music, or they may enter a two-year military academy and graduate as an NCO in a branch of their choosing (pending government approval). Students here are years 7 through 10. Physical education classes are a mandatory class which happen every other school day. 

Note: Year 7 students must take Fitness and Wellness and Personal Finance.

**Academy**

The Academy is for advanced-level students - those erudites, statistically few in number, who strive to achieve academic perfection. Academies are the pinnacle of public academia in Scotland, and the schools are few and far between. School hours are from 8:00AM to 6:00PM, with a three-hour recess from 11:00AM to 1:00PM. Typically, musical classes and vocational classes are in the mornings, with academic classes extending from the afternoon into the evening. Academies are six-year institutions, with the last two years consisting primarily of college/university/military/conservatory prep. Years are designated by ""class"", beginning with ""Class 6"" and ending with ""Class 1"". Students pursuing the military route may join a military university, which will allow them to graduate as a CO in a branch of their choosing (pending government approval). Students pursuing musical, literature, or performance art will go to a conservatory, which encompasses refined arts such as art, drama, literature, and music. 

Note: The ""Scientific Study"" class allows students to choose a field and conduct independent research - the only graded assignment is a 10,000 word scientific research paper, due at the end of the school year.

52ugcb,1,2016-09-14,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52ugcb/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

But I worked as a rails intern for 6 months.  (The company has a great reputation.)  
After my internship I got hired by a company for a python position but every developer at my company quit so I consequently lost my job and I have to move at the end of this month!  

I don't want to stay at the city I'm in because that's not where the jobs are.  They underpay people, cut people easily and just there's too much competition.  (100+ people for every job position.)  

Is there any place I can guarantee employment even though I'm effectively junior level (just a bit above intern level.)?  

I have worked on about 10 projects during my rails internship, doing full-stack work.  

I am not above average, but I at least know the fundamentals and I got a good grasp of some computer science concepts (I'm self-taught though.)  

Am I effectively screwed or is there hope?  It took me over a year to get my first contract, and I don't want to job hunt where I'm at anymore so I'm going to travel to job hunt.  
Finally to add, I'm not that literate when it comes to software, I can explain things to non-technical people but I fumble with my words when I'm talking to senior level people.  I'm worried I'll come off as stupid to other developers for interviews."

Do you think it is worth it to quit my job and risk not being prepared to move to have this internship under my belt?


So far, I have one pr internship under my belt , though I did not learn a whole lot, this program sounds much more structured and I feel I would be much more qualified.

Having a job in PR definitely increases my income potential and will allow me much more free time.

I need to task our intern with doing some of the tedious work that can help improve SEO and depth of user visit.

Two questions.

1) [Is this a good reference regarding internal cross linking?](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/commandments-of-internal-linking/) She's been poking around [our articles](https://chroniclevitae.com/news) looking for natural opportunities to link between them. I know at one time there was talk that you could affect the perceived value of different pages this way (this is mentioned in the kiss article linked) but it sounds like that isn't really an issue anymore. If that's true, she should be able to cross-link with only adding value/uncovering relevant content in mind and secondarily improve SEO. Is that true?

2) I'm being told that I no longer need to worry about repeating keyword phrases a few times (title, headers, alt tags) for the sake of SEO. My googling this is bringing up conflicting answers. Thoughts?

Feeling very conflicted!,masterpretender_,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/52y3cr/i_f23_need_help_deciding_if_i_should_study_abroad/,"Hey guys! I (F/23) have been in the process of applying to studying abroad in the UK. (I'm American) At first I was really excited at the opportunity, I've always wanted to truly be immersed in the culture of the UK, and I've heard from so many people what an incredible life-changing experience it can be! Plus, I really want to experience more of the world before I start  my career. But now that it's seeming more ""real"" I'm having second thoughts...

First off, it would most certainly put me into debt. My semester abroad would be my last before I graduate. Right now I have zero student loans, and I don't know if it's the best idea to take out loans right before I set out into the ""real world"" (I definitely want to move away from my the town I've been living in once I'm done with school.) 

Also, I've experienced pretty bad anxiety before. The one and only time I went overseas before, I had panic attacks and anxiety throughout the whole trip. That was a couple of years ago, and I have since lived away from home for 6 months (I did the Disney College Program and loved it!) and I was fine, but I am still nervous that being in such a new and different environment will seriously trigger my anxiety again. The past couple days I have felt so much anxiety just at the thought of it actually happening. Plus, if I decided to go home early, I wouldn't be able to graduate. So even if I ended up hating it, I would be absolutely stuck there. 

And the last thing. There is a guy who is from and lives close to London. We met while we were both living in the US. We have had sort of a long distance relationship thing over the past 6 months or so. This guy really isn't good for me though, I've been trying to keep my distance from him in an effort to kind of get over it... I really love him still though. I guess it could be both a good and a bad thing, him being there: at least I have one person I know; but on the other hand, this guy has hurt me in the past, and I wouldn't want it ruining my time there. (I know, it's stupid.)

I am applying to the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield.

If I choose not to study abroad next semester, I was thinking about trying for a summer internship in London through BUNAC's program. Does anyone have any experience doing something similar?

I just feel so conflicted, it's driving me crazy! If anyone could offer me any advice or input at all, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!"

Though most of the students like me end up getting jobs as a software developer after their engineering (huge demand.anyone with coding skills and iq gets hired somewhere), I personally am not very fond of writing software and coding 4-8 hours a day for a living. Though I am a decent coder in my class, Topics like Theory of Computation and Operating Systems are more interesting to me.

Apart from Computer Science, I am keenly interested to learn and explore how our minds work, how can we as a race become more efficient overall and all things mind. I am also deeply moved by art in as many forms as I have encountered. I play carnatic style of violin, used to draw a when I was in school and am interested in hiking as well.

I am an introvert but very open w.r.t. ideas and with people that I am familiar with.

52z2fu,1,2016-09-15,Venting about finding work,Spastik2D,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/52z2fu/venting_about_finding_work/,"I'm 20 years old, turning 21 in March. My fucking parents do nothing but hound me about finding work, which I'd be fine with if they were more supportive and less disappointed about it. I WANT to work, but they have it burned into their heads that I don't because I get really depressed and lose the motivation to do anything after a few weeks of looking for work and getting fuckall in return or getting jerked around by people. For context, I've got awful luck getting work. I've gone to places that have not only forced me to do two interviews, but had the GALL to fucking say ""oh well we never had any positions :)"" or ""Oh well you were too serious"" in a fucking job interview no less after making me waste my time going to both fucking interviews. In the past four years, I've managed to get one job, a position working at a game store which was my fucking dream entry job, and I was let go from it after maybe three weeks of working there last year. My fucking parents WONT. SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP. ABOUT. IT. Literally all they do when they talk about work is ""Oh, well you only worked 3 weeks of your life, we've been telling you to get a job for almost four years."" Gee, thanks. That's SOOO FUCKING MOTIVATING, I JUST WANT TO HOP IN THE CAR I DON'T OWN AND DRIVE AROUND TOWN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF YOUR *AWESOME* MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH, YOU REALLY HELPED ME OUT THERE MOM AND POP. It's so fucking draining and depressing that I'm slowly starting to sink back into where I was in Highschool and I'm starting to contemplate suicide again. They just have to remind me every day that I'm getting older and still don't have a job and whenever I try to tell them that it's not helping, they get pissy and ask ""what else are we supposed to do?"". Hmm, I don't know, maybe say ""Hey look, it's tough, but we're on your side and we know you can do it."" Nah, that'd be supportive instead of damaging. That's not how conservatives work, we have to damage our children beyond repair and then bitch about how they don't function right! 

It's not like I'm not trying, because I am. They have their fucking hissyfits over my lack of a job so much these days that I'm too afraid to ever talk to them and now all I do is look for work, from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed. I have days where I hop in the car and look for places with help wanted signs, often getting places that ""just keep the sign out front"" and don't actually have positions which completely waste my fucking time.

AND IT'S STILL NOT FUCKING GOOD ENOUGH.

I don't know how to fuckin deal with this anymore. Not only do they want me to work a 40 hour a week job, which is reasonable, but they want me to do a full schedule of school AND do like 20 hours of intern work a week AND they're not willing to give me transport because they're too busy running the failing fucking business they weren't prepared to open. It really makes me just want to take a gun and splatter my brains against the wall just to think about all of this. And every single day I get worried that I'm going to get too old to get a fucking entry level job. Every single fucking day I wake up and think ""gee, i'm a quarter of the way through my life and i'm not working, i'm going to be fucked at some point."" I've already made it a promise that I'm not ending up as a 40 year old loser in their parents' home, I'd rather commit suicide by cop than let that happen.

Quite frankly, I'm ready to commit suicide now. I'm pretty sure if I can't find a job before I hit 21, I'm just going to fucking end it. What's the point in continuing if nobody's ever going to fucking hire me at that point."
52zem4,1,2016-09-15,[Conflict] Czechoslovakian Expeditionary Force begins Anti-Insurgent Operations,loltimetodie_,ColdWarPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/52zem4/conflict_czechoslovakian_expeditionary_force/,"Following permission from the Polish government, [Czech forces](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/52nwx4/event_military_exercises_in_northern_slovakia/) have crossed the Northern border into Poland to begin anti-insurgent operations. The 1st Expeditionary Army's headquarters will be located outside Krakow, though will likely move north as the Army's operations do. 

____________________
##Part 1: Intelligence Operations

[**Firstly**, the StB will engage in its largest operation since its inception. StB cells will relocate to every major &amp; middle size city, each to be given a certain ""district"" to cover. These cells will co-operate with Polish law-enforcement, intelligence, and military officials to engage in ""oil spot"" tactics (Occupying an urban area and expanding operations from there into the surrounding area), expanding slowly outwards from their central base. The StB is advised not only to use the utmost secrecy when engaging with civilian populations, but also to avoid as much as possible committing any *overly questionable* acts such as torture, public killings, etc. that may drive poles into the arms of the insurgents.](#secret)

Though they will be given a good degree of local autonomy in deciding tactics, cells will primarily focus on the following tasks (Ranked in order of importance):

* [Locating Insurgent safehouses, stockpiles, strongholds and meeting places](#secret)

* [Ascertaining the size, organization, and armament of both local Insurgent groups and the Insurgents as a whole, information which will be provided firstly to Czech military officials, and then to Polish officials when necessary.](#secret)

* [Infiltrating and subverting Insurgent groups](#secret)

In the south, such information will be put to use as soon as possible by the Military, in a manner outlined below. Further north, and even in southern areas the Expeditionary force will not yet be operating in, [StB agents will engage in slower moving oil spot tactics. When the Military is ready to move into a district, and the StB has completed operations, the StB will conduct synchronized raids/arrests on all ascertained individuals, meeting places, and smaller stockpiles and safe-houses. The Expeditionary force will immediately then move in to engage larger strongholds, such as controlled towns, training camps, or armouries.](#secret) They will do this in the manner outlined below.

Note, Reconnaissance versions of the JU-88 will be utilized in rural &amp; wilderness areas to locate structures for investigation 

**Propaganda**

In terms of propaganda, the Czech StB will aid in the distribution of any Polish made propaganda, and we will rely on the Polish government to conduct the bulk of such campaigns. The StB will also be implementing Czech-sponsored/produced propaganda, to be co-ordinated with the Polish campaigns. This propaganda will present the narrative of the insurgents being envious Fascist leave-behinds and exiles, capitalist running-dogs hungry for any power they can seize, and willing to do *anything* to get it. [Naturally, a few incidents will be fabricated to support their supposed vicious nature, though any guerrilla operations they conduct will also be cast in this light.](#secret) They will be shown to be agents of the capitalo-fascist empires which desire once more to wrest control of the population of Poland from the true and proper instrument of the proletariat's will, the Polish government, and exploit the land and people for their own ends. Possible appeals to nationalistic sentiment will be especially attacked, emphasizing class struggle, working class solidarity, and the struggle for socialism above national struggle. Czechoslovak troops will be portrayed as friends, as part of the eternal brotherhood of man who saw their neighbors suffering and are reaching out a helping hand. Small gifts of chocolate and toys are authorized to be given to locals when troops pass through populated areas, and Czech troops will be instructed to view Polish citizens as (possibly treacherous) friends, who are to be treated well, if at a bit of a distance.

________________________

## Part 2: Military Operations

Military operations will be as follows:

The Military will wait for a period while the StB concludes operations in the southernmost intelligence districts, as outlined above. Upon said completion, the expeditionary force will immediately move into the area and surround whichever major compound is located there. 

Should said compound be located in an urban area, the following tactics will be utilized:

* 70% of the armoured units will block major routes out of the area, and reconnaissance JU-88s will circle the area

* Infantry will be divided into ""cordon"" troops, and ""kick"" troops. Cordon troops and Kick troops will be issued AH-IV tankettes at a 70:30 ratio. Kick troops will also be accompanied by 30% of armoured units

* Tito guns will be placed at major exits to the urban area, and used to ward off attempts to escape attempts

* All vehicles exiting will be searched. All will be denied entry.

* Those who flee will be searched for indication of allegiance, and interned briefly. All individuals will be denied entry. StB agents will be lying in wait at safehouses that have been already cleared, and homes of individuals not yet arrested, in case any Insurgents make it out of the cordon and attempt to contact allies.

* Messerschmitt Me 323 E-2 Cargo planes will conduct a leaflet-drop run. Leaflets will inform the reader that the area cordoned off has been marked as a terrorist stronghold, and will be assaulted imminently. They will be advised to lay down arms and surrender to surrounding forces. They will inform the reader that if they remain in the zone, they will be subject to search and seizure, and may be mistaken for a terrorist combatant during firefights.

* After a period of time long enough for any recipients to exit the area if they so choose, ""Kick"" troops will enter the area the ""cordon"" troops are surrounding. They will converge on the estimated stronghold location and engage any armed individuals. They will be authorized to breach through buildings to protect themselves from fire if need be. 

* Armed individuals attempting to breach the cordon will be shot, a section of infantry will be on hand to converge on breakout attempts to assist cordon troops

* Once at the stronghold location, they will kill all combatants and arrest all non-combatants

* The Cordon troops will then assist the Kick troops in clearing up any resistance, and anyone arrested during this process will be handed over to the Polish government.


Operations in Rural/Wilderness areas:

* Troops will be split into ""Cordon"" and ""Kick"" groups.

* There will be a 60:40 split in AH-IVs between the Cordon and Kick troops

* There will be a 40:50 split in Armoured units between Cordon and Kick troops

* These troops will take up positions in a wide area around the target *as quickly as possible while retaining the ability to close the cordon effectively*

* All available artillery will take up positions outside the cordon

* JU-88 recon planes will survey the area, and circle while the operation is conducted. They will report positions and breakout attempts to the Cordon HQ, who will relay important information to Kick leadership and support units.

* Cordon troops will be backed by a small contingent of motorized troops, and 10% of armoured units used. This group, designated ""Clear"" will have the task of quickly responding to any threats that have been recognized and engaged by Cordon troops.

* Upon completion of the cordon, Messerschmitt Me 323 E-2 Cargo planes will conduct a leaflet-drop run. Leaflets will inform the reader that the area cordoned off has been marked as a terrorist stronghold, and will be assaulted imminently. They will be advised to lay down arms and surrender to surrounding forces. They will inform the reader that if they remain in the zone, they must realize the area will soon be saturated with bombs and weapons fire. The pamphlet will guarantee anyone who lays down arms good treatment (This is to get any civilians out of the area before the next stage).

* An appropriate amount of time will elapse to allow anyone to leave. Anyone leaving is to be searched and interned.

* StB agents will be in any other safehouses or known gathering locations in case any insurgents escape

* JU-88 tactical bombers will begin engaging suspected insurgent formations, fortifications and structures. 

* Kick troops will converge on the Target, fully supported by artillery, armour, and airstrikes.

* Kick troops will arrest and intern any who surrender. Kick troops will kill any combatants. 

* Kick troops will clear the target stronghold completely

* Kick troops will thoroughly comb the area to locate any remaining insurgents.

* Kick troops, backed by artillery, will thoroughly burn and demolish any Insurgent-created structures, and confiscate any weapons, vehicles, ammunition, cash, Identification, or other important items

Note how I do not specify *Amounts*. This is because it will be at the individual commander's discretion to decide numbers. That said, the entirety of the expeditionary force will be in one intelligence district at a time, so if they wish, the entire force may be on standby to assist, or may be engaging in general anti-partisan operations.

It is not expected for there to be a stronghold in every district, or even sufficient numbers to warrant anything more than StB collaboration with local police and Garrisons to put down insurgents. Accordingly, such operations as outlined above may not even be necessary. 

The Expeditionary force will generally sweep upwards from the southern border into intelligence districts declared ready by the StB.

StB will remain in a combed districts post-Expeditionary operation in that district, in order to manage any trailing aftermath.

_____________________________________
##Exit Strategy

Upon reaching the Baltic, and officially clearing all districts, the Expeditionary Force will hand over garrisoning/further hunting operations over to Polish troops. Intelligence operations will be formally transferred to Polish intelligence. A number of advisers will remain to aid in both these efforts, but in the wake of these operations, all major bulwarks and strongholds should be smashed. What remains, if anything, will be a scattered few embittered ideologues, which local authorities will surely be able to handle. Czech troops will then return home, as will any other foreign troops engaged in these operations. 

______________________________________

Overall, the guiding principles of the campaign will be:

* Separate the guerrilla from sympathetic layers of the population, or areas they are supported in.

* Occupy the zones that the guerrillas previously operated from, making the area dangerous for the insurgents and turning the people against the guerrilla movement; and

* Coordinate actions over a wide area and for a long enough time that the guerrilla is denied access to the population centres that could support him.
_______________________________
**MILITARY ASSAULTS AS OUTLINED ABOVE WILL ONLY TAKE PLACE IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF INSURGENTS, INSURGENT  CAMPS, OR A GENUINELY INSURGENT-CONTROLLED SECTION OF TERRITORY. OTHERWISE GENERAL ANTI-PARTISAN TACTICS WILL BE USED, NOT NECESSARILY THE OUTLINED TACTICS**

____________________________

Finally, Czechoslovakia would like for the DRG and Poland (And the USSR, if available), to contribute a similar amount of troops, and appeal to any other communist nations who wish to see these terrible insurgents put down once and for all. These troops would be nominally under control of an ""Eastern Bloc Expeditionary HQ"", which would co-ordinate all forces in tactics as outlined above. If anyone else contributes troops, multiple districts can be assaulted at once. The more troops committed, the more lighting-fast our operations can be.

Forwards to the International Revolution, comrades!

52zgzv,2,2016-09-15,Balancing my relationship with everything else,Since_1918,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52zgzv/balancing_my_relationship_with_everything_else/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for over 2 years now.  We've been good friends for over 5 years (since the first day of freshman year of high school), and now we're 19 year old sophomores, going to universities about 5 hours apart.  We're starting our 2nd year long-distance, and it's been tough, of course.  But I really like our relationship, I love her, and now at 2+ years it's clear we have something going for us.  


One thing that we've always stood by is that we owe it to ourselves to act in our own best interests in terms of seizing opportunities.  We had a chance to go to school together, and we agreed it would be a bad decision because we both had different schools that were good fits for us.  So we made the sacrifice to go long distance instead.  Last summer, when we were finally back in our hometown together, we had jobs that kept us out of the house at opposite hours of the day, so our precious summer together was severely limited.  But we were determined to spend our summers in ways that were best for us - we compromise on a lot of things in our relationship, but we've always said that if we're meant to be then these things are just bumps in the road.


2 days ago I interviewed for another internship, and I feel pretty good about my chances of getting it.  The problem is that it's 14 hours from home.  It's undeniably a great opportunity - it's in my prospective career field, dealing with a subject that I think I'm really interested in and want to learn more about.  It pays well.  It's perfect, except for the distance.  If I get it, I'm going to accept.  I have to.  But man, it fucking blows.  It feels selfish to take it, and honestly I'm just tired of being apart from my girlfriend.  We keep pushing, telling each other that it's only for a limited amount of time.  That after this it's going to be such a treat to be able to see each other on a daily basis.  But I'm tired of waiting.  At some point, we become serious enough that we both weigh in on these decisions, right?  At some point, you have to stop being selfish and start doing what's best for the both of us.  And I know in my head that 19 years old is not the time to be doing that, but man I wish it was.


I should also tell you that I have a serious travel bug.  I love going new places, and as often as I can squeeze in adventure I do.  Recently this has meant road trips with my best friend (because my girlfriend has family issues that keep her at home.  That's a different story.)  I'm working hard at school and I stay busy in the summers, so I don't have time for much, but my goal is that as soon as I graduate I'm going to take off for a while - hopefully several months, and hopefully with my girlfriend - before I start my job.  And after that I just want to travel as much as I can with her.  It's a literal ache though - not a lecture goes by that I don't daydream about traveling somewhere new.


All of this just has me tied up in knots.  I desperately want to travel, and honestly there's a large part of me that just wants to ditch school altogether and go - to take my girlfriend, and make it a reality right now.   Part of me feels absolutely shitty that we insist on dating when we both have so much else going on.  She doesn't know that I interviewed, and if I do get this new position I know it's going to be more shitty times for both of us.  I could make that easier by just giving up right now, and freeing up both of us to do our own things without having an emotional commitment to someone hundreds of miles away.  And part of me is trying to hang on, in the hopes that things will go according to plan.  In 4 years I could have a great degree, work experience, a beautiful girlfriend, and the opportunity to travel the world.  It sounds too good to be true, and that brings me back to wondering if I need to seize the day and go now. 


This is eating me up. "

Please help.",temp647364924,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52zimn/my26f_mother_60sf_father_60sm_and_sister_22f_all/,"(So I'll try to summarize my issue, and then go into detail with the personality and life of each of my family members, along with my relationship towards them. At the end, I'll also list where I am right now (am no longer living at home). Please let me know if I should rewrite anything, and thank you in advance for listening to me everybody.)


What I am looking for:

So basically, I'm having trouble emotionally handling everything that is happening around me.
I am here asking for emotional support, and how the HECK I can keep my chin up?

Did I grow up in an abusive household?

How is my outlook on all this?

Am I crazy?

Am I a bad person?

Am I a bad daughter? 

Am I just 'taking shit' about them?

Should I be scared? Because I'm just so scared.


I've learned that I have a positive outlook compared to them, and all my friends (who know my family) do not like my family members. My best friend of 10+ years, who has grown up with me, has been great with giving me honest opinions on if I am correct when I say that my family members are miserable, sad people, or if I am being too harsh on them (hint: she thinks they are miserable, sad people and that it's not my fault). 


Short background of the issue?..:

Ever since I can remember, my parents have had a bad relationship. I can only remember seeing them kiss once. I'm not sure if they stayed together for the kids, or because my mother is afraid of being alone and always hoped that my dad would make good money again. I think now she just feels stuck. 
I've normally always been able to handle their rainstorm relationship- in a 'it is what it is' kind of way. But I have a very small family, and only one set of grandparents. Now that my grandparents are in an Assisted Living Facility and are dying, its causing SO much more negative energy around us. I have a mother and father, one younger sister, one set of grandparents[late 80s], one aunt and uncle[late 60s], and two older cousins in their 30s. 


Everyone in my family has always been very negative. There was never a happy day in the house when I lived there, and still isn't now that I am back here, visiting for two months. They never smile, do not talk to each other, even the house is always dark- they don't like to turn the lights on. They claim that they cannot afford to go to a therapist, and instead they just do the same thing every day, in our dark house (they draw the curtains closed even if its a beautiful day out, like it was today!). They don't speak to each other very nicely, and I've learned how to have a healthy relationship by trying to NOT be like them.


Ok. Let's start with mom. This will be THE longest one, and all after them will be very short, I promise. :)


Mom: 

My mom grew up in an abusive household. She was the youngest of like 8 kids, and she says that she doesn't know if they were all even born to the same father, because her mother always had different boyfriends. She has always been vague with her answers about how exactly it was abusive. My sis and I, while growing up, always tried prying out of her what exactly happened to her as a kid...what the heck was so terrible that she doesn't talk to anyone anymore? I have never met my mother's parents, I don't even know their names. Her mother died when I was around 10 I think. Of our family, only she went to the funeral. Also, her father recently died- and she wasn't able to go to the funeral because no one told her about it (her father left her mother when my mom was young. He got remarried, and years later tried getting in touch with my sister and I. My mom gave me letters that he had sent us, but I personally refused to write back to him because he abandoned my mom when she was little. My mom found out that he died, because the ONE sister that she still keeps in touch with found out through Facebook that he had died. His new wife (the one that he married after he left my mom's mother) did not tell any of his 'other' kids (my mom and her siblings) about his funeral. 

When my mom was 13, she ran away, because all her siblings had moved out of the house. The police found her a years later, and when they tried to bring her back to her mom, my mom's mom said ""if you bring her back I'll kill her"" so my mom went into foster care.

If you've seen the movie White Oleander, the daughters journey with Foster Care families is exactly like my moms (as my mom has said). All bad, abusive, etc. She moved out of her last one at 18, never had much money, and spent over 10 years graduating with her bachelors cuz she couldn't afford to live and go to school. Met my dad in her 30s, got married, had two kids.


When I was growing up, my mom was always a very anxious person. My sister and I used to jokingly make fun of her, because she was always afraid of us 'getting raped'. We weren't allowed to do anything. She was very strict with what we did and where we went- but it was in a ""my mother is very, very scared something will happen to us"" kind of way. As teenagers, the reason why we couldn't go to a concert was not because we were too young, but because we ""would get raped"". Things like that. Now, as an adult, I see it's no joking matter, and I don't know why she always had such fear. She would always jump from 0-100 with anything. If we fell, she would scream. I became a very dramatic teenager, and my sister and I both developed severe anxiety. We were constantly afraid of doing anything. My mom has a sick sense of humor, and now sarcastically jokes that she grew up always thinking she was just a worrywart, but it turns out it was anxiety. ""Whoops!"" She'll say. My sis and I have told her she should get therapy, but she always makes up an excuse not to. 


Also, my mother has made clear to us, and my father, that she married him because she wanted kids and he had a good job. She wanted to be a stay at home mom, and blamed him for the fact that she ended up having to work, and now she REALLY blames him because she is in her 60s and is the sole provider of the household. She has always ""hated her job"", with every job she has ever had. She always encouraged my sis and I to marry rich, that way we would never have to work. Surprise surprise- my sis and I love working and are both in the Human Rights sector and love working and learning. But when we were teenagers, she was always impressed if a boy drove up with a nice car. Or was from a good town. Her reasoning behind this was ""Marry him and you'll never have to worry about a thing!"" 


I guess I'll also say that I feel like she always takes other peoples problems, and makes them her problems. When my sis actually came out as Lesbian, my mom blamed herself and said it was because my sis was bullied in school and that my mom didn't do enough to stop it. When I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome as a child, my mom thinks its her fault and has apologised my entire life for it (it does NOT affect my life whatsoever! I have it only lightly. People don't even know unless I tell them.) My mom blames my father for all of her problems, and blames herself for her childrens problems. All my life I've always heard her say ""This isn't how I wanted my life to be"". 


My analysis:

 I think, bottomline, my mom should have gotten therapy before she got married and had kids. I think my sis and I developed issues growing up because of her. Looking back on my childhood with adult eyes, I realise now that she overreacted with any issue that my sis and I had. I once got mad at her that I couldn't go out with my friends, and so she threw herself on the ground, started pounding the floor with her fists (exactly like a toddler) and cried. It really scared me. It was like she never expected having teenagers to be difficult. Sometimes I blame her for her own issues, sometimes I blame her for my own issues growing up, and sometimes I feel its not her fault at all and she's just a child trapped in an adults body, who never got to grow up.


Dad:

Dad is a loser. I love my dad, but he's a loser. I always went back and forth on whether or not I thought he was a shitty dad or not, but now I realize he has always been a great dad, but a bad husband. 


My dad never says anything bad about my mom. To this day, he says that he loves her, but I've never heard my mom say that to my dad. He always says that my mom is SUCH a good mom, and that she loves us. Constantly praises her. Once when I was younger, I woke up to them fighting in the morning, and he was yelling at my mom, saying ""You won't even hold my hand anymore!"". Now, my dad also hates working. He lost his job because of the economy crash when I was younger, and ever since then he couldn't hold down a job. I grew up not realising that- I just thought my dad had all these cool jobs. He was a bartender, worked at concert venues, invested in Start-ups, and worked a lot of blue collar jobs that teenagers worked. He makes me mad, because he'll try to open up to me, and tell me about how he hates working and just doesn't want to anymore. Yet the same day, he'll tell my mom that he can't WAIT to start working again and was looking for jobs all day. Additionally, I've learned that he is a kiss-ass and is very gullible (finally I know where I got that from!). He always thinks something is a good deal, is easy to fool, and gets way too excited about the possibilities of...any potential job/scenario that could bring in a lot of money. My father is a dreamer and doesn't realise he is dreaming until he is rudely woken up. He also has a BAD temper and tries to solve anything by yelling. He's been fired for saying 'Fuck you' to his boss. When my parents found out I was watching porn as a teenager, he screamed at me and foamed at the mouth (it was, of course, only spit! He was so busy yelling I don't think he remembered to take a breath and swallow), and threw a chair across the room. He has never hit me, but I bet its because my mom didn't let him. He has shook me very hard before, and tapped his fingers against my head very hard when asking me ""What were you thinking?"" My dad doesn't raise his voice, he screams. If he is on the phone with some kind of customer service, he has a 'spiel' of some sorts that he does, where he thinks he can get the best service by belittling the person on the other end of the line, yelling, calling them stupid, and asking to speak to a manager. Its gotten to the point where I know what he's going to say next.


Sis: 

Sis is doing okay, now. And I say that cuz I have faith in her. She always had issues growing up- she was apparently raped (forgive me- I say 'apparently' because she had lied about a lot before but I will get to that part soon!), came out as bi as a teen, then came out as Lesbian. She did a lot of drugs, but not anymore. I really don't think she was ever addicted- I think she just experimented. She always did great in school, then went to a good college, graduated almost top of her class, and is now working as a waitress in a nice little hip city, in a cute apartment, trying to find real work. She says that she's happy doing what she's doing and may not try to find a real job anytime soon. This concerns my mom, and not so much my dad (that's typical). But I do feel she's doing great, and she'll get a real job when she's ready. She's smart and not lazy.


My sis first went to a psych ward when she was 16. I was in college and no one told me. She threatened to kill herself. Did the same thing a year later. She finally told my parents that she was raped, and my mom said it was her fault(my mom said it was my MOM's fault). She was diagnosed with depression, and was on meds at 17. She still did drugs, despite being on anti depressives. She snuck out a lot, lief about a lot, and stole sometimes. Then, when she was in college, she self diagnosed herself as manic depressive. Recently, her college psych properly diagnosed her with Bi Polar disorder. I don't see it- but I feel that a psych of course knows more than I do. My sis is hoping to get mood stabilizers soon.


Growing up, she was always very combative and would threaten to kill herself if my mom didn't let her hang out with her friends, or buy her something. I always felt that she did this because she knew how to take advantage of our vulnerable mother- who was so afraid of my sis killing herself that she would give in and give her whatever she wanted. (An ipod, new clothes, a haircut).


My sis and I barely speak, but I think that's both of our faults. I hated her when I was growing up for how she caused so much drama in the house, and I refused to speak to her. So I think she just got used to it, and that became ""our way"" of being with each other. It's getting better now- I'm not as immature, and I feel she's becoming...healthier. I really do have faith that we can have a healthy future together. Her and I even get together sometimes to talk about our parents and try to figure it out together. I really appreciate when we can do that- it makes me feel like we're figuring out the puzzle of our childhood, which is not something we can do alone. I still think I have to give her more time though, because she still needs to get a handle on her emotions. She still can go from 0-100 very quickly, just like my dad. But I have faith that that'll change because I know I was still like that when I was 22 as well.




Me:

Sometimes I think I'm doing great in life, other times I think I'm a loser as well. I have never had a family that supports me and what I do. They are willing to let me fall back on them if needed (which I have never, so far) but they will never tell me what I'm doing is good. 


Basically, I grew up REALLY angry, yet walked on eggshells around everyone at home. I've never been able to talk to my parents about any emotional stuff, because they can't handle it. Mom either freaks out, or dad yells. I couldn't go for advice on boys or anything. I always felt guilty for anything- bad tests, grades, saying something that would make mom go lay in bed all day, being alive, anything. Then, I wanted to travel and see the world. I wanted to go after high school, before college. Mom talked me out of it, saying it was dangerous and I'd get killed. I graduated college, and went anyway (Still, the only thing I regret in life is NOT travelling right after highschool. I would have had a different life route.) I'm not going to get into how miserable and unsupportive my family was of me travelling after college- but basically I was talking to a guy online (dangerous, yes.) who lived in another country. He helped me get a job, apply for a visa, and I went. Him and I ended up dating for almost three years, and he was a blessing. I kept travelling with him and he helped me grow up and learn that the whole world isn't trying to rape and kill me.

Him and I broke up because I grew up so much, that I learned who I was, and that I wanted to get another degree, and eventually settle down. He didn't want that, so we ended. (still a wonderful man) I am now studying for my Masters abroad in a different country, speak two languages, and am learning a third. I think I do great with communicating with people, relationships in general, and building up my resume and networks. I feel very mature and can't wait to be done with my graduate degree and get a job somewhere, GET THERAPY, and settle down. Folks still make me question my life choices, but I just hope I'll end up okay. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm too old to have only had ONE real job. I'm afraid that I'm running out of time. I get my masters degree in July 2017 and I'm hoping to work find a real job either before that, or immediately after. I already have an internship lined up in another country, which I go to in 2 months!


  **tl;dr**: Family members are an emotional mess. Are very depressed and have big issues (I feel). This has been making me question my sanity, and I can't handle the emotional stress. I go into detail about what they're like to maybe get advice on how I should go about everything.


Thanks everyone!"

Can I ask for advice here?,temp647364924,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/52zn0p/need_advice_on_my_family_members_with_undiagnosed/,"The bot didn't see what context the word was in. My mother was always controlling and terrified of my sister and I getting raped, which is why it was mentioned. I hope this post doesn't get removed...

Hi everyone. I'm looking for advice on my family, and I hope its okay to post here. If not, please just very nicely tell me and I promise I'll go away. Thank you.


(So I'll try to summarize my issue, and then go into detail with the personality and life of each of my family members, along with my relationship towards them. At the end, I'll also list where I am right now (am no longer living at home). Please let me know if I should rewrite anything, and thank you in advance for listening to me everybody.)


What I am looking for:

So basically, I'm having trouble emotionally handling everything that is happening around me. I am here asking for emotional support, and how the HECK I can keep my chin up?
Did I grow up in an abusive household?
How is my outlook on all this?
Am I crazy?
Am I a bad person?
Am I a bad daughter?
Am I just 'taking shit' about them?
Should I be scared? Because I'm just so scared.
I've learned that I have a positive outlook compared to them, and all my friends (who know my family) do not like my family members. My best friend of 10+ years, who has grown up with me, has been great with giving me honest opinions on if I am correct when I say that my family members are miserable, sad people, or if I am being too harsh on them (hint: she thinks they are miserable, sad people and that it's not my fault).
Short background of the issue?..:
Ever since I can remember, my parents have had a bad relationship. I can only remember seeing them kiss once. I'm not sure if they stayed together for the kids, or because my mother is afraid of being alone and always hoped that my dad would make good money again. I think now she just feels stuck. I've normally always been able to handle their rainstorm relationship- in a 'it is what it is' kind of way. But I have a very small family, and only one set of grandparents. Now that my grandparents are in an Assisted Living Facility and are dying, its causing SO much more negative energy around us. I have a mother and father, one younger sister, one set of grandparents[late 80s], one aunt and uncle[late 60s], and two older cousins in their 30s.


Everyone in my family has always been very negative. There was never a happy day in the house when I lived there, and still isn't now that I am back here, visiting for two months. They never smile, do not talk to each other, even the house is always dark- they don't like to turn the lights on. They claim that they cannot afford to go to a therapist, and instead they just do the same thing every day, in our dark house (they draw the curtains closed even if its a beautiful day out, like it was today!). They don't speak to each other very nicely, and I've learned how to have a healthy relationship by trying to NOT be like them.


Ok. Let's start with mom. This will be THE longest one, and all after them will be very short, I promise. :)


Mom:

My mom grew up in an abusive household. She was the youngest of like 8 kids, and she says that she doesn't know if they were all even born to the same father, because her mother always had different boyfriends. She has always been vague with her answers about how exactly it was abusive. My sis and I, while growing up, always tried prying out of her what exactly happened to her as a kid...what the heck was so terrible that she doesn't talk to anyone anymore? I have never met my mother's parents, I don't even know their names. Her mother died when I was around 10 I think. Of our family, only she went to the funeral. Also, her father recently died- and she wasn't able to go to the funeral because no one told her about it (her father left her mother when my mom was young. He got remarried, and years later tried getting in touch with my sister and I. My mom gave me letters that he had sent us, but I personally refused to write back to him because he abandoned my mom when she was little. My mom found out that he died, because the ONE sister that she still keeps in touch with found out through Facebook that he had died. His new wife (the one that he married after he left my mom's mother) did not tell any of his 'other' kids (my mom and her siblings) about his funeral.
When my mom was 13, she ran away, because all her siblings had moved out of the house. The police found her a years later, and when they tried to bring her back to her mom, my mom's mom said ""if you bring her back I'll kill her"" so my mom went into foster care.


If you've seen the movie White Oleander, the daughters journey with Foster Care families is exactly like my moms (as my mom has said). All bad, abusive, etc. She moved out of her last one at 18, never had much money, and spent over 10 years graduating with her bachelors cuz she couldn't afford to live and go to school. Met my dad in her 30s, got married, had two kids.


When I was growing up, my mom was always a very anxious person. My sister and I used to jokingly make fun of her, because she was always afraid of us 'getting raped'. We weren't allowed to do anything. She was very strict with what we did and where we went- but it was in a ""my mother is very, very scared something will happen to us"" kind of way. As teenagers, the reason why we couldn't go to a concert was not because we were too young, but because we ""would get raped"". Things like that. Now, as an adult, I see it's no joking matter, and I don't know why she always had such fear. She would always jump from 0-100 with anything. If we fell, she would scream. I became a very dramatic teenager, and my sister and I both developed severe anxiety. We were constantly afraid of doing anything. My mom has a sick sense of humor, and now sarcastically jokes that she grew up always thinking she was just a worrywart, but it turns out it was anxiety. ""Whoops!"" She'll say. My sis and I have told her she should get therapy, but she always makes up an excuse not to.


Also, my mother has made clear to us, and my father, that she married him because she wanted kids and he had a good job. She wanted to be a stay at home mom, and blamed him for the fact that she ended up having to work, and now she REALLY blames him because she is in her 60s and is the sole provider of the household. She has always ""hated her job"", with every job she has ever had. She always encouraged my sis and I to marry rich, that way we would never have to work. Surprise surprise- my sis and I love working and are both in the Human Rights sector and love working and learning. But when we were teenagers, she was always impressed if a boy drove up with a nice car. Or was from a good town. Her reasoning behind this was ""Marry him and you'll never have to worry about a thing!""


I guess I'll also say that I feel like she always takes other peoples problems, and makes them her problems. When my sis actually came out as Lesbian, my mom blamed herself and said it was because my sis was bullied in school and that my mom didn't do enough to stop it. When I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome as a child, my mom thinks its her fault and has apologised my entire life for it (it does NOT affect my life whatsoever! I have it only lightly. People don't even know unless I tell them.) My mom blames my father for all of her problems, and blames herself for her childrens problems. All my life I've always heard her say ""This isn't how I wanted my life to be"".


My analysis:

I think, bottomline, my mom should have gotten therapy before she got married and had kids. I think my sis and I developed issues growing up because of her. Looking back on my childhood with adult eyes, I realise now that she overreacted with any issue that my sis and I had. I once got mad at her that I couldn't go out with my friends, and so she threw herself on the ground, started pounding the floor with her fists (exactly like a toddler) and cried. It really scared me. It was like she never expected having teenagers to be difficult. Sometimes I blame her for her own issues, sometimes I blame her for my own issues growing up, and sometimes I feel its not her fault at all and she's just a child trapped in an adults body, who never got to grow up.


Dad:

Dad is a loser. I love my dad, but he's a loser. I always went back and forth on whether or not I thought he was a shitty dad or not, but now I realize he has always been a great dad, but a bad husband. My dad was prom king, football quarterback..Mr. Popular growing up. Very good looking. Was a meathead, funny, all that jazz. In the 80s he did a lot of coke (who didn't?) but it kinda got a hold of him and he sold his business for 30,000 and blew it all on coke. I only know because my sis got that out of my mom, who is always keen to make my dad sound like a bad person.


My dad never says anything bad about my mom. To this day, he says that he loves her, but I've never heard my mom say that to my dad. He always says that my mom is SUCH a good mom, and that she loves us. Constantly praises her. Once when I was younger, I woke up to them fighting in the morning, and he was yelling at my mom, saying ""You won't even hold my hand anymore!"". Now, my dad also hates working. He lost his job because of the economy crash when I was younger, and ever since then he couldn't hold down a job. I grew up not realising that- I just thought my dad had all these cool jobs. He was a bartender, worked at concert venues, invested in Start-ups, and worked a lot of blue collar jobs that teenagers worked. He makes me mad, because he'll try to open up to me, and tell me about how he hates working and just doesn't want to anymore. Yet the same day, he'll tell my mom that he can't WAIT to start working again and was looking for jobs all day. Additionally, I've learned that he is a kiss-ass and is very gullible (finally I know where I got that from!). He always thinks something is a good deal, is easy to fool, and gets way too excited about the possibilities of...any potential job/scenario that could bring in a lot of money. My father is a dreamer and doesn't realise he is dreaming until he is rudely woken up. He also has a BAD temper and tries to solve anything by yelling. He's been fired for saying 'Fuck you' to his boss. When my parents found out I was watching porn as a teenager, he screamed at me and foamed at the mouth (it was, of course, only spit! He was so busy yelling I don't think he remembered to take a breath and swallow), and threw a chair across the room. He has never hit me, but I bet its because my mom didn't let him. He has shook me very hard before, and tapped his fingers against my head very hard when asking me ""What were you thinking?"" My dad doesn't raise his voice, he screams. If he is on the phone with some kind of customer service, he has a 'spiel' of some sorts that he does, where he thinks he can get the best service by belittling the person on the other end of the line, yelling, calling them stupid, and asking to speak to a manager. Its gotten to the point where I know what he's going to say next.


Sis:

Sis is doing okay, now. And I say that cuz I have faith in her. She always had issues growing up- she was apparently raped (forgive me- I say 'apparently' because she had lied about a lot before but I will get to that part soon!), came out as bi as a teen, then came out as Lesbian. She did a lot of drugs, but not anymore. I really don't think she was ever addicted- I think she just experimented. She always did great in school, then went to a good college, graduated almost top of her class, and is now working as a waitress in a nice little hip city, in a cute apartment, trying to find real work. She says that she's happy doing what she's doing and may not try to find a real job anytime soon. This concerns my mom, and not so much my dad (that's typical). But I do feel she's doing great, and she'll get a real job when she's ready. She's smart and not lazy.

But I have faith that that'll change because I know I was still like that when I was 22 as well.


The rest of my family:

Uncle is my dad's brother. Did a lot of crazy stuff in his life (boxer, Air force), made some bad investments and lost his house WHILE he had a wife and two kids (my aunt and cousins). He has his first stroke right afterwards. I only have memories of him being in a wheelchair, talking crazy. My Cousin Matt, the oldest child, had a tough childhood because of the finances and that he wasn't able to have a 'real' dad. Things are better now, and he's got a job. My Cousin Lisa, the younger child, is now a nurse and is also doing good. But neither of them talk to us, really. None of us are close.


Grandparents:

Grandparents are madly in love. Healthiest relationship ever. Grandma got Alzheimers and is in stage 7. They both live in an Assisted Living Facility because of this. I visit them literally every day, now that I am home, and Grandpa says every time how he is depressed and hates living there. They WERE rich, and we all had honestly HUGE big ass inheritances. Those are now gone, since all the money has gone towards taking care of my grandparents. They tell us they want to die every day.


Me:

Sometimes I think I'm doing great in life, other times I think I'm a loser as well. I have never had a family that supports me and what I do. They are willing to let me fall back on them if needed (which I have never, so far) but they will never tell me what I'm doing is good.

52zvnf,1,2016-09-15,Might be getting a job offer with a company without benefits. What should I know?,throwawaybenefits999,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/52zvnf/might_be_getting_a_job_offer_with_a_company/,"Hello everyone! I'm using a throwaway here.

I'm a recent college graduate with an associates degree. I'm only 20 years old and I have been interviewing with a small company of only 11 people. It has been EXTREMELY HARD to find a job despite having a degree in computer programming when I only have an internship, a small portfolio hosted on LinkedIn and no work experience. I've also been out of college for 4 months.

I have sought the help of a tech recruiter through LinkedIn who had told me about the company. He told me over the phone that they're willing to pay anywhere in the $50,000 to $55,000 range, but because they are a small private company they offer no benefits. I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, so I believe that range for salary is the average but I have no idea how to budget for the various insurances I need.

I have found out today that I'm getting my 2nd interview with the company, and the tech recruiter I've been working with says they really want to hire me and might give me an offer on the spot. The job seems really like a great fit for me, but I'm still somewhat concerned by the fact it offers no benefits. I'm still under 26, so I am covered by my parents health insurance for now. I don't have a car nor a driver's license, so I don't need car insurance yet (and the company is about a 10 minute walk from where I live, and the apartment I want to move into is also about that same walking distance). But I'm worried about things like 401k's and retirement planning, car insurance and health insurance for the future, and renter's insurance for when I eventually move out of my parents house. On top of this, I want to be able to afford going back to school to get a bachelors degree, and still make a decent living.

If I am offered a job on the spot, how should I handle negotiating for a salary that can both give me a good wage and help me pay for the benefits I will need to get on my own? How do I get insurance on my own? If they offer something extremely low, how can I counter or know when to walk away?"
53064g,11,2016-09-15,My experience with the US immigration system and why you need to fix it now,filetofishmeal,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/53064g/my_experience_with_the_us_immigration_system_and/,"I was born in Canada to an upper middle class family. My background is Scottish and I am as white and pale as anyone you have ever encountered. I attended university in my early 20's and entered the construction field where I earned great money for my age allowing me to purchase my first home. Like alot of young people I realized that what I thought I wanted as a career just wasn't what I could see myself doing for the rest of my life so I rented out my home and decided to follow my dreams in the US. After getting my student Visa I attended school in Manhattan. The way it worked was I had to prove that I had enough money available so that I wouldn't have to work while going to school, and that's what I did. I would wake up at 8 in the morning to head to school, finish by four and then head to an internship program where I'd work from four until 11 at night. I busted my ass ever day not getting paid a dime just to learn. The day came where I had to think about going home, but I love the US and I loved my time in NY and all the friends I made. So I started talking to a immigration lawyer. The first thing he said to me was ""you would have a better chance being a Somalian cab driver that can't speak a word of English than a Canadian if you want to be here"" and that is the honest truth. I had already put at least $100,000 of my own money into the US economy between schooling and living expenses. I had already proven I wouldn't be a burden. But I had to return home. Now I own a business here and am about to open another. As Americans you need to get out and vote. You need to be hard on illegal immigration because the ones that don't want to be a burden are the ones that don't want to break the law. Get angry. I know I am angry everytime I see someone who can't speak the language. Everytime I see someone who leaches off the system. Everytime I see someone committing crimes. Because I wanted to be productive and so do many many others. "
5308n0,1,2016-09-16,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5308n0/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
530a34,4,2016-09-16,CorpSINS Episode 29 Recap,Demmalition1,HyperRPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperRPG/comments/530a34/corpsins_episode_29_recap/,"Hey all, a short recap of S1-E29 for you.

&amp;nbsp;

The night opens with the team finding themselves in the hospital after the near-deadly ambush by Scarlet Fyre.  Though Scarlet Fyre killed their mark, Emile Corrigan, they did manage to save District Attorney Dana Oakes.  The team is licking their wounds, Cromwell and Fang took the brunt of the beatings.  Interestingly, Cromwell believes in reincarnation and hallucinated for a bit that he came back as an owlbear, much to the nurse's humor.  Fang, on the other hand, wakes up shackled to her bed and has to be spoonfed her jello by Ma1n.

&amp;nbsp;

Once regrouped in the hospital (and Fang is freed from her bed), the team heads to meet Dana in her secure wing of the hospital.  She then works with the Draco Foundation (Miss. J) to pressure the group into getting information on Scarlet Fyre.  In order to do this, they must send Fang undercover back into the prison that she was previously in.  Though Fang initially objects, she relents when they would just send her back for her actual crimes of 4 parole violations in the 2 or 3 months since getting out of jail and joining MMFEC.  In return, all of the team will receive 10k Nuyen and Fang will have her Criminal-SIN erased.  Elsie also joins in and poses as an intern Social Worker for the prison.  As a side note, we find out that Fang's last name really was Glasgow (and possibly that her real first name is Shell/Michelle, but not confirmed) and that only 3 of the 4 members of MMFEC are considered friends (my bet is on Elsie being the non-friend)!

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, the rest of the team goes back to the apartment complex from earlier to retrieve Cromwell's grenade that he hid in the hopes of remote detonation.  He intended to kill Corrigan himself once Oaks' interrogation was over.  In the van, Ma1n has the brilliant idea of dressing as a Lone Star cop Detective Jo Lord, working alongside Cromwell's disguise of Charlie Hammer, Knight Errant detective.  Mordecai also joins the fray as a bounty hunter in a poncho named Casper Bartholomew.  Mordecai reveals that he was adopted and that although he never knew his real parents, though the fact that the same Spirit of Man always shows up to help him means that it must be his father.  Unfortunately, he can never know the truth due to the fact that they can't speak to one another.  Ma1n reveals that her birthday is June 20th.

&amp;nbsp;

They make it past Seth, the guard, and head up to the apartment.  Once there, they quickly defeat a guard spirit put there (by the police?  Humanis?) and take a mysterious device that was attached to the computer.  Ma1n's contact reveals to the audience that Ma1n was once a UCAS citizen (the same contact from earlier who talked to Ma1n about her parents, so this is either a close childhood friend or a family member).  Once in a clean room, the device is revealed to take any file sent to it, plant a high-level databomb, and send it to the database of First Corporation Bank (which has close ties to Humanis and Brackhaven).

&amp;nbsp;

Returning to Elsie and Fang's prison extravaganza, Fang discovers that Orange is indeed the new Black when she meets her mark, former Scarlet Fyre member Lotte Sokolov.  She has cybernetic legs and a mean attitude backed up by a thick Russian accent.  Though Fang and Sokolov have issues connecting at first, they eventually agree to work together to survive in prison.  Fang, through the use of crayon drawings, relays to Elsie (who is now in the prison under her guise as a Social Worker and has both Fang and Sokolov's cases thanks to the help of Ma1n) that Sokolov wants Bliss.  The first meeting between Elsie and Sokolov is rocky at best but goes better the second time when Sokolov receives her drugs.

&amp;nbsp;

Back in her cell, Sokolov reveals that the rest of Scarlet Fyre abandoned her after the Dzhugashvili rescue.  Her mission was to secure the safehouse with explosives, but once the team was busted she was abandoned while they escaped, leaving her with bad blood between them.  Scarlet Fyre consists of:

- Fiero:  Spirit Summoning Mage and twin of Rosa. Favors fire spirits and can summon Spirit of Man too.

- Rosa:  Mage Face and twin of Fiero.  Is never the same person twice and can also summon fire spirits.

- Tigh:  Street Samurai who is HEAVILY augmented and prefers melee combat. Cromwell considers him the worst.

-  Rebecca/""Becky""/""Queen B."":  Decker and Rigger who favors heavy combat drones and wasp-persona based attacks.  Is literally the wurst!

&amp;nbsp;

Now with everything in place, how will the team get Fang out?  Will the detectives get to the bottom of the case?  Find out on September 21st when we return!

I'm not posting it in dating_advice, since I imagine that skews mostly Western. I'm being really vulnerable here, so please be nice? If this is inappropriate to post here, please let me know.


My ex is a native Korean that dropped out of a Korean university, studied in Russia for a year, then got her degree at UCLA. She speaks near-fluent English. She's 24 (int'l age). She moved back here after graduating with a major in communications and a minor in film. She lives with her parents, as is custom, though they've agreed she should move out once she has income due to interpersonal strife. She's currently job searching. She had an internship at an advertising agency, but she couldn't handle the culture and work.


I'm an American, born and raised in south Florida, having lived in Atlanta, Nashville, San Francisco, and LA, in that order. I'm 28 (int'l age). I just moved to Seoul, and I'll soon be working for one of the chaebols as a software engineer. I only speak English, but I'm learning Korean, if slowly. I decided I wanted to move to Seoul someday before I even met her, but meeting her made me realize someday could be now. Mostly a ""why not?"" feeling.


Story time.


We matched on Tinder in January or February while she was at UCLA. I recently learned that I look like the Western version of her most recent ex. We went on our first date March 27 after numerous delays due to sickness and travel and whatnot. After that, things went very quickly, as I usually tend to rush things. There was some strife around being ""official,"" mostly I was pushing. Beyond that, things started excellently. We went on several adventures. Lots of dates. Intimate life was incredible. We got to know each other's friends. Everything was good. 

I made several mistakes early on, but they ended up mostly okay. On our third date, I took her to dinner at my company. My goal was to introduce her to my coworkers. We sat next to a group of them, and they were talking about compensation in a very heated manner. I tend to get hyper-focused on things, and I was searching for an opportunity to interrupt the conversation, change it, and introduce my date. I was so focused on that, I ended up not talking with her. Eventually, someone else came and sat with us. I introduced them, and we chatted a bit. After only a minute or two, he started asking me about work stuff. I tried to gear the conversation back to the three of us, but no joy. Eventually, we finished eating, and she called an Uber home, clearly unhappy. A short time later, I called her, and she explained things from her point of view. I understood, apologized, explained my thought process and how I wouldn't do it again, apologized profusely even more, and she forgave me. 

I'm friends with most of my exes. I had been dating my most recent ex for 2.5 years, ending in October. She also had a long relationship that ended in October. Not being over our exes was a concern of hers, but I wasn't worried about it. Occasionally, either a habit of mine or an object or something came from an ex, and I'd notice it and mention it. To me, it's just like talking about a memory of an old friend - no big deal. Obviously, I'm an idiot. She eventually asked me to stop mentioning my exes like that, and I complied. She also told me to stop watching porn, which I had issue with.

I still talked to my most recent ex about once a month. We were best friends, regardless of the relationship, and we didn't want to lose each other as friends or get back together. The once a month phone call was a perfect compromise. My girlfriend knew about this but largely put it out of mind. 

After a short time, I started feeling paranoid. I felt like she was always assessing me. This didn't help with my anxiety of over slip-ups during dates. I didn't feel like the relationship was secure. I felt like I was always walking on eggshells. I mentioned this to her, and she told me I had nothing to worry about. I still had the sense that she would drop me at any moment. It was suffocating. 

By this time, June was rapidly approaching, when she was going to move home. She managed to finish a major film project of hers, and her mother was coming to see the screening and help her and her sister prepare to move home. I ended up meeting her mother. She didn't like me, but she didn't necessarily hate me either. It's just that I was neither Korean nor Christian and dating her daughter. My girlfriend was super anxious the whole time, as she and her mother fought very frequently. I was basically her escape. She'd come to my place, or we'd go out. I'd comfort her, and we'd go out to help her de-stress and have fun. 

We decided we'd try to make long distance work, and I decided I was going to move to Korea. She had anxiety that I was moving there for her. I told her I'd wanted to move there, and she was the catalyst for it happening now rather than ""someday."" Her anxiety didn't go away. She didn't want to feel a sense of commitment towards me as a result of moving there. I assured her time and time again that even if she broke up with me, I'd still move there. I explained that she just helped me realize there was nothing stopping me from living abroad now rather than someday. It ended the conversation, but she kept bringing it up again and again.

I went to visit in July for a week. It was wonderful. She taught me many things, showed me around. We went on several dates. I also worked from my company's Seoul office and managed to interview for a role there. I didn't get it, but they introduced me to an SVP at one of the chaebols. He guaranteed me a job. Everything was looking up. Going back to the States was painful, but I told her I'd visit her again in a month and move there shortly after.

We managed to do pretty well over long distance. We chatted every day. I setup a Minecraft Pixelmon server that we played on together. We found a mobile app for couples to send each other dares that we used. We figured things out really well. My feeling of paranoia that she would drop me was still there, though, especially with her mentioning a fear of commitment from my moving there. She was concerned about me leaving my job, and we ended up deciding I wouldn't visit in August. I decided I'd move there end of September, when I expected the job to start. We decided this was okay.

My ex and I wanted to see each other one last time before I left the country. It'd be the first time we saw each other since October, pending when she dropped off something of mine for only a minute once. I talked to my girlfriend about it. She wasn't happy. I didn't see any danger in it, so I felt like she was trying to control me. Again, I'm an idiot. We came to the compromise that I could only see her with a group of people.

I'm still an idiot. She and I met up. I didn't expect this to happen, but I remembered the time when we were dating. In past encounters with exes, that had never been a problem for me. I felt solace in those memories with how suffocated I was feeling in my current relationship. I felt safe. We joined my roommates and some other friends at a nightclub. My ex and I both really like dancing, and things got really heated on the dance floor. Too heated. We managed to chill out, but we'd already danced in manners I'd deem inappropriate. At the end of the night, we said final goodbyes, and she kissed me. I didn't stop her. It was her way of saying goodbye, and I didn't want to ruin it for her.

I didn't tell my girlfriend right away. She had just gotten an internship and was struggling. It was incredibly taxing on her, and she vented to me every day. A couple days after the event, she had decided she was going to quit the job and was feeling good. I brought up the dancing. She was furious. She kept asking me more and more info, and I told her about the kiss. She was even more livid since I wasn't going to volunteer that information. She said this was the worst thing she feared in our relationship. She asked if I felt like it was cheating - my definition of cheating is if you feel like it's cheating, it's cheating. It's not a physical act but a conscious decision of acting disloyally. I told her it did feel like cheating. She asked me why I did it. I didn't have an answer immediately; I didn't know. I told her I could figure it out given a couple of days. I asked if I could think about it and tell her. She said okay.

I thought I had come up with the answer the next day. I'm a junkie for physical affection, and I felt comfortable with my ex. I told her this the next day, and I made an oath to never do it again. She said she had wished the person she had cheated on in the past had given her a second chance, so she was willing to give me one. I was grateful and overjoyed, and I made that evident. 

Over the next couple of days, I resumed business as usual, as if the event had never happened. To me, the matter was closed. After several days of this, she said she couldn't just keep going like nothing happened. I asked her what I could do to help make things better. We never really came up with an answer, but we kept going. She said she felt like she was losing her feelings for me. I asked if it had to do with the distance, and she said yes. I moved up my move date to two weeks from that day and started preparing.

Things were looking up again, for the most part. Then the week before the move, she told me she couldn't do this. We broke up. She cited the cheating, the pressure of feeling commitment, fading feelings - a slew of reasons. I asked if we could still be friends. She said she didn't want to be friends with me. I felt that if I wasn't the kind of person she wanted to be friends with, then why would I want to date her? 

We cut off contact, blocking each other on everything. I couldn't handle it. I ended up contacting her, saying I wanted to at least keep in touch. She didn't really say yes or no. On my way to the airport, she said she would meet me there and help me figure things out, since I only knew one other person, and he was busy. After much back and forth, I said okay and thanks. 

On arrival, I saw a message from her saying there was an old friend who only had one day off from the military and wanted to see her. She had confidence in my ability to take care of myself and figured things out. No problem on my part, and I told her so. I got to my airbnb just fine. 

We maintained contact. We talked like friends. I kept telling her I wanted to see her. She'd respond saying she didn't think it was a good idea. I'm not one to push things, so I didn't. At several points, I became paranoid jealous. In my head, if she was intimate with others during this time, it said to me that she no longer loved me. Any time she mentioned hanging out with friends, the feeling kicked in. It wasn't healthy.

Throughout this whole time, I'd been thinking about the cheating and why I did it. I realized the reason - that sense of paranoia and suffocation. I told her. She interpreted it as putting the blame on her. She called me. I tried to explain that wasn't what I was getting at. I was still at fault, since I should have called things out and fixed them rather than always acquiescing. She was already angry. I told her I still loved her, and we said we'd cut off contact again.

She called me the next day. She apologized for being emotional with me. I told her I needed to see her in person. She said okay, and we met the next day.

We tried to find a public place where we could have privacy, but we couldn't identify any excellent spots. We ended up eating near my place and going back to my airbnb. We chatted some things out. I tried to convince her that we could make things work. I could tell from her body language and how she was approaching things that she missed me. She said she was hurt and felt betrayed. I understood. She said she needed time to heal. I told her we could heal together. She wasn't convinced, but she was taking solace in being near each other again. We ended up sleeping together. After post-coital cuddles and a shower, I thought of something. I knew she wasn't interested in other people - she needed time to herself. That made my jealous paranoia go away. I had a plan. I told her I would wait for her to heal. It would give her the time to heal her wounds and give me the chance to show my loyalty. She didn't like the idea. I told her I was going to do it anyway. She called me an idiot. She said she didn't know how long it would take and wouldn't guarantee anything afterwards. I said it was worth it to me to find out. She called me an idiot several more times. We said goodbye.

I'm still an idiot, so I messaged her the next day. The implicit understanding between us was that we would have time alone, but I couldn't handle it. We resumed talking like friends. The other day, she called me since she had resume work to do but not enough time to do anything meaningful. I was overjoyed to hear her voice again. At the start of the conversation, I told myself to simply be thankful she's comfortable talking to me and not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Everything started fine, but I told her I wanted to see her again. She again told me she didn't feel like it was a good idea. I asked why. She said it would be painful. I asked her why she was still messaging me if talking to me was painful. She said she'd stop messaging me. I called her out and asked for a real reason. She said messaging me was still painful, and she thought the understanding was that we weren't going to talk while she healed. I agreed to not message her. I haven't since. This was Sunday.


It's killing me. Any spare moment of thought I have, I'm thinking about her. The jealous paranoia is coming back. I worry that abandoning her feelings for me will be part of her healing. She said she still loves me, but she doesn't want to. I want to know why so I can fix it, but I don't feel like I can go back on my word of saying I won't message her. A part of me is trying to move on by taking an interest in other women, but I want absolutely none of that. A western buddy of mine here has a Korean girlfriend who's been correct about my ex's behaviors once in the past, and I want to get her time to ask more, but I feel like that's awkward, so I'm turning here. I've been reading and watching videos about eastern philosophy and Korean culture in the hopes of understanding what's going on in her head. I'm desperate to figure out a way to make things work or at least get answers.

On arrival, I saw a message from her saying there was an old friend who only had one day off from the military and wanted to see her. She had confidence in my ability to take care of myself and figured things out. No problem on my part, and I told her so. I got to my airbnb just fine. 

We maintained contact. We talked like friends. I kept telling her I wanted to see her. She'd respond saying she didn't think it was a good idea. I'm not one to push things, so I didn't. At several points, I became paranoid jealous. In my head, if she was intimate with others during this time, it said to me that she no longer loved me. Any time she mentioned hanging out with friends, the feeling kicked in. It wasn't healthy.

Throughout this whole time, I'd been thinking about the cheating and why I did it. I realized the reason - that sense of paranoia and suffocation. I told her. She interpreted it as putting the blame on her. She called me. I tried to explain that wasn't what I was getting at. I was still at fault, since I should have called things out and fixed them rather than always acquiescing. She was already angry. I told her I still loved her, and we said we'd cut off contact again.

She called me the next day. She apologized for being emotional with me. I told her I needed to see her in person. She said okay, and we met the next day.

We tried to find a public place where we could have privacy, but we couldn't identify any excellent spots. We ended up eating near my place and going back to my airbnb. We chatted some things out. I tried to convince her that we could make things work. I could tell from her body language and how she was approaching things that she missed me. She said she was hurt and felt betrayed. I understood. She said she needed time to heal. I told her we could heal together. She wasn't convinced, but she was taking solace in being near each other again. We ended up sleeping together. After post-coital cuddles and a shower, I thought of something. I knew she wasn't interested in other people - she needed time to herself. That made my jealous paranoia go away. I had a plan. I told her I would wait for her to heal. It would give her the time to heal her wounds and give me the chance to show my loyalty. She didn't like the idea. I told her I was going to do it anyway. She called me an idiot. She said she didn't know how long it would take and wouldn't guarantee anything afterwards. I said it was worth it to me to find out. She called me an idiot several more times. We said goodbye.

I'm still an idiot, so I messaged her the next day. The implicit understanding between us was that we would have time alone, but I couldn't handle it. We resumed talking like friends. The other day, she called me since she had resume work to do but not enough time to do anything meaningful. I was overjoyed to hear her voice again. At the start of the conversation, I told myself to simply be thankful she's comfortable talking to me and not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Everything started fine, but I told her I wanted to see her again. She again told me she didn't feel like it was a good idea. I asked why. She said it would be painful. I asked her why she was still messaging me if talking to me was painful. She said she'd stop messaging me. I called her out and asked for a real reason. She said messaging me was still painful, and she thought the understanding was that we weren't going to talk while she healed. I agreed to not message her. I haven't since. This was Sunday.


It's killing me. Any spare moment of thought I have, I'm thinking about her. The jealous paranoia is coming back. I worry that abandoning her feelings for me will be part of her healing. She said she still loves me, but she doesn't want to. I want to know why so I can fix it, but I don't feel like I can go back on my word of saying I won't message her. A part of me is trying to move on by taking an interest in other women, but I want absolutely none of that. A western buddy of mine here has a Korean girlfriend who's been correct about my ex's behaviors once in the past, and I want to get her time to ask more, but I feel like that's awkward, so I'm turning here. I've been reading and watching videos about eastern philosophy and Korean culture in the hopes of understanding what's going on in her head. I'm desperate to figure out a way to make things work or at least get answers.


Help

530hss,3,2016-09-16,What would you do?,aaronphillips66,Firefighting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/530hss/what_would_you_do/,"Hey everyone, I'm new to reddit completely. So hopefully I'm doing this correctly! 

I have always had the lifelong dream of becoming a firefighter, but during September of 2015 this dream was halted. I was only 19 years old at the beginning of all of this, with no knowledge of workman's compensation laws, or anything with this nature. I was employed at the worlds largest retail chain we all know of at the time, and sustained an injury on the job. 
Just two weeks before this happened, I began my journey towards my dream career through schooling. I was enrolled in EMT-B classes at a local community college. This made it very difficult to perform in this class, as it has physical requirements! I did my best though, and passed, while still being employed at this chain, driving an hour for class 2 days a week, and studying constantly. 

Months passed, and I was terminated from this job for missing days because of the injury. This was April, 1, 2016. I moved on from that and was offered an internship in a small town about 3 hours from home doing computer work, and inventory. Soon after I was offered this position I received news I would be having surgery on my back. I was now 20 years old, I'd never had any type of surgery in my life. So this was very overwhelming to add on top of my life as it was. It was scheduled for June, 27, 2016. My girlfriend's birthday of all days! 
The time came for me to travel to Wichita, Ks for my surgery. I was to have a spinal fusion at L5-S1 with rods and pedicle screws, and a laminectomy of a free floating fragment in my spine from this injury. 
I hope what I have so far isn't too long, boring, or not how reddit works!
But anyways, continuation! It's almost over I promise.
The surgery went well, no complications. I was pretty much in my bed for about 2 weeks after the surgery and continued work from home as I could. I have to wear a back brace any time I am not asleep or sitting in a well supported position (so basically always). As well with my wonderful belt of glory, I cannot lift over 10 pounds.
Now currently I live in Lawrence, Ks working 3 jobs and not in school yet, as I have no idea what I can even do with my future. So my reason for being here is general advice from people on what they think the best route in life for me would be! This experience so far has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and am running out of options on everything. Should I go to school in an other field? Should I wait until I'm cleared by my doctor (no idea when that will be) and if any firefighter/EMT's are out there, would you ever hire someone with this past, or even try to continue in this field? 

Any and all responses are much appreciated! Thanks everyone!"
530oky,2,2016-09-16,I think I screwed up my internship this summer.,ps1203,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/530oky/i_think_i_screwed_up_my_internship_this_summer/,"I'm feeling so much guilt, disappointment and worthlessness. As my last day approaches, I received more negative feedback than I expected. I didn't realize how bad I screwed up. I could have done so much better and used my time much more wisely.

I think I was okay for the first month, but then I ran into a creative block in the last six weeks and I wasn't getting any further on my secondary project. I couldn't even bear to talk to anyone about my projects because they were going nowhere and I hate to disappoint anyone. My slump is probably coming off as lazy, but I do have several health problems that affect my ability to function at a normal pace and stay focused.

I have always had a problem with being on time, and I let my body get the better of me by sleeping in too long and coming 2-3 hours later than usual without prior notice more than a few times. My dad said I abused my privilege of being allowed to work from home. I did that about 3 times because my body was just too exhausted. I also missed a lot of meetings I should have been to because they were in the morning. A meeting is a meeting and there is no excuse, but I put myself in a bad position and now I have to face the consequences. I missed a lot of opportunities to network at the meetings and that is my fault.

I was lost for several weeks that I ended up giving rushed products at the last minute.

I hate the projects that I submitted because I know I did a bad job and I am now putting myself in a horrible situation.

My secondary project was apparently what wasn't expected, but I thought that I had discussed what the changes would be. I thought my report was agreed upon, but apparently I was expected to be more patient and work harder to find another solution and provide a more comprehensive report.

I know I was expected to show regular results consistently, to get more feedback and have a better product, but I failed to do that because I was internally panicking about having nothing to show for my projects. I wasn't just supposed to show a product at the very end. That was wrong.

I didn't realize that I would be pointed at today for lack of communication. I thought I was doing fine in the beginning, but when I started to get stressed out, I almost stopped talking to everyone because I was so overwhelmed. Now I'm getting feedback that I should have gone around every day and talked and did more networking. I'm pretty sure this didn't happen because I was too exhausted and stressed out about my projects. I also now know that I should have been networking more and talking about various topics. I don't really know what topics are off limits. I was also supposed to share more about my professional interests and classes. Again, too stressed to think about socializing and nervous because I had nothing to show for myself. I was told to communicate if I was stuck on my projects, but my perfectionist self was too afraid to say anything. I wanted to look like I was fine, but I obviously wasn't and everyone could tell.

Although I thought my projects were fun, I felt detached from the real work that was being done. I think that would have been more practical to do.

I can't go back anymore. I can't redo my internship and do it right. I probably deserve what is waiting for me if it is bad news. I have so much regret. I wish I could change how the bad weeks went and just did work the right way.

I won't be surprised if my return offer is revoked tomorrow. I put myself in a position to fail and I didn't realize it. I don't know if this is going to affect my ability to be hired again in another company (I have a feeling that it won't work out again with this one). I feel awful and horrible, and I always seem to screw myself over with every opportunity. That's why I never get anywhere in life. Why don't I ever learn?

I don't think anyone will respond but I can't stop thinking about everything that happened. I have to shake this feeling away but talking to my parents didn't help. I think talking to an outsider would help me think more practically."

I'm a respected industry manager and I never had an issue like this. 

I have an artist that I really like the music of- the sound, the vibe and the personality- and I believe he has so much potential to be huge. 

How can I convince an A&amp;R person that isn't too sure about meeting with him to meet him? 

I currently do not have the bandwidth to kickstart a career for him without the backing of a label so I'm trying to get him signed. 

Is there any sure-fire way to convince someone to meet him? 

I was speaking with an A&amp;R intern about him, which I was at some point. Would telling him that signing him would probably get him promoted to A&amp;R/Director of A&amp;R because he WILL be big? I would've been convinced by that in the 90s if someone told me that at that stage.

I really want to get him signed and I need tips.

Thanks.

531fkg,1,2016-09-16,34M4F - A few scenarios to pick from,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/531fkg/34m4f_a_few_scenarios_to_pick_from/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as

* the intern gets a special offer
* staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
531i3s,2,2016-09-16,A few questions about Auckland,M-arijn,auckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/auckland/comments/531i3s/a_few_questions_about_auckland/,"Hey there,

Last night I had an interview for an unpaid internship that will start at +- 17th of October in Auckland. The company is located at this adres (https://goo.gl/maps/M6J8R5sLAZn). I have a few questions about Auckland and NZ:

- What are the nicest student area's (to live) in Auckland? By nicest I mean still affordable (600 AUSD/month (?). I prefer an area between the city centre and the office where I intern.
- How much do you pay per month for a NZ sim card with about 2 GB internet per month (100 minutes or even 50 is enough for me)
- Is the public transport any good? Is it affordable to use 5 times a week for lets say 2x15 min trips?

The reason why I ask these questions here is because I like the fact that the answers come from people that are living in or near Auckland and that I can reply them if something's not clear.

Thanks in advance! :)"
5321js,2,2016-09-16,I [22M] am unsure if this girl [22F] at my internship is crushing on me or creeped out,creepornah,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5321js/i_22m_am_unsure_if_this_girl_22f_at_my_internship/,"Hey everyone, so I started this internship in my town a few weeks ago. A couple people flew in from out of town (some abroad, some within the US). She flew in from a different part of the US and is here for the duration of the internship. I noticed her when we first had orientation and thought she was pretty, but I didn't think much of it. However, I started noticing her staring at me more.

I'd catch her staring at me and turn to look towards her. I'd see her quickly turn away as soon as I caught her, so that was the first clue. Also, when we were all grabbing lunch one day, she was with one of her new friends and they were chatting about something random. They messed up something in the line and so the girls switched positions, but I noticed that she got a little close to me while we were in line. I kinda hurried up to get my food and got out of line. I planned to sit with her, but then my immediate coworkers called me over to sit with them so I was out of luck.

Cue a few days later, I was sitting in the main area of the internship working on some assignment. I yawned and stretched for a bit, then looked around the whole vicinity to see who was around. My line of sight was lowered for some reason, and I caught a glimpse of her adjusting her skirt. I quickly looked up because I didn't want to give the wrong impression, but then my eyes and hers locked for a moment. I don't remember her having any particular expression, but I remember after that I quickly turned back towards my work.

This whole time I hadn't introduced myself to her yet. We had an internship gathering, some sort of icebreaker event last week. I finally got to introduce myself to her there and, even when I introduced myself, she hesitated to shake my hand and shook it in a really weird way (as if she was trying to keep contact away from me as much as possible). We talked a bit at this event, but it was maybe five minutes total. It honestly felt somewhat like she was avoiding me. There was another opening for me to talk with her when we were at a bar as a group. The first moment we had to move chairs and tables together to sit, and I remember the girls got together to do it and specifically I heard her talk about how ""she doesn't need a man."" That kinda threw me off a bit. Later at the bar, I was getting to know some other people, but when she tried to talk to me I was in conversation with this other dude and was more interested in what he was talking about so I kinda just went ""Yeah, that's cool"" and kept talking (yeah yeah... stupid, I know). I remember she looked kinda sad and not too long after the group called it a night and split off.

Cue this week, things are just as weird. I saw her at lunch again and invited her to eat with us, but she said she already talked to someone about reserving a table for them. She said she doesn't know the girl's name and mentioned some name I'd never heard before, so I said that I didn't know the person. She said ""yeah you do"" and kinda gave me a cold shoulder while sitting at the other table faced away from me. I thought it was really weird, but then saw that she was talking about another friend at the internship who I was sitting one on one with at lunch once. The second girl... let's call her S. During that time I sat with S, the other girl walked by and I could kinda see her looking at us. This makes me think that she was mad that I was sitting with her (but we're just friends!!!)

So I've been getting a lot of the cold shoulder from her. When I'm looking, she doesn't look at me, kinda freezes up, does all of that. But then sometimes I'll see that she's really close to me and I get really confused. I don't know any other reason she would act like this, because we really don't know each other. It's still bothering my mind though. I don't want to pursue a girl who looks uncomfortable (on the chance she doesn't like me, I'll be that dick that couldn't take a hint).

532ieu,2,2016-09-16,F4M Some Fun Scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/532ieu/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."
532v2n,34,2016-09-16,Introducing my ILs and why my Husband is the way he is.,Polyprobsyo,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/532v2n/introducing_my_ils_and_why_my_husband_is_the_way/,"In my last post I introduced my Kinda-SIL1's kids.  This will go into the history of my Husband and why I am not the biggest fan of his parents.  Some of this may belong on r/JUSTNOMIL but this includes my FIL so I will post it here.

DH is a child of a failed marriage.  MIL and his bio-father split before DH was out of a womb due to lots of drama.  DH has never met his bio-father because he is a dead beat and MIL doesn't have a single photo of bio-father around.  When DH was about 2 years old MIL met FIL and they ended up getting married.  FIL adopted DH (one of the kindest things I think FIL has ever done) and in all ways except DNA FIL is DH's dad.

The first horror story (imo) was from DH's 3rd or 4th birthday.  He was a very quiet and withdrawn child that loved his legos, books and anything with technology.  During his birthday party he did not want to come out because he was scared or sleepy or whatever and MIL forced him to blow out the candles on his cake and open presents in front of friends and family.  While the group was singing him happy birthday DH turns to MIL and says ""Mommy, the eyes. I don't like the eyes. They are watching me.""

Now if I had a child tell me that I would be talking to their doctor at the next appointment.  Did MIL or FIL? Nope.  They just said it was one of DH's little oddities.  

MIL and FIL end up having 2 kids and DH slowly becomes the black sheep of the family.  He is cared for a loved in their own way but nothing he does is quite good enough.  Video games?  They are the devil.  Learning how to code?  Nope not ok.  Excelling in math and science?  Yeah but DH isn't doing well in sports.  BIL and SIL ended up being the GC for everyone but DH's maternal GFIL.  DH ends up graduating high school at the top of his class and getting into a great engineering program.  FIL and he have a very rocky relationship at this point due to butting heads pretty much all the time.

I meet DH at University and we hit it off lovely.  I meet his family and he meets mine and everything seems to be going great until DH gets a 6 month internship near his parent's and moves home.  First things first.  His childhood room had been changed into a rec room with a pool table and all.  When DH moved back they set up a bed, dresser and desk in one corner of that room for him.  During the weekends FIL would often come in to shoot pool and it sucked because DH and I had no privacy when we were there.  As the months went on MIL and FIL started treating DH much like a child, demanding chores get done, he help his siblings and general parents being parents.  Mind you DH was 22 at the time and was pretty much living in his room because he was doing what any computer nerd would do, playing WOW.  He did help around the house but he seemed to get the majority of chores because ""Oh you don't have any sports or things after work."" Exact MIL quote.

The final straw for DH was when FIL demanded he replace the fog lights on SIL’s car for her driving test.  At the time DH was packing his shit up to move back to University and get away from his family.  They end up having a spectacular fight when DH said “No, she doesn’t need those lights to work.  If its that important SIL should do it herself.” I think by the end of it FIL disowned DH.  FIL was even more pissed when DH was basically like “That’s fine, I play for my own schooling anyway,” and packed up his shit and left.  I think DH didn’t talk to FIL for months after that.  MIL was all “BUT FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMILY” and was pissed at both of them for years.  I will note BIL and SIL thought their dad was being insane and agreed with DH.

Then about 5 years ago maternal GFIL passed.  MIL when nuts because her father went from ok to dead in about a week.  She tried to get DH and I to move into GFIL’s house, tried to connect us to her sister (who is a total narcissist), didn’t understand when we told her fuck no and equally didn’t understand when DH was a wreak for months after.  GFIL was the only family member that took DH for who he was and loved every inch of him.  They would talk tech and wood working and DH would even call GFIL on a regular basis (which is a fucking feat).  

After GFIL passed, DH slipped into a major depression.  He got laid off from 2 different jobs within a year of each other, and I think this is when his mental illness came to the forefront.  DH’s GF and I were both worried, encouraged him to get help and generally supported what he needed.  He was (and still is a bit) self-medicating with alcohol which we later learned is one of the reasons why MIL left bio-father.  It was a long uphill battle but DH did get help.  He got onto meds, did talk therapy, DBT and is doing much better on the alcohol front.  He has a job that supports him and his medical needs and finally has an accurate diagnosis. 

DH was talked to his parents about his mental illness and looked for their support pretty early in his journey because that is what parents are support to do.  My parents listened and offered advice and basically told him do what you need to do and if you need help we will be here for you.  MIL and FIL on the other hand immediately asked “So when are you getting off the meds?”  

DH and I were like “Um…..most likely never.” 

“But most people go on meds to get off them again”

At this point DH is looking at them bug eyed.  “Mom, Dad these meds are like insulin or blood pressure medication for me.  My doctor’s think I am going to be on some form of medication for the rest of my life.  When I am on these I am able to function, hold down a job and have happy relationships.  I just want your support.”

“But when are you getting off the meds?”  *face palm*

Around this time I find out UIL who is related to FIL is schizophrenic and is un-medicated because the family doesn’t think he needs it.  “UIL is just a bit odd”  No UIL is crazy and kinda scary and I don’t want to be in the room alone with him.  Ever.

And that folks are my IL’s.    BIL and SIL are pretty ok.  There are family members on that side of the family I like quite a bit, but if I had my way to never talk to MIL or FIL or UIL or AIL again….I would be totally ok with NC or VLC.

533386,5,2016-09-16,Afraid that the constant stress and anxiety have permanently damaged my brain,TechnialyItsOneNacho,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/533386/afraid_that_the_constant_stress_and_anxiety_have/,"Im 21 years old and currently in my junior year of college. Ive always had a little bit of an anxiety problem but its never been as bad as the levels it reached within the past few year. Looking back on highschool I cant remember i time when i was really anxious or doubted my intelligence in anyway. I was an outgoing funny guy ,sometimes a little too outgoing due to adhd , but my friends loved being around me so thats all that mattered. I stopped taking my adhd medication during my senior year of hs because my schedule was so relaxed and honestly I had doubts that i even had adhd( or that it was a real thing for that matter). Then right before I came to college i told my doctor that i wanted to get back on the meds. I started taking them the summer prior to going to college and each month i told him i needed my dosaged upped until i got to the max dose. I didnt really think i needed this high of a dose, and honestly hadnt been taking the meds, but I had just started to hang out with some shadier people and wanted to seem cool so i decided to be that guy who always had uppers. Then i got up to school and without hesitation started taking the medication. I remember it made me very introverted and zombie like during school but as soon as i got on the shuttle to come home I was like the energizer bunny. I can account this to the meds wearing off or the fact that i sat with my friend everyday and maybe I finally felt comfortable enough to let all my thoughts out. A few months go by and im still taking the meds like their candy. Taking them to get over hangovers, drink more, snort with people at parties, you name it. I convinced myself that i was addicted to them and accounted all my adhd related symptoms to withdrawl. So i would give myself little breaks from it then get back on them. This went on until i finally transferred to the school I had been aiming for. The curriculum here was alot more demanding and really tested my abilities. I started taking the meds more regularly but still abused them on the weekends. Got through sophmore year with a coupled failed classes but nothing too serious. Came home after first summer semester and proceeded to party my ass off. Near the end i started using my dads boat and the week before i school started back I drank way too much out on the water and hit some stuff on the way home (with my car, not truck with trailer). Car still drove so i went immediatley home. Unfortunately i live in a very small community so ( and it was only 9pm) so there were people that saw the accident and recognized my car. So im sitting outside my house staring at the hole in my windshield and all the other damge, trying to digest what just happened. My friend pulls up talks me down a little and gets me to get into his car. As were pulling off a cop car comes cruising down my street. I immediatley know im fucked. This suspicion was confirmed when he stops even with my buddies car who hadnt pulled out yet. I get out the car and proceed to tell the cop that my sister backed into my car the other day and that i hadnt been driving my car that day( all the while trying to keep myself from falling face first into the pavement. My sister sees the lgihts and comes out the house and asks whats happening(she already knew, small community, eye witnesses were her friends and had texted her before i even got home) cop says go back inside. Another cop pulls up and then things start to get interesting. Whats the he has in his hands? The dismembered boat keys? with all the registration information including my dads name address ? thats right i left them on the hood of my car right before driving off and committing a hit and run. Great. (just realized this wasnt the focus of this post so ill wrap the story up and get onto the point) Mom comes outside and lets out this unworldly shriek then barges back into the house letting out every curse in her vocabulary. Even the cops looked sad for me. My dad comes out, gives his spiel about how im in college in a very tough major, not a dumbass yadda yadda. The cops do a field sobriety test just to show how drunk i am. humiliating. im crying at this point cause my mom (the women whom i spent my entire childhood with and looking up to because my dad was never home) had just let out this terrifying shriek signifying how much of a fuck up i was then proceeded to come outside and ask them to send me to jail. im rambling.... long story short i got a leaving the seen and a speeding ticket. This got the entire family dropped from the insurance and forced me to get sr22.

Week later i went back up to school and continued to take the medication but something weird was happening. The medicince was giving me SEVERE anxiety. Then the panic attacks started. Calling my gf freaking the fuck out. Driving to the hospital an hour away only to turn around when the anxiety subsided because I knew i would only be giving the doctors a laugh. fucking torture.

Some how managed to land a paid internship for the upcoming spring semester. I was tired off all this fear and anxiety so when new years came around i decided it was time to figure myself out. I decided to really try and get my adhd medication dialed in correctly and start seeing someone about my anxiety. (2016) Went through 3 different medications and they all made my anxiety way worse. This anxiety made me think i didnt have adhd and that all i was doing was frying my brain, which was further reinforced by how sporadic and unfocused i was off the meds. 

end of summer 2016 and i decide fuck the meds i dont need em. Quit for a month(right before school starts back up ..brilliant). Finally came to the realization that i do need them so now ive been trying something for about a month now. 

everyday the anxiety comes back in new form. Today in class i had a friend say something to me looking for an intelligent response and all i could muster was some thing superficial. The look i was met with in response to this mediocrity was one that i can only explain as futile, or  the sudden realization that i was incapable of deeper thought. My response was an effort but my brain hit a ""wall"" i literally could not think of anything else to say.

so .... im worried all this long term stress/anxiety has fried my brain. Leaving me stranded and unable to complete my degree. i have my first round of tests next week and im terrified....

TL;DR : Abusing meds, Stupid decisons resulting in ptsd? , ultimatelty feeling deserted and betrayed by the people i trusted the most. this caused panic attacks/ persistent stress and anxiety for a year, on top of a prexisting anxiety disorder and adhd. So now im worried i fried my brain and am incapable of finishing my degree .


sorry for the rambling and jumping around



edit : left out some pretty relevant stuff.....the panic attacks didnt start during my sophmore year. They started the second semester of my freshman year. After i got kicked out of my housing for smoking pot in my room. so an entire year and half of pretty severe panic attacks went by before i had the hit and run..... so 2 and half years of panic attacks and severe stress....."

It was around 2001, so that's a while ago, but I feel like I would never forget if I found out my son was (he's a toddler now, but you know what I mean, in the future).

I've been breaking up with my husband for the past year, and I've explained it to my mom 4 times.  Yesterday, I was talking to her on the phone, and she said, ""You know, if you're not careful, things are going to get really bad between you . . . "" meaning, we're going to get a divorce, and I lost it and told her I'm done talking to her about it.

The DAY BEFORE this, I explained to her how we're living like friends for now, and she said, ""That's good; so are you dating anyone?"" and I told her of course not since I'm in school, don't have time, and am technically still married (haven't filed papers yet).

She's really oblivious and can't remember anything about me.  She was here for 2 weeks to ""help"" me with my toddler, and she kept asking me how she looks, does she look okay, and even if I begged her to leave me alone, she kept busting in to ask me stupid questions.

My sister and I are really very certain that my dad has NPD.  Growing up, I always thought I was close to my mom, even though she never really hears me.

It's like, I'll have this great conversation with her, and feel like, wow, she knows me, and then 2 days later, it's like it never happened.

I told her on the phone yesterday that, when I talk to her, I feel like it goes in and spins around a bit and then flies out the other side.

I feel like she's just a total idiot child.  I hung up on her yesterday and texted her to apologize, but I told her I need a break from her and please don't call me for a week.  She said okay.

So, she hasn't called me, but she's texted me 3 times.  I feel guilty.  I'm so angry with her.

She's always been obsessed with my dad, even though he cheated on her for over 30 years.  He is objectively an asshole but, like everyone else, is not without redeeming qualities.  I find him easier to get along with than my mom at this point.

My dad date-raped my mom (this is India in the 1960s) and then his mom found out and made him marry my mom.  That's the story, anyway, what my mom told me when I was maybe 13-years-old.  My sister told me that my mom's parents were going to set her up with a nice dentist, but that my mom refused to marry anyone but my dad because she loves him.

They divorced ten years ago and my mom still can't get over it.
She disgusts me.  She has no self respect.  She watches romantic comedies and thinks that's what real life is.

Sometimes I think science has not yet developed a name for whatever the fuck is wrong with her.

My sister thinks she might be a form of NPD or some kind of autistic sometimes.  I don't know.

I guess I'm wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone else, this combination.  Of course I could say more, but I'm supposed to be writing a personal statement for my internship application right now, and anyway this is already too long.

Thank you in advance for any help at all, and thank you for reading this.


UPDATE: She just texted me to ask her to take pictures of my son in the shirt she gave him when she was here.  I have been telling her repeatedly that I have to write my personal statement, do all my regular homework, and take care of my toddler son mostly by myself this weekend, so I just wrote her back to remind her I have no free time.  She always says, oh, I'm sorry, I love you, I pray for you, so why, if she hears anything I say to her, why does she not remember anything, why does she not take me seriously AT ALL.  I wish she would just leave me the fuck alone.

5348g2,13,2016-09-16,"[Meta] Welcome, new subscribers!",CampusReform,CampusReform,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampusReform/comments/5348g2/meta_welcome_new_subscribers/,"#Welcome to /r/CampusReform, everyone!

Whoa! After our post on /r/kotakuinaction the other day, we've seen some excellent growth! Take a look for [yourselves](http://imgur.com/5AdxjWz). 

For those of you who can't access Imgur for whatever reason, here are the highlights:

* Subscriber count grew from 151 to over 500. That's an increase of more than 360 subscribers and 240%! Not bad for a small subreddit. 
* Over the past two days, we've had a total of 615 unique users and more than 1100 pageviews. That puts us over 700 uniques and 1,500 pageviews for the month. 

So, for everyone who's new (which is, uh, the vast majority of you), here's how the subreddit has been working so far:

To avoid violating Reddit's self-promotion rules, this account posts articles dealing with liberal/progressive bias and abuse in American higher education. We post articles not only from *Campus Reform,* but also from *Daily Caller, Heat Street, Red Alert Politics, The Federalist,* and *Reason.* We do this by pulling the RSS feeds for those sites through IFTT; their domains are caught by our automod so that we can filter out things irrelevant to the sub (such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampusReform/comments/531hg2/the_electoral_college_still_makes_sense_because/) one, which has nothing to do with the focus of the sub despite dealing with a college--in this case, the electoral college). 

We've had only a handful of user posts, and if memory serves, they've all been self-posts. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but we'd love to see a lot more user engagement and content. That means links to stories of liberal bias/abuse from smaller, local outlets, links to pages on school websites promoting outrageous events (say, a white privilege conference), etc. It also means discussions amongst you guys about various different topics, or your own stories of liberal/progressive bias and abuse. Let's get posting and keep the party going!

##Decent looking place, but a bit of a fixer-upper, isn't it?

You may also notice that we have a relatively barren sidebar and our wiki is pristine. We also have no flair. Unfortunately, the staffer who handles the subreddit only took one coding course in college before quickly deciding the comp sci life was not for them. Our CSS for the sub was handled by an intern, believe it or not. So, if any of you have any expertise in such matter, ***please*** message this account. We'd like to get the sub as nice looking and as functional as possible!

---

##Rules?

Well, we've got a handful of them in the sidebar, but they're pretty sparse and deal primarily with asking you not to submit links from certain domains since we already handle that. In the next few days, we're hoping to flesh out some more rules to keep this place a happy, healthy, and growing community that is in line with Reddit's policies. 

When it comes to moderation, Reddit has traditionally been a bastion of freedom of speech; as such, we intend to keep a reasonably light hand with the moderation. Plus, y'know, we've got day jobs and we can't spend all day browsing Reddit at work (though this raises the question about whether it's wasting time on Reddit when modding the subreddit becomes part of the job)!

##What do you think?
This is the first time any of our staff have ever moderated a subreddit before. We appreciate your patience. But we also want to know what you think! Do you have any suggestions for how we could improve this place? If so, please let us know in the comments below! 

Thanks again, everyone! We hope you visit this place often and that it lives up to your expectations.

In addition to not having a social life or being able to meet girls, I'm trying to land a job and build something where i can get a job, build a career and establish a nest egg. I'm fortunate to be supported by family but they won't be there for long.

I'm based in the bay area and need to enter a career that can be financially successful but i'm having trouble finding a path as I'm used to school where everything is defined.

Is there a field i can enter in something quick to get me out of my rut? I've already graduated college a long time ago and my degree isn't going to land me a job directly, what's a job i can go into and a clear path to get there and ensure financial success?

She texted, ‘Are we still on for tonight?’

He answered, ‘Yes.’

‘Can you get kinky?’

‘How kinky?’

‘Ben Wa balls.’

Charla waited and waited for his response. He was probably using a search engine to find out what Ben Wa balls are.

Finally, his response. ‘In you, right?’

'Of course.’

‘I can accommodate that.’

Thomas Keller was a good looking man with strong looking hands and a great smile under his hipster beard. At least that how he looked on his profile picture.

“Ms. Fox?”

Charla looked up to see her summer intern Jason Graham standing at the door. A twenty three year old kid with charming good looks, the senior from Columbia had been her gopher all summer in her investment banking department. He stepped in with a three inch thick manila envelope.

“The contracts from Wassermans are here,” he said, setting the envelope down on her desk.

“Good. Thanks. Have a seat. I want to talk to you,” she said, setting down her phone.

He sat looking a bit anxious and confused. He should. She was wearing her power suit for her breakfast meeting she had this morning with executives in from the firm’s west coast office. And though her jacket hung on the coat rack and her blouse was delicate and lady like, she still had the aura of a boss with her keen deep blue eyes set in an alabaster face framed with lush dark hair. Jason took a seat across from her.

Charla said, “Well, I just wanted you to know that I think you did a good job and I appreciated your efforts.”

He looked relieved. Charla pushed an envelope his way saying, “You’ve earned this letter of recommendation.”

“Thank you,” he said, taking it and pocketing the letter in his jacket’s breast pocket. “I was going to ask but I didn’t want to push it.”

“Can I take you out for lunch? Show you my appreciation for all of your coffee runs.”

“Uh, yeah sure. Thanks.”

The two walked to a noisy steak house where she and Jason got a booth in a dark corner where the ordered lunch and drinks. The two never returned to the office, drinking the afternoon away, as she shared her tips on how to succeed in cut throat corporate America. When Charla saw the orange light of a sunset glaring through the one shaded window, she realized how late it was. The crowd was becoming more raucous and women in tight dresses were now mixing with the men at the bar. Her buzzing phone skittered over the table. She picked it up, tapping the screen to read the message.

From: Thomas Keller ‘Sorry. Can’t make it.’

Translation: ‘Sorry, I found a hotter woman.’

“Shit,” she said, slamming down her phone.

“What?” he asked.

“That was my date for tonight. He can’t make it. I’m about to lose a bet.”

His brows furrowed in confusion. She sipped her drink and thought what the hell, tell the guy. The shock value alone will be worth it.

“My girlfriends and I give each other sex toys, you know to spice up our sex lives, and we take pictures of using them as proof that they were used. If you don’t, you have to buy the girls a gift. We meet tomorrow. I need to prove that I used my gift.”

“And what did you get, if you don’t mind me asking?”

Charla looked both ways before pulling the box from her bag and handing it to him. She had planned to go straight to her date after work and had brought them along. Jason opened the box and looked at the heavy silver balls.

“What are these?” he asked.

“They’re Ben Wa balls. They’re used to tighten and stimulate your pussy.”

He quickly closed the box and handed it back to her. His eyes lingered on hers before looking down in submission. He grabbed his beer.

He asked, “So you just going to shove them in?”

“My date was going to do that and take the picture.”

“So, you need help?”

She looked at him and laughed. He looked dejected and she stopped laughing to reach out and touch his hand.

“You’re my intern. There’s this thing called ethics.”

“As of four p.m., I’m no longer your intern.”

The executrix and her former intern took a ride share to the lower east side where they walked up a flight of stairs to her apartment. He looked around her airy modern apartment three times larger than his with teak wood floors, plush rugs, well placed artwork and streamline furniture.

“Drink?” she asked.

“Sure. I’ll have what you’re having,” he said, sitting on a butter yellow leather couch.

She stepped into her kitchen and sliced some lime before throwing ice into two tumblers, splashing vodka over them and garnishing the drinks with lime wedges. She handed him his drink and sat beside him, drunkenly kicking off her shoes.

He said, “Nice place.”

“Thanks,” she said, gazing at him with a silly grin on her face as she played with her hair.

“I’ve got to be honest with you. You made my day when you walked by my desk. The way your ass flexes under those tight skirts, it made me chub every time. I mean I’m not sick, and I was taught to respect women, but you,” he said, biting his lip. “You, with that dark hair and those blue eyes and that body. I just wanted to get up in that.”

“You watched me walk by?”

“Every day.”

She giggled before kissing him again and again until they were making out like horny teens in the backseat of a car. His arms pulled her against him until her boobs smashed against his body. Panting, she pushed him away and he opened his eyes to see her flushed face.

“The balls,” she said. “I need to get a picture.”

He sat up as she reached for her purse and pulled out the box and her phone. She set the phone on the coffee table before removing one ball from the box which she raised between the both of them. He kissed it with his bow shaped lips which brushed her fingertips. She handed him a ball before standing to her feet to unzip and shimmy out of her pants. She stepped out of her panties and stripped off her top as well, to stand in front of him dressed only in a black scalloped lace bra. He couldn’t take his off the neat strip of sable fuzz on his boss lady’s pussy inches from his nose. The steel ball was warming in his hand as she leaned over to loosen his tie and unbutton his shirt. She kissed his waiting lips, straddling his lap to sit her naked bottom on his thighs. She took his face in his hands and kissed his lips before drunkenly falling over onto the couch. She giggled, flexing her pedicured toes, lazily gazing at him as she watched her handsome young assistant get up.

“You want to take pictures, Ms. Fox?” he said, getting up to aim the lamp light her way. “Let’s make a movie.”

Jason picked up her camera, aimed it at the couch, and propped it up against a candle before pressing on the video recording button. He plucked the second ball from its box as Charla became comfortable spreading her legs a little to accommodate him.
The camera recorded as he bent to lick her clit. Her fingers roamed in his soft hair as she pressed his head into her moist private warmth. He looked up into the camera before kissing the silver ball, then backed up to insert it inside her wet fold. Charla moaned with pleasure. Her head sank into plush pillows as she processed the feeling of heavy cold steel inside her. Jason backed away to make sure the camera caught it all. He stared at his former boss writhing and hissing like a cat in heat, knees up, cunt out, her swollen pink nub peeking out from between her controlled fuzziness. The sight made him very hard in his pants which he’d take off only if invited. He still thought of her as the boss lady but he couldn’t take it anymore. He dove down between her legs to suck on what teased him the most.

“Oh, Mr. Graham,” she said, enjoying the weight of the ball inside her as his tongue tripped and slopped over her clit.

She contracted and relaxed her Kegel muscles over and over, feeling the steel ball against her soft accommodating insides as Jason planted his palm on her inner thigh to spread her legs and lick a little deeper inside her. He took the second ball and popped it into her pink moistness. She arched her back against the couch as he nuzzled the secret flesh he was privileged to kiss. Charla panted out, “Okay, turn off the camera.” Jason reached over for the phone, fumbling with it until the screen went black.

He asked, “You want me to take them out?”

“What’s the rush?”

He returned to his obsession, burying his head between her legs once more. Charla clutched her knees around his shoulders as she sighed in absolute heaven at the tongue bath he was giving. It went on all night.

Charla awoke in her bed to the grey morning light with Jason beside her. She nearly panicked when her arm hit his back curled up beside her. With an overwhelming sensation to pee, she got up, wrapped a robe around her and walked into the bathroom. She peed as she held the Ben Wa balls still in her. She wiped and rose a little, steadying herself into a squat to take out the balls. She was just about to insert a finger to fish them out when she thought about it. Maybe her pussy does need a little tightening. After all, the ex-husband was a stud with a solid nine inches of girthy length. Four years of his kind of pounding would make any girl wonder if her pussy will snap back into shape. Hmmmm. Maybe she’ll wear them a little longer.

Alright. We've all seen the recent drama post. If not, to summarize, someone wanted multiple recent pledges refunded, there was confusion on CS's end due to the mentioning of a chargeback. CS responded to that by closing his account.

Now, you can argue about whether or not this was justified on CIG's part or not. I replied in there, so you can check my reply history if you want my personal opinion on it. However, one thing the OP mentioned was this:

----

Just a heads up, /u/wleverett_cig did reply to that post and say there was confusion and that they'll get things sorted. Seeing as he's a Game Support Manager, he's basically the highest authority, so he'll be able to sort things out.

UPDATE: The poster has gotten his recent pledges refunded and his old pledge and reward returned to him. Please see below.
----

&gt;In the face of such a rejection, these articles advised and encouraged backers to reply that they would be willing to start a chargeback if they did not receive a refund.

This, ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, is why **we do not believe everything we read on the internet.** This is absolutely *fucking* wrong. The thing is, ""threaten chargebacks"" has become a common response to any situation in which you're trying to get a refund and the other side is dragging their heels, and this is probably an honest mistake that others can make too.

That's why I'm making this post. Its only tangentially related to Star Citizen, but honestly I believe it could help anyone else who needs to get a refund and might be considering this tactic.

----

#Alright Prof, what is a chargeback, and why do they have it?#

A charge back is [""a process that allows debit and credit card holders to reverse transactions when **there is a problem with the goods or services they've purchased using their cards.**""](http://www.choose.net/money/guide/features/chargeback-visa-mastercard.html)

Please note the bolded text. Yep, that's right, its only when there's an issue with the goods or services purchased. That same site has a bit more info:

&gt;Breaches covered under chargeback include situations like the following:

&gt;* The cardholder has bought a TV. As soon as they get it home they realise it has a serious electrical fault but the retailer refuses to help.
&gt;* The cardholder orders an item online but it never arrives and the retailer refuses to refund the cost.
&gt;* The cardholder was overcharged for an item as the result of a technical fault.
&gt;* The cardholder looks at their statement and sees that there's been a clerical error: the account was debited twice for one purchase.
&gt;* There's an unexplained and possibly fraudulent charge to the account.
&gt;* The trader goes bust before they can provide the goods already paid for.

Alrighty, so that's what a chargeback is meant for. If a request for chargeback doesn't fit any of these, your bank will likely say ""No, fuck off"" and just charge you a fee for wasting their time. Does the situation in the post linked in the intro fit any of these categories?

----

/u/SC_TheBursar posted this:

&gt;Another reason for not requesting chargebacks unless they are truly warranted is they can be recorded in your credit history (although typically not displayed on most traditional short form credit reports!). Perform a few (or even just one if it is denied) and now you are a problem customer - kind of like vexatious litigants or particularly clumsy/unlucky people (when it comes to insurance) these are people companies don't want to do business with. It can damage your chances of being approved for future credit.

Excellent info, and something to keep in mind.

#Would the situation linked in the intro actually be legitimate grounds for a chargeback? If not, what happens?#

**This is a hypothetical: a chargeback was not begun, and while it was mentioned, the intended message was that it would happen if they failed to live up to their ToS i.e. not done within the two week max period. There was misinterpretation on CIGs part, which they've apologized for.**

No, it doesn't, as no part of the Terms of Services was broken by CIG. Let's go to those, shall we? First, the bit that says you can cancel the pledge within 14 days.

&gt;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, you may cancel your Pledge for any reason within 14 days of the date on which you made your Pledge if your Pledge is for Virtual Goods (as defined in Sec. 11 below) (“Cancellation Period”). RSI Intern. Terms of Service 1/2015_Draft Final 

&gt;To cancel your Pledge during the applicable Cancellation Period, you simply need to notify us in writing of your decision to cancel your Pledge. The easiest way to do so is to complete and submit to us our cancellation form which can be found here. You can also cancel your Pledge during the applicable Cancellation Period by emailing us at support@cloudimperiumgames.com.

This is fairly cut and dry. As long as there's nothing else in the ToS they can point to, you may cancel a pledge within 14 days of the date in which the pledge is made, by notifying CIG support. This was done by the poster in that thread, and everything proceeded fine.

The problem is, they have this bit in the ToS as well:

&gt;If you cancel your Pledge during the applicable Cancellation Period, we will without undue delay, and in any event within fourteen (14) days from the date on which we receive notice of your decision to cancel your Pledge, fully refund to you the amount of your Pledge. In accordance with applicable financial control and banking rules, we reserve the right to refund you using the same means of payment as you used to make your Pledge.

As long as they make sure the refund goes through within 14 days and that there was no ""undue delay"" (which, considering the workload they have, is probably easy enough), they have not broken the ToS.

----

#Why did CIG refund his entire account, if the chargeback would have failed?#

Because of an error, and an apology has been issued. CIG's Ray Roocroft stated [""may I apologise for how this has been handled. You are completely right in your request, that you are entitled to a refund for any pledges made within the 14 day statutory period (as your request was within 14 days of the purchases) and your account should not have been fully refunded and closed down - this was done in error.""](http://imgur.com/ZurcNEM)


----

#So, I shouldn't ever threaten to start a chargeback?#

I'm not saying that! Chargebacks do have their purpose, which were listed way back up top. If CIG were to have taken over a month to get back to that poster linked in the intro, a chargeback would have been perfectly justified!

If Star Citizen were to release and it only worked on a MacBook Air, **and they refused to refund you**, you would be justified in beginning a chargeback.

The key thing is, think of chargebacks as a weapon. Arguments change drastically when one side pulls a knife, and you should not be surprised if the person you pulled a knife on doesn't want anything to do with you afterwards.

----

#Conclusion#

I hope this helps some people understand what exactly a chargeback is, and why it shouldn't be thrown around willy nilly. Please feel free to ask questions, correct me on a mistake, or anything else.

TL;DR: I spent 40 goddamn minutes typing this, you can spend the time reading it if you actually care.

I'd also like to take a moment to say that this was never meant to be a slam post against the original poster of the drama post, but that honestly after rereading it a few times today it definitely came off that way even to me. Therefore, I'd like to issue an apology to him for my mischaracterization.

However, my point stands: Chargebacks are not to be used lightly."

as i have always been into design on the compute, my dad recently came at me with the idea of maybe exploring user experience/design. so ive been reading up on it. which also got the idea of web design/development in my head.  after playing around with these ideas and reading about them, i figured its something i could really get into, as i am also a very visual person. a few years back, before my life really changed due to some unsuspecting circumstances, i used to be really into this whole design thing - photoshop, illustrator, indesign, dreamweaver - so i am familiar with some of the basic. 


so, i decided to go BACK to my community college and take my first  intro class, ""Website design"". i really have no clue where to get started in this field, how to get a job, etc., so im hoping this class will just lay down the basics of design and development. the class will also introduce me to html, css and javascript, which is good because i have never, ever used those before let alone done ANY coding in my life, so that is the only part that I am not too familiar with. can anyone else tell me what to expect? i am still somewhat new to the whole thing, so any helpful links or advice on web design/development in general would be much appreciated. 

like i said, i really have no clue where to start"

Anyone who has emigrated or has information regarding accommodation could you point me in the right direction?

I will have just finished my 3rd year in Summer 2017 degree, with being able to return in September 2017 for the 4th and final year. 

Will I be able to score internships considering its only a BSc ordinary degree? 

Is it difficult to get citizenship for Irish citizens in Canada?

How can I avoid getting friend zoned and get her involved?,Thaaz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53739y/i_26_m_fell_for_coworker_23_f_how_can_i_avoid/,"Actually it's the 2nd time I ask a question about this girl - previous topic is titled: 'This girl at work [23 F] was looking at me [26 M] for months, now I started to pay attention. What next?'

To make it short, she started internship in March and gave me hundreds of smiles and cute looks, but we've been talking only since last week. First we used internet communicator, but I understood she won't open without having a REAL conversation.

She agreed to talk during work hours, in a secluded place outside building. We had 3 such meetings, each lasting ~60 minutes, so that's great. I learnt she will work here at least for another 3 months, and I told her - I'm very emotional and nervous in such situations - that I enjoy her looking at me, that I want more of that, and I'm interested in having a date in near future. She said she'll think about it, smiling.

Now I'm a little anxious she knows perfectly well I fell for her and she can toy with me. I don't know if she has a boyfriend, probably yes, but hell - as long as she's talking to me, it doesn't matter. I just want to avoid getting friend zoned. On one hand, she seemed interested for many months, she keeps eye contact and is nice to me. On the other, my gentle attempts at touching her didn't work out, she's very secretive about herself (although opened up a little yesterday), and she doesn't give me any clear signs of attraction.

I don't know what it means, maybe it's just fun for her and she isn't taking me seriously (=friend zone). Or maybe she has a BF and weighs her 'options'. Or plays hard to get. I'm confused.

Bottom line: I leave tomorrow on delegation and won't see her (or text) for more than a week. I'm losing my mind about it and I'd love to know she feels the same. If not, well, I must do everything to change it, because it's my no. 1 priority. But how can I avoid discouraging her? How to keep her interested, when to ask her out, how to act without drama and read her intentions? Lots of questions, but I was 'out' for so many years that it's hard to grasp.

537yqe,11,2016-09-17,Been thinking about the reunion stage of temporary LDRs - I'm curious to discuss how others feel. I [M23] have both failure and success to share!,Tremaparagon,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/537yqe/been_thinking_about_the_reunion_stage_of/,"Many couples who aren't LDR initially might find them selves facing temporary long distance. For me, I consider being far apart for a month or more officially a long distance period of the relationship, rather than just a trip. I wonder if most people think like this, more or less. Regardless there's always the anticipation of getting back together and planning all the things you'll do and how you'll catch up and spend time together again. However, the dynamics of getting back together can be so different from relationship to relationship.

I've been in two relationships now where we've been apart for three months. The first was in undergrad where we had different internships in different states. Things seemed to be going well and we communicated a lot but kept ourselves busy and totally trusted each other. When she came back, I was so excited, but something immediately felt off. She seemed cold and distant and wasn't eager to be alone with me. She seemed to just acknowledge me while going on about meeting up with friends and her new roommates and how much she wanted to see them all. Needless to say I felt a little lost and especially neglected. 

Things were rocky ar that point and I eventually found out part of why. Within a couple weeks of some tense and frustrating time we had kind of a heat to heart because I was fed up and basically the gist of it was this: I missed her more and more over time and basically wanted to binge on her when she was back. Make up for lost time. She was never really a relationship oriented person so to her she was still adjusting to being back and getting into the rhythm of school again. So she felt like she was fighting me off from smothering her. Basically what I got out of it was she would have expected to pick things up date by date again and not just dive into each others arms. I sympathise and know she did nothing wrong but it still hurt to experience. We never really recovered fully, we tried, but she ended things some months after, but there were other reasons as well.

**Anyway I'd like to hear others' thoughts or experiences with reuniting and what things went as expected and what was different. Was there anything scary or exciting or comforting about how you and your partner changed over time? What was it like getting back to a physically close relationship? How did things change or what stayed exactly the same? Please bring up whatever tale or ideas you want to share!**

That last relationship crushed me for a while because of how it seemed to fizzle out, and there was nothing I could do about it. But I'm proud to say this time with my current girlfriend it succeeded! We were apart for three months this summer, and have had a lot of fun since we got back together. Things did pick up as they left off, no surprises. Frankly I had been worrying a lot because of the past but the signs were better. For example she changed her initial plans for getting to her family home from the airport a few hours away from here, and instead told me ""I want you to be the one to pick me up and I'm staying with you before going home the next day."" Not that significant, but in my situation it meant a lot. If you've read this far have some [success](http://i.imgur.com/3MoAIhG.jpg) [selfies](http://i.imgur.com/UrIMDnU.jpg), you've earned it!

**TLDR getting back together can have unexpected challenges. People think of reuniting differently. What are your thoughts or stories?**"

We create so much mental activity revolving around women - be it expectations, assumptions, justifications - that we no longer see the women for herself but our mental activity about her, which is most often falsely created from a limited perspective.

Men communicate overtly. We say what we think, mostly. Women communicate covertly, they do what they think and say what needs to be said to ensure they're not rocking the boat.

Look at her actions, not her words.

***
First off, I apologize for bitching during my last field report.

A friend here has a fuck-buddy, let's call her M. M's cousin sells social media likes, an old business of mine that did really well which I've been looking to get back into for years now. I met the M at a club and asked her about her cousin. He was at the club and she introduced me to him on the noisy, crowded dance floor. I was able to get his number after telling him I'm in the industry and would like to have a conversation about business.

The next day I send him a text and ask him to meet up for a beer to discuss business. He instead invites me to go out with him and his friends. I show up at his apartment to pre-game, and after some discussion realize we're on two different models of the business and I don't have much to bring to the table on his model of business.

His company has 8 million Euros in the bank, and he was telling me his new business model that's brought in the capital. He's sort of like the Genghis Kong of the app store, buying hundreds of app one-by-one and increasing their profitability. He's too legit now for my old ways of doing business, but he did hint at the fact of future opportunity when he said that recruiting new interns, partners, and employees is the hardest part.

Some of his employees showed up - really top-notch people, but comfortably informal kids in their 20s who mostly dropped out of school to learn a hard skill and apply that skill as part of an entrepreneurial venture.

I then met his friend who owns a company which sells CRM systems to Italian banks, along with a few other companies. I was talking to him about entrepreneurship, success, and the like. ""If you want something, you must take it. Don't think of money as the goal. The money is a means to an end. What you're working towards is the feelings and emotions money brings. I don't like to clean my house, so when I work I work so that I don't have to clean my house - I hire people to do that for me - I never work for the money. When a client is threatening to close a contract, I say, ok - go ahead. It's not about the money.""

We went to a club for a couple hours, and I said goodbye and left after 2 whiskeys and this terrible concoction called ""Negroni.""

I had no idea how to get home at that point - the metro was closed and only trams and buses were running. I asked some people outside the club who gave me complicated directions my non-sober self wasn't exactly capable of following. I jumped on the first tram I saw and started talking to this girl on her way home from going out. I was laughing having a good time as I asked her for directions, teased her, did my thing. I got her number and I'll take her out for drinks in the area tomorrow.

I pretty much dropped my plate. I don't really desire her anymore - she was a step down from what I was used to but I was on a dry spell and needed to hit the reset button. As it stands I have two girls I think I can fairly easily convert to plates.  I could do better but I have better things to direct my time and energy towards. They're 6's or so, good fuck-buddies both nothing more... unless they can cook, in that case they'll be over every night.

My friend in Miami real estate hit me up with some sort of a promoting-type opportunity with his friend who is expanding his real estate operations into this Italian city. We'll see what comes of it. Tonight I'll meet with a guy who works for what's probably the most popular club in town, to discuss promoting work. After my last promoting gig really blew up in my face, I didn't want to continue with this position, but I got some new, fresh ideas today as to how to promote; might as well try it and see how it goes.

As of now I have 50 Euros left and change, with no steady source of income. I hate to ask my parents for money but it's come to that for the time being. It's expected - I'm a first year student in college. However, my dream is to make them wonder ""how come he never asks for money? and why haven't we heard about rent?"" and fly back home completely on my own dime, show up at the front door and surprise them.

I was losing grasp of my discipline of working out and daily meditation for a few days after crashing at a friend's place and having a few long days of classes. I was on a lazy, high-stress streak for a few days where all I wanted to do was sleep. Today I finally manned up and went for a run, which motivated the hell out of me. I got home, did a proper workout, and listened to *Self Reliance* in the shower.

That gave me the inspiration to love fate and love where the ""gods"" have brought me. So, in that case, I will work very hard at what I am doing. I will work doubly hard, however, to ensure that I can do some business ventures on the side, in order to learn new skills, explore what I like, and learn valuable lessons.

I may have posted on here about a month ago about how my parents stabbed me in the back over a computer I wanted to build.         
The jest of the story was that I had worked an internship during the summer and saved enough money to buy a computer + monitor worth ~$800. However, my NDad had forcefully put my checks into a short term CD from which I couldn't withdraw from (too much saving to the point where I had to work overtime just to pocket enough cash to buy business clothes).                    
Midway through the summer I correctly predicted that they wouldn't allow me to buy the computer and yet I went against my better judgement and trusted them by ending all of the counter-measures I had created to hide the purchase (i.e making my own bank account, automatically doing a direct deposit to this bank account so that they won't be shown on my checks to my parents, etc). Nearing the end of the summer I trusted them to be understanding towards me buying it as long as I said it was for productivity. Then what happened is what typically happens here on RBN: they turn me around and backstab me. Called me ""disrespectful"", fought me, etc.                                 
Well, it has been a month now and I've finally sneaked the money away to buy the PC!!! And it is AWESOME!!! I've played games at 1080p AND done excel homework. I call it ""Parental Advisory"". I have also the parts list found below.              
I just want to say that your parents are now an all-consuming force. They are fallible just like you and me. Even if they shout nonsense like ""We are doing our best"" or ""we are just doing what is best for you"" know that as you get older you have more autonomy, even if they don't want that for you. If you have done something amazing, even if they want your results to be put into a certain area, don't be afraid to say no, sneak away or do anything to put your rewards to whatever area you want.

5398ks,2,2016-09-17,College internship question,Shopcell,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/5398ks/college_internship_question/,"I'm looking at attending a university as a freshman, and I'm interested in their Financial Mathematics degree program. This morning I spoke with a Math professor about what the school can do for students trying to become actuaries. He told me that an insurance company with a local headquarters near the college asks him for candidates for internships every year, and he sends them a list of the best students. He also said that company has a very good relationship with the university and usually hires students right when they graduate. 


This sounded amazing to me that the professor already has connections and would be willing to help set up internships. I thought about it a little more and had a question about possible issues that you all might be able to help me with.


If I go to this university, will other insurance firms see me as marked for the one company the college has an agreement with? I don't want to be locked in and unhirable if I decide later to move to another region.

I'm also worried that the university might teach specifically for that one insurance company, to make candidates for them only, so I might learn things wrong for another firm.

Also it's a small, not widely known school so Im slightly concerned that other companies might not recognize it.


But to be honest I have no idea if these are legitimate concerns, so if I'm wrong please straighten me out. Thank you for your time."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP

53a5bw,5,2016-09-17,I [22m] don't know how to break up with my 2+ year long-distance relationship love of my life [20f] and desperately need help.,basedgunners,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53a5bw/i_22m_dont_know_how_to_break_up_with_my_2_year/,"Me and my gf (April) have been in a relationship for almost 2 years. We had both dated around, but this is both our first major relationship.

Our relationship has been pretty great, but the only problem is that I go to school on the east coast and she goes to school in my hometown 12 hours away. I'm currently in my last year, and she has 6-8 more years of med school and residency. The only time I get to see her are during all the major breaks, and we've been long distance for maybe 2/3 of our relationship. We've broken up a couple of times (mainly over miscommunication), but we always end up making things work. It seems like we've been through so much together, and she's helped me to grow into a better person. I love her very much, and when we're physically together, we're inseparable. I love almost everything about her, and I've thought in the past that she's the one that I want to get married to and spend my life with.

However, lately I've been thinking about all the things that I wanted to do in college, and feel that I've really missed out. I turned down certain job opportunities and opted for internships with smaller companies back home just so that I could spend the summer with her. I really wanted to study abroad and completely forgot about it last year because I was so madly in love with her. I still am, but lately I've started to remember all of these things that I wanted and planned to do before I met her. I also want to be able to go out with my friends whenever I want and it kind of sucks missing out on things because I have to worry about being reckless or having a skype date or something scheduled. I also never really got to experience the single life for the majority of college. 

As for her, I feel like she's made incredible sacrifices just to see me. She barely goes home to see her family, and during most of the major breaks, she'll cut her time short with them so that we can spend time with each other because those opportunities are so scarce. I am so grateful for all of that, but I feel incredibly guilty that she's sacrificing all of that for me. I know this sounds selfish, but if we didn't get to see each other during those breaks, I would not  want to continue a long-distance relationship, because it would be too hard. Lately, there have been talks about how she's planning on going to grad school in another state, and that she might not be around this summer, because she wants to go home and work for her parents. I don't blame her for wanting to spend time with her family, but for my selfish reasons, I just don't think that I could handle not physically being with her.

I feel like I want to be free in my final year and not have any responsibilities when deciding my next step in my life (whether its career-wise or grad school). I can't make long distance work for another few years if we don't end up in the same place (which seems likely). I also believe that even if we do end up in the same place, she'll be stressed out from grad school all the time and she's not exactly someone who handles that very well, which would be a difficult living environment. Either way, it seems like the future is incredibly cloudy, and I'm not sure that I see one with her because of all of the uncertainty. I'm not sure it's fair to either one of us to push through this relationship in our final years of college if we're just going to end up breaking up anyways.

The big problem for me is that I've never broken up with someone before, and I'm not sure what it's supposed to feel like. Every time I think about breaking up with her, I feel like throwing up and my heart feels like shattering into a million pieces. Logically, I feel like breaking things off seems like the right thing to do for both of us, but for some reason the thought of it makes me weak. It destroys me thinking about what it would do to her, especially after all the incredible moments that we've shared. I just don't know if I'm being impulsive, or if I need this, or what. I'm lost right now because I really do love her and I care for her so much. Has anybody been in this situation before, or something similar? I've been thinking about this for the past month and I feel like it's eating me up inside.

  ---   

tl;dr: Been in a long-distance relationship for the majority of college with the girl of my dreams, but I feel like we're holding each other back. I'm not sure if I'm being impulsive or if this is actually what I want and should do. Logically, I think this is the right choice, but it's so hard to bring myself to that point."
53a7tu,1543,2016-09-17,Thank you,Mod_Ed,2007scape,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/53a7tu/thank_you/,"Back in June I joined Jagex for a three month internship as a Junior QA Analyst working on Old School RuneScape. Today my three months with Jagex came to an end. 

I first started playing RuneScape over 10 years ago and it has been a game that has stayed with me ever since. As a huge fan of the game, the chance to finally work on it myself was a dream come true and while it hasn't always been easy, every day I walked into that office has been an absolute honour. The chance to contribute to the future of Old School with the various pieces of content I've worked on over to summer, especially the Wintertodt which I designed myself, is something that will stay with me forever.

So I say thank you. Thank you to everyone on the Old School team for making and maintaining one of the finest games to have ever existed and thank you for allowing me to be a part of that. And most of all, thank you to every single person in the amazing community that this game has. Old School would be nothing without you.

Well that's it from me, I have to go see if Joel is on Skype yet. Goodbye and once again, thank you.

53aefe,2,2016-09-17,"I [24F] broke up with my BF [24M] of 6 years, not sure if I did the right thing",shouldiregret,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53aefe/i_24f_broke_up_with_my_bf_24m_of_6_years_not_sure/,"**What happened**

I broke my 6 year previously long distance relationship this week, I'm feeling very confused and I'm not sure if I was unfair to him. 


**Background**

We met when we were both 18, on the internet. He was a very troubled guy, he had issues with depression and had already tried suicide. He was obese, had problems with his family, had no money, no job, and had stopped going to school that year. He was a really, really bad boyfriend at the time, very emotionally demanding, very fragile in general (if something bad hapenned, his first thought was suicide). That was a VERY unhealthy relationship for a 18 year old to get into, but I went though with it despite my mother being absolutely against it, with reasons. 

For the first 4 years things didn't improve much for him, the exceptions being: he lost a lot of weight and finished high school. But that was it. For me, things improved a lot - by that time I had saved a good amount of money, was at university and was off to spend a year studying abroad. 


**Beginning of the problems**

When I returned home last year, I asked him if he didn't want to move to my city. He was scared but I was insistent, because he always said he had no future there at his city, and he didn't like to live with his family. He said he couldn't because he had no money, so I figured I'd help him by covering all his expenses until he got a job. So he got a job and spent literally 2 days at it because they'd lied to him about what he'd had to do, plus the place had sanitary problems (rat urine and feces all around. it was a local supermarket, ew). So I said ""okay, let's find something else"". The next month he found another job, and spent another 2 days at it because he had an anxiety attack over having to talk on those walkie talkie radios. So now I was very disappointed already but said ""okay let's find some therapy for you"". But before he started therapy he was at my house and I was talking to my mom about a friend that got married and didn't have a job and her husband neither, and they lived off my friend's parents. Then my mom said something about it being wrong to live off somebody else's money and my boyfriend took it personally and thought it was directed at him. He got mad, left my house and later we got into an argument because we were talking about someone else and not him, though probably my mom's comment had a bad timing. So I broke up with him and he went back to his city. Later I regretted breaking up with him and asked if we could be together long distance again. He started going to therapy there and became a whole new person, his anxiety and depression were under control and it was like a dream come true for me.


**Current problem**

Fast forward to 6 months ago. This time he took the initiative to move again to my city, but he still had the money problem. I said I could help him until he got a job. We were not living together, he rented a room and I was still living with my family (where we live, it's not weird at all to live with your parents even when you're ""old"" like me). We planned on moving in together after we both had stable jobs. So he moved and started looking for jobs. I saw it, he really tried to get a job, he was called for a couple interviews but he couldn't get a job. Eventually he didn't know where to look for a job any more so he kind of just left it at that. To be fair, he would ask all the time if he was being a burden for me and I'd say no, because I wanted him to feel secure. It would bother me that I had to pay for everything alone, but I had the money so I figured why not continue helping him. 2 months ago he managed to get a scholarship at a private university (government scholarship, not good grades scholarship). That was a huge victory because he'd be the first one on his family to go to college, and that would mean he'd finally have some qualification. Then he said he couldn't get a normal job anymore because now he had classes to attend at night and most normal jobs work hours were in the afternoon until night. I said ""well okay, so look for internships"", so he applied to a few, but no answers. And it was left at that. 

Then we had an argument last week about something random. After he moved to my city we were having arguments over everything really. I figured we were raised very differently and many things I find important are unimportant to him, and vice-versa. Plus, I didn't feel like he could complain about me because I had to put up with a lot of things I didn't like in him while having to pay for everything he needed (probably I was wrong in thinking that, because in relationships we always have to put up with some things we don't like about the other person). Anyway, when we argued last week, he said he was done and wanted to go back to his city. So I said ""you know what, I'm done too"", and said he could go back to his city. After that I thought about many things that were not making me happy in this relationship. I remembered all the stuff my mom pointed out during all these years and I chose to ignore so I could stay with him. I'm going to list a few things that were bothering me:

* He kept asking me for my stuff. I know we were in a relationship and all but it made me really uncomfortable that he wanted me to give him my stuff all the time. Sometimes I would give it to him and he would sell it and keep the money to himself. We had an argument about this once and he said I was being petty and everything we had separately should be ""our things"". He has tried to sell me some os his stuff, though. 

* He had no manners at my (my mom's) house. He would come in and talk loudly, sit on the sofa as if it were his house (becase ""he was family, so why couldn'd he sit like he wanted""), munch loudly on the food, grab my butt in front of my house which made me really uncomfortable. I called him out on the manners many times because I know my mom notices these behaviors and would think poorly about him, but he wouldn't listen because he thinks manners are stupid social rules, basically.

* He had a dish he really liked to eat on Sundays, so he would come here before lunch time and prepare it. He didn't want to get up early on Sundays though, so I had to leave things halfway done for him to arrive and just finish it. He claimed there was nothing wrong with that because it was just a favor he as asking, but I think that if he's the only one that really wants to eat it, he should come here and prepare it himself and not involve anyone else.
  
* He'd be unpolite at times and make some rude comments in front of my family (I believe it wasn't on purpose but it was bad regardless)

* This one isn't really his fault but was a problem regardless: we have very mismatched sex drives. He feels like it all the time and I never feel like it, especially because I was always kind of upset at him so it killed all the mood. He couldn't keep his hands off me even in inappropriate places, which pissed me off because I was always worried about other stuff (such as if he would ever get a job) and he was thinking about sex. We had discussions over this dozens of times, and I realize I was the problem here, but I just can't feel like it at all with so many worries on my mind.


**How I feel right now**

Despite all that, he was very sweet and loving, I feel he really loves me and I do love him back, but I don't feel like putting up with this anymore. I think maybe we could talk everything through and come to an agreement, but I just don't feel like sticking around anymore. He made tons of improvements over the last year and was finally getting somewhere in life after he started attending university. When I said I wanted to break up he blamed it on my mother, because  she thinks he's not good for me despite all the efforts he's made to become a better person. He also said that he feels lied to, because I said I would help him until he got a job and suddenly (to him) I said it was a problem that I have to cover all his expenses. I kind of feel that he thinks I should have no problem in paying for everything for who knows how long, just because I have the money. 

I'm confused, I don't know what to think. Sometimes I feel relieved, sometimes I feel worried that he'll get depressive and suicidal again, sometimes I regret I gave up and miss him so much, sometimes I regret I ever started it. I don't know anything anymore. I'd appreciate to hear some thoughts.  

Thanks for your time.

  **tl;dr**: Broke up my 6 year relationship because I had to put up with a lot of things that made me uncomfortable, but I'm not sure I did the right thing because I sticked around during all his depressive bad times and decided to break it now that things seemed to be getting better. I'm confused and don't know if I did the right thing."

We started young, but we had one of the most dedicated, fun, and amazing relationships I've ever seen.
After a couple years I began to realize this is the type of girl I could spend my life with.  We talked about getting married and sharing a life together, and we kept those dreams alive for many years... 
This summer she picked out a ring (which I happily bought) and I was just waiting to finish college before proposing.  We had everything planned, and we were so so happy.  She told me every day I was her everything and she couldn't wait for our life together.

Then suddenly things changed.  She did an internship this summer where she met a few new friends and found a job she wants to do the rest of her life.  Suddenly her feelings about me seemed to fade.  She told me that we weren't right for each other and that we had too many differences.  I learned that she had a couple incidents in the week leading up to the breakup where she cheated on my with one of her close friends.  She is now pursuing a long-distance relationship with him.

My whole world has been completely shattered.  I loved her with all my heart.  She was my best friend and closest confidant.  She was the love of my life and I looked forward to our future every day.  Now she's gone.  I am utterly broken.  She made so many promises and we had such a good time and a good future.  Now I'm struggling so hard for motivation and for meaning.

Every night when I finally fall asleep I dream about her.  I dream about us reconciling, about waking up from the nightmare I'm living.  I've done all the cliche things on the checklist... I started working out, I keep my head up during the week and I don't let anyone know I'm bothered.  I don't talk to her or look at her social media.  But I don't feel any better.  I'm trying to put my life together and move on, but all I want is for things to be like they were.  I thought after a month I would start seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.

Every morning I wake up and wish that I hadn't.  Every night I don't care if I never wake up.  I have no passion for anything that interested me before.  I feel like I ruined the relationship with the one person who I loved more than anything.

How do I move on from someone who has moved on from me?"

Quick intro: I'm a 29 years old male, studying Computer Science. I started my college year on a High Profile Public College at my country, but, had some issues about it, so, i studied there for 8 years and now i'm finishing my degree on a private college. The issues mainly consisted on me being quite unmotivated and very very very(did i say very?) unhappy about my ""gifts"" for programming and IT stuff overall. I feel like i'm just a mediocre programmer, and that my skills will not be enough to provide a living for me =/

During the last 3 years, i took some violin students. I play the violin since i was 8 years old, but when i expressed the will to do it as college carrer, my mom backlashed it thoroughly. I was 15 years old when it happened, and it was quite convincing at the time. Mostly because i didn't see myself as Violin Teacher (Money stuff and, because i won't work on Sabbath, i would hardly be able to play at an Orchestra)

My mom profile: Nurse, PhD in Public Health Care
My brother profile: Mechanical Engineer, Speaks 4 languages and work on a Consulting company as low level consultant.


That being said, i mostly want to warn that i hold no grudge for my mom breaking my will to go for Violin Major and stuff. Past stuff is on the past and so.

**--The real issue--**

I've decided that, after i finish Computer Science, i'll work on it until i can pass the Music College exams. I'm working towards it and I've already 5 students under my wing, and looking for expanding this number. But my brother and mom are really annoying about it. They just see problems with that, keep insisting that i should get an internship ASAP (Which i'm doing, it's not like it will fall on my lap. I'm currently participating on 12 different selection programs. I **believe** I'm bound to pass at least one. So that's no an issue i can control every detail)

My mom just ask me when i'll get a real Job. All my brother talks to me is if ""Have you signed up on this Internship already?"" They start to stick their's noses on my classes ""You are taking to much time with this student's class"" (When it took 20 minutes more to finish a class) ""This student is trying to teach you how to teach"" (Because my student that have hand issues on left hand). They both gave a hard time because i took a violin to the Luthier for a student ""This is not you Job. You put too much effort on this thing."" and other stuff

It gets on my nerves because i never say a thing about their jobs/careers. My brother worked so hard that he developed stomach issues because of the stress. My mom is already retired, and works at my uncle's clinic and developed some depression stuff over the years of work. They don't know squat about violin teaching and playing. They just seem to think ""Violin teaching is not a Job."" This whole situation is ruining my mood lately. I know i'm at fault for not being graduated, to not liking Computer Science and stuff. But it does not give me 1% of the Happiness of Teaching Violin. They always seems unhappy about their line of work, and they want me to follow the same path. My brother always complains about his job and the whole ""office companies eco-system"". I know money is something we need to survive, but, why can't they let me go for what it want? And what i believe i'm actually good?(Or at least not mediocre).

I'm flustered about it, and it destroyed my weekend. I just hope this situation gets better on the happening of getting an internship. But i feel like i'm just giving up on my goals to please them. Plz, give me some light and help on this matter.

  **tl;dr**: I'm 29, giving violin classes, although i'm in college for Computer Science for 9 years and want to go to Music Major afterwards. Mom and Younger Brother getting on my nerves and meddling on my classes. I feel they don't see being violin Teacher as a valid line of work/Career Path. What should i do to A)Let them not ruin my mood; B)Make them accept my choices"

I have a request for you, one of my foreign ex girlfriend sent me a very dirty story one day, that she wrotte specialy for me.. I like to read it sometimes, and few days ago i thank about Gonewild Audio.. I would love to hear some of you girls reading it while you touch yourself.. it could turn me on soooo much !
by the way i'm French and she is spanich ;)
So here is that dirty story, feel free to change or add different things ! I'm hurry to listen you..

""It was a hot day on summer, the beginning of July, warm and sunny day. I was in the office, in my glamorous study with the air conditioning very loud. I love my job, I feel goosebumps when I am in a reunion with lot of those men that thinks they own the world, but at home when they come back knows who take the control, and here is the same. Maybe they feel some reaction in their underwear when they see me come to the center of the table with my tight skirt and my blazer, with my deep eyes and my cold and distant character but sarcastic at the same time. Sometimes I like to think that they think in me one time at day, but just to make me feel desirable, because they know they are out of my league, and is not because I’m with someone, is because I’m very selective with men. Normally the man is not enough for me, maybe is not too good in the bed, maybe he bores me, maybe he is not big enough… Today I have to do a selection of people for internship, the department of Human Resources do the dirty job but is me who take the finally decisions. This time there is people from other countries, I like to see the pic profile, who knows… I make the decision in five minutes, is very easy for me, I look first the age, younger I could squeeze them as I can, then the profile pic, I take this very serious I don’t accept ugly people in my office sorry, and finally the hobbies of the person, this can say you lot of thing about the person, and of course I’m sure that the Human Resource Department only accept people prepare. I pause two seconds over the odds to see a photo, is a French man of Normandy, what the hell is that city, but he looks nice, I can see something very interesting inside his eyes. Maybe he will be my new guinea rabbit, we will see. I use to wear sexy lingerie, even in the office, is because one day I caught out of this, I was reviewing some reports and the boss of the other department of the central in New York comes to visit me, but unfortunately my secretary forgot this fact, of course I dismiss her at the second, and I didn’t wear the right lingerie but anyway it was and amazing fucked. This time I had the adequate underwear, black and sophisticate. I had black tights with light, a black culottes and bra with lace and silk in some parts. And I had a very tight skirt grey with a companion blazer, sexy and serious at the same time. And of course, I have more pants in my bag, is very important to have spares for a women like me, I used to have sex at the office, is very important for my job because is very stressing. This morning the candidates will come to my study and I have to do the corresponding interview. The first one is a girl, I just select girl less smart than me, the competition is the competition, and of course less beautiful. She looks me with a Bambi eyes, she just end her degree two months ago, and when I asked her the first question I can see that the left eyelid trembles. Too weak for this company, you will need nerves of steel. The second one is a guy, I think, he looks very feminine, at the beginning he seems very hustler but I can see under the table white socks with a black shoes, sorry but I can’t stand this sacrilege to fashion. Get out! Finally the last candidate, is the French guy I remember his face. He seems very confident, smiling and he transmits good vibrations, nice beginning. I can see inside his deep eyes, I find something disturbing, he doesn’t look me like the other men, he looks me with a mixture of concern and curiosity. Usually I caused a barrier between the men and I, I think is due to the power that I emanated. As I do questions to him, he doesn’t stop to looking at me straight at the eyes. I like this, I like the way he looks me, is very sexy, I notice something in my pants… Maybe is the hot day or maybe is me, but I start to sweat, and after a shiver runs my back. I think I’m getting horny, come on Sara, he is just an internship partner. He realize of my discomfort and he suggests to open the window a little… Is not necessary we have air conditioner I answer him, but he says me that sometimes natural air is better than artificial, suddenly I don’t know why I’m thinking in my vibrator, and I’m agree with him, is better natural things… I realize that I have a month without fucking, I can understand now this reaction, is not only him presence what excited me, is me… In the middle on the conversation I have an idea, maybe is too much bold but never mind, is summer and I’m exhausted… I ask to Simon what position he prefers in the bed, and I can see that him is not red or surprised, he has a half smile in his face! INCREDIBLE! I just found a good candidate, I say to him that the job is for you! And also that I was kidding before, it was just an strategy to see him reaction to the puzzling.. .I’m a professional at all! But I need to take some fresh air and I need some distraction to this busy day, and before he close the door I ask him, stop Simon, lock the door please! He doesn’t ask why just do what I say… He is in front of me, waiting for something and I ask to him, Simon can you clean the hard drive? He is confused, so I ask again with and this time I’m more effusive with my look and eyebrows… Can you clean the hard drive? He is smiling and very quick he says, of course, I’m very good with this!! Ok, we will see I think…. He comes slowly to my table, him eyes are very shine, I’m impatient to have him mouth in my cunt, I start to be very wet… I sit in the chair with my legs very open, he is on the floor and starts to take off my pants with his eyes on my eyes, very concentrate, and when he looks my thing he realize of my lingerie, he is very happy I can see in him look… I feel him wet tongue on me, oh my god, I’m getting more and more horny now, he take my legs with him arms and start to eat me very deep… I start to make some noise, Oh I can see you are really good, I told you he says… Suddenly someone knock on the door, oh no! I say one moment but the door is lock, so I call to my secretary to open it, Simon is under the table… is the boss of the department of Human Resources to ask me if I did the choice of the candidate, and I answer yes, the candidate is suitable, he has good skills!!!! And after he left my study, thanks god! And my secretary ask me if I need something, Oh no I’m perfect now!! I look to Simon and he is laughing a lot… but I’m saying continue with my eyes… He takes me again to eat me, I am so wet that I say Simon come here, and I give a passional kiss to him, I like him sweet lips, so good, is a good and slow kiss! And after I surrender something in him ear, just what I want…. And what I want is that him take a rule that I have in my box and spank my ass very hard! Come here Simon, just take off my skirt and my blazer (because under my blazer I just have my bra) and give me a strong spanks in my ass… Ok like you want!! Ahh ahh ahh!! I like this! Continue… al little more!!! More strong Simon, more strong!!! He is so excited I can see in him eyes, there is a fire!! So I take off him pants to see him dick! Is very hard, I take it with my hand, and I start to touch him, very slow with my eyes in him eyes… hi is more and more hard! And I put my tongue on the top of him dick, umm nice taste! I want to fuck your mouth he says!! I’m your boss are you crazy? I am speaking very loud! But after I take him dick with my mouth, inside my mouth!

I will not stop until to cum in me, I’m saying very loud… and I have an idea, I lie on the table so him can fuck me very hard…. I throw everything in the table, but I don’t mind I need to feel him strong dick inside me!!! Simon is fucking my pussy very hard, and kissing my boobs at the same time, he is hard and sweet at the same time…. I like him parfum, is so virile!! I like to have him very deep in me, so I turn and I put my ass in front of him… he is touching my ass with him hands, and he wants to fuck my ass, I can see in him looks… I take him fingers to put in my pussy and I say I want that you fuck my ass… Ok I will fuck you beautiful ass boss….

I've been doing these for a while now and I'd love some feedback. What do you enjoy the most about these articles? Do you think it's worth me putting the extra effort in and having a short write up or is simply detailing the genre enough? Is there anything you think I should add?

Also, I've included a few releases on here by users of this sub and intend to continue. If you release a mixtape or album (doesn't have to be hip-hop, I'm open to all music) that you would like me to cover then PM a link to stream or preferably download, and if I like it I'll include it."
53dq6z,4,2016-09-18,"My mentor/""big brother"" has turned on me and I'm upset and confused",mylittleweirdo,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/53dq6z/my_mentorbig_brother_has_turned_on_me_and_im/,"Hey Mom, I wish I could talk to you about this irl, but I've always had to be the strong one in our relationship. You always turn things around with things like ""You being sad is making me sad!"" and somehow I end up comforting you and my problems get cast aside. I can't handle that right now, I need you to be the strong one and help me.

I started working at a company as an intern in my last year of film school, and I hit it off right away with one of the partners (the company is co-owned by three guys). When I graduated from college he hired me as his personal assistant (to run errands for him and his other businesses), with the promise that I would get work as a sound editor as well. We shared an office and we became good friends. He stayed true to his word, and slowly transitioned me to working fully as a sound editor, helping me every step of the way until I had the skills and confidence to handle it on my own, at which point I was moved out of his office into the group room with the other editors (and I no longer had to do assistant stuff, either).
But even more than just work stuff, he was there for me for anything. My pet rabbit got sick, so he drove me to the vet. I had nowhere to go for New Years, so he invited me to spend it at his house with his family and their friends. I had a panic attack at a work party, in front of everyone, and he immediately pulled me into a big hug and held me and told me jokes until I'd calmed down, no judgement or fuss. And there's so much more. He's always been there for me, like the big brother I always wished for. I am acutely aware that he's not perfect (you don't share a small office with someone without discovering at least some of their secrets), but he always treated me with respect and kindness.
I've been at the company for over 4 years now. They recently helped me get into a union and transition to working as a freelancer (but I still get to stay at the company, even if I'm not technically staff any longer). Everything was working well, but then one client was being particularly difficult about the sound design for their movie. I was doing everything I could, but I'm only one person and I was working incredibly long hours and still couldn't keep up with their insane demands. My boss arranged to have a conference call between our sound team and the client (who is in another city), with him sitting in to moderate. But when we got in there he took over the conversation, and completely threw me under the bus, blamed everything on me and wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise to explain myself. He completely humiliated me in front of not only a client, but my coworkers as well. I was blindsided and so hurt, and when I tried to talk to him afterwards he was flippant and condescending and wouldn't have a conversation. So I sent him an email saying very clearly and tactfully that I was upset by what he had done. He never replied, and has stopped talking to me altogether (with one exception, a slightly nasty email a few days later telling me I was being pulled off the project because he and the producers felt I was ""being too difficult""). 

I just don't get it Mom. How did it get to this point? I can't rationalize this person who's treating me like garbage, with the man who took me to see Wrath of Khan with him and his two best friends, and had me over for dinner with his family on several occasions (his daughter even invited me to her birthday party once), and always knew exactly how to cheer me up when I was depressed. I'm tough, and I know I can get by without my ""big brother"", but I miss him horribly. I don't know what to do. I feel like if I'd just left it alone and not sent the email sticking up for myself, maybe things would have blown over. But because I called him out on what he did my relationship with him is not only ruined, but irreparable. Where did I go wrong? What do I do?"
53duuv,9,2016-09-18,Breaking up with him over the phone or text is the best option but i feel like shit about it.,NYU4U,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/53duuv/breaking_up_with_him_over_the_phone_or_text_is/,"Just a bit of backstory: I've been dating the same guy for just under three months now. We lived about a 5 minute drive away from each other when we first met and saw each other multiple times a week. We'd go out and do fun things like amusement parks, grab coffee, hang out, etc. Then we fell in to a routine of just going over to his place, watching netflix, and having sex. Then, one time when we actually went out and were on a date together, he had a seizure for the first time. Because of that, his license was taken away for 6 months as a precaution and he could no longer drive. Which is fine, because I drive. But then it just perpetuated me just driving over to see him, doing nothing and just sitting at home. I didn't really mind, but it started to get a bit boring. 

Then, I moved downtown for school, which is about an hour and a half commute for him to visit me using public transit because he doesn't drive. I wasn't able to come up town to visit as much as I would like because I was starting an internship, as well as being in school full time and working, but he would offer to come see me, since his schedule was more free. He would often ask if he could sleep over because the commute took a while, and I felt bad about not visiting, so I would say yes even if it's not what I wanted. I live somewhere really exciting and still all he would want to do was sit in my apartment. I started kind of making excuses for why he couldn't come because I was tired of doing nothing but having sex. My sex drive was going down because it was just so routine and expected. 

Last week, he came to visit me between classes, and I was planning on walking with him to a park near my apartment that I really liked. As we were walking to the park, which I was clearly excited about, he told me he didn't want to over-work himself for fear of having another seizure, and asked if we could go back to my apartment. They were doing some electrical work in my apartment, so we couldn't, and he seemed kind of disappointed. I ended up just sitting with him on campus and we talked for a few hours. When he left, I just felt disappointed because it seemed like all he wanted to do was come over to my apartment and have sex. 

Yesterday, I just broke. He asked if he could come sleep over at my apartment tomorrow and I just basically told him I was tired of feeling like he didn't want to do anything but come over and have sex, that I'm bored, etc. He basically guilt tripped me by saying he's ""happy to see me regardless of what we do"" and that he can make more of an effort. I was kind of confused because I feel like it was less about how I feel and more about how I was being needy when he's cool doing nothing with me.

Today, I texted him asking how work was going, and he told me he went home because the stress of our conversation last night made him nauseous. Once again, I felt like he was trying to guilt-trip me for just explaining how I feel. He was trying to say all the right things, how he doesn't want me to feel like it's all about sex because he doesn't feel that way (even though that's how he's been acting), and he really wants to work through it. 

Honestly, at this point, I'm just turned off and no longer attracted to him because I don't feel listened to. I feel like trying to fix it isn't something I want to soon in to a relationship when I'm busy with life and can't see him more than once a week because of school anyway.

The only thing is, while I'd prefer to break up with him in person, I feel like a grade A douche having him come all the way downtown, an hour and a half commute, only to have me break up with him and have him turn around. I can't figure out which is worse, breaking up with him over the phone instead of face to face, or largely wasting his time. "

Raided all throughout WotLK, notable accomplishments were 11/12 10 man heroic ICC, 6/12 25 man Heroic ICC, Ruby Sanctum down as well. Skipped first half of Cataclysm and came back during Dragon Soul, was able to down 4/6 Heroic DS. Did not play during MoP.

**11) Explain your stat priorities, ability rotation, raid utilities, and any personal cooldowns your class has (Show us what you know):** Haste &gt; Crit &gt; Mastery &gt; Intellect &gt; Versatility


**---Ect---**

Tell us about your personality and why you think you'll be a good fit for the guild?** I'm a complete WoW addict. I've been playing this game for 10+ years now. If i'm not raiding, I'm Min/Maxing my stats or PVPing. I'm online pretty much at least 4-5 hours ever day and would love to get some rated BGs going.

Hi, I'm H_bomba, Creator of CLASS4. 

  

Class4 is an ongoing project i'm working on, destined to be a sci fi/horror motion comic.
Class4 is set in the Somewhat distant future, of 2039. 

---

You see, This is set in the real world. Or, at least, before the timeline diverged at some point after now.


 In this world, There is an invention known as SABER, The Self-activated-Bomb-Eradication-redundancy.


Which, in essence, when installed on a nation's borders, will cause any ICBMS That cross the border to immediately shut down, and crash without detonating. 


This is installed over all major powers that can afford the massive million dollars per fifty square miles price tag. 


Anyways, this effectively nullifies the idea of a global nuclear war, as no nation can launch a missile to destroy the other, and any bombers can be intercepted with jets. 


This spurs the development of a new kind of deterrence; Biological ordinance. 


There was a Research firm, Entitled Kaelon Biotechnics. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

They Used the cumulative knowledge of hundreds of geniuses to produce novel technologies, and were particularly good with biological engineering.


 They patented the first ever total gene therapy serum. Able to completely change your appearance over the course of a few weeks.


 You could change your natural hair or eye color, make yourself taller, Give yourself a genetic resistance to disease, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

 Well, Unbeknownst to the general public, they were also a massive weapons firm.

&amp;nbsp;

 Pumping out advanced weapons such as Rail-guns, Laser Anti aircraft weaponry, and other systems. 


They were approached by the united states government, and tasked with 3 things. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, a biological method to turn a countries populous against each-other, to wreck infrastructure and create instability. 

&amp;nbsp;

Secondly, To produce a way to bring near death, or recently dead soldiers back to healthiness.

&amp;nbsp;

And Finally, To produce a Super soldier, that regular humans can become without needing to be born that way.  
And So they did. 


First, Using a combination of various viruses' DNA, such as, but not limited to:


 Ebola,


 Rabies,


 Human Hyperlibido syndrome,


and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. 

&amp;nbsp;

The result, Was Tereus. Named after the son of Ares From ancient Greece Mythology.

&amp;nbsp;

The Results were quite... Horrifying. 

&amp;nbsp;

When infected, often through injection or a aerosol Gas Bomb, Subjects began having violent seizures; along with muscle spasms, Blood pressure Ramping up Highly, the veins in their eyes and septum Burst.

&amp;nbsp;

 The eyes Turn a vibrant  scarlet Red, and subjects will begin to foam at the mouth, showing extreme signs of aggression. The virus can only be spread by bodily fluids, and bites will not work.


 The method picked, was one to be so incredibly horrible, that people would think twice before attacking.


 The infected persons will attack and attempt to rape any non infected mammal they see. 

&amp;nbsp;

A demonstration was Shown, So in an underground chamber, sat an underground test facility, with one male death-


Row inmate as the Dependent variable, and several other of varying sexes and appearances as the independent variable. 

&amp;nbsp;

The moment the auto injector on his wrist activated, he dropped to the ground and began thrashing about... 


Roughly thirty seconds later, The inmate who will be now referred to as 01, climbed to his feet.  

&amp;nbsp;

He then Charged the nearest inmate, grabbed her by her throat, and tackled her to the ground.


Slamming it's fists into her head, until she stopped resisting, tearing her clothes off, and engaging in copulation to the horror of the other inmates.

&amp;nbsp;

They tried to run, but the armed guards trained rifles on them, barring their escape.

&amp;nbsp;

 After 01 had apparently had it's fill, for a brief moment it had a look of calm on it's face...

&amp;nbsp;

 Before Locking it's eyes on another inmate...


 The female who will now be called 02, Then began to spasm in the same manner 01 did, before standing and joining 01 in attacking the others.

&amp;nbsp;

 At the end of the test, they were shot,it took an average of 8.7 bullets to bring a single one down in a timely manner.

&amp;nbsp;

 They did not seem to experience pain, Seeing as they did not wince when shot, even slightly. 


 Another observation yielded they were unusually docile when they were not aware of any non infected nearby. Often just standing around, sitting down; or sleeping on the floor. 

---

This turned to be a great success, with the Company getting a $3 billion dollar grant to continue operations.

&amp;nbsp;

 A new research center was built, Beneath downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Then, they made the next. Using a concoction of various viruses, bacteria and fungi, they produced a virus that when inserted into a corpse, would return to life, although, rather incomplete.


 They were completely unresponsive to their names being called, and when approached, showed signs of aggression. The decay seemed to continue regardless of state.


  They would eat various things that would be inserted into the test chamber, from ordinary food, to raw, and even rotting meat. They did seem to have a preference for fresh meat.  

&amp;nbsp;

The true nature was only discovered when an intern dropped a test tube containing the virus, and it shattered. 


Triggering a lock down, the virus was inhaled by roughly 8 people.  There was another 6 people in another room when it happened. 

By the time the guard staff had donned gas masks, they entered the sealed sector to find the infected people apparently having died, and reanimated, and killing and cannibalizing the uninfected staff.

 It was determined that due to the nature of the virus, subjects would reanimate  over and over until their nervous system was destroyed. 


Bearing a striking resemblance to the pop culture monster known as ""Zombies"".


 The cannibalized subjects later reanimate in the morgue and were promptly incinerated. 


More testing and manipulation needed. 

&amp;nbsp;

The final project yielded beings known as chimeras.


 People with a genome, roughly 8 times longer than most people's.


 Incorporating All the genes of every human on earth, and that of various creatures such as;


 Tyrannosaurus Rex (DNA Reconstructed by a remarkably preserved bit of bone marrow)


Eagle, Gorilla, and many others.

&amp;nbsp;

They have the ability to ""Shift"" as in transform into a larger, stronger, and more defensive version of themselves.


Complete with a long, reptilian tail, Large, Bladed Spikes growing from their vertebrae, the rears of some joints, and finger and toe tips.

&amp;nbsp;

  They often grow roughly 60% taller, and have a weight increase of roughly 943%.


 This is accomplished using Incredibly efficient fat, that is mineral and vitamin-soluble.


 When they shift, They instantly turn this fat into energy and raw materiel, and though a very complicated chemical process, turn that energy into matter, and then into usable mass for their growth, It is also reversible. 


But this isn't some ugly Frankenstein with limbs of various creatures.


 They were custom made to look visually appealing always, though when they shift, it is substantially less.


 They are made to turn every person into a living, breathing tank. 

&amp;nbsp;

Their abilities include incredible strength, higher stamina, and the mental capacity to process their actions at roughly 8x the speed of a normal human.


 Being able to literally dodge tank shells fired at them, if they're willing.

&amp;nbsp;

 Otherwise, their bones no longer incorporate calcium. 


Instead, it has been tweaked to use titanium in place of calcium, making the bones strong enough to support this weight. 


They also have an ability to regenerate at a massive rate, capable of regrowing a destroyed arm in little more than a day. 

&amp;nbsp;

They can tolerate overheating to a massive degree, at times even getting so hot their blood will glow red hot, and their sweat will boil off the surface of their skin.

&amp;nbsp;

Their hide is thick and can resist most small arms, the smallest round capable of even piercing it is .50 BMG AP.

&amp;nbsp;

The muscle also has this effect, so really, the only way would be to hit one with a Railgun square in the heart, to destroy the blood's ability to flow and carry minerals to regenerate.

&amp;nbsp;

 Due to the law of conservation of mass and energy, when they regenerate, they will become slimmer, and must eat meat to regain the weight.

&amp;nbsp;

 They are able to digest incredibly quickly and efficiently, though.


 It is spread in such a way that it cannot be stolen, due to it requiring cooperation, and a special method.


 It is spread through sexual interaction, to be specific, sperm cells. Once inside the body, a bite must be placed on the subject without killing them, which will inject a serum to activate them.


In which case they'll immediately dig into the bloodstream and break apart into millions of Gene-spreading molecules, somewhat resembling viruses.

Anyways, after a LOT of plot related events i don't have time to explain, basically, A very bad thing happens in that research facility, and all of these horrors are unleashed into the world From there, Right in the heart of Cincinnati.

Another opportunity exists. I have a phone number of a higher up in a company that also hires in my field. He's a family friend, and has said that I can call him any time. I'm thinking of calling to ask him for a job, and what kind of technologies his company uses so that I demonstrate proficiency in them in the event of an interview.

The issue is, I don't really know how to make this kind of call. Is this normal? ""Hey man, I know you said I could call anytime, but now that I need something...""

53ezbc,25,2016-09-18,Tweaks/Changes to the 4-3-3/4-1-4-1,dwabn,chelseafc,https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/53ezbc/tweakschanges_to_the_4334141/,"Based on our recent performances I don't see Conte drastically changing Chelsea's system of play. However, I think we can all agree there is definitely room for improvement. I would like to use this thread to open a discussion on what tweaks or changes people would like to see to the current 4-3-3/4-1-4-1 formation to improve play.



I for one feel that one of the biggest problems with the current line-up is the positioning of the fullbacks on each flank. I believe their positioning and attributes are causing problems with both the positioning and selection of our midfield three and the linkage between our attacking trident. I think these problems were best illustrated in the Liverpool game and can be clearly seen in Chelsea's passing map from the match:

https://twitter.com/11tegen11/status/776891794487447552

By overloading Ivanovic's flank and pressing high up the pitch, Liverpool caused our midfield triangle to invert wherein Oscar had to drop extremely deep to try and get on the ball and to protect Ivanovic from overloads. This left Matic as the highest midfielder and greatly disrupted Chelsea'sbuild up play. Moreover, we were unable to build up play on the left hand side of the pitch because Azpilicueta is right-footed and routinely positioned deep and in line with Hazard. This left Matic to become the shuttler and push up in attempt to link up play with Hazard and our attacking trident. While this ended up working for our goal it was generally ineffective, and the attacking trio remained quite disconnected and spread-out throughout most of the match.



Now, how to fix this? I believe Chelsea are at their best when Hazard is allowed to drift infield and link-up with Costa. This is best illustrated in our passing maps from the Burnley and West Ham matches below:

https://twitter.com/11tegen11/status/769565520697892864


https://twitter.com/11tegen11/status/765509367248584704


As you can see from these diagrams Hazard, Costa, Willian are all located more closely together and have several linkages reflecting their interplay. Moreover, in midfield you can see our RCM is further up the pitch (ahead of Matic and Kante), and is successfully linking play.



By moving Azpilicueta to the right and playing a more aggressive LB like Alonso, I believe we will be able to address our problems on both flanks. 



On the left, Matic is naturally positioned to sit deeper and cover for our LB. This intern allows our LB to push up the pitch and provide width, giving Hazard the option to use the LB for overlaps or drift infield to get closer to Costa.



Having Azpilicueta on the right would allow our RCM to move further up the pitch and better link play with our attacking band. This would lesson the RCM's defensive responsibilities as they would no longer be as responsible for covering for Ivanovic or dropping into the RB position when he pushes up the pitch (like Matic would be doing on the left). This would also allow Fabregas to see more playing time as there would now be fewer defensive responsibilities on the position, but would free up whoever ends up playing the position nonetheless.



What are your thoughts on what other changes/tweaks you think Chelsea should try?"

I'm planning on graduating in December with a Bachelor's Accounting degree from a small-ish college in the Texas A&amp;M system. Right now my GPA is something like 2.8 and with a little luck I can hopefully get it up to a 3.0 after this semester, as I'm retaking some courses I did poorly in.

During my college years I faced a lot of health challenges that made it difficult to be competitive in school - some semesters it was just a matter of scraping by and doing the best I could with the hand I was dealt.

My only work experience so far is outside of the accounting industry, and I haven't had the opportunity to work an internship before graduation.

I know I'm not in a great place right now, and naturally I don't expect work at a Big Four Firm or anything like that. 

My question is, can anyone give me some advice on what to expect in terms of employment opportunities? I'm concerned that my low GPA will make it difficult to find work or be taken seriously for interviews or internships. Do you have any advice on how I should frame myself in interviews, or explain my (relatively) poor academic performance? I really just don't know what to expect and I have a lot of anxiety about how I'll be able to begin my career.

If it matters, I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area but I would relocate just about anywhere if it meant a steady job and a foot in the door of the industry.

Thanks in advance. "

Being in my 3rd office-setting job, I'm realizing that I'm never going to be happy in one.  My favorite job of all been ones where I was either outside, got to walk around a lot, or both. 

My first job was at a drive-in movie theater. Most of the work was outside. I would spend the first hour or so showing cars where to park, and then I would walk around the fields to count how many cars we had or make sure people weren't doing things they shouldn't have been doing.  And to top it off, the hours were evening/night and the theater was in the middle of a heavily forested area, which are my favorite times of day and nature scenary.

My second job was working for my township's road department.  Most of the work with park maintenance (cutting grass, picking up litter, trimming hedges/trees), but I would also go out with the full-time guys into town to take care of other things. So no matter what I was doing I was always outside and being visually productive, it was also a big bonus for me.  I was taking care of the town I grew up in and loved. 

Finally, my job during college was working for the IT Department. I work in the IT building at the help desk, but I would also often have to walk to various buildings around campus to pick up computers, drop off printer paper, or take care of issues that were more easily fixed in person.  Our campus was pretty small and it was beautiful, so I loved walking around it.

Since then I've had an office internship and two full-time office jobs.  Obviously they pay better, but I'd much prefer being able to be outside walking around to inside sitting at a desk for 8 hours.  Honestly, if I could have my road department job back and make the same amount of money I do in IT, I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

Does anyone else feel this way?"

53fut3,2,2016-09-18,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53fut3/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out.

We were friends for 12 years. No matter what you did or where you went, when you came back home we would hang out at our spot, and talk for hours. We had a good thing going.

Then my wife's vehicle was vandalized. Key marks everywhere, and the insurance money couldn't cover it all. You happen to mention that you could do body work, and you could fix it up nice for us. Great! That's awesome. 

My mistake was not making a contract before you started working on my wife's van. I should have known better. You ended up demanding an amount of money that was absolutely ridiculous because you were afraid we weren't going to pay you. What? Have we met? In what universe would I ever do such a thing?

But whatever, we made an agreement.

A few days later my wife happens to mention that you're upset with me. Now I'm pretty damn busy. I have three step kids, three jobs, and an internship at a high school. Sometimes keeping up with people can be hard. So I text you to see what's up, and this is what you say: ""color me confused. You haven't spoken to me or even really given me eye contact in nearly a week."" 

What? Aside from the fact that that's not even true, you have made zero attempt at doing that either. You couldn't be bothered to come in to say bye because you just had to go to laundry. The one time you asked if I was okay was ""hey, what's wrong with you?"" Yeah, that's really inviting to have a discussion.

But after I try to talk it out, you say that this is ridiculous, and that after this job we will not speak. Excuse me? Are you. Really going to end our 12 year friendship over text message? Nope.

The next day, I reach out. You say you need to think about things, and we can talk after the van is done. Fine.

Then I see the van. Holy shit, a monkey could have done a better job. We trusted you, because you said you could do body work. You clearly just wanted some easy money. After a few days I reach out again. I tell you that I'm done being angry over this, I express my feelings in a clear and calm manner, and tell you that if you want to meet up and talk about this, we can do that.

"" Hahahahahahahaha, okay, yeah, bye.""

And just like that, it's over.

And I've never been happier.

You were my first love. I've been in love with you for over a decade, knowing you didn't return the feelings. And I respected that. I didn't bring it up, didn't make anything weird, but it was always in the back of my mind. Sometimes I would cry just from the pain.

But now, it's like a bad spell has been lifted. I'm no longer broken up over what never would have been. Sure, our van looks like shit, and we might not make rent this month because of you. But that's okay, I always figure something out.

I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors."

1) As a newlywed couple, you and I decide to take our first honeymoon aboard a lavish and large cruise ship. This boat has all the amenities anyone can imagine; massive pools, relaxing spas, and even a tennis court. However, there's something awfully peculiar about this cruise ship...

2) Uh oh, a dirt biking accident gone wrong. You've broken your right arm, and you're now in the hospital being waited on by a beautiful staff of nurses and doctors. That's when you notice this hospital doesn't seem... normal.

3) You are the high chief of a small, pagan tribe within Scandinavia. You hate that bogwash of religion and mysticism until you meet an occultress who wields sorcery beyond the scope of imagination.

4) The Brew Pot, your favorite place to get your morning coffe. It's a bustling cafe mixed with cute barista's, a lovely smell, and the best tasting coffee you've ever had. Things do get weird, however, when they change the recipe to their dark roast blend...

5) You are a young casanova living at the height of your life in downtown Manhattan. Young, hung, and beautiful; you really have it all going for you. Your only weakness? Women who are extremely beautiful but batshit crazy. Your most recent girl is a firm believer in astrology and pagan rituals and brings you to a... strange part of Manhattan.

6) One of us is a lowly intern at one of the biggest corporations in America; Bi-dustrial incorporated. They make anything and everything, and pretty soon, one of us finds out some of their most secret and lucrative projects. 

7) Being a king or queen in the modern era isn't exactly what it used to be. From running entire empires and civilizations to being classy socialites and having bounds of twitter followers, it's hard to admit that time has indeed changed for our monarchs. Boundless wealth and nothing but time is enough to cause anybody to get a little crazy.

8) It's difficult, becoming a mother. Gaining unwanted weight, my breasts getting uncomfortably engorged with milk, sometimes I'd just prefer it if I never had to do it at all. The changes can be drastic, and can really make me feel a little depressed. It helps, however, to have a caring and loving spouse.

9) Genetically modifying fruit is a very controversial practice these days. We're putting these fruit in our bodies, that can be dangerous! It can be especially dangerous if a young, inexperienced scientist get's their hands on boundless information on how to accomplish some of the crazier changed fruits.

10) It's kind of like the plague, except no one dies? It's weird, doctors are afraid of the effects it will have on society, but it doesn't actually hurt anybody. If anything, it makes everyone feel pretty good. Even if society falls, at least the plague will make people happier. Maybe it's not all bad if society takes a tumble.

If you have any prefernce or ideas that you'd like to throw in, feel free! Please remember, I'll be going to work soon, so this roleplay wont be immediate.  [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/iI8tV6V.png)"

53j5ps,1,2016-09-19,My [30F] boyfriends [30M] masturbration habits are getting a little out of hand.,wankwankqq,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53j5ps/my_30f_boyfriends_30m_masturbration_habits_are/,"My boyfriend ""Craig"" and I have been together for a little over 4 years now, and we have been living together for just over a year now. Our relationship is great! We have a lot of things in common; that being said, we do our thing and have our own interests. Moving in together went really smooth, almost *too* smooth. Our habits seemed to be right on point, considering both of us are on the ""upper"" end of being clean and having our routines (compared to most people I would say).

---

That being said, over the last number of months (I would say as far back as January), I have noticed that Craig hasn't been that desecrate when it comes to masturbating at our place. For instance, one day I came home from doing errands, and he was just laying on the couch getting himself off. I wasn't expecting that, but whatever. My biggest issue though is when he masturbates in our bed! Specifically, he never really cleans up after himself when he is done. 

Normally whenever we have sex, or we are on a bit of a tear, I try to keep up on cleaning our sheets as much as possible. I am sure most of you couples living together know where I am coming from here. But, I can always tell when he has masturbated in our bed. For instance, I spent Friday doing laundry and cleaning our sheets, while he went over to friends place to drink and hang out. Here I am, a 30 year old women cleaning my bed sheets because my boyfriend decides to spray over our sheets like he is 16 or something.

Sunday night (last night, Sept 18th) I had a talk with Craig over this. I have been really, really quiet about this since I started noticing this back in January. I didn't want to rock the boat in our relationship over a very small issue. I told Craig that I would like him to be more aware of himself while he masturbates - specifically in our bed. Craig told me that he always was self conscious of himself while he masturbated and he didn't think that he was making a mess. But, I then had to allude to him how much I was cleaning the sheets of our bed, and/or buying/putting on new sheets very periodically.  

I felt like after our small talk that Craig will probably forget about this soon enough. How can I approach him in more of a ""direct"" manner, opposed to trying to not rock the boat, but intern, being less effective? Have any of you couples living together have had to deal with this before? How did you go about it?

  ---   
  **TL;DR: My boyfriends masturbation habits, that I started noticing around January, have been bothering me a lot. I am trying to figure out a way to speak with him directly, without rocking the boat and making this a bigger issue then it has to be.**"

If you have any comments or suggestions on that story, now's the time to send 'em my way before I'm fully underway.

Anyway, wanted to throw that to you all so you know I'm **still actively working on my writing and career there.** I haven't forgotten about you all, and I hope you haven't forgotten about me.

Updates with Lazarus should come in the next few weeks. I'm hoping to finish it within the year and releasing it as a full story in one fell swoop.

53jf49,4,2016-09-19,Octo - Kig-Yar Doctor (Format Fixed),DreamingKroot,HaloRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloRP/comments/53jf49/octo_kigyar_doctor_format_fixed/,"Scales and Feathers.

  Albeit they are hardly the center-stars of the universe, it's hard not to feel this odd, twitchy Kig-Yar just didn't just hit the ugly tree on its way out of the nest, but careened through it and decided it'd make a good home.  With big yellow-amber eyes that gleam when viewed at certain angles, and scales that are a bit on the red side, with flecks of ochre running the underside of his eyes, mouth, and against the slits where his hearing organs lay.  He's given to a long, beak like snout, with many mangled teeth resting in his mouth, while the scale looks pinched, like he's too stressed out to relax his facial muscles.  Occasionally, a twitch makes one eye spasm.  He has indigo-black quill-feathers that run from between his eyes and up over the top of his scalp, and sweep backwards.  A few patches of quill-feathers are permanently missing - indicating he lost the growth there in the past.

  He has a bit of a bird like neck,wattled slightly and prominent to a nervous swallow that runs him a near constant dry throat.  His neck flusehes with the thin shoulders, while his build appears to sag slightly from his bones.  Lacking any particular strength, the weedy lizard-bird has loosely feathered forearms that run to three fingered hands, tapped as they are with sharp pointed claws.  His chest is slim, and belly has an odd paunchiness to it, showing the odd dishealth that he keeps.  The mottling darkens over his chest and along his lower belly, while a slender trail of feathers runs from mid abdomen and low, short quills that are fine in manipulation, but itchy as all-get-out when disturbed.

  Slender hips give him an almost delicate manner of walking, which might oddly offset the otherwise twitchy movements he normally leads with.  A short tail rests above his slim haunches, stubby and touched with small feathers that match the ones that run down from the back of his neck, though they do little to hide him.  His legs are bent in the unfamiliar digitigrade stance, marking him to walk like a bird with backward-bending knees.  He has three toes on each foot, claws worn down from being always on his feet.

  A headset rests upon his brow, covering a black band that looks strapped to him, and clowers both a microphone to rest along his jawline and a visor to cover his left eye, providing pertinent information as needed.  He has a black carapace covering his torso and hips, made of hyper-light armor that designate him as a drop-paramedic, as well as a ships doctor, or at least so the heraldry of the shoulders say.  He has a beaded necklace around his neck adorning him well, though it's hardly ostentatious.  He's otherwise not wearing much beyond his utility belt.

Quirks:

Medical Prodigy - He's skilled at medicine to a degree that almost makes up for his flaws!

Lucky - He's got something about him, perhaps chance, perhaps fate, that keeps him alive.  
  
Flaws: 

Ugly - He hit the ugly tree, and decided to build a nest out of it.

Coward - He suffers from combat paralysis, and refuses to fight back.

Gremlins - Tech goes wonky around him.  A lot.  Weirdly.

Stigma - People tend to feel unlucky around him.  This crimps his social abilities.

Bio:

  Born on an unassuming ship in high orbit around a little historically unimportant world known as Harvest, in the late edge of 2525, Octo is unlucky.  Or he's very lucky, but everyone else around him is made unlucky by his sucking the luck out of them.  Or maybe it's just the bad circumstances around his birth.  It was a difficult birth with half the eggs were stillborn, the ship undergoing a quote: ""Really bad slip-space event"", and the contact with what would end up being the hammer to smash the Covenant against the anvil of reality, bad things happened around poor Octo that simply aren't his fault (so he claims) but can be devastating (so others admit) if not handled carefully.

  But such are the ways of fate that, despite being unlucky, he was still a native-son on-board the Kig-Yar ship ""Fortunes of War"", and such was put to use working, when he was old enough.  From scrubbing walls to burning out bilges, to just sitting in a room to avoid actually touching anything with the gremlins that seemed to follow him about.  After the third contaminant failure, and while he was recovering from being covered in bilge-goop, the poor Octo was taken up by the doctor on duty to run errands as intern.

  Maybe because gremlins are prone to not messing with living bodies than they are mechanical, he had very little trouble when it came to doctoring.  And, after a particularly nasty encounter with a rival ship that remains off the record, he was instrumental in not screwing up the med-bay when half the doctoring staff was injured.  This lead to him getting promoted to medic - and his career was born.

  Having served ship to ship for over thirty years, and has survived - always by keeping his head down, never returning fire, and just staying under his desk when the shooting starts.  He might have a reputation as a coward, craven, and someone weak, but he's alive - and has a chance to make sure others live through encounters with the many horrors of war."

53jmf6,2,2016-09-19,My dad is a high-ranking employee at a big tech company - I'm interviewing for a software engineering internship there. Should I avoid bringing it up?,dootdoot13131,interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/53jmf6/my_dad_is_a_highranking_employee_at_a_big_tech/,"I'm a college undergrad and this week I have a final-round interview with one of the tech giants that's popular with CS students (Msft,Apple,etc) for a software engineering internship of the summer. 

I believe I'm well qualified and I think I should be able to do well at the interview. I have a lot of experience for my age, solid knowledge of programming, practiced &amp; prepared a lot, etc.

There's one thing I haven't been too sure about, though and I feel that it's a super naive question but I'm only a young college guy so what do I know haha. My dad is among the highest ranking employees at that company. His direct boss that he reports to on a day-to-day basis is one of the people who show up when you Google that company's executives, and he personally knows all the execs.

For me, this is one of the reasons that I really want this internship. And I feel like, in general, if an interviewer asks ""So why are you particularly interested in working here as opposed to somewhere else?"", this would definitely be a reasonably good answer: ""My dad works here so I've been able to see what the company culture is like, and I think it's a great company and it'd be awesome to be able to work for it."" (and that's really how I feel about it). But I also feel that answer naturally leads to the question ""Oh really, that's cool! What does he do here?"". At that point, I'm afraid saying his actual job/position could be almost arrogant, because in terms of job level it'd be like saying ""oh yeah my dad is your boss's boss's boss's boss."" I don't know if that's how it'd be actually interpreted, but to me it's certainly a possibility that I want to avoid since that's definitely not what I mean to convey. But if I just answer super vaguely like ""oh yeah he works in ___ department"" then it'll seem like I'm not actually that interested in the company, I'm only saying it.

Am I proud of my dad? Heck yeah. He started his career as a dishwasher and worked his way up over the years. But I certainly have no delusion that him being a big boss at the company has any influence on my own chances at an internship, and I don't want to come across that way.

Should I just avoid bringing up the subject entirely? Will the interviewer probably not care and I'm just being paranoid? Essentially one of the reasons that I really want to get this internship is because I know the company well, but bringing up the reason why I know the company well feels a little awkward for me because it almost feels like nepotism or something.

**tl;dr I'm struggling to think of a way to mention that my dad works at the company which is one major reason I'm really excited for the opportunity, but at the same time not coming across as saying being super arrogant like ""ha my dad is one of the top people at this company, you better give me this job""**"
53jyz5,2,2016-09-19,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53jyz5/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
53k5z9,33,2016-09-19,Destination: Auburn,levilarrington,SeattleWA,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/53k5z9/destination_auburn/,"Destination: Auburn


Slayer made an album called South of Heaven. Washington incorporated a city called South of Kent.

But most of you know it as Auburn. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzae_SqbmDE

Auburn can be reached by highway 18, which once boasted the title of most dangerous highway in the United States. That means those that lived made it to Auburn and developed a city. Like Mad Max.

And look no further than the burn pit at the Fireworks stand for the Thunderdome. Every year around The Fourth of July, people from all over the Puget Sound visit the Muckleshoot reservation to buy fireworks. I am told this is 70% of the Auburn economy. The other 30% comes from the trauma unit at the hospital. 

In most Washington cities, fireworks are illegal. Or, rather, the caliber of fireworks found at Muckleshoot are illegal. For 20 dollars, you can purchase the amount of gun powder used throughout the entire Civil War all wrapped up in a cardboard burrito and ready to blow your hand or hands off. 

From Whistling Petes to tennis balls full of gun powder, you are given a dirt lot to light off just about anything and just go nuts. Typically, ""just go nuts"" and tons of explosives are frowned upon in societies outside the Middle East. But in Auburn, it's encouraged. Fingers, limbs, and heads are blown off every year in order to elect a mayor last-man-standing style. 

But The Fourth of July is only once a year, so you'll need to go beyond Beyond Thunderdome for the equivalent outside of July: gambling. 

If you think losing your thumb and nose to a mortar rocket is painful, try losing your life savings to a slot machine based on a television show. Muckleshoot casino can offer you this. Price is Right, Wheel of Fortune, Star Wars - they all have slot machines aimed to make you think gambling is entertainment. And let me tell you something: if you win 300 dollars, then lose 400, then win 100, then lose 1000, then win 100 you are being entertained: through math.

Speaking of entertainment, Auburn is also home to Green River Community College: Home of the Whopper. You can get an AA, one menu item, and a soft drink for a student loan you'll have well into your AARP days. Keep telling yourself ""I'm transferring to the U next quarter"" as you take bong hits out of the potato gun you made last semester in Modern Art 101. Check out their Running Start program where you pay 500 dollars a quarter to intern at Taco Bell.

If you're like me, you like to kick back and watch a concert - what better venue than The White River Amphitheater. White River is becoming the go-to for top acts from music to comedy. You would think this would generate city sized crowds and you'd be right. You'd also think they'd have more than a one way dirt road in and out of the amphitheater - they don't. Let me tell you something: if you're going to see a concert at White River, you're essentially camping. Now you may choose to camp outside the theater in someone's yard or you can camp for seven hours in traffic on the road leading to Highway 18, either way you're camping.

But let's talk about lifestyles - what can Auburn offer you? Well, your cousin for starters. Do you want seconds? Auburn has a Waltons in Compton way of life that is rivaled by no other. Let's say you want to join a street gang, but you still love country music - Auburn has you covered. And boy do they: at any time in Auburn there's a 90% chance there is a gun drawn on you. This could be a gangbanger, survivalist, cop, hunter, teacher, doctor, priest, or an anti-gun protester driven to the final edge. 

In addition to wild west shootings, Auburn has an array of local fast food joints. These aren't just your everyday McDonalds or Burger Kings, these are independent burger joints that serve a great meal at a reasonable price. Just don't expect fancy city things like licenses or food handling permits.

Auburn is also the home of Washington National golf course, which is home to the UW men's and women's golf teams. So, you can see how that college thing comes full circle.

All in all, you couldn't find a better city to find yourself out of a job, divorced, and wiping with a flannel shirt in an Applebee's bathroom at 1 AM because they're out of toilet paper again.

53kc5h,3,2016-09-19,Need some happiness right now.,saaaaaadthrowaway,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/53kc5h/need_some_happiness_right_now/,"Hi everyone,

I've never posted on here before but read all the time and you've all really helped me out with some stuff I've been dealing with before. I've also answered a few advice-type questions before so now I'm hoping you all might return the favor. But it's not necessarily advice I need right now...just some happy thoughts and encouragement that life won't be like this forever. Anything that might make me feel better because life is pretty much shit right now. A few big issues have come crashing down all at once and it feels like too much.

1)First of all, my ex broke up with me a few months ago. I saw it coming, and it needed to happen but even so I've been blindsided by a pain I didn't even know was possible. The worst part is the up and down part of recovery, which is apparently pretty common after a breakup....I've thought I was legitimately feeling better a few times since the breakup, but today I woke up, started sobbing immediately, and have been doing that off and on all day. It's almost 6:30pm. I feel just as bad as I did when I woke up this morning. I think about her and the fact that I'm alone now and it starts again. I don't know how to make that feeling go away.

2)All this is made even worse by the fact that I recently moved back to my hometown (for financial reasons) since an internship I was doing ended. I feel like most of my friends don't live here anymore so I don't even have a wonderful support system.

3)I'm putting tons of time and effort into looking for a job. I am getting more and more sick every day of the constant grind of searching for and putting all of this effort into applying for jobs I likely won't get (statistically speaking...though I'm putting everything I've got into applying and trying my hardest to stay positive.) I've got a bachelor's degree, a post-grad program in my field, some relevant work experience, and now a directly related internship under my belt. I only took the internship thinking it could help me get a full time position and all it did was reconfirm what I already knew--that I am totally qualified to be a full-time employee in this field, since I already had experience doing everything my ""superiors"" were doing. Yet I still haven't had any luck at landing a full-time job.

I'm just at my wit's end with everything. Part of me knows I could maybe speed up the process of healing from my breakup if I could date, even casually. But I plan to move for whatever job I get because there are really no prospects in my field here so I wouldn't want to start dating anyone now. 

I've been looking for love and a job both now for a couple of years, and I've got nothing to show for it. I feel like I'm doing everything I possibly can and still coming up short. I feel completely and utterly stuck. I can't move on in love, but I've got to get a job before I can get out of here and live my life in any respect, including dating or finding love.

This turned into quite the rant, so thank you for reading. I couldn't really explain why I'm feeling SO terrible without explaining my whole life situation and what exactly is holding me down. I've been thinking lately I'm getting better at rolling with the punches, but today really shook me. I've never been suicidal, but days like this (which are few and far between and I may have never had one this bad) make me understand a little bit why someone might be. It's a really miserable thing to feel like you're wasting your time and you should just give up, and that the road ahead is so long and grueling that you don't even want to try.

What I'd really love is some encouragement, maybe on the love side of things, or even the job side. Have you been here before? What did you do to get out of the mood? What motivated you to keep trying when things got tough? Give me all your wisdom please...I really need it.

Thank you all so much in advance

I started at $60,000 salary. The company is about 35 people, with about 10 engineers.

I've thought about the points I could bring up to back up my case. See below:

-I was an intern before I started full time. I was able to jump into designing and working on projects. Someone without that experience would have had to go a couple of months with training to be able to do that level of work I started day one.

-I graduated #1 in my electrical engineering graduating class(the 30ish that graduated with me.) I have a couple of friends I graduated with in the same major who started at 65, 70, 75k salaries. (Should I bring this up?)

-I've never taken a sick day off, even when feeling terrible, to avoid missing deadlines.

-I work with a handful of other engineers. Year to date, I have engineered more $'s(regarding projects) than any other engineer. Now this doesn't mean I'm the best(I'm not), but it is a feat. I have only been there for a year and a half, and I'm working on projects that are as difficult as a few people who have been there for 3-5 years.

-I know a very close approximation on how much each job pulls in profit-wise. Just a example, I engineered a couple of panels, these wren't too difficult, but it took me about 12 hours of work time. This project grossed about $110k in profit. Now, its not often those kind of profits are made so easy, but I easily make the company tons of profit every week. Should I bring these thoughts into the boss' office?

Should I even bring up the theoretical situation, if I left the workplace, to hire another worker and get them to the skillset I am now would take a huge amount of time and effort?

I am just so unsure of the approach i should take. Please help me out here! Sorry about the long post!"

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

----------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout.

53n3v9,1,2016-09-20,"I hate this job, and I don't know why I don't quit",musingsofmadman,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/53n3v9/i_hate_this_job_and_i_dont_know_why_i_dont_quit/,"I hate the job I'm in. This time last year, I knew I was going to be moving to a new city in late spring/ early summer of 2016. I looked at what my current job and skillsets were in, and realized that it was not going to be easy to get into that area in the place we were moving too; not to mention I knew I was going to have to move again at least one more time for my wife's career and my career field (at the time) was not much suited towards portability/ following your spouse.  So I thought long and hard and found a career path that made use of my current skills and training and took steps to make the transition easier.

The move is getting closer and I find out there is an opening in the my general career field in the new city were moving too. Seems like it could be a good fit. So I apply, interview, and then get offered the position. This seems great! I've got a job lined up for when we move, its in my current field.....then it goes down hill.

I realize that in the new hire paperwork that I had never discussed pay during my interview or offer period. (I'm relatively young , I work in government where pay is usually set due to policy and up until this point someone in the interview would say early in the interview process what they could pay me based on policies). I call up and try and discuss pay, its capped at what they stated. Its low. Very low. Its low for the position, its low for even the area we were moving too, its very low considering I have a masters and at least 2 years of experience in the field. 28k. But the benefits are decent, fairly good pto policy, and it will be good experience whether I decide to stay in government or move into another field. Thats what I tell myself.

I get to the new job and at first everything seems to be going well. The projects I'm told I'll be working on sound interesting. My co-workers are nice. The regular office hours are pretty awesome (7:30-3:30). All is going well.

Then the reality sets in. The projects they told me I would be working on, well there's a few caveats to that. The main project they discussed during the interview and in the first few days of the job, that's not really a main focus. In fact, were just going to reference that project and not really do anything with it or give you any guidance.  The other project that was mentioned, that the real focus. Also, no one really knows what to do with that project, is going to offer you any guidance or direction or expectation, you're going to have to be a rea ""self starter"". Also, there are some other functions to this job that we didn't mention.  On your third day here, were going to make you the accreditation manager of this program that's really important to us. We haven't had an accreditation manager in about a year, no one in the organization really knows anything about this program, and there is an annual report due in three months. Also- it will be at least two months before you'll get any real information on this when we ship you off to the training for this program. Oh, you have this other random responsiblity associated with this position because the person you replaced took on this position on their own for some reason. Have fun! Also you'll occasionally get emails from people asking about things and you'll find out that you are also in charge of a few other things randomly. Have fun!

The final nail in the coffin. Travel. We mentioned nothing about travel or irregular schedule in the interview, job description, orientation (or whatever passes as orientation) or anything in the first few weeks. Now I figured I might have to travel once in a blue moon for training, or an odd meeting, that sort of thing. I did not know that when certain parts of my job are ""activate"" I might have to travel for several days at last minutes notice. Our over night stay policies and per diem policies suck btw.

I deal with random job responsibilities, the potential for a lot of travel (at last minute notice), and little to no direction projects, for 28k a year, and I have a masters in this field. The final cherry on top, the janitor in my office building makes more than me. He's also an employee of the state, he's been here six months longer than me, and he makes 31k a year + comparable benefits , but his pto package isn't as good as mine but still decent. 

I really wonder why I took this job. Hindsight is 20/20 I couldn't of known about half the stuff that turned out to be shit in this job. I'm still not sure I would of turned down this job had I known all that was involved. Being able to move somewhere with a job lined up (especially after some higher than expected moving expenses and small emergencies that popped up). Now that those emergencies have been setteled, and finances are stabeled, and funds replenished, and reserves have been established , I wonder why I'm still at this job. Other than resume fodder/ job history (i'm young in my career and I took time out of full time work to do internships + my masters for the past 3 years), and the extra income, I don't know. We could live off of my spouses income easily, and I have money set aside (60k). It just makes me wonder. 

I hate this job. I want to quit. Sometimes the only thing that gets me through the day when I think about all the crap associated with my job (lack of direction, cruddy boss, random responsibilities, random last minute travel, extremely low pay) is the knowledge that I have a rip chord- if I really want to I can quit and be fine financially."

I'm a junior in college studying criminal justice. At least, I am for the moment. Since I was a kid, working in LE has been a dream for me. I got my associate's in CJ at my previous college, and while there I was selected for a campus safety officer internship program as well. To this day that's the best job I've ever had. We worked with some of the best officers I've ever met there, and it was a hell of a learning experience and a great time.

But I may not be able to go as far with this career field as I'd like. Due to some un-correctable vision issues, I'm pretty much ineligible for any ""field"" position. My plan had been to get into the probation/parole field until a few months ago, when I found out that said vision problems also meant I can't get a driver's license. 

I tossed around the idea of working in dispatch/evidence/analyst positions for a while, but realized it's just not quite the same thing. One thing that I learned from that security job was that I absolutely loved getting out there, meeting people, dealing with problems head-on, not sitting behind a desk. Also, in speaking with some folks involved with our state investigative departments, the vast majority of analyst or technician positions require some sort of ""field"" experience, which I can't get. 

I have a meeting with a career guidance counselor in two days to determine if I'm going to stay in the CJ program or try and transfer my credits to something else. I'd love nothing more than to stay in this field but it's pretty clear that things wouldn't work out well if I did.

I'm not looking for pity here, just felt that the post deserved a little explanation. You folks do a job that doesn't get enough respect these days. Even though I might not be able to do the same job I felt that a sincere thanks for what you do is needed. 

Stay safe out there. "
53nf1u,10,2016-09-20,Slightly unrelated- does Uni prestige matter in the Big 4,Thranrond,AusFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/53nf1u/slightly_unrelated_does_uni_prestige_matter_in/,"Sorry if this is in the wrong sub! I didn't know where else to ask.

I'm in year 12 now and am deciding on which uni to go to. I'd eventually like to work in one of the Big 4 but I don't know which is my best pathway there.

I'm deciding between UniMelb, Monash, RMIT and Swinburne.

I've pretty much crossed UniMelb off my list though because of how bad I've heard the competition is there. My careers councilor (who definitely knows her stuff) told me only 250 internships are offered to the 1000+ commerce students. She also said a lot of comm students are graduating worried from there because they know they aren't going to get jobs as they don't have any work experience or overseas study.

Swinburne and RMIT are very appealing me to right now. They both offer guaranteed 12 month work placement (paid at Swinburne, not sure about RMIT). From what I've heard and the information I've read, work experience is invaluable to prospective students and I feel like it would be silly of me to let this go.

The counter side of this argument in my head is that I don't need a 12 month work placement to be in my course for me to do it. If I go to Monash (or Melbourne), I could still organise the work placement myself and do it on my own. I imagine this would not be easy (and very time consuming!) though.

My ideal situation is to obviously go to a Go8 university AND have work experience but I don't know how likely this will be.

What do you guys think? Do you possibly have any advice for me?"
53nghs,1,2016-09-20,Doing multiple searches on different sheets. How do I skip sections I already did?,gualdhar,vba,https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/comments/53nghs/doing_multiple_searches_on_different_sheets_how/,"I've got a workbook with sheets from three different years, and I'm trying to combine them into one sheet, but grouped by product number and sorted by year. This was previously done by an intern I worked with, but he was a science major and had little coding experience, let alone in VBA, so the code wasn't fantastic. Activated cells, actual copy/paste, etc. After cleaning it up as best I could I noticed a problem - he did a search of one year's sheet, found the same product numbers on other sheets and moved on. But the macro wouldn't look for products that didn't exist on the first sheet. We've got new products designed or obsoleted every year, so there are products that might exist in one year but not the others.

I'm trying to find an elegant solution to this. I need a way to show which product numbers are accounted for on the other sheets, so I can skip them in subsequent searches. I could do a .Find on the combined sheet for each product on the year sheets but it seems like overkill. Then I thought about italicizing the cells for matches I found on by-year sheets and skipping them on the next loops, but thought that wouldn't be very efficient.

I can't mess with the values on the original by-year sheets, but anything else should be fair game. Any direction would be appreciated.

I know so many people who wants to play this game but just can't or the FPS is just unacceptable. Many of those people have excellent computers. If you look at the technical support forums, every patch update theres always huge performance issues effecting many players. 

For us veterans, we will do whatever it takes to get this game running smoothy, but for new gamers, they probably won't spend much time trying to figure out how to optimize the game before switching to something like DOTA2. 

Lastly, the sheer number of bugs for a Blizzard quality game is unacceptable. I realize this is a FTP game, and that they probably have intern programmers working on many of the things. But the sheer number of issues is just disappointing and the time it takes to fix them is really concerning. It almost feels like WoW and Overwatch were made by a different company all together.

This is not meant as a rant, but to encourage discussion and get blizzard aware of the issues at hand. "

I recently turned 18, got my first credit card, whatever. I started looking into purchasing a new-to-me car as my current car is on it's way out (95 Grand Cherokee). I found a 97 Volkswagen GTI VR6 for $3000 local to me on Craigslist.

I know I can't get a loan as I don't have enough credit history and I work for a Political Internship so my current job will be done in November (but I already have another lined up). I would have my father cosign with my but he told me it might be an issue because he is self-employed and has been for only about a year and a half. I make enough and he easily does to cover whatever the car payment would be it's just the matter of getting approved.

Would a credit union be any better in my situation?

Any ideas?"
53ogtt,4,2016-09-20,Five years,where2go_fromhere,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/53ogtt/five_years/,"Not sure where to begin, 
When I was 19, I started dating the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I will call him J. He painted himself as this sad little puppy who lost his high school sweet heart after she cheated on him. The first two years we spent together were the happiest I had ever been. There were issues here or there, his ex would text him or school would be over whelming, but I thought we were happy.

2 years into the relationship, J's lies started to unravel when his ex confessed to me they had been having an affair for the past six months. He swore she was lying, trying to break us up. He said there was no proof, and he was right, there was none. So I decided to believe him, stupidly. At this time, he dropped out of school and could not keep a job. He must of gone through 5-6 jobs at this point. Six months later, he disappeared. Randomly, cut contact from me. I begged him to contact me, with no words. After some time passed, he showed up in my life again. He would come over tell me sweet things, we would have sex, and then he would leave. Eventually, we started a relationship again.

One day, months into starting again, while I was on a skype call for an internship meeting, my laptop crashed. I grabbed his laptop and restarted my skype call. While on this call, I found messages between him and several other girls. He had been cheating on me. Sexting women, slept with one.  I grabbed all my stuff and left. When he found out I left him, he started threatening to kill himself . He told me he knew he was mentally ill and needed help. So I stayed. I was scared of him killing himself. I really believed he would do it. I tried to leave several more times after this, all resulting in him threatening to kill himself. He would have violent outbursts at inanimate objects, but never at me. I watched throw a shoe at a laptop, throw a laptop out a window, slam his head into a wall, etc. He started believing in conspiracy theories and still could not keep a job.

In November of 2014, I found my father dead in the garage. He had a heart attack. I tried to save him but it was too late. He was my best friend.
At this time, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD and put on medication. I was pulling my hair out, I wasn't leaving my bed. Five months later, somehow, I manage still to graduate college. A week after I graduated, I found out again, that J was having an affair again. I kicked him out of my apartment and blocked him from every aspect of my life. I was a wreck, trying to put my life together after losing my father. I would have flash backs to finding him in the garage. I was at my wits end.

I dated someone else for about 6 months. We simply weren't compatible. J tried to contact me during this time. I did not let him. Eventually, J was taken to a mental institution. 

After I broke up my new relationship, I went off my medication. J contacted me again and told me all about his epiphanies and how he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving he changed. So I let him, I stilled loved him dearly. And for 6 months, we weren't the happiest but I thought we were stable. He kept a job the entire time and started talking about trade school. I would have days where I would just be so mad about everything he did in the past. I would find out lies he had told me. For example, I discovered all the beginning of our relationship was a lie. He cheated on his ex a multitude of times and then randomly left her one day, never even broke up with her. He started pursuing me, leaving his ex to believe he was cheating on her with me. He did drugs I never knew about. He did online stripping for a time. I would get so angry I would tell him I didn't want him in my life.

So now, here I am. Hes gone and he has starting dating an eighteen year old. He is 8 years older than her. I have started therapy and counseling. I'm a conglomerate mess because I don't know how to feel about it all. I ask myself if he will be much happier with her, if he really changed and I just couldn't get past all the history. He has tried to sext me a few times, so he has likely not changed. He has told me he is still in love with me but she makes him happy because they have no bad history. I'm just a mess and I'm trying to move forward and feel like I made the right decision. "

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as
* the intern gets a special offer
* staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

Should I meet her anyway ?",10701220,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53p89k/my_25f_friend_that_i23m_was_supposed_to_meet_for/,"Please excuse my English

Hi Reddit:

I met this girl at uni (computer engineering major ) while I was a sophomore and she was junior. I was madly in love with her for two years but nothing happened  between us,just close friends 

During that time I used to do her homeworks,projects ,study together (more like me teaching her stuff ),and did here graduation project as way of telling her that I'm madly in love with her.

Nevertheless i've never felt that I was even a close friend of hers,Never felt that I was important to her

On her birthday I bought her this expensive purse as a birthday gift and a cake ,but she never even got to eat the cake with me as she was busy with her ""other friends ""  so just gave it to her at the bus station 



Thinking of her was just too painful that I decided to never meet with her again once we finish working on her graduation project,I gave her lots of signals that was gonna happen,On the last day of school I gave her all of her stuff that I had borrowed,Then she started crying beginning me to keep that stuff with me.




Then she called me and asked me to attend her graduation dissertation I told her that I wont be able to,because I was doing my internship,Nevertheless I took a day off and went to surprise her(or at least that what I thought would happen ) she couldn't be less surprised,I got mad and left (using my internship as an excuse )

Then one month later she invited me to attend her graduation ceremony,So I went there for 3 hours hoping that I can take a pic with her,or say some sweet words to her once the ceremony is over

And once it was over ,she left so quickly that I couldn't even say Hi to her


Tow days ago she texted me with a funny meme and asked why we haven't talked in a long time !and then told me that she's moving to another city in two days,So naturally  I just asked her to meet up for the last time She said yes 

So i went shooing bought her this cute mug that i'm sure she would just love ,and a bracelet as a goodbye gift 

Today she stood me up ,And after I called her for more than 20 times 
she picked up and Said she's sorry but her friends surprised her and threw a party for her that she couldn't leave home (and her phone was with some of her friend ) and let's re-schedule for tomorrow (her last day in the city )) 

now i'm wondering what should I do ?Should I go ? or Should I just call it off (I'm really angry ) ?


Update:
Just to be fair to her ,just has almost never asked me for a favor.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My crush who became a closed friend that never appreciated anything I did for her,stood me up today and asked me to reschedule for tomorrow ,possibly it's the last time I'll be able to meet her as she moving    to another city /should I meet her?  "
53p97u,186,2016-09-20,You have a heart of gold,FollowtheBuzzards25,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/53p97u/you_have_a_heart_of_gold/,"A few years ago, I was walking down the boardwalk of Venice Beach; I was interviewing for an internship in the area and decided to grab some dinner and go shopping.

I did not have much growing up in life and to this day, am extremely sensitive to folks who are down on their luck and are mentally ill. I firmly believe that kindness can go a long way. As most Southern Californians know, there is a huge homeless population on the beach, complete with panhandlers as well as performers who hustle.  After dinner, I was heading back to the hotel I stayed at, and gave ten dollars to a man sitting in the shade with his head down;  In my opinion, he certainly appeared to be homeless.  A gray, shaggy beard, unkempt clothing, two large plastic bags beside him full of blankets, torn shoes, and sweaters, etc.  As soon as I dropped the money in his hat, he looked up at me, smiled a big cheeky toothless grin, and stated "" YOU HAVE A HEART OF GOLD.""  I smiled shyly, wished him the best, and walked on.

Twenty minutes later, I arrived at my hotel, reached my room, and   prepared for a shower.  My room was on the first floor, just the way I liked it - I also must mention that due to being younger and without financial help, I was obligated to choose a seedy hotel of sorts.  It was the kind with palm trees outlining the front, pink cemented walls, the more ""decorative"" type, if you will.  The way the room is situated, you walk in, the kitchenette is directly to your left, the bedroom is straight down the room, and the bathroom is past the bed and to the right.  Typical.  Routine.

I took the shower, put on my robe, and proceeded to go to bed, as my interview was the next day.  That night/morning, I woke up at exactly 2:45 AM to contents in the closet shifting (I had placed a few hangers with clothes prior to my shower.  At first I thought it was my imagination, but SOMETHING made me get up to check.  I can't pinpoint what it was, but I ALWAYS trusted my gut.  I got out of bed, walked over to the closet, opened it, and before my eyes is the SAME HOMELESS MAN I gave the money to!! At this point, I am obviously fucking TERRIFIED and screamed bloody murder!! The crazed look in his eye complete with that same toothless grin is an image that haunts me to this day.  

""I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING A HEART OF GOLD.""

I hauled ass the fuck out of that hotel room in my robe, ran to the front desk, and told the clerk to call the cops.  All my valuables left behind, including my cell phone - believe me, I knew I had to get the hell out of there before God knows what would have happened.

The cops arrives on scene 5 minutes later and I was obviously in shock as to what just happened.  They proceeded to case my room and the surrounding area for the homeless guy, but minutes later they came back and stated there was no sign of him.  What they DID see, however, was a broken window with glass shattered both in and out of the room as well as a hammer right outside.  I heard NOTHING - i was in the shower, afterall.

My assumption is that he followed me back to my room after I gave him the money.  Venice Beach is crowded at all hours of the day and night, and I was regrettably not vigilant.  They never caught the guy, as he was most likely a roamer.

I suffer from terrible anxiety and panic attacks because of what happened, but feel much better now.   Please everyone, I strongly urge you to all to choose a SAFE and highly reputable hotel when staying the night somewhere, and check your closets, bathrooms, hallways.  Please look out your window and make sure there are no shady folks!"

It seems the good FR captain Duvalle has gotten a trifle too friendly with the angel woman he was appointed to escort. Our eye witness testimonies and long-range photos taken of Cpt. Duvalle's quarter's window show and confirm frequent instances of hugging, kissing, and other displays of affection public and private! One source even professes that the Captain at one point publicly bragged to the crew and the political appointee sent to oversee him that he was engaging in sexual intercourse with the angel.

Faithful followers of Rev. Alban, Archbishop of New York have expressed shock and disgust at Duvalle's actions, citing past reports of his inappropriate conduct toward women under his command as proof of his being a satanic incubbus sent to deflower the guardian angel of the Free Republic. More liberal sources have also put forward the theory that Duvalle is not a demonic seducer but has instead been trying to father a nephalim, an angel-human hybrid, in order to curry favor with the state and with God Almighty. These same proponents were sadly publicly flogged for heresy by angry crowds shortly after giving Channel 20 News their take on the issue. 

When asked if he at all felt as though his relationship with the angel represented conduct unbecoming of an officer, Cpt. Duvalle declined to comment and had our roving reporter forcibly ejected from his airship. No word yet on whether this has anything to do with the abhorrent slaughter of a kindly old Catholic schoolteacher and his students for just trying to follow their sincerely held religious beliefs, perpetrated last sunday by an FCC Smith graduate ""Creepy Chris"", or with the Monday night Massacre of New Rochester police officers by Chris and his accomplice, notorious blood monkey-in-chief Davey MacNeil. But our sources are calling it sure signs of a demonic plot to undermine the righteous cause of the Free Republic and its President. 

We'll have more details tonight as our roving reporter and armed intern team are given the go ahead to interview none other than Pres. William Bradford concerning how his administration plans to respond to Cpt. Duvalle's conduct and to the rash of killings perpetrated in FR borders. Tune in at 11!"

These might be the last words I ever write. I can already feel it, the savages tearing apart my simulacrum. Soon, they’ll have access to my wine cellar. It was once a joyous place of celebration, but now it’s my last stand. A couple of my friends stand by me, prepared to fight to the death. As the humans begin to enter my Wine Cellar, I remember the events that started this plight.

My realm has always been a place for monsters and animals to harmoniously coexist. Humans were welcome in the realm as long as they kept the peace. They had their own realm called a nexus, but some humans preferred to stay in my realm. The pirate brothers Dreadstump and Jon were two of my best friends, so it’s no surprise that they accepted my offer to permanently stay in my realm.

Then, there was the famine. Hundreds of my subjects started starving to death. It wasn’t long before we learned that the cause of this famine was that some of the humans were stealing massive amounts of  food to sell oversea to other lands. My most trusted advisor, Shaitan recommended that I close the realms immediately and banish all the humans for disturbing the peace and causing the deaths of thousands of monsters. I was foolish enough to ignore his advice. Instead, I set up a screening process to see which humans were smuggling suspicious crops.

Two of those humans, Alex and Rob were caught stealing our food in masses, using 24 enslaved drakes to carry them. They were promptly banished, and told never to return. Little did we know, they would come back. 

For the next few years, the peace was maintained. Then, my intern Craig reported an issue on the beach. He said something about starvation and murder, so I sent one of my two simulacrums there. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The humans, Alex and Rob had lead a group of humans here. 6 of my guards lay dead while the humans pilfer the remains of their weaponry. Then, my simulacrum flashed and it was decapitated.

I sent Hermes, a swift moving god to contact the humans for an explanation. I wish I knew what happened to him, but he never returned. The only thing I received from him was a poster of me. “Realm of the Mad God - Live Action Game - Try to kill the Mad God and his minions!” I was furious. I issued an order to kill all hostile humans in the realm, and use them as food, since our regular crops were no longer available.

They came, wave after wave. Each time, the humans took more of my realm and murdered more of my gods. I tried calling for a ceasefire, but they were ruthless. They killed some of their own kind, the pirate brothers. They even went out of their way to aggravate the stronger gods to kill their allied humans - just for fun.

At last, my realm was stripped bare of all its inhabitants. The desolated areas that remained were plundered by humans, searching for my castle. I needed to end this. Using all my power, I created a magical current that transported all of the humans into my castle.

My stone guardians tried their best to talk to the humans, to convince them that they were wrong. Instead, they were met with a flurry of swords and projectiles from various different weapons. Janus tried to show them the different paths and their outcomes, but they chose destruction. After they entered my chamber and destroyed my simulacrum, they were prepared to enter my wine cellar.

My wine cellar was specially designed so that only the invited guests could come in, if they owned the wine cellar incantation. I never expected that the holders of the incantation would be killed and that their incantation would be stolen. 

The last of the humans were sharing laughter as they took down one of my Henchmen. They would even laugh when one of their fellow teammates died. Alex and Rob were behind them, with a smug look. That’s when I realized...

They didn’t understand. Besides for Alex and Rob, they never knew the truth. To them, it’s just a game. To me, it’s fighting for my life, fighting for the land where I used to rule, and fighting for my friends, who boldly tried to stop the invaders. They were just pawns of Alex and Rob, the true evil ones. It was far too late to convince them of this though.

When I was finally beaten back, I heard a voice yell “Stop!”. Alex and Rob were walking toward me slowly. I braced myself for the final kill, but instead, Alex whispered in my ear. “You have made me too much money, and I’m not letting you die now.”

#Epilogue - 6 years later

It’s been a long time since I’ve seen any light. I’m given the minimal amount of nutrients to survive, and forced to work. It’s painful, being forced to recreate simulations of my friends that have already died. I watch sadly as mirages of Jon and Dreadstump were slaughtered over and over. I wish I could die, but I’m cursed to do this for an eternity. Alex and Rob have been gone for a while, but they were replaced by many others - Dashahead, Zbornox, Tiffytiff, Nullbot, Buffsoulja, Arbiterz, KoalaP, and most recently Sileex. A tear drops from my eyes as I witness the illusion of Shaitan, dying once again - and know… this is forever."

Took a hit and played video-games for about a half hour. Knock on the door. It's the police, ohshit.jpg. Open the door, was super honest and straightforward with them. I have never been arrested and my record is squeaky clean. They respected that because after taking the remainder of my weed, they were generous enough to let me off with a ""don't let us see you doing this shit again"" type deal. They gave me a good scolding, but the police simply confiscated 2 grams from my dorm room, and left me to reflect. I was not told I was being charged with anything. The police merely told me that my name is in their system now and if they catch me with weed again they will be less forgiving.
Later, the RA's on duty came by to write up the incident, and I was just as honest with them as I was with the police. About a week went by, and I got an e-mail telling me to meet with a community director to discuss the whole ordeal. I had the meeting and all went well, and then he told me that since it was drug related that he had to forward my case onto student life, where I will discuss the events again and be issued my punishment.
I have the meeting with student life in a week's time, but I was hoping to learn from other Spartans' experiences in these types of situations.

My question: Considering I was not charged with anything through the police, what is a punishment I am likely to receive from Student Life? Perhaps a class? Writing a paper about the incident? Or something more severe, like losing financial aid? 

PS: I am a broad business student and have been on dean's list since my freshman year. I have never been written up for misbehavior during my entire stay here, until now of course. Additionally, I have had 2 internships and can prove on paper I'm not a useless stoner.  

Any and all relevant experiences are welcome :)"

Thursday: Take tests. Damnit, I shouldn't have fapped this much. Well I dug a hole this low, fap.

Friday: I feel like a piece of shit. How do I pick my self back up? 

It's literally just when I have serious things to do. I end up just desiring high level escapism for a moment that ends up being hours and it's really bad. Sometimes when I have a regular week I can go almost all week without a relapse. I still work on a regular week. Go to class, go to my internship, go to the library. I'm pretty normal. It's beginning to be more stress-induced procrasturbation than anything. Irrational too. If I just studied those hours, I'd probably ace the test.

One thing I have noticed is that I have become uninterested in almost all porn to the point I spend 3 hours finding one I even want to fap to, so the procrasturbation ends up way longer than desirable. My reptilian brain kicks in because my human brain is stressed and nearly lets it.

53rah7,0,2016-09-20,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53rah7/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout.

Apologies to those who I left behind after my last prompt, I got extremely busy! If you're reading this, feel free to recontinue our past prompt or start anew with this one.

Typically I roleplay by posting a long prompt and hoping someone builds off of it, however I'm feeling particularly lazy. So instead of me writing a nice long, steamy prompt, I'd love it if YOU wrote one out. Below are ten mini-prompts. Each one has a little to offer, and I want you to build upon one of them. Essentially, send me a prompt based off of one of the mini prompts below! In your message, please include your kinks, your limits, and your name/age.

Please don't take too long on the prompt, but also please don't send a small amount either! I'll be content with 2-3 paragraphs, but will always read however much you'd like to put into it. All of these themes must include one kink: Expansion/transformation, but other kinks can be discussed!

1) As a newlywed couple, you and I decide to take our first honeymoon aboard a lavish and large cruise ship. This boat has all the amenities anyone can imagine; massive pools, relaxing spas, and even a tennis court. However, there's something awfully peculiar about this cruise ship...

2) Uh oh, a dirt biking accident gone wrong. You've broken your right arm, and you're now in the hospital being waited on by a beautiful staff of nurses and doctors. That's when you notice this hospital doesn't seem... normal.

3) You are the high chief of a small, pagan tribe within Scandinavia. You hate that bogwash of religion and mysticism until you meet an occultress who wields sorcery beyond the scope of imagination.

4) The Brew Pot, your favorite place to get your morning coffe. It's a bustling cafe mixed with cute barista's, a lovely smell, and the best tasting coffee you've ever had. Things do get weird, however, when they change the recipe to their dark roast blend...

5) You are a young casanova living at the height of your life in downtown Manhattan. Young, hung, and beautiful; you really have it all going for you. Your only weakness? Women who are extremely beautiful but batshit crazy. Your most recent girl is a firm believer in astrology and pagan rituals and brings you to a... strange part of Manhattan.

6) One of us is a lowly intern at one of the biggest corporations in America; Bi-dustrial incorporated. They make anything and everything, and pretty soon, one of us finds out some of their most secret and lucrative projects. 

7) Being a king or queen in the modern era isn't exactly what it used to be. From running entire empires and civilizations to being classy socialites and having bounds of twitter followers, it's hard to admit that time has indeed changed for our monarchs. Boundless wealth and nothing but time is enough to cause anybody to get a little crazy.

8) It's difficult, becoming a mother. Gaining unwanted weight, my breasts getting uncomfortably engorged with milk, sometimes I'd just prefer it if I never had to do it at all. The changes can be drastic, and can really make me feel a little depressed. It helps, however, to have a caring and loving spouse.

9) Genetically modifying fruit is a very controversial practice these days. We're putting these fruit in our bodies, that can be dangerous! It can be especially dangerous if a young, inexperienced scientist get's their hands on boundless information on how to accomplish some of the crazier changed fruits.

10) It's kind of like the plague, except no one dies? It's weird, doctors are afraid of the effects it will have on society, but it doesn't actually hurt anybody. If anything, it makes everyone feel pretty good. Even if society falls, at least the plague will make people happier. Maybe it's not all bad if society takes a tumble.

If you have any prefernce or ideas that you'd like to throw in, feel free! Please remember, I'll be going to work soon, so this roleplay wont be immediate.  [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/iI8tV6V.png)"

I'd eventually like to work in one of the Big 4 but I don't know which is my best pathway there.


The best uni's of my state (Monash and Melbourne) do not offer any internships or work experience as part of the course. In fact, t Melbourne, probably the most prestigious uni in Australia, only 250 internships are given to the 1000+ commerce students.


At the next ""tier"" of universities are 2 universities I'm considering. They both offer guaranteed 12 month work placement (paid at one, not sure about the other). From what I've heard and the information I've read, work experience is invaluable to prospective students and I feel like it would be silly of me to let this go.
The counter side of this argument in my head is that I don't need a 12 month work placement to be in my course for me to do it. If I go to the more prestigious uni's I could still organise the work placement myself and do it on my own. I imagine this would not be easy (and very time consuming!) though.

My ideal situation is to obviously go to the best university AND have work experience but I don't know how likely this will be.


What do you guys think? Do you possibly have any advice for me?"

53sj1m,10,2016-09-21,Serious visa/residency trouble,RichardElric,italy,https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/53sj1m/serious_visaresidency_trouble/,"Buongiorno redditori italiani! 
Parlo un po' d'italiano, ma la mia domanda è troppo importante per rischiare che qualcosa si perde nella   traduzione. Per questa ragione quella farò in inglese.
                     
So my girlfriend is currently in Italy for an internship and has run into some legal trouble concerning her visa/residency permit (or lack thereof). I've come here for advice, since we haven't got a clue how to turn this mess around. But first, some background:

My girlfriend is a non-EU citizen, but has lived most her life in Germany on a permanent residence title. She is currently studying for her Bachelor degree in a program with an integrated year abroad. This incorporates one semester of study at an Italian university  (which she 
already completed) and a four month internship.

Her legal status was already complicated when she studied in Italy, however in that case, her (Italian) university assisted her in getting a residency permit.

When the time came to go back to Italy for the internship, she enquired at the Italian consulate whether she would need a visa and/or work permit for this. Her German residence title generally only entitles her to a short-time stay for tourist purposes.

The consulate wasn't being very helpful. After several rounds of not getting any information at all or contradictory statements from them, they finally told her that she wouldn't need a work permit since the
internship was part of her study, and that she should apply for a permesso di soggiorno locally, as she had done when she was studying in Italy. (The internship is unpaid, if this is relevant.)

So she did just that. However, when she was at the local ufficio immigrazione for her permesso soggiorno, the workers there had a different opinion. They told her:

1) she should have applied for a work permit beforehand  

2) she was currently staying and working illegally in Italy

3) this wasn't any of their business 

All the while, they were getting very agitated as my girlfriend tried to explain her situation and what the
consulate had told her. They obviously didn't believe her and at one point threatened to call the police and have her taken away.

However, before they (almost literally) threw her out, they told her she could still try to get the internship recognised as part of her study via some unspecified documents which she should present to some unspecified government entity. It's quite possible that they told her where to present these documents and she simply didn't understand in this agitated situation, as her Italian isn't perfect. However, when she asked, they showed her the door and told her this wasn't in their responsibility.

So that's the full story. We'd be thankful for any kind of advice of what to do in this situation, but
mostly we'd like to know:

1) Is this really not within the ufficio immigrazione's responsibility? If not to them, to whom should my girlfriend try to plead her case?

2) What would be needed to prove that her internship is part of her study? She has an official  letter from her home university stating as much. Would this suffice? Is this even legally relevant? 

3) What could be the consequences, both immediate and long term, if it was ruled that she has definitely been staying illegally? 

If anyone has experienced a similar situation and gotten out of it, please tell us how to proceed. Also any kind of information/resources on the laws involved would be welcomed.

We've been thinking about getting a lawyer involved, though we can't really afford one. Would this be a good idea? I'd rather get the money needed somehow than risking dire consequences. (My girlfriend has recently applied for naturalisation in Germany and violating another country's residency laws could, in a worst case scenario, stop the process from going forward, or even result in her German residence title getting revoked). 

Thank you in advance. I hope someone has some advice to offer. It's greatly appreciated!"
53t01m,4,2016-09-21,It's one of those weeks...,BootyhunterzX,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/53t01m/its_one_of_those_weeks/,"Have you ever had one of those weeks where everything in your life is just going wrong? I mean everything. From your relationships  to your business pursuits to your family to your work. This has been the longest and most lucid nightmare of my life.

I have no friends. I only have one friend and I can feel he's getting sick of me already, all I do is complain about how everything is crumbling around me. People I used to talk to have been giving me a cold shoulder. People I have not talked to in a while, maybe the alienation is my fault.

I cry at least once a day. Some days I might cry more than others.

My biggest issue right now is that I'm in a relationship where only one of us is in love. The other just wants out. I've done everything in my power to keep my SO happy, I guess I've just been delaying the break-up. She doesn't love me anymore, she says she does, but I guess she's just grateful for trying to be there for her for four years without expecting anything in return. I did my best in this relationship. I really did. She was my first of everything. I looked at so many relationships to find where they went wrong and I did the best I could to be perfect for her, so she could be happy.

We talked about it and I guess I managed to just delay the break-up saying that we should take some time apart. It was just me selfishly clinging to this, the relationship is brain dead, but I just put it on life support, hoping that this was going to change, that she would magically love me again one day. It's only been 11 days since I decided that maybe what we needed was some time apart. She doesn't really talk to me. All she says is ""Good morning"" and ""Good night"" every three days, like it's on a schedule. In the four years we were together, I was very certain I was going to marry this girl, then, from one day to the other, that dream was gone.

I was starting a business with a friend from my high school. He's an Engineer, but his dream had always been to work with cars for a living. To start his own performance shop. My dream has always been to have my own business to administer and make money off. I suggested that we start a Corporation. I convinced him and I put a chunk of my savings into this. Way more than he did, to show him that I was really trying to make this work. I got all the necessary paper work, I made long lines at multiple Government offices, I did everything that was boring shit. He didn't do anything. All he had to do was pop open hoods and get to work, and take some classes for his mechanic license, classes that I agreed to pay for. He was literally going to get paid to study. I sought out internships with prestigious Auto Shops that he would've been able to go to.

Then one day, he tells me over messaging telling me that he's afraid of the political environment over where we live and if some asshole that everyone hates wins the election (Not US), he's going to leave the country. 

At first I was just bargaining to keep him interested. Now, I don't care. I don't want to be in a business with someone that shits themselves the first time something goes wrong. He doesn't have the backbone for leadership, how could I run a business with this person? Regardless of the outcome of the election, I want to dissolve the company anyway and pursue something else. I can't be the only one with business gall. I can't be with someone that isn't in this 100%. A corporation is like a marriage, if one of them is always unsure, it's going to be long and messy when it comes to an end. I want to just nip it right now.

My grandmother has Multiple Myeloma. It's pretty bad and she might not last as long the doctors initially said she was going to last. The condition left her bones so brittle that they break under the stress of her own movements. She was in surgery a week ago for a humeral fracture, she finally left the hospital on sunday, on monday she was rushed to the ER again because he other arm is now broken as well, she has since been operated and and is recovering. It kills me that my dad has to go through this entire problem on his own. He has three brothers, one that helps and two that haven't done jack. He has basically done everything on his own and it kills me that he has to watch his mother die regardless of all his effort, all anyone can say about that is that ""It's life, it's the way things are"" but ultimately, it's unfair.

I'm suffering this in my own way. I was closer that some of the other cousins, but I wasn't the closest. The closest had left the country in pursuit of other things and rarely visited. I don't cry about it, but the stress on my father is killing me. He needs me there for him and I can't be there because I am angry and just miserable all the time.

My sister has made some terrible choices in her life, leading to my parents not trusting her at all. I've become the bridge for them to interact. I'm forced to tell my parents some made up story about what my sister really did some night instead of what she really did. Turns out my sister is a Lesbian, I have no problem with that if that's what makes her happy, but my parents don't see it the way I do. They would absolutely go nuts if they found out my sister was a lesbian, even if it is out of her control. They would certainly kick her out of the house and she's not equipped to take care of our pet turtle, let alone herself. She ruined her own life and I'm the one that's going to be left to take care of the family, my parents when they're older and her because she's not very good at doing things the right way, because she's made some shitty choices. She was going to be a doctor, now she tests needles at the QA department of some Big Pharma company, earning scraps. That I couldn't get a word through to her and had to see her catch fire, crash and burn.

My job has made me a bit miserable in my life, even if it is decent money for an undergrad. I thought working in the company for where my uncle was a Chief Officer was going to be a good thing. That I would get too see ""How the sausage gets made"". I haven't seen anything. The Accounting team is distrustful of me and the other teams downright dislike me. I'm sure the issue gravitates to ""His uncle is the president of one of the companies and Main Shareholder in the other, that's the only reason he's here."" Yeah, that I'm here because of connections and not out of merit. That I don't deserve to be there according to them, even if I'm just an Intern. Every month they send out a list of all the birthdays for the month and they have missed mine consistently for the two years I've worked there. It's been clear that they don't care about me and they don't want to either. I've been doing a good job. I've been given more and more hours because they need me, but they still treat me like crap. It took me two years to actually get a terminal that didn't freeze up when I had more than one application running at a time.

I want to just quit, but things where I live are so bad that I can't just turn down $10 an hour. My father can't keep paying for my stuff because I need him to put more money into his 401k so he can retire comfortably because the government where I live destroyed the pension fund for employees to pay for debts and my mom is now out of a retirement fund.

My life has become a boring routine that has depressed me. I can say exactly what is going to happen today because it's happened every other day. I get up at 5:30 in the morning. I brush my teeth. Get dressed, pack some extra clothes and I'm out the door at 5:55. I drive to college and get there at around 6:30. I go to the Cafeteria and I get the same ""Turkey, swiss and Egg sandwhich, mayo and butter, no salad, and a coffee please, thanks."" ""That will be $4.79"" the employees already know what I'm going to order before I order it. I already know the price. I could operate the register already. I wait around go on reddit because my class is actually at 10:00 in the morning, the reason I'm here so early is because at exactly 7:00am we run out of parkings spots at the lot and we have to walk a lot further. A LOT. 


After my class I leave the University and stop on one of the three food trucks on my way to work, this is the only place that is unpredictable to me because I still don't know what the specials are but that will change in a few days. I take my food and sit down, I eat it as quickly as possible because the time is usually 11:45 and I have to be at work at 12:00. I leave for work which is just 5 minutes away from the trucks.

Then at work, my direct supervisor tells me that I haven't done something she asked for through email when I was in class. This will become an even bigger problem because she will bring this up in front of the general supervisor, the person that reports directly to my uncle and she will get a few hits in too. I do all my work as quickly as possible. Sometimes I finish all of my things on the To-do list way before 5:00 pm so I lock myself in a stall and cry because they don't want me there and I don't want to be there with them, cry because my entire life is falling apart. If I was dying, and I had a chance to have them there comforting me before I died vs dying alone, I think I'd rather die alone.

I clock out at 5:00 pm and am diligently stuck in traffic at 5:20. I reach the gym at 6:00 to 6:30. When I get there, all the free weights are taken, all the machines have a queue and all I can do is cardio. I do Cardio for 40 minutes to an hour, I'll be on the elliptical machine most every day and then a bit on the stationary bike.

Once I'm done, my other grandmother that isn't dying makes a small meal on mondays and tuesdays so I stop by and eat. Then I'll go home. Once I'm home, I'll pour a tall glass of scotch I keep under my bed, I'll catch up with my homework and watch an episode of some show, then I shave, shower and go to bed.

The next day I do the same thing, except that I leave earlier from the university and the food trucks aren't open yet so I have a frozen burger from the cafeteria and then go to work. Today is food truck day, I'd enjoy it more if it weren't so expensive.

This is about the time that I wish a truck would just run a red light, T-bone me and just obliterate me. It would spare my SO the issue of breaking up with me because there would be nothing to break up with. It would make my co workers happy because they can hire someone based on merit. I wouldn't have to see my dad go through his issues. I wouldn't have to tell my friend I don't think he has the balls to run a business and I wouldn't have to dissolve the company myself, my mom and dad could so it and they could keep the money. My friend won't have to listen to me bitch about how everything sucks or how I feel things suck. My sister will become more responsible and maybe she will take charge of her life because her safety net is gone.

Maybe being dead is better for the people directly around me.

TL;DR It's one of those weeks where everything keeps going wrong. I was already miserable and didn't need any more misery to pile on."
53t1na,2,2016-09-21,Handling access,Lokart,userexperience,https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/53t1na/handling_access/,"I'm developing an application to store and manage files, passwords, things like that. Currently I'm thinking about how to handle access to this data;

My initial thought was a ""security level"" system; every user has a security level (given by an administrator), which is actually just a number between 0 and X. When uploading files, storing passwords, etc. you can specify the required security level. For example: user X has a security level of 10 - hence he can look at all data which requirements are equal or lower than 10. Every data with a security level requirement above this won't show up.

My concerns here are: it could get tricky if you have a lot of different security levels. At some point the administrator is probably like ""well, what security level does this need to be viewable by managers but not for senior developers? 50? 100?"". Kind of a solution to this problem would be to store security levels by name. So you could manage security levels by value and by name; e.g. security level 1 is ""Intern"", security level 10 is ""Employee"", 20 is ""Accountant"", etc.. That would mean you're not assigning the security level itself to a file (or a password, or whatever) but a readable string. Sounds easier - but is still the same as above.

I don't to handle every users access individually. That would be way to much work when, for example, just want to provide a file which shouldn't be read by new employees but anyone else.

Any other ideas? Or are my concerns about the security level system just exaggerated and it's actually ""okay"" to do it that way?"

I graduated 6 months ago from a Bachelor in Business ( Major in IT Minor in Marketing) and I'm about to finish an IT internship in a big company ( 50 000 + employees, CPG, well known and reputed).

The likelyhood that I receive a return offer from the company at which I'm working right now is pretty high, but I also received an interesting offer at a much smaller company ( 300 employees, tech industry, huge growth right now)

The biggest dilemma I'm facing right now is that I'm wondering if jumping from a big to a smaller company is a step down for my future. I feel like I would perform a bit more in the role in the smaller company ( Partners Manager ) than in the one I would get in the bigger company ( IT Project Manager ). 

I have been getting feedback saying that I should stay within a bigger company to learn from their processes and methods, but I've also received feedback saying that I should jump to the smaller company to get more diversified responsibilities and an opportunity to learn and grow with the company.

What do you guys think?"

Place to look for job listings:

the Emory Public Health Employment Connection website: http://cfusion.sph.emory.edu/PHEC/index.cfm?CFID=13092232&amp;CFTOKEN=80281718. 

job boards for the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists website (CSTE: http://www.cste.org/ ) and  the National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO: http://www.naccho.org/ ).

post-graduate paid fellowships in Applied Epidemiology:
Fellowship opportunities at CSTE: http://www.cste.org/?page=CSTEFellowships.  Applications for CSTE Applied Epidemiology Fellows will be due soon. 

The Florida Department of Health also has a two year fellowship opportunity called the Florida Epidemic Intelligence Service FL-EIS: http://www.floridahealth.gov/%5C/diseases-and-conditions/disease-reporting-and-management/florida-epidemic-intelligence-service/index.html

The California Department of Health also offers a one-two year fellowship program called the California Epidemiologic Investigation Service (Cal-EIS) Fellowship Program: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/CaliforniaEpidemiologicInvestigationService(Cal-EIS).aspx *updated per mountainsound89's tip*

CDC also has a fellowship program available called the Public Health Associate Program (PHAP https://www.cdc.gov/phap/ ).  


Here are some applied skills that we often see missing from the skillset of new MPH graduates.  If you can leverage your MPH program to support you in developing these skills, that’s great, if not, you may have to do some self-teaching on these but your candidacy will be stronger for it in the long run.

•	Develop a really solid understanding of the principles and methodologies behind disease surveillance- Many MPH programs offer a lecture or if you’re lucky, a whole course dedicated to disease surveillance but that’s often not enough. Roughly half the jobs in applied public health are surveillance positions (which will be evident when you look at the positions advertised on the PHEC website). Having a really good understanding and working knowledge of the principles and applications behind disease surveillance is worth seeking out.

•	Know how to code in SAS and/or R and/or EpiInfo (extra bonus if you know how to code in Python).  Focus on data management skills, specifically know what a relational database is and like how to deal is, not just statistical analyses.  Just about everyone with their MPH can do cross-tabulations, or even run regressions, but very few understand what a relational data table is, and how to deal with it to run the report you want- there are a lot of opportunities to learn these data management programs for free. Both R and EpiInfo are free programs- so there should be no financial barrier to getting experience with both of these platforms.

•	Know how to make maps (ArcGIS experience preferred)

•	Know how to use the entire MS Office Suite (that includes MS Publisher)

•	Get experience visualizing data dynamically.  A large piece of the work we do is communication, and in particular communication to non-scientific audiences. 
 
•	Become familiar with the principles of project management and resource mapping. 


As much as I dislike the idea of an unpaid internship- I feel that people should be paid for the work they do, unpaid internships are a great way to get experience and network also. The longer you are willing to be an intern for, the more exposure you’re going to get, and, generally, the more time you’ll have to develop a relationship with your mentor so that they trust you with bigger projects that will get you better quality experience and exposure.


I have probably missed a million things, so if anyone has anything to add, please do!

I'll be accepting a job in LA for early 2017 (Feb). I interned with them before, so I'm familiar with the area and the commute, but that was a temporary gig. This is at least semi-permanent. Here are the details:

* $50k pay, and I can expense travel on the job, if that matters.
* Located slightly east of DTLA. Think Little Tokyo/Arts District. More specifically, very close to 1st/Alameda.
 

My info:

* Single, 24 year old male.
* Moving from the midwest, Chicago area.
* I have a car, and I own it outright.
* I have no debt of any kind.
* I've lived in an apartment for some time, so if it's the best option, I have furniture, including a bed. Everything I'd need to set up short of appliances, essentially.
* I've looked at PODS for shipping my stuff. Cost estimate was roughly $2k after taxes/fees.
* Essentially, I have no outstanding monthly costs other than rent, utilities, and car insurance right now (which I've had quoted around $80/mo).

I've looked at trying to find a decent deal in Pasadena, since the office is really close to the Gold Line, or the commute would be super short from the South Pasadena area anyway. As for the city, I'd need a bit more help. My max rent is pegged at right around $1100. For my internship, I got lucky and subletted a great spot at USC, but that's not gonna work for permanent adult living.

I guess what I'm looking for here is an assessment of my situation, a couple more particular ideas for areas of the city, and costs I need to consider that are CA specific (rather than the generic costs of moving).

Thanks!

I had previously been six months earlier in a relationship that ended after 4.5 years. The ex had been very smart and challenged me, but in the end she was so strong willed and hard headed we didn't work out. My friends and family described her as not a nice person. Thus I went after this most recent girl, I'll call her ""Allison"". 

Allison, was more fun in nature. She seemed to go with the flow and like someone I could spend large amounts of time around. I had other girl options at the time but she seemed the least like my ex and a sure bet. I was her friend for a year or so previous and we had always stayed in touch, now that I was single and she had moved back to the campus after taking a year off, I decided to make a move. 

We hung out a ton around Christmas time and I asked her out. Everything went super well. I noticed though in some ways emotionally, she didn't seem to have the depth or feelings early on I saw develop with other girlfriends. She seemed to go straight for sex after we had started that phase, instead of cuddling or kissing. As a guy I was fine with it but found it odd. I attributed this to being her first boyfriend, and that her parents were on the brink of divorce and had an unhealthy relationship (didn't even sleep in the same room). She had hooked up with some dude once before my time she met at a club a few times, but that's all I knew in terms of her guy history. 

To give some background, I'm a very jokey, light hearten person who gives their all into everything they do. Sometimes it scares people but I think to do anything less than your best is a joke. I was a 3.3 student and very organized for a guy and clean. I enjoy sports, reading, video games, volunteering. I sometimes come off as hard to read or a jerk at first but once people know me well I become very close and a long term friend. 

She's a great person as well but struggled in school when we first met often and took things personally when I tried to help or point something out. She'd make a great mom and wife one day I thought. She's drop dead gorgeous and normally a nice person, good to take home to mom and dad type. She was very messy and disorganized though and tended to trip herself up a lot. Forgetting things and all that. I tried always to help her with that and be more functional. Often she didn't see the problem but would be late or forget to do stuff in school and I'd help save her. I guess I thought her growing up over time would fix those things so it didn't bug me much and she was a good time to hang out with and relax. She knew she lacked compared to me in those areas but I'm not perfect and she seemed to know that at first and that I wanted to help her. Over time she resented it and it bugged me she didn't seem to progress. She was very much save the world, vegetarian, liberal, dreamer. I was rational and believed hard work got me places along with others. I didn't mind her opposite mindset because I felt it balanced us as a couple and made us branch out more. 

We spent a ton of hours together the first six months like any normal couple, we grew in love and made one another better. The same could be said for the months following. We were on campus a lot together, volunteered in the same service groups and lived in the same apartment complex area. 

The first problem started about 8 months in, she ran into a guy in a class. This guy looked like your typical jerk who didn't care about anything and was a frat boy. I knew this because I'd attended one class with her before and seen the kid. She would tell me how he wouldn't pay attention, then text her asking for her help, and that he would play with her computer mouse or touch her screen when sitting next to her.  After several times of me telling her he was flirting, a fight broke out at her apartment between us. Not heated but me saying stop talking to him and that she needed to be trustworthy. He had kept texting her and the last text she showed, he asked to study together at his place. I said she had to have known and to stop flirting. She said sorry and cried and turned around to end the conversation by saying she would never do anything because she loved me. That was the first time we had broached that and I had considered saying it soon but wanted to be patient and not freak her out. She was 20 at this time. That was our first fight and over trust. It would become a common theme. 

After this time and for the next year things were still good overall. The guys hitting on her issue and her not shutting them down seemed to still happen though. It always ended with the guy via text or in person blatantly inviting her over or texting her something awkward then she allegedly got the hint and agreed with me to shut it down. Part of me wondered if she had done this because she didn't really like the idea of commitment and enjoyed the intention. I'd had girlfriends hit on by dudes before (but they shut it down properly and quick. 

Trust became a big issue. I always felt bad bringing it up but the worry grew over time seeing the pattern. I would always do little things for her like bring her coffee at work, or do her laundry if I could, take her to dinner, or those kind of things. Romantic things seemed to weird her out the first year so I was hesitant of those type things but tried. I'd bought her things like jewelry too but she had lost two of the three necklaces I had gotten her and so I got her a cute but less expensive one last for her to wear around. I just wanted her to know I was thinking of her, and that she mattered. Not that material part had mattered to me. She rarely did the same type stuff but I didn't need it I thought because making her happy made me happy. 

We spent tons of time together the next few months and did things like make meals together and celebrate holidays with families and really seemed passionate about one another. 

Around 1.75 years in I got a full time job at the place I attended school, while still finishing. I couldn't turn it down because it was paying for my school and getting me a salary, benefits and job exp. I became much busier and moved to night classes. During this time the girlfriend got a job at a restaurant waiting tables and we ended up having opposite schedules only seeing each other on weekends and select nights. This job in IT wasn't strenuous, I had did similar tasks as a student intern previous but it took a toll working 40 hours and class twice or three times a week at night. Sometimes at night we wouldn't talk as much cuz I'd be tired or she would or stress levels were just high. 

The girlfriend and I began to get in a rut and around 2 years in she said she wanted more adventure. I agreed but said I was doing my best with the time I had. When we saw each other on weekends it was often at 10pm at night and so she would come over and we'd often watch a movie or go out with friends for food and then come home, have sex and fall asleep. It happened often and I knew it was only a phase and part of growing up so I was ok with it. Things were still passionate and fun to me, just less spontaneous due to schedules. The occasional trust problem still cropped up with guys hitting on her at her new job, but mostly nothing developed. We only ever really fought once every few months about that issue and never really fought about anything else. She wasn't very vocal or willing to share her true thoughts, I am the complete opposite. I was patient though with her because she was still kind of new and meant well at this. 

Two years in she went on a service trip with friends in the northern part of the state. She was one of the student planners on the trip so we didn't talk much the week she was there. She seemed to create a bond with a girl while up there, we will call her ""Erica"". Upon returning from the trip she was supposed to meet me and take her car to a shop to get it looked at about an hour away. Instead of taking me, she took Erica. I found this odd but didn't think much of it. Two weeks later, she had come over late and was showering. I was laying in bed waiting for her to join me and suddenly her phone is blowing up. It's Erica and she had little emojis. I knew Erica  a little previously and knew she was a lesbian, as she had dated a mutual friend of mine. I decided with that in mind to see what was so important on her phone. It was then that I found that my girlfriend, Allison had been hanging and talking with Erica at a level I never suspected. Allison was texting her how she had plans to break up with me in the next week and that she had to ""get used to touching"" with her. 

When my girlfriend walked out of the shower, I left the phone on my bed with the screen lit up to the texts. Her face went white and she actually tried to deny it when asking her if she cared to explain. She didn't know I had read majority of the texts, and so I tested to see if she offered to share anything more. She did not and seemed pissed at me. I don't like having to look at someone elses phone and not text them, but my gut and the results there proved I was right. My trust was shattered and it made me wonder how faithful she had been in all those guy situations she claimed weren't her fault. 

She apologized to me but didn't seem to really quite understand the impact that she had more or less possibly cheated or planned to and the impact that had on me. We were ok dating the next couple months but I was edgy with work stress and she seemed to be mailing it in of late in terms of effort. Eventually she wanted to talk and break up. Siting that I wasn't as fun and carefree and that she didn't know who or what she wanted. We broke up at her apartment and it was a cordial and nice as that situation can be.

About a month later we attened the same social event and she looked good, apparently she had been drinking before hand knowing I would be there. I only went to accept a very prestigious award at the ceremony.  I heard rumor she was still into me some and that things with others didn't work out. I never knew what happened with the girl and she claimed nothing. I always questioned that because they no longer talked and the girl tweeted what a shitty person she was. I talked to a few other girls in between but wasn't into it and still thought of her, even despite what she had done.  I decided to ask her on a date after about a month and five days of being broken up. She came over and we talked and I told her she needed to be confident in herself and believe in herself for us to date, and to act trustworthy. I thought maybe she was just young and messed up and I loved her so I felt it was good for us to have a second chance. She agreed and we started dating and everything was fun and great. That lasted about four months. 

She then went up north again on a fun vacation trip with a new friend and her friends family who lived up there. She didn't call me for the first 5 of the 11 days she was there but when she had left things were good, she was asking about moving in on my lease coming up, talking long term with kids and wedding colors someday and seemed happy. Suddenly after a long work shift doing upgrades I get a text at 1am. It's her basically saying she's really happy up there and she had found herself and didn't know what she wanted in life. She said she wasn't sure she only wanted to be with one guy and was worried she was settling. She admitted it was out of the blue and claimed she was doing it for her after talking to her friend and that it had nothing to do with the friends brother who was her age up there. He had eyes for her before once when we hung out in a group and I met him, but I trusted her it was nothing. She said she wasn't sure if she wanted to break up and that she wasn't happy and didn't feel like herself with me. She asked to not text for a few days, but after 24 hours I asked her to call me and talk about it, I thought 2 and some years had bought me at least that respect. It was a heated of a conversation as we had had, she kept saying things she had never brought up before, and claimed things like ""I wouldn't be fun if I didn't have my job to focus on and that it defined me"" and that ""I didn't like her singing or adventures"". In all reality I love my career so that offended me, yes I had focused on that of late but it required that, and I loved her singing and adventures. I just didn't have the time and energy sometimes to go off on as many as I used to. She said that the tickets I had bought her to a concert recently, that she didn't have fun at it because the right guy would have danced more at it and pushed up into the crowd unlike me who was just content singing a little along and admiring. She got mad when I asked for sure that the brother wasn't involved and she struggled to say I love you when hanging up the phone. We texted a little after and I asked why she hadn't said she was unhappy more before? And she said she didn't feel like herself when with me, I never knew that so how could we have addressed it? It seemed like her solution was just to ditch it all and she said that she didn't feel like we were throwing away anything after 2.5 years. She also claimed that I didn't want her to study abroad, in reality I did I just told her I would miss her which I attributed to normal human reaction. That wasn't me telling her know, it was that I loved and would miss her but have fun and do her. I was upset, we texted very little that weekend and she didn't call or text once back. We basically broke up via phone an Facebook which made me mad. I wanted more class and maturity than that. 

Turns out after talking to a mutual friend, less than 3 weeks after breaking up, she drove 10.5 hours one weekend to spend four days with the brother of her best friend she had gone up north with. This guy was 21 and seemed like a bro/party type. The opposite of me, I was past that phase a few years back. Moving on that quick and claiming nothing was there before we broke up makes me think twice about the kind of person she was/is. Once finding this out I was enraged and deleted her from all phone, social media etc and don't care to talk to her again. 

 I worry I may have been too boring or not fun enough and that weighs on me, at the same time I think maybe that was her was of making herself feel better about running off with the other dude. 

My question going forward is, how do I trust again and not carry that fear to the next person, and should I give her the light of day if she ever enters my life again?"

I graduated in May 2016 and been applying since middle of my senior year. I graduated with no internship and research experience. I had GPA of 3.04 but my last two year of ChE I had maintained GPA of about 3.5, something I used to forte in my interview saying I have maintained high GPA while taking some of the most core classes in ChE. I filled more than 400 applications and went to about 5-6 interviews. I would like to share what I changed in this process which help me land this job at Colgate-Palmolive. I see lot of post here that are struggling to find jobs. First of all do not loose hope! I have filled every application out there and always stayed positive on possibly landing job. Staying positive is the most effective thing. Another, if you are not landing jobs/interviews get your resume reviewed by you senior classmate who is working in industry or best option your professor( something I did). You will be surprised on how many connections professors have in industry. Aim at professor who is very nice guy and you know he would help any student, I went to my thermodynamics professor. He suggested me to put my projects on my resume instead of irrelevant work experience you might had. Try putting senior project, Heat-mass project or any project you did during your degree and show them how you used computer programs (Excel, Aspen plus, Visio, etc) to solve or make project easier. Brush-up on interview skills. There are tons of website,workshops or videos to improve your interview skills. Talk to your classmates who have had internships or other positions. Lastly, find a way to get contact of hiring manager. If you can somehow find a way to put your resume directly to hiring manager and skip HR dept, you are mostly likely to get called in for interview. Find any alumni from your college working in industry by either LinkedIn, networking or again professor's connections. I landed my job because he graduated from same college. They are very familiar to the program you went through and professors/classes and projects you did during your degree. They are more lenient towards  same school when making the final call(happened with me in this job). "
53vghd,13,2016-09-21,I [26F] started trying to get our finances in order and now there are issues between my husband [27M] and I.,relevantinthe90s,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53vghd/i_26f_started_trying_to_get_our_finances_in_order/,"Hey guys, I’m not sure if this is more relevant for r/personalfinance or r/budgeting or r/relationships so I’m just going to put this here until I get told to move it somewhere else. Also, general disclaimers of throwaway since people know my usual screenname.

So my husband [27M] and I [26F] have been together for 7 years, married for 2, and our bank accounts intertwined for 3 years. We have always been really shitty with money, him more so than me in terms of paying bills on time/acknowledging their existence but we always made rent. As you can imagine that has been a CONSTANT pressure on our lives but hasn’t really caused any noticeable relationship stress until I started trying to get our finances in order. 

A little background:  when we met both of us were working minimum wage jobs with the intent of saving up for school. I ended up going back to school through the grace of a windfall from my family, scholarships, some saving, and a bit of help from credit cards while he bounced around jobs and finally settled into where he is now making decent money 36K/yr. I spent a year doing an unpaid internship following school, where he supported us, and then ended up where I am now making 37K/yr. During the intervening time life happened and we racked up debts, most stupid but some unavoidable (medical) and as a result have been swimming in what feels like crushing debt. We make our minimum payments, contribute to the household equally, and attempt to save where possible but really hadn’t gotten beyond the “whining about being poor” stage until now.

I jumped onboard the budget parade to track our wasteful spending and ended up going through the last year’s worth of expenditures and breaking them down by category.  I found out how much we were spending on cigs (we both smoked) and I quit. Found out how much we spent on alcohol and I quit that too. Basically I got healthier because I was horrified by the amount of money being spent but didn’t want to force my husband into anything so I just assumed those expenses would be halved (WRONG).

Problems:  I’ve been getting a little prickly about our budget since then (he was never really 100% on board with this approach, he just wanted all debt to vanish and or didn’t want to alter his lifestyle) because now 62% of our monthly “fun money” ($230) is going to things I don’t participate in and I would rather save that money OR go do something that we can both participate in. The prickly-ness extends to me spending 15% of the “fun money” on things I want and then getting hassled because “Oh, it’s okay if YOU spend money on blahblahyourthing but I can’t spend money on blahblahmything”. He doesn’t seem to realize that drinking and smoking are NOT NECESSITIES/BASIC RIGHTS they are LUXURIES and fall under the FUN MONEY category despite being explicitly told that and shown that in a myriad of graphs (yeah I’m a data junkie). 

So now I’m pissed and a little butthurt because I have been putting in no small amount of time and effort developing a budget system (mint and ynab didn’t really do it for me so I set up my own spreadsheet system) so that we can get out of being 22.5k in debt, fix his credit, save for a house, save for a kid and maybe live in a world where we don’t feel crushed by debt and he is making me feel like a bad guy for not letting him spend money on the things he wants to! I have tried to make him feel involved in this process, shown him the data, broken in down multiple ways for him to get a full understanding of what is going on, and expressed to him how he hurt my feelings and the level of genuinely upset I am. Here is the kicker, he seems sorry but then a few days later is doing the same exact thing that hurt my feelings in the first place! 
What can I do to make him actually understand that I’m already sacrificing the majority of ‘my’ spending money so he can keep doing the shit he wants to do but more importantly TEACH HIM THE VALUE OF BUDGETING BECAUSE I REFUSE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE BEING STRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING I CAN FIX WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE SUFFERING.

So. Does anyone have a better approach for me or am I being way out of line about this whole thing?

TL;DR I [26F] started budgeting to pay down debts and my husband [27M] thinks I'm being unfair about how he spends 'his' money

PART I - Excitement 

I drove the same car from 16 years old to the day I got hired at my first ""real"" job out of college. It was a 2001 Subaru Outback. The thing was awesome. It carried all of my high school friends on countless adventures, made several expeditions through terrible weather conditions across the mountain passes of Western Washington, and stayed on the road with very few mechanical issues despite my sometimes less-than-pampering treatment. 

As reliable as it was, an older used Outback wasn't the coolest car to have as a 16, 18, or 22 year old. This was always in the back of my head. I wouldn't say I felt embarrassed driving it, but it just wasn't something I took pride in when I was driving down the road. So throughout college, I told myself that I would save as much as I could. When I graduated and found a career job, I would spend whatever I was able to save on a new, COOLER, car. 

I worked every summer, odds and ends of jobs; one year as a camp counselor, one year a marketing intern. I vicously saved all of my summer money that I could throughout the school year. I was fortunate to have parents that covered my basic amenities in college (cheap rented house shared with 4 people, a basic meal plan at the school, stuff like that), so I didn't have to worry about large monthly expenses. I even avoided ""necessity"" purchases like a mattress, instead opting to sleep on a $30 inflatable one. All in the name of saving for a cool car. 

I graduate college and find a good job at the end of 2012. By this time, I had saved up about $8,000 in my ""car fund"". About 4 months after moving to my current town for work, I come into contact with a higher-up at Microsoft selling his 2005 Audi A6 because he is buying a Tesla. It was top of the line, fully-loaded. 4.2 liter V8, 335hp - the thing was crazy. 
He was the only owner, bought it new in '05, had all the service records, and was only selling it to clear out the room in his garage. 92,000 miles. He found a dealer that was giving him $12,000 for it. I asked him if I was able to match that offer, would he instead sell to me. He agreed. 

I proceeded to ask my dad if I could borrow $4,000 from him to cover the difference I needed. Now having a salaried position, I knew I could make car payments relatively easy, I just knew trying to finance this 7 year-old car through a bank as a first-time borrower would be more difficult. He loaned me the money. 

I was stoked! I had the coolest (and fastest) car of all of my friends. Even though it was 7 years old, it looked new. It had been super well maintained, this guy had just finished performing ""tune-up"" maintenance to sell it, so it had new brakes, new tires, oil was changed, cabin filter, etc etc. 


Part II - Enlightenment 

Fast forward about 4 months. Still loving the car. I'm noticing it's kind of expensive to fill up, though, with gas prices being where they were at, and the fact that this thing isn't that fuel efficient (20 - 24 mpg). I'm spending almost $80 to fill the tank up sometimes, but whatever. At this point it's about time for this Audi's first oil change. Wow, $150 for an oil change. Oh, it takes 8 or 9 quarts of oil? And HAS to have the oil that's $10/quart? Yikes. The price I pay for a sweet car I guess!

Let's jump ahead another 4 or 5 months. I notice a very deflated tire coming back to my Audi in the parking lot of a restaurant. I baby my way to a local tire shop. Don't exactly remember why the tire couldn't be fixed, but I remember that I had to buy new tires. It's a quattro, so I can't just replace two of them, it needs all four replaced. Oh this Audi takes super wide, weird-sized tires? Ok, how much are those? $900? Holy &amp;%*#. Ok, well get it done I guess. 

Now the fun starts. Myself and my (now) fiancé are driving back from a weekend getaway. I notice the car doesn't seem to have the umph it should have going up hills or getting up to speed. Over the next day or two I also notice the car getting louder as I bring it up to speed. Ok now, it's clacking. Wow, now it barely goes 35mph. 

I convince my dad to come down with his car trailer to bring it to a local independent german auto shop we had used for my sister's VW. A few days later I get ""the call"". It's basically worst case. It's the timing chain, which is inside the engine block. To fix it, the engine will straight up need to be removed; about 40 - 60 hours worth of work. We're talking a V8, 335 horsepower engine has to be taken out of the car. The estimate? About $6,000. I chew my options over. The car is basically worthless like this so it's not like I can sell it. I choose to fix it. Not even through paying my dad off for the purchase of the car, I reluctantly ask him to help me out with the cost again. He loans me another $2,000. Thanks, First Bank of Dad.

3 months later, the car is finished. YAY. I get my car back. 

Not even 6 months after, something else happens. I'm attending an event in Portland and come back outside to my car, start it up, and notice the electronic parking brake is on. That's weird. I don't usually put my parking brake on when I am on flat ground. I push the button to disengage the brake, and... nothing. Instead, after a few seconds, a giant indicator light blinks brightly at me with a horrific high-pitched beeping noise to accompany it. Parking brake failure. 

I had it towed to an independent shop closer to Portland. This is a story in itself, but the short version is they spend 1 month pulling their dicks around and come up with no fix. I finally convinced them to give it up and had the car towed to Audi. (By the way, arranging a tow for a completely disabled car with a parking brake permanently engaged can be difficult). 

Audi was actually confused by the problem for a while too. They eventually replaced the whole parking brake module which worked. $1,500.

You might be wondering if I had ever thought about selling this godless money pit. Yes. Yes, I had. Let's remember at this point, the car depreciates every day. Quickly. Someone had slightly sideswiped me in a parking lot without leaving a note, so the driver's side panel had a dent in it. I was kind of screwed. Do I sell this for like $8,000 and then finance a brand new car (still while owing my dad a little money)? Or do I just eat this fix and pray that it lasts another 100,000 miles?

Preferring to only owe money at ONE institution - The First Bank of Dad - I decide to give this car one last chance. Now we get to March of this year. I'm driving to an Easter celebration with my fiance at 70mph on the freeway. Total loss of power. It's a cracked head. $5,000 estimated fix. The car's done. 

How the mighty have fallen. 

I owned this car for a total of about 3 years and I spent more on maintenance than I did on the car itself.


Part III - Reckoning 

To everyone who's thinking:

""do your research"", ""you should have known"", ""there's a reason used luxury cars cost what they do"", ""should have sold it"", ""don't buy a car to be cool"", ""it's Audi"", ""shouldn't have spent that much to fix it"", ""don't buy a car you can't afford to maintain""

or any other snarky remark with undertone of my ignorance.

Fuck you and fuck off. Not because I don't want to hear it. But because you're right.


Part IV - Redemption

Now, if you're particularly astute, you may have picked up on the fact that the Audi was in the shop for a combined time of several months. What did I drive during that time? Did I survive without a car? 

I drove my 2001 Subaru Outback now with 220,000 miles on it. 

I returned to the Subaru dealer a humbled man. In April of this year I bought a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek. The thing barely has 150 horsepower, and I LOVE that about it. You know what I also bought when I purchased my Crosstrek? A giant motherfucking warranty.

I paid about $2,000 for it and I smiled as a wrote the check. I probably would have paid twice that for it. Even if it's unlikely it'll pay off, it's worth that to me just in peace of mind. I'll probably buy the biggest warranty available on every car I buy for the rest of my life. Cause I know what the value of it is to me. 

And if you think this was an unwise purchase, let me just say this:

When you are legitimately scared to take your car in for an oil change because you know they'll find something else that'll cost you 4 figures, THEN I'll take your feedback seriously. 

Value is subjective. There's not a soul on this planet who's going to convince me I didn't get a good deal on that warranty. 

When these salesmen say the ""true cost of something is what you are willing to pay for it"", they're not BSing.

Boss is an exec and while he does know a lot about tech (he has a computer engineering degree thank god), I'm the one who knows the ins and outs of our system better because I literally live it. 

Anyways, our nametags had our job titles- executive director and software engineer. When people (both guys and girls) would come up to us, they'd go right to him and would be unsure if they could talk to me about the position. In addition to asking about the internship opening they'd generally ask him about the skills needed and what they'd do- stuff that I know better since they'd basically be my intern. 

I had one guy try to explain Java to me. I work in C#... I'm making sure his resume isn't getting far. 

Also the women at sign in automatically assumed I was an HR person and needed clarification when I said I was an engineer 

Why is being a woman and being a developer such a farfetched idea?!?! Grah!!! Other women aren't innocent here either, I've gotten shit from both sides. I feel like my boss respects me more than most people there and he's voting Trump ffs! "

Just time for a new one. This one still does okay, but it's not what it sued to be. Lots of pictures, lots of music, lots of stuff for what was my internship and now is my work. This new one will *not* be a work computer. I'll keep this current one and use it at work for as long as it will keep on going... or until my work gives me one that I can use to make their stuff.... which would be reasonable anyway ;)

Stuck between [these two](http://imgur.com/a/1GX1U): Pro retina with 2.7hz and 8gb and the macbook pro (non-retina) with 2.9GHz and 4gb 

Trouble is, I don't really know enough of the nitty gritty to have a feeling for what difference this will make. This new mac will house music, pictures, maybe a few videos and books, select apps, and that's it (that I can foresee). It will be my everyday, at-home laptop that I will stream on and use the internet on. The macbook air and the new macbook notebooks just look to fragile to me. I want it to be capable of breezing through imovie/photoshop stuff if I had to use it. 

I want something that isn't *too much* for my basic needs, but I also want something that is strong and sturdy enough (both mechanically/power-wise and physically) to last me for another bundle of years (and maybe even more than this current one). 

I don't feel like I need to retina display, so I am leaning towards the 13"" 2.9ghz with 4gb. But I can't grasp what difference would be made if I a.) went down in GHz or b.) went up in GB and got the retina.

Sorry I'm so lost and thank you for your help!"
53wf64,248,2016-09-21,Neutral sister(GC) has chosen a side after we went NC with Woeful Wendy,Faux_the_penix,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/53wf64/neutral_sistergc_has_chosen_a_side_after_we_went/,"I am such a mix bag of emotions over this. I should be shocked but I saw this coming. Wendy has gone to my youngest sister (the GC) whenever she is upset. If u/Libida and I stand up to Wendy and DH you bet your ass Wendy is going to go crying to my sister before I get a chance to talk to her. GC has put herself in the middle on several occasions. Wendy cries to her about how mean we were for not letting her do whatever the fuck she wants. 

But we have had several talks with GC and have come to an agreement that she will remain neutral and we will avoid pulling her into it. We actually just had a conversation about two weeks ago where we talked about how GC is afraid she may have to live with Wendy when she gets her internship because it is unpaid. Also we mentioned several other shitty things Wendy has done that do not come to mind right now.

Fast forward to this past Saturday(&lt; a week NC with Wendy). It is my sister's birthday. Early in the morning I message her on facebook and say happy birthday to my little sis. She replies back with “ thank you big bro” or something. So I think all is well. u/Libida wakes up and tries to say happy birthday as well and can’t… She has been block. What a two faced cunt! I check her facebook wall and there is a soppy speak about how she is soo lucky to have such great parents who did a fantastic job at shaping her into the women she is today. We had an agreement. She did not even attempt to talk to us. u/Libida was devistated. She did not see this coming. I feared this would happen and I still had trouble processing it.

As mad as I was with my sister’s betrayal I was equally as mad with Wendy for her part in it. I really wanted to talk to my sister but as I mentioned this all went down around her birthday. As mad as I was I did not want to lose any hope of saving whatever fraction of our relationship I could get. I will probably never trust her again and she will never have my kids stay the night at her place but I do not want to lose her.

So I sent her a text. I pointed out that we needed to talk and we set a date to talk. I spent some time thinking but also kept myself busy. Thinking too much would shut me down. It was eating at me and I was not going to let the feelings win. Sunday came around and I had all weekend to think. I realized that Monday’s conversation is not going to go well. My sister has taken a side and is going to mad on my mom’s behalf or defensive about her own actions. I am pissed that she has broken our trust and taken sides. This conversation should wait. I sent her another text and she agreed. We have not set a time or date and I have no clue when she will come around. I really hope she does. I just finished losing my parents. As much as it was gratifying to go NC it hurt to realize my relationship with my parents would never get better. I do not want to loose my little sister too.

53wigp,1,2016-09-21,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53wigp/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

53wr87,0,2016-09-21,Study abroad vs. internship abroad vs research during the summer?,uncommonscans12,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/53wr87/study_abroad_vs_internship_abroad_vs_research/,"Out of all of these, I feel like research is where my time is best spent med school wise, while studying abroad is the least. An internship abroad though seems like an in between, where I'd get to work for a company (I could be placed where I want, could probably do something healthcare related) and also have the experience. Not sure really... these are just thoughts and may never come to fruition, but I'm torn in what I'd do if I had the option. My OChem professor said if you did good in the class and he would take students to work in his research lab (he is really nice and working with carbon nanotubes, which I think is cool and plus it'd pay me, plus I got the third highest grade on our first exam so I'm getting there), and I think this would be the best looking for med school, but also the most cookie-cutter. Studying abroad and internshiping abroad seem cool and more like an experience, but studying abroad at least seems like not a big deal to med schools, and both of these would cost me money.

Not really sure what I'm asking, just looking for some thoughts.

Thanks for the read"

My OMS is 54, and I have ongoing interviews with corporations in consulting and data analytics. I've had internships every summer and I know I can get something based on experiences, GPA, etc. I put MI and Signal as my top 2 but I don't want to branch detail. If I get a job offer, which would likely happen in the next few weeks, I'd rather go Reserves and have the choice of picking a unit. I already talked to my PMS and HRA about this, and they mentioned that there is (or was in the past) a waiting list for cadets looking for Active Duty. Other than that they weren't too sure about switching with an incoming Reserves 2LT. 

Can anyone confirm the deadline when cadets currently assigned to Active Duty can switch component to the Reserves? "

We tried to visit every other weekend, but the first year was really tough for me since I didn't meet many other people to spend time with and she was always telling me about her new friends.  I got lonely and kind of jealous, which was an awful feeling and wasn't fair to her.  Eventually I became detached as a way to cope and we called and texted less between our visits.

After we graduated, we lived in the same city for several months. For the previous 4 years the longest time we had spent in the same place was 2 weeks during our winter breaks, so we were excited to spend time together.  For the most part we had a good time, but I found myself getting bored easily when we were just hanging out at one of our houses and I was more annoyed than concerned when she would get upset about things.

3 months later (about 3 months ago) I moved out of state for a job and she went to grad school. We're about 5.5 hours apart in good traffic.  The few weekends we've visited each other we've had a really good time, but between those times I've been feeling detached again.  I'm not really interested in her texts and I haven't been particularly looking forward to seeing her, even though I enjoy it when I do.

Are these just the side effects of long term / long distance relationships? What can I do to become more emotionally involved without going back to being lonely and jealous?  Our plan is to move in together for a while when she gets an internship.  I think it could help, but I don't want to become completely detached before then.

**tl;dr:  I feel emotionally detached from my long term long distance girlfriend and I'm afraid it will hurt our relationship in the future.**"

53y2vp,4,2016-09-22,Having trouble composing that email? Here are some suggestions and templates for effectively writing to Congress.,mitraheals,kratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/53y2vp/having_trouble_composing_that_email_here_are_some/,"I’m not a politician or a lawyer or anything like that, just been researching the most effective ways to write letters to congress lately (3 guesses as to why :). Here are some personal observations I have learned, that helped me compose my letter to my congresslady today. Hope they are of help…

Intro: Here you want to quickly grease the wheels and state clearly what it is you want. The greasing may take a little tweaking, depending on who your congressman/lady is. For example…

“Dear Honorable Representative [SpongeBob]: Thank you for the excellent public service you have provided our district throughout the years. I am writing to respectfully urge you to sign the Pocan (WI) / Salmon (AZ) Dear Colleague letter by close of business Friday, to delay DEA Scheduling on Kratom tea.”

“Dear Honorable Representative [CarlosDanger]: Thank you so much for getting the funding appropriations for our district’s highways last year! On my way into work, I noticed how fewer potholes there are in the roads, all thanks to you! I am writing to respectfully urge you to sign the Pocan (WI) / Salmon (AZ) Dear Colleague letter by close of business Friday, to delay DEA Scheduling on Kratom tea.”

“Dear Honorable Representative [GiaEarthGoddess]: Thank you for fighting the toxic and dangerous oil/gas/nuclear/flux capacitor industry for contributing to climate change. We need more Representatives like you if we are to save our beautiful planet. I am writing to respectfully urge you to sign the Pocan (WI) / Salmon (AZ) Dear Colleague letter by close of business Friday, to delay DEA Scheduling on Kratom tea.” 

…you get it. Say something positive about the guy/gal then say why you are writing them. Short and sweet, ideally customized to your Rep, although the first one is generic enough that it could be used on pretty much any of them – just try to tweak the wording a little to fit your style.

Middle: Here you tell them why you want them to sign. It can be scientific evidence, regulatory conflict, or a personal story. Or something even better that you came up with. Again, the best choice will depend on who your Rep is and what issues resonate best with them. Just keep it short and sweet. Remember an intern or at best a legislative assistant will be reading this, and they have hundreds a day to go through. Make every word count.

Scientific Evidence: (good all around for repubs and demos): “Dr. Edward Boyer, M.D. of the University of Massachusetts has studied Kratom tea extensively and found it to be useful in the treatment of chronic pain and the opioid crisis. Unlike opioids, Kratom tea doesn’t produce the deadly side-effects associated with opioids, such as repertory depression responsible for death in overdose. However, Kratom tea still helps people cope with their chronic pain long term. DEA Scheduling Kratom would be taking away a powerful weapon against the opioid crisis.”

Regulatory Inefficiency (best for repubs/conservatives): “The CRE has noted a regulatory conflict between DEA action and that of an ongoing NIH health grant to the University of Mississippi and the University of Massachusetts for study of the plant’s medicinal properties. By placing the plant in Schedule I, the DEA would effectively stop the NIH’s research on the plant, because there would be no legal avenue for the researchers to obtain it. This is yet another executive overreach/abuse of power by the Obama Administration &lt;-- only use last sentence when writing to Repubs!!!”

Personal Story (best for liberals/democrats): “I suffer with chronic [whatever] and was prescribed a host of pharmaceuticals, such as [the scarier the better]. It made me into a zombie/addict, unable/barely able to work/care for my children, have a good life/marriage, or participate in society in any meaningful way. However, after discovering Kratom tea, I got my life back entirely. I no longer take [scary opioid drug(s)] and haven’t for [X] years. I am now a productive full time student/mother/professional, all thanks to Kratom tea.”

End: Sum up what you said above by restating what you want the rep to do, again complete with a little grease.

“Representative [EightHundredDollarHaircut], I know you are very busy, but could you please call Rep. Pocan’s office regarding this matter? His office will answer any further questions you may have. Please sign the Pocan/Salmon dear collegue letter by close of business Friday. Thank you for your time/have a nice day. Your constituent, [firstname lastname]”

My $0.02. Hope it helps someone out there in redditland fight for the cause."

I'm currently in Paris for a small visit and I leave in a day and a half. Having been exposed to this wonderful city, I wanted to explore to possibility of relocating or temporarily working here. If I researched correctly, I basically need a company in Paris to sponsor me if I want to work here.

However, I just graduated in college a few months ago with a technical degree. So the jobs I'll be looking for would be in IT or programming. My problem is that I can only apply for an internship or entry level position. I can't seem to find much and I've tried applying to a few so far. Additionally, I only know basic French right now so that would also damper my chances.

Anyone know any ideas or would working here be in the realm of impossibility?

Thanks!

Thanks for the response guys. It means a lot. I'll look into what you guys suggested."
53zh79,0,2016-09-22,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53zh79/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."
53zk1p,2,2016-09-22,This VOIP issues has been plaguing my department. Could use some help,TonyPepperoni25,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/53zk1p/this_voip_issues_has_been_plaguing_my_department/,"So I am an intern at a towns IT department and no one in our department can figure out why our VOIP phones can't keep a steady connection. We switched about 150 land line phones to our new VOIP phones (Cisco 3905 for teachers and 7841 for admins and secretaries) and we are having issues with very choppy quality on the calls. Any ideas as to what might be going wrong would be very appreciated! 

What we've ruled out so far:

- Our first thought was that our web filter wasn't setup for as many clients as were on it, but we upgraded our web filter to handle many more clients than is necessary and nothing changed.

- Personally (just an intern), I thought our switches weren't configured for full duplex. They all are.

- We run 10G fiber to our hub and then we were running 1G to each building but we upgraded the connection between buildings to 10G and nothing changed.

So current theories (I'll put a * next to my own personal [just an intern] theories)

- *Our 1G switches need to be 10G and all cable replaced with cat6 (this is an unrealistic move from a budget standpoint) 

- Most of the complaints we get are focused in certain regions (connected to certain switches) of our buildings, so that might be a lead. 

Thats really where we are at right now so any input would be very helpful! And any questions I can answer I will."
53zllx,1,2016-09-22,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53zllx/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout.

2) If I do email or call back, what should I write?

Any advice should help!

Edit:  Thank you everyone for their advice and comments, they were all very valuable and realistic input.

The company's Benefit
Healthcare - I am still reading through it, but they are average. 
Retirement 403(b) is 10% contribution 3 years vesting. 
Tuition reimbursement up to $1,600 per semester and 50% for the rest of the courses (Really great since I am currently taking classes as well)
Paid-Time Off - 4 weeks vacation + 9 days holiday each year= 5 weeks vacation it's not bad at all.

After reading everyone's comments I guess $42k with all the benefits are very good.  I am going to just ask for a 10% increase and see what happens. If they reject the counter offer, then I will take the job anyways because I get to work with Biostaticians, researchers, SAS, SQL, and I get to help people.  I am really excited because I am going to be learning so much this year with my new job, school, and internships.

540332,1,2016-09-22,Depressed about my age,malazatum,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/540332/depressed_about_my_age/,"Would you say that someone who is 28 and just got his master's degree is stupid, when you can get it at 23,24 in europe?

Basically, i'm finishing my masters this november/december, and i'll be 27 (born in august 1989), but i'll only get the degree in 2017, since the examination board takes place each year, in june or in uly. (i'll probably get a certificate this year though)

I got my bachelor's degree when i was 24, took a year off, and then started my masters (in a well known business school in my country). It's also common to do it in 3 years because of the additional 6-7 months internship.

My work experience so far :
-7 months as a business analyst in Bangkok (my master's internship)
-2 years of basic jobs : assembling computers, being a salesman, being an assistant-accountant (idk what you call that)...
So, to sum it up, i have around 2 years and a half of job experience, and i'm graduating at 27, BUT getting the degree at 28.

I feel really bad about it, because i feel like it's not normal to be this late, i feel like people won't allow me to have a great career because i failed too many times, and i'm starting my career too late. I feel like i'm not even allowed to be an entrepreneur (my dream) because my profile is mediocre or something...

I had a severe depression when i was doing my internship in thailand (i'm from western europe though), because i saw many brilliant interns who finished their course around 23-24 years old. We had tons of interesting discussions, most of the time, because (and that's what hurts the most), i know i have the same intellectual facuties : i'm not and idiot, but i feel like people will always look at me in a weird way if they know that i got my degree at 28 (although i'm graduating at 27)

So there you go : every time i see someone brilliant (just had a conversation yesterday with someone who got his masters at 22, and his phd at 26-27), and although i know this man didn't think that i was stupid when we had this conversation...i kept thinking what if he knew how old i am?....

I know it's been a while since I've posted here, or on the slack, but I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm still doing kaizen, and improving in nearly all areas of my life (I still need to work on procrastinating less). I keep kaizen and its ideals in my mind almost constantly, and it helps to get motivated to do work, work out, eat clean, meditate, etc. I am keeping score of how well I am doing based on Path_of_change's formula and the trendilne on the graphs that I make using the number outputs is upward sloping, meaning that I am ""continuously improving"", which is great. 

To be honest, I was in a really dark place when I started kaizen. I was studying abroad in England, and with the crappy weather, huge school and lack of friends I was really really depressed. It got to the point that I was self-harming, too weak and tired to go to class or get out of my room, and was drinking to get drunk by myself everyday. My best friend told me about kaizen, and that's when I started meditating, going to the gym, eating clean and talking with him a lot about how to get rid of my depression. Although kaizen helped a lot, I was still drinking a lot and didn't realize that this was a problem until the summer. What happened was that I was still depressed at my summer internship, and continued to drink heavily after work. Although I was doing kaizen stuff, it was the drinking that was leading to my depression, so no amount of kaizen without me handling my drinking could make me feel better. Anyway, on July 26th, I had a breakdown at work and was sent to the psych ward for three days to get a handle on my life. I was fired from my internship and felt like I hit rock bottom. Since coming home early, I've managed to have a handle on my drinking, and have felt much much better. Without heavy drinking in my way, I could really deal with my depression, and through practicing kaizien, I've felt happy on a consistent basis for the first time in almost a year. It feels great to be doing the stuff that I know is right for me, turning my life around, and heading in the right direction with my mind, body and soul.

During your upcoming lectures a lot of companies will advertise ""internships"". One of the big ones is college works painting. Long story short, they are a pyramid scheme. They make you pay for your equipment by using a line of credit and you also have to use your earnings to pay your workers. By the end of it all you will be making far below minimum wage. They also go out of their way to write reviews on websites such as glassdoor in order to make themselves look legit.

Any company that tries to find its workers by advertising in a lecture hall not legitimate. Real companies do not need to do this because in order to find good candidates, they go to job fairs, post adds on LinkedIn etc. in order to get driven candidates. **This does not apply to campus orgs** however as it makes sense for them to advertise this way. 

I have also never met anyone who was turned down from the job, everyone I know that interviewed both: 1. Got the job and 2. Told me the interview process was very weird and sketchy.

I'm having a tough time right now, and would like to talk. I am going to begin mental health counseling next week, but something came up recently... and I don't really have anyone to talk to since it's pretty personal.

I won't go into a lot of details to spare you... and me... from a 99-page-long rant, but I'll try to explain the best that I can my situation. As a disclaimer, this is a pretty long post - so I apologize in advance.

So I just graduated from college last month, and my major was a tight-knit group of 22 people. 3 guys, 19 girls. During the beginning of this two-year program I got to be great friends with one of the other guys, lets call him x.

Here is the cliff notes of our relationship up until now:

We get to be almost best friends

He comes out as gay and says he really likes me*

After a few days of thinking, I tell him I don't feel the same way. I'm not gay... as far as I know.

We continue being friends

There is consistent tension between the two of us

We get in fights fairly often

Try to be good friends

We have lots of good times

But also lots of bad times

It is not healthy for my mental health

We apply together for a quarter-long internship at the same hospital

Both get accepted

I have spent 2 years with this guy and the bad times are now outweighing the good

...

He is really emotionally manipulative and it is hard for me to continue being his friend.


Okay. Skip to the end of the summer internship, and nearing our undergraduate graduation. We get in a fight, and I try to make it clear that I don't want to be friends with him any more. He is SO DEEPLY ATTACHED to me... and admits that he is... that he cannot come to terms with the two of us not being together forever. It seems to me like he is in love with me, and has never gotten over the fact that I am not into him the way that he is into me. It's overwhelming.

Anyways, I'm sure that I'm missing a lot of details, but I'm gonna skip ahead anyways.

So yesterday was his birthday. My mental health is not that great, and it's hard for me to stop being friends with him. Up until this point I know (or at least I think I know) it's what I want, since he has caused me so much (seemingly unnecessary) pain. He is incredibly emotional and drags me down with him when he is upset. I am done with it... but since we have been so close for the past 2 years, it is hard for me to sever that relationship. 

He invited me to his birthday, but at this point (a month after graduation) I cannot be around him. It's hard for me since he invited a bunch of friends  IN A GROUP TEXT to this place in town.

I decline the offer, and stay vague that I am not able to make it.

So here is where the shit begins.

He posts a very passive aggressive post on his facebook, not saying names but that he gives the world and is sad that he receives nothing back.

This is typical - he has done this many times and expects me to console him. I have many times, and I feel like I have conditioned him to keep doing that. That's not healthy for either of us - for him to be PUBLICLY upset every time that he wants attention from me. again... I am done with it.

So the night goes on, and I get a text from one of our friends saying she hopes that I will come to dinner. I apologize again, and say that there are family health issues that are going on in my life (which is true - my dad went through surgery a few days ago and is nervously waiting for the results... but that's a story for a different day).

The next day (today), I get a call from him... which I didn't answer because I do NOT want to talk with him. Frankly, I am fed up with his needy tendencies, and can't give in to him any more. He is just going to rant at me. But then, I get a text message IN THE ORIGINAL GROUP CONVERSATION WHERE X INVITED US TO HIS BIRTHDAY saying:

""(my name) are you seriously not gonna do anything for my birthday ... I'm really hurt right now...""

Him and I haven't talked in over a month. I sent him a one sentence reply to his initial invitation, but nothing after that.

It is embarrassing to me, and (hopefully in retrospect) to him too... and this behavior is typical for him too! He will do something that is fucking crazy, and then be in tears apologizing later. One time, despite me telling him repeatedly to stop contacting me and specifically NOT to come to my apartment, he left a series of ~5 voicemails, i had ~30 missed calls from him, and then HE KNOCKED AT MY DOOR. Needless to say, that was a scary day. In fact.. that was probably when I decided he and I couldn't be friends after graduation.

Anyways...

So now our group of friends (probably about 5 other in the group text) are totally aware that he is incredibly upset at me, which is NONE OF THEIR GODDAMN BUSINESS!

I haven't replied back, and it has been a few hours now. But I can't perpetuate, congratulate, or continue reinforcing this kind of behavior any more. It is fucking nuts, and through him publicly yelling at me in the group message with all our friends, it seems like he is (unknowingly/subconsciously) trying to sabotage my friendship with our mutual friends.

I don't know if I should ignore that, contact him, send a message back to the group... or what. I was thinking I could write something back, staying professional, and saying ""hey, im sure that was meant for just me, and I'm sorry you have to hear about our personal business"" or something like that or..... I don't know man.

Reddit, please halp. Also, thanks for reading. Thoughts?

TL;DR: Eh, sorry guys, don't really want to sum up my personal life in a one-sentence synopsis. "
541m44,10,2016-09-22,"My [26F] boyfriend [25M] of 6 mos. will be moving away in a year, do I continue to invest in our relationship?",isitbesttoinvest,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/541m44/my_26f_boyfriend_25m_of_6_mos_will_be_moving_away/,"I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 6 months. He is in grad school and I have a very fulfilling and successful career in the city we reside. My last serious relationship lasted 3 years and we were engaged. I was forced to end things due to infidelity and emotional abuse and it completely wrecked me. Since then, I have spent 2 years dating around. I finally met my boyfriend and things clicked. I am his first girlfriend – he spent many years studying, being anxious and reclusive and he tends to be on the quiet side (i.e. awkward on first dates). I am the exact opposite in every way – super talkative, outgoing and I have no problem being an initiator. Everything we do together has been some kind of a first for him. It worried me early on but now I’ve grown to enjoy being involved in many of his “firsts.”


For three months out of the six we have been together, he was in another city about an hour away for an internship. We saw each other on the weekends only. Because of this, and because of his inexperience, we have moved slowly. He has since moved back and we have spent most of our days together since then. I believe we are hitting the point in the relationship where it’s time to decide if we are going to become serious.


Since he moved back at the end of August, he has shared his feelings with me more than he ever has before. He has told me that I have helped him come out of his shell and that he feels like he’s really growing as a person as a result of dating me. When he told me these things, my heart was pounding. I was waiting for him to finally say those three little words but he got flustered and the conversation faded off. I wasn’t worried though – I thought it was all a good sign that we were moving forward and heading in a more serious direction with our relationship.


Earlier this week, he very casually mentioned to me he was looking into school/work in different states. He has never lived anywhere other than the city we live in and he thinks it will be good for him. I agree and support him. I've lived in many different states and countries since I was young and they were amazing, super formative experiences for me. I think he needs to have those experiences outside of his hometown and I would never stand in the way of better job/education opportunities. This move would be a year from now –  next September.


Unfortunately, these comments have forced me to rethink the way things are going in this relationship and where it's headed. I am torn on what this means for our relationship and for me. Is it better for me to cut and run now? I am really falling in love with him at this point… but I do not want to invest in a relationship that looks like it has a firm expiration date. Even if things were still going strong, I don’t think I could handle a long distance relationship without becoming an anxious, jealous mess.


I confided in him about this last night, and told him I was feeling a little torn up. Honestly, I know this is a decision that is ultimately up to me and me alone, but I was hoping he’d give me a little direction. Really, I was just looking for any kind of insight into what he would prefer to do. He was quiet for a while and eventually cuddled me and told me he enjoyed spending time with me. He said, “You’re a great girlfriend. You’ve been great first girlfriend.” That addendum gutted me. It made me feel like shit. Not only were his comments vague and ultimately unhelpful, they made me feel like some sort of placeholder or starter girl to give him experience before he moves away and finds a better life, better girlfriend, etc.  


I was tired and needed to think, so I quietly thanked him and I drifted off to sleep. I woke up a few times during the night to find him awake, sitting up in bed or anxiously pacing around the room. At one point, I asked him what was wrong and he told me he had a cramp. He got back into bed and planted some really sweet, passionate kisses on me and I fell back asleep. I haven't heard from him since I left for work this morning. I don't know what to think about any of that except for that it's strange and unlike him.


I guess I’m sitting here at a loss wondering how to feel about things. Should I let the chips fall where they may and worry about this closer to the time when he will be moving? (Maybe we’ll have come to be in love, maybe we’ll have already broken up?) Or should I just end this now and not gamble with my heart any longer?


Thoughts, reddit?

TL;DR — My boyfriend of 6 months will be leaving the state in a year. I am starting to fall in love with him. Do I prematurely cut and run and save myself the heartbreak? Or do I stay in this relationship and continue to invest on the off chance that the situation may change?"
541zba,5,2016-09-22,Thoughts on OData?,TimeBomb006,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/541zba/thoughts_on_odata/,"I have been working with OData recently as an API consumer, and I am curious why I don't see it come up often in discussions here because I find it quite enjoyable.

My colleague wrote an API, essentially mirroring a CQRS style service.. specific endpoints for commands and domain centric queries (for single objects), and OData controllers for retrieving IEnumerable results (allowing the consumers, a mobile app written in Xamarin and an admin interface in .NET MVC, to craft their own app-specific queries). OData integrates well with Kendo UI components, so even our intern (who wrote the web app) was able to pick it up quickly.

Is there something I'm missing? It seems like a great
 solution yet I see very little discussion, and unsurprisingly, few public APIs which expose OData endpoints. I understand the argument to keep business logic in the service,  away from the consumer, but I feel like it's a happy trade-off, as it's not really core business logic but app-specific queries with little domain value. My coworker mentioned some pitfalls, like consumers being able to expand the result set and access domain entities that are intended to be private, but he disabled that functionality. 

What are your thoughts?"

There are not many black and Latino computer science graduates but there are more than enough of them. I know talented black coders that went to top schools (Ivies, etc) who can't get jobs are in debt but the average white or Asian guy can get a job. And these men are actually talented.

In my case I am a black female engineer at a PhD level who went to an Ivy and is now going to an even better institution.
If it weren't for CODE2040 I wouldn't even have an internship. 
We've all heard stories of white(-presenting) people who drop out of college and get a coding job (not that there is fundamentally anything wrong with that) but do people really think the tech world is fair? The only ""diversity"" really exists for white and Asian women.

An example is Isis Anchalee....even if I wanted to, I couldn't be like Isis Anchalee and I've been an engineer before it was trendy and hipster to do so.

5423t7,2,2016-09-22,"Not sure if I [20F] should pursue a relationship with my very good friend [21M], or just back off?",fallfunatthebeach,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5423t7/not_sure_if_i_20f_should_pursue_a_relationship/,"Full disclaimer, I don't really use reddit much at all and I apologize for any mistakes I make because of that, including my potentially disastrous formatting. I'm really trying!! That said, I will try and keep this short and to the point. Thanks for reading and any advice!

I attend a very small public university [Less than 1,000 people] for the past two years. Last year, I had a four hour long class that basically met everyday of the week. On the first day we were put in groups and I met my good friend who I will call C. 

I am a somewhat introverted person who is extremely socially anxious and has difficulty connecting with people as a result. C is a very outgoing person who gets along well with everyone, and I originally thought he was talking to me a lot in part because we are stuck in the same group. However as the semester progressed he went out of his way to invite me to events and gatherings, text me things at 2:30 in the morning, etc. 
I thought he was just being friendly, but it wasn't until he made the comment to me in which he referred to both us as being straight that I thought there could be something more. I kindly corrected him and told him that I wasn't straight but bi, and was in a relationship at that time with a girl. I could tell he was a bit saddened by this, not really upset, but definitely taken aback. 

Fast forward through the year and we remain very good friends even after our long class together ends and we see each other rarely. Over the summer we talked briefly a couple of times about various school things, but nothing too long. Then, out of the blue, he texted me about how he was going to have surgery. I asked him what day it was, his response was in thirty minutes. I asked for clarification of the day, not how long the surgery was going to be. He replied with a picture of himself in a hospital bed with the caption ""In 30 minutes."" 
It was a bit weird that he decided to talk to me right before, but I brushed it off as him trying to spark up a conversation. I went out of my way to talk to him everyday after that, stay up late with him if he was going through a tough time, and lament about how crappy post-surgery recovery is. 

When school started back up we learned that we were neighbors and our rooms were right next to each other. We try and hang out all day once a week to catch up and talk about how life is, but both of us are very busy and the workload at our school is very intense. 
However he did talk about his past relationships to me one night, in part because a mutual friend had asked him out on a date. 
During that conversation he told me particularly about one girl back home who he has been interested in. However neither one of them wanted to pursue a relationship with one another due to not wanting to pursue a long distance relationship among other things.

It was during this conversation that some other things clicked for me. The girl he was interested in, K, is evidently very similar to me. As in, he has made multiple comparisons between me and her on different occasions, both in how we act, dress, interests, comments we've made, etc. over the year I have known C.
Suddenly comments he made to me in the past year made sense, his random texts at 2:30 in the morning, his disappointment at learning I was in a relationship with a girl last year. And this was all basically cemented by the multiple other people who asked me if we were dating because of how we interacted with one another. 

Other notable things: He really wants me to come visit him over the summer on the west coast so I can meet his friends and family, to the point he went out of his way to let me know about potential internships in the area that I could pursue.
He told me after the conversation where he mentioned his feelings for K that I am now one of his closest friends as he very rarely speaks about that or his past relationships with anyone.
I am his closest friend at our college as is he to me. 

That is more or less where I am now. I do like him a lot and think any relationship with him would be super healthy and fulfilling, but I am way too socially anxious to outright ask him if he has feelings for me. I don't want it to ruin our friendship or make things awkward, and in addition I don't want it to make it seem like I am betraying his trust... Especially after our conversation about his past relationships which he was very guarded about prior.

Also, us and three other friends are going on a week long vacation to the beach within the month, so I don't want to make that awkward or weird either by this whole thing. But at the same time I want to know and I am tired of pussyfooting around the topic....
It's to the point that I feel like I am reading way too much into his actions and maybe nothing is there, and that is also feeding into my anxieties. 
 
  **TL;DR:** I want to ask my friend about his feelings towards me but I don't want to betray his trust or make things weird if I happened to misread the situation. How do I ask him without potentially damaging our relationship or hurting him?

I have 63,000 in student Debt. I pursued a BSc in Mining Geology and watched the commodity market crash ( and where it has remained) in 2012  - the year I graduated. I then went on  to complete a MSc in Petroleum Geoscience only to watch the oil collapse 6 months before I graduated and now in the worst oil downturn in over 30 years.  The best part is? The only way to get a job as a geologist is to essentially get an internship in school - however, I watched them all fold as the markets crashed, and now I am told if you are underemployed for more than 2 years they will never hire you.

So here I am with a 3.6 gpa and I can't even get a fucking interview for a job because I am not a student anymore, I am now a graduate. 

The plan - Go get a BSc in Computer Science, Go get a BSc in Engineering. Rack up another 80,000k of student loans and then leave to India, Chile, Japan or some other country and never pay them back.

542njw,2,2016-09-22,(23/m HL DB?) Am I heading for trouble?,deadrooms55,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/542njw/23m_hl_db_am_i_heading_for_trouble/,"My girlfriend and I are both 23 and we've been together for 2 years and we currently live together (about 3 months).

The first portion of our relationship (before we moved in together) we were having sex semi-frequently, probably 2 or 3 times a week  when we found ourselves alone (both lived with parents). When we moved in together I thought that would increase with us being alone more often, and it did a little bit. Probably 3 or 4 times a week for the first month or so. 

After that first month, she got a new job (was previously working midnights, same schedule as I am on) that is a standard 8-5(7-6 really with commute) M-F office job. With me working midnights and her working mornings it really doesn't effect our time together too much, she goes to sleep around 1030 when I go in to work, leaves when I get home and I wake up around when she gets home from work. She is also going to school Tuesday Wednesday Thursday after work to finish her bachelors. 

Ever since she started her new job our sex frequency has dropped to probably about twice a week (usually once on her off days and once maybe during the week). Anytime I would attempt to initiate sex I would get the I'm tired response or something like that. It has caused a couple fights because she said my attitude changes after I get rejected, she says I sound sad, which maybe it does change. 

I brought up to her that it bothers me the frequency we have sex and has told me that she feels like I put too much emphasis on sex, feels like I always want sex and that turns her off. She said if I put less emphasis on sex and made it feel less forced (I guess me trying to kiss her and touch her while we are cuddling is forcing it?) we would probably have sex more often. That was two weeks ago, and I have no mentioned sex, I have not initiated kissing or touching her while we are cuddling and I have tracked how often we had sex in those 2 weeks and it is still twice a week.

She has also told me a reason for her not wanting sex recently is she doesn't want to spend 30 minutes having sex when she only has 4 or 5 hours of free time after work. That is really what has caused concern for me, because the job she got is an internship for what she is going to school for, her shift is going to be a standard 9-5 the rest of her life. That makes me nervous because I don't think I'm content in a relationship where I'm only having sex maybe on her days off.

Our relationship is good outside of this, shes really caring, I can tell she loves me and is just great overall. But I just cant help but think I'm fucked here. I don't feel like I should only be having sex twice a week at 23. I feel like it is only going to get worse. I have a high libido and usually end up jerking off after she goes to sleep, and that is kind of depressing.  

Am I heading for trouble? What should I do in this situation? Thank you anyone for help, I really appreciate it."

I was under the impression that they were offering summer positions as well but they are not.

I'm working at my current full-time job until May 2017 when I graduate and can really only take positions after that. I need to stay at the job I'm currently working since it offers flexibility, pays my current bills, and I can take a full courseload. I can't afford to take an internship or full-time next spring semester because then I won't be able to take my 15 credit hours and finish my undergrad with 150 hours.

It seems likely that the firm in question (smaller regional firm) was going to invite me for an on-campus interview since I connected well with the recruiter at the career fair, have been emailing with their HR director for about a year, and have spoken to their partner as well, and it's too late to withdraw the application.

This would be one of the top firms I would like to work for at some point, but obviously this position won't work out. What's the best way to word this with the firm? I feel like I've probably ruined my future chances with them.

I am currently a senior in an AASCB school with a 3.3 GPA about to graduate this coming May and just had some questions to ask. After getting my undergrad, I want to get my graduate degree so that I can sit down for my CPA exam in a year. The thing is I anticipate working after I finish my undergrad (Currently married and have a child) therefore I am mostly thinking about taking my graduate degree online. Do you think it might be possible for me to work full time and also be able to manage getting my graduate degree ? My other question was since my undergrad is from an AACSB school, does it matter if I choose a graduate school that isn't ? Will it ruin any job prospects with big 4 etc or affect me at all ?

On another note, I recently had on campus interviews for some internships and among those interviews was one with a big four. I am not sure how my big 4 interview went ( had 5 interviews overall with different firms) but the thing is they said they will let me know of a decision in the next 1-4 weeks. The thing is that I already have office visits from other firms this week and I really want the big 4 but I am worried that if I hold off the other offers and end up not getting a big 4 I might end up loosing all of them and graduate with zero accounting experience. I don't want to accept an offer then rescind it for a big four offer, what do you guys suggest I do ?

Would it also be possible to get an internship with a local firm or something and then apply to big 4 again ? I also got an offer from RSM, is it comparable to the big four ?

Thank you all for the advise I would really appreciate it."

Toward the end, I had my first full blown manic episode. I had to be hospitalized and put on Depakote, Risperdone, and Cogenten. Then I returned to law school, confident I would be able to tackle anything. After a couple of weeks, I could barely handle the stress and I cracked, threatening to harm myself. I was taken to the hospital nearby and I was hospitalized for a week.

I feel like a failure. It's a prestigious law school top and I felt like shit because of my grades, feeling suicidal. It's still hard for me to overcome that sense of failure even know.

We only saw each other a few times that summer to hang out, cuddle, watch movies together etc., and I originally had no intention of seeing or talking to him ever again once we both went back to school. For some reason, I felt a compatibility with him that I've never felt with anyone else despite only having a few encounters with him, but I went back to school assuming that I'd just forget about him after settling back into my routine. As you can imagine, that didn't happen, and the urge to see him again remained in the back of my mind as the school year passed. After a few months without us talking, I emailed him to see how he was doing. This started a long chain of emails and FB messages, in which I got to know him more and more, and that's when I realized I was possibly developing feelings for him. We agreed that if the opportunity arose, we'd try to see each other again.

Fast forward to the last few months of the school year. After securing a summer internship, I decided I'd spend a few weeks after my internship traveling through Europe. I contacted him, hoping we'd be able to meet up for a few hours if I happened to travel near his city. Well, he took it a step further, and offered to take a week off work to host me and show me around his city. We kept in touch regularly throughout the summer, until I finally went to visit him for a week in August. I had one of the best weeks of my life, and connected with him in a way that I've never connected with anyone. I got to meet his family, friends, visit his office, go sightseeing with him; it was amazing. We both shared things with each other that we hadn't shared with anyone before. I visited him with the intention of having fun with someone I shared a somewhat romantic friendship with (not sure if that makes sense?), but the more we talked and the more intimate moments we shared, the more I fell for him.

I was only there for a week, but leaving him at the end of my trip was absolutely devastating. I had about a week and a half of traveling left in beautiful cities, but I honestly had to force myself to get up everyday and go explore. It's been about a month since our last day together, and I'm back in the US for my final year of college, while he's finishing his PhD in his country. I can't stop thinking about him. We message every day and are planning on seeing each other again next summer, hopefully for a longer period of time, as I'll have 1 - 3 months to travel before starting my full time job. Neither of us have brought up starting a relationship with each other. He mentioned during one of our particularly long, deep conversations during my week there that he believes the Internet and apps make long distance relationships possible, but I'm still not sure whether he was trying to hint at something. We'll both have jobs with which we'll be able to afford traveling pretty much as often as we want bearing time constraints, and that would allow us to eventually relocate to a different city if need be. I'm not married to the idea of living in the US forever, and would move for someone I love.

I'm fine just talking to him regularly for now as I continue to get to know him, but I know that I can't just keep developing feelings for him indefinitely without letting him know eventually. Am I crazy to think that this could go anywhere? Dating around is not for me, and there's no one else I've met so far I'd want to pursue anything with.

I know that he has at least some affinity toward me; he wishes me good night every night, he checks up on me regularly, and asked to visit me or have me visit him next summer (which I've agreed to).

The thing is that I'm not comfortable with the idea of starting a relationship with someone who isn't committed to making it work in the long term. Obviously, most people don't go into relationships with the intention of breaking up. But from what I've seen, a lot of people, especially around my age, go into relationships just to have fun and to see what happens. That's not enough for me. I need it to be clear from the beginning that we'll both try our best to make it last and really work through the inevitable difficulties that would arise. I don't want to scare him away with that and end up losing the friendship as well. 

I know I'll probably  have to end up discussing it with him eventually before it's too late. I'm just not sure how long I should wait to bring it up without putting the friendship at risk. I still want him in my life one way or another.

**tl;dr**: I am falling for a guy I met in the US, but who lives in Europe. We get along really well and have great chemistry. I only want to start a relationship with him unless he can really commit to working hard at it, but I don't want to be too forward and scare him away. I want him in my life either way, and I am willing to wait for the right time. How long do I wait to bring this up, and how do it do it to still keep him as a friend should things not go as I want them too?

543bqs,6,2016-09-23,My NMom keeps forcing me to change my travel dates for my first big solo trip.,PolkaDottedBee,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/543bqs/my_nmom_keeps_forcing_me_to_change_my_travel/,"I'm [20F] going to Europe this winter. I took the chance and told my mom I wanted to go and she said okay only after I said that it wouldn't interfere with anything and I would be paying for this trip by myself.

But I work for her, so she's been using work and family to guilt me into shortening my trip numerous times.

The original plan was to leave middle of November and return middle of January (around 80 days) because I really wanted to experience Christmas markets around different cities and then NYE/Hogmanay in Scotland.

She's made me move it earlier so now I am leaving October 18th. After this initial change, I had to return by at least December 20th (around 60 days). Her reasoning was (in order of importance):

1. Because we own a nail salon, the busy time would be before Christmas and New Years so I have to come home earlier than planned to work. 

2. I would miss ""family time"" during the holidays. We are Asian. We don't even celebrate Christmas besides giving little gifts to my younger brothers (I haven't even received a gift from my mom for Christmas/birthday since I was under 10). Besides, we work every day of the holiday besides Christmas (and even then it's because no clients would show up, not because it's a holiday we really recognize). 

3. Traveling ""for so long"" is dangerous because she says I'm too stupid and naive to be able to handle myself. But of course right after that she'll say something like ""who do you think would help you if you get into an accident over there? Do you think I would hop onto a plane for you? Are you going to pay for that?"" Or (this is my favorite. I remember before Obamacare, we only ever had life insurance. Never medical insurance) ""okay fine, go travel for all I care. And when you die I can collect the insurance for it""

But NOW because she wants to go on a week long trip in the beginning of December (she decided this yesterday. don't even get me started on how this contradicts some of her arguing points) she is making me book tickets so that I return the beginning of December. This makes me miss the two major things I was most anticipating from this trip. When I approached her with flights for me returning December 3rd because it was the cheapest I could find, she got even more pissy and told me I need to be back by the end of November (she literally changed this in a matter of hours, this takes another week out of my travel time will add probably $200 more in plane tickets on top of much more I've had to add) because she wants me home before she wants to leave. She keeps repeating things like, ""you need to do this. You have to put some importance in me before you because I'm your mom/I've raised you. Where do you think you got your money? Do you think other kids are as lucky as you? I couldn't travel like this when I was your age, so you shouldn't either"" etc. Just because I work for her, she still thinks it's her money. But it's my time and my effort that is being used to pay for this trip. I can't even tell her that because it makes her go into more fits about how ""lucky"" I am to have a job that doesn't require burger flipping.

The only reason I agreed to coming back beginning of December was so that I would watch my younger brothers while she and her husband leave for the week. My mom was about to drag my 72yo grandma across the state for a babysitting gig (but decided it would be easier to drag me over the Atlantic) which is such a safety hazard. I didn't want something to happen so I bent over again.

I just don't know what to do. I've already used as much defiance and courage I could to even make her agree to letting me go on this trip. But if I continue to defy her she would probably combust. She keeps telling her friends and our relatives that I'm stupid for going on this trip alone, but that I'm old enough that she can't deny me permission to go. When we were having an argument about the travel dates, I said that I'm already paying extra to get the dates she wanted. But her response was that if I was doing what she wanted, I wouldn't be going at all.

Sigh.

I forgot to mention this: even though most of my time in Europe will besolo, a close friend is at internship in Germany that ends November 16th. We were going to travel together before her family arrives December 18th (one of the reasons why I had my original itinerary scheduled the way I did). I've been looking forward to seeing her after so long and going around Europe with her. After the first change in dates, it was okay. But now that my mom is telling me to come home so early, this cuts two weeks out of our plans. Now it's not only affecting me, but my friend as well because she would have to go solo until her family arrives. Because it's not her choice to go solo, I would feel guilty for putting her in that situation.

I'm starting to feel guilty for even wanting to go on this trip in the first place.

I just need some advice, honestly. And I needed to vent a little. I thought that going on this trip would help me build my confidence to eventually feel like I don't need to be under her control anymore, but she still has so much of it over me. There's a lot (a lot lot lot lot lot) more that goes into this situation, but I think I hit the big points to understand what's going on."
543glc,21,2016-09-23,Why aren't SLPs referencing the current literature?,dallassslp,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/543glc/why_arent_slps_referencing_the_current_literature/,"Probably going to offend some people here, but oh well. So I've been a practicing SLP for over a decade now. Not nearly as long as some of you here have, but not quite so meager a time either. I have worked in pretty much every setting and I find that the caliber of speech therapists I am encountering is far below my standards of ""acceptable"". Sure, I may just be a crotchety old bag with impossibly strict standards, but there may be some validity here too, I hope. Recently, I took on a gig as supervisor for a grad program in my area. I mentor graduate students, supervise beginning clinicians, help with internship placements, CFY interviews, the works. I also assist with staffing and hiring SLPs in the hospital I work at. We have had an open position for so long, it is ridiculous. And this is not to say that there aren't any applicants; we get a wholeeeee lotta applicants, sometimes within the hundreds for one position. Probably because of the large amount of grad programs pumping out students like candy, but that's another issue altogether. However, my colleagues and myself have not found any of them to be within our standards. Are they just teaching graduates poorly nowadays? A new program just opened up within our district that advertises a 1.5 year program including prerequisite CSD courses. How are these students even learning everything in this time frame? It seems absolutely insane to us. 

One of the questions I like to ask applicants during the prelim interview process is, what journal article did you most recently read, tell us about it, and tell us what you got from it. It is APPALLING how many SLPs come up blank. What's even more troubling is the fact that I find this to be a common occurrence. Over the years, I'll occasionally ask colleagues if they keep up with the literature and it always shocks me how they all casually laugh and say ""not since grad school!"", ""Oh, we're out of school now!"" I see a lot of newer therapists coming on here asking about the validity of their methods, how they feel ineffective, how SLP is a grey area and they feel as if they're not actually doing any good. But how many of them cite the research in their complaints?? How many of them keep up with current evidence? Because nearly everything I do can be backed by the current literature, and I make it a point to read at least 2 articles every week, ever since I graduated ages ago. This field as a whole already faces a lot of skepticism from other fields because 1, a lot of people (our own therapists included) seem to not know what it is that we truly do and 2, SLPs are giving out therapy without really understanding the underlying research behind it. 

Some of the therapists I used to work with have said that the new CFYs/externs appear so completely lost and have very, very mediocre knowledge about some core concepts in the field. Goals and objectives are written poorly, data collection is sloppy and disorganized... how can they go through grad school and come out on the other side without knowing how to master these things? In the program I now supervise at, every class is a seminar and participation is mandatory. We read a minimum of 2 articles per class, per week and you must come prepared to discuss as colleagues. On exams, it doesn't matter if you have the ""right answer""; if you cannot cite the research or rationalize your response, it is incorrect and you will get no points. Biased or not, I believe that my students come out on the other side much more capable than the vast majority of new SLPs I am seeing, who only seem to be able to somewhat recite things verbatim from memory, but do not truly understand it. Most of the sites in our district are now clamoring for our graduates, but I do not think this is because our students are exceptional; I think it's because other graduates are so disadvantaged when they leave. This has been a topic that's been bubbling up inside of me lately. We literally cannot find an adequately qualified candidate. I've done guest lectures at other graduate programs, and the students there seem like undergrad freshmen, not like someone who is a year away from treating real people. Some programs don't even have their kids read journal articles on a weekly basis. I just find this incredibly damaging to our field as a whole. Especially with these accelerated, prereq+grad-courses-in-2-years programs coming out, how can our students possibly master the concepts they need when they enter the working field? Am I being too harsh, or is anyone else troubled by the competence of these younger SLPs? 

The knowledge is out there. There is a wealth of research documenting the effectiveness of what we do, but so many clinicians seem unwilling to invest the time and effort it takes to look into this evidence. "
543iqc,0,2016-09-23,"End Workplace Violence, Harassment, And Discrimination: Help Me Help Others",cliffhanger486,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/543iqc/end_workplace_violence_harassment_and/,"My story is a complicated one. In 2007, I was diagnosed with some health issues that prevented me from working full time in most environments. My first plan was to apply for disability until my health improved. I was denied. As a result, I suffered great financial hardship and was a great burden to my family and friends, who I owe a great deal of gratitude as well as money. Along with the debts to them, I accumulated a great deal of medical bills which I have still been unable to pay. Since 2004 I have worked part time with teenagers at a drug prevention agency. Helping young people always has been and always will be my passion in life. I have worked as an antique dealer since 2011 as a means to supplement my income, and it has turned into a small business endeavor. In 2012, my health had recovered to the point where I was able to go back to work full time. I was hired by a human services agency (which I must refrain from naming due to ongoing legal proceedings). This agency hired me as a youth counselor for it's homeless shelter, which houses homeless and runaway teenagers up until the age of 17. This agency ""provides services"" to young people, and as youth counselors, we were on the front lines. We did everything. Intakes, paperwork, cooking, cleaning, supervising, helping with homework, running activities. We were basically substitute parents for these young people. We dealt with some of the worst trauma backgrounds you could possibly imagine, and most of us put our all into helpings these young people find a path to a better life. I would like to paint a rosy picture of this place, but it would be a fantasy. The truth is, this agency has victimized me and my fellow former employees, and has failed to live up to it's mission of providing the proper care for these young people who need it most. My time spent there has hollowed me out as a person and has jaded me to the world of human services. One would like to believe that in such a place, justice, acceptance, caring, and fair treatment / appreciation of employees in such a difficult position would be a given. Unfortunately, things couldn't be any farther from the truth. My yearly salary, as a college graduate with 8 years of field experience was $18,500 (which amounts to $8.89 / hour). I justified this salary, due to the fact that I was told that our agency didn't receive a lot of funding and that they couldn't afford to pay anymore. At this rate. I was making about $355 per week, before taxes, which came out to around $300 per week. It is easy to see how no one could live on such an income without great sacrifice. I was forced to keep my part time job and continue selling antiques just to keep myself afloat. In my mind, helping these young people made it all worthwhile... And then reality set in. On my first day of work, I was sexually harassed by an employee who was upset that I got hired for the position that she wanted. She touched me inappropriately and was incredibly vulgar. I tried to brush it off as some sort of new employee ""hazing"",  but I soon realized that wasn't the case. I was routinely harassed by this employee and was afraid to report it because I had just been hired and didn't want to make waves. She would call me at late hours and leave disturbing messages. She would hug me and touch me despite my protests and constant denials. Finally, the situation came to a head just days after I had torn a ligament in my knee while playing sports. I was on crutches and in a brace, and this woman assaulted me. She threw me over a chair in our administrative office, and laughed. I'd had enough. I reported this incident, along with the laundry list of other incidents that I had been subjected to by this woman. She had even gone as far as to come to work (on her day off) and bring me Valentine's Day ""gifts"" and stalk and harass my girlfriend who worked there. My executive director said she was shocked and said ""she needs to go""... I was relieved... And then the other shoe dropped. Not only was this person kept on the staff, she was PROMOTED to full-time. I couldn't understand. 3 days later, while still in a brace, I was assaulted by a female intern after reprimanding her for innappropriare behavior with the youth. She tackled me to the ground, lifted my legs over my head and said ""I'm gonna change you like a baby, bitch"". She did this in front of a resident and in front of another intern, who thankfully came to my aid. When I reported the incident to my direct supervisor (rather than my executive director who hasn't helped me in my previous experiences), he said ""Well, you know some of these interns like you. Maybe she was just trying to see if you were into that kind of stuff"". My head almost exploded. I didn't know what to do. Here I was, the victim of 2 assaults and constant harassment, and it was totally acceptable under this agency's standards. I am quite certain that if I was a female and the perpetrators were male, the response would have been drastically different. After the harassment continued and I had no recourse, I decided to give my notice of resignation, which was too be effective in 2 weeks. Because of my commitment to helping those young people and wanting my co-workers to be in a good position, I stayed on for over 2 months until a proper replacement was found. At this point, I took on the responsibility of caring for my sick grandmother, and oddly enough it was a great relief to me. My family was very supportive of me and helped me financially during this time. After a year, my grandmother passed and I had to move forward with finding work. It was at this point that I made the biggest mistake of my life. I heard that a case manager position was open at my previous job, and I thought that it would be a good opportunity for me to get back into the workforce. I figured since I would be working at the administrative offices instead of the shelter, I would be insulated from the previous harassment and that the culture would be different. I couldn't have been any more wrong. I was hired and took on my new position with a great deal of excitement and enthusiasm. I soon realized that the culture of harassment and mistreatment was just as bad, if not worse, than it was at our shelter. I was routinely targeted for bullying and harassment by my co-workers, who were of the mindset that if anyone challenged the status quo, they should be driven away. This agency provided such a poor level of service to these young people that it was sad and pathetic. Nothing about their mission was real. It was all a numbers game of clients ""served"" and getting funding. I did my best to thrive in my role and do the best I could for my own individual clients, but seeing other clients not receive adequate services was too much for me to keep quiet about. Finally, my supervisor called me and threatened me, calling me a ""pussy"" and a ""little bitch"". He threatened me and told me I didn't know who I was ""messing with"". I was actually afraid for my own safety, because this man is a convicted felon. He was a former police officer who got caught stealing money from suspects and not reporting the incidents as arrests, while keeping the money from undocumented ""raids"". He was finally caught when he and his fellow involved officers robbed an undercover informant. He was sentenced to 4 years in prison. He was hired by our agency when he got out. I have no idea how such a person is allowed to work with young people, much less be the supervisor of every case manager. Needless to say, I took the threats of this man very seriously, and I called my supervisor and told her that I was concerned and that something needed to be done about him. She laughed at me and told me that he wasn't going to be terminated. I told her that I was going to pursue legal action if I wasn't properly protected and the situation was him was not addressed. Not only was the situation not addressed, but I was suspended by this man the next day, and fired two days later. After consulting an attorney, I was informed that I was likely illegally terminated because of whistleblower protections. I was also told that my salary, along with that of many of my co-workers, was not within the legal limits of ""exempt"" status. This simply means that our salaries were so low that our agency was legally required to pay us for overtime and training, which they never did. Overtime and training were required and never paid. To sum this up, I am pursuing legal action against my former employer, and I cannot afford to do so. I need your help to make this right as best I can. I am pursuing this case not for the money, but for the young people who need the proper care, and for the few co-workers of mine who deserve to be supported by the administration and to be paid a fair salary for the difficult work that they do. I don't want to take this agency down, I just want it to change. I want to help make it what it could and should be, a place where the young people most in need can get the proper services. A place where employees and appreciated and applauded. A place where ""acceptance"" doesn't mean that assaults, harassment, and bullying of those who try to hold other accountable to help these needy young people are the standard practice. A great deal of the money that is given to our agency is funneled away from the children and the counselors and into the pockets of the administrators who have fancy fundraisers and events. They sell this idea of a wonderful place that helps people to line their own pockets. They have abused, neglected, and mistreated children. Due to the the sensitive nature of this case, I cannot go into further detail. I need your help. Every dollar counts, and will go to my legal expenses and my debts to all those who have helped me along the way. Thank you.

543kx8,27,2016-09-23,Please help me with rebuilding my life,Susan7,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/543kx8/please_help_me_with_rebuilding_my_life/,"Hello, I'm a 24 year old female. Please help me out.

My life seems to be a big mess. I'm diagnosed with clinical depression and I seem to be failing out of school, due to the depression. I don't take my meds  because I just don't believe that they make me feel better.

My parents are usually mad/not fine with my behaviour in general because when I was going through some serious bouts of depression, I spoke to them rudely and cursed at them. They usually take it to the extent of blaming me for some things I have not done and when anything goes wrong at home, I am the one who is usually blamed. We have no good relationship and we sometimes argue, most of the times we don't talk.

However, they pay my school fees at university and buy me medicine that I don't take. I usually hide the fact that I don't take my medicine from them.  They complain a lot about my hygiene, how I do my chores at home etc while sometimes I am just going through a depressive period and they just don't understand it's why I'm slacking on duties.

I feel that they usually pay my fees and buy my meds so that I heal quickly and finish school, so that I am out of their house, not because they want the best of me. They seem to want to get rid of me because they usually say that I am old enough to move out, especially once I finish my degree.

Due to this pressure, and sometimes being threatened to move out, I failed my exams in university, 3rd year. I am studying a 4 year actuarial science course. I am afraid of telling them because they will definitely be mad at me. I got depressed due to how mad they usually are at me and how bad our relationships are and was unable to study well for my exams. 

When I look at my options, without a degree, I will be unable to get a job, a real paying job. I don't know what to do about my life because my parents will definitely stop supporting me, probably throw me out and I will have no one to turn to. I am currently doing an internship, which is good, but to be confirmed for a permanent job, I need to have a degree, which I have failed. What do I do? It's why I don't tell them of my results.

As for friends or a boyfriend, I lost my friends when I got depressed because most of them didn't understand me sometimes when I snapped, or lost contact, once I started being depressed. They would think I had something against them yet I was struggling with my own issues. I only have 2 wonderful friends, but they can't support me or help me much in this situation because they are also young and live under their parent's support. How can I work towards becoming financially independent so as to support myself in this scenario?

Emotionally, I am usually stable though there are times when I get majorly depressed due to lacking an answer to solve my problems. To the point of being suicidal. Ever since I got depressed, people (family and friends) have left me out, ridiculed me, claimed I am pretending to be ill when I actually am and blamed me for what I haven't done. My life has gone on a downward spiral and I can't even see myself as positively as I used to. I end up spending a lot of time on my own and living alone, especially because my friends are usually busy working. I see that my death caused by myself would make no difference because I am not someone who matters in society. I can't focus in school and I am distracted because of this situation. My family just copes with me, not that they want me or enjoy being with me, they just live with me because they have to - because their is nowhere for me to go. They treat me as if I am a bum who doesn't want to move out and pay their own rent, food, electricity and act as if I am living off them to finish their money while I am genuinely struggling to do my best with my condition.

They only talk to me when needed not because they enjoy talking to me. How do I work out of this? When I apologize, or ask them to understand me, or ask to speak to them, they ignore me and tell me that apologies are not enough, I need to pass and move out and live on my own and be independent so that I am not a burden to them anymore. They don't care.

Definitely, staying on my own means that I don't get a chance to socialise and meet people so I am boyfriend-less. I broke up with my past boyfriend due to this depression... I was highly temperamental and snapped at him (i had my own issues) and he left me, just like that. I have been heart broken since and noone serious really tries to court me or get my attention, making my self esteem suffer. What do I do?"
543ofe,1,2016-09-23,archived stories,fullasian,PatheticStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatheticStories/comments/543ofe/archived_stories/,"""""This is a bit of a cathartic rant, so forgive me for incoherence, bad grammar, and lazy spelling.

Background on me. I am 27, pursuing a career change into the nutrition field. I'm finishing my second Bachelors in a few months and pursuing a dietetic internship. I have a non-asian boyfriend. I don't want to attend church with them. I play video games sometimes. lol

I never truly believed I had ""typical asian parents"". Not like, Tiger Mom style at least. I got some Bs growing up. I wasn't forced to play violin. I went to a small, private liberal arts college (not Harvard, boohoo!) I suck at math. Throughout, my parents were generally good parents.

I appreciate them. They clothed me, fed me, housed me, loves me (the best they could). I even have a pretty good relationship with my mom, with lots of heart to heart talks, and good laughs.

But I've been noticing more and more a kind of emotional abuse occurring. Sometimes, things are good. But then there will be a sudden explosion of discontent, disappointment, and anger directed toward me. Then an apology. Then another explosion. It's exhausting and feels abusive. They say awful things. My dad will scream at me, at the top of his lungs, telling me how he is ashamed that I am his daughter. That I am SO OLD (at 27). That my life thus far is worthless and without direction. That my exclusive boyfriend of two years only uses me for sex. (my mom echoes this sentiment). They demand that I break up with my bf to appease them. They don't like him purely on the fact that I spend so much time at his place and that he hasn't proposed. Premarital sex also makes me a ""whore"".

Obviously my mistake was to be living at home during this time. But as I pursued another degree it seemed like a good idea to save money, and I was also getting out of a bad breakup and needed some emotional support. That clearly backfired on me.

I am SO grateful that my parents took me back in after my messy breakup with my ex. I will always love them. But this constant yelling and namecalling and passive aggressive behavior is getting out of control.

Marriage is not on my radar. I love my non asian, non christian bf. We like having sex. We also do other things. I've developed so much as an individual because of him, and I have improved so much in my ability to communicate with people (that is, everyone except for my own parents).

God, I could go on and on and on, but this is getting out of control.

I will end with this. I'm preparing to move out asap, or hopefully move in with my boyfriend. I am really worried about finances but this is the only logical step for the future, as living at home like this is akin to living with emotional terrorists.

Reading through this sub actually made me really sad. There are so many miserable children, so many hurtful parents.
-----------------------

I'm a female first generation Chinese American - my parents were born and raised in China, I was raised partially in Singapore, and we moved to the US when I was 16. Through my adolescence I've felt a culture gap between my parents and me; I'm highly Western in thought but maintain core Asian values, while my parents still have a very traditional mindset. But because of my Chinese upbringing, I've continued to live with them since graduating college, choosing to sacrifice some freedoms out of filial piety for the physical comfort of home and free rent.

I hadn't dated anyone long term until last year. I'm notoriously picky and I've kept all dating activity a secret from my folks. Nearing 30, my own apparent lack of desperation only made them more so - they began to set me up with ""nice Chinese boys"" (most of them recent transplants from China) introduced by well-meaning family friends. Out of respect to the ""grownups"" I gave all of them a shot, to no success. Recently, my parents tried to set me up with another prospect, and I couldn't bear the weight of my secret any longer. I told them about the guy I'm seeing, who as far as they're concerned strikes out on all counts: white, under 6 feet, earns less than me (and I don't earn that much), and whose career trajectory is in flux. The world did not end as I'd feared: my dad was reasonable and even-tempered throughout, leading the conversation, accepting all this while trying to persuade me that I shouldn't put all my eggs in 1 basket. My mom was quiet, but I know her well enough to know she's unhappy about this. Not only does she have outdated beliefs on most things, she also has irrevocably bigoted misconceptions about white men. I knew this wasn't going to change after one big heart to heart with them. I agreed, again out of respect, and knowing realistically that some circumstances of my current SO are not ideal, to begin correspondence this new prospect, but strictly as friends. If after a period of organic interaction it turns out we have chemistry and I develop feelings for him, I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. That was our agreement.

Things were peaceful for 2 weeks. During this time I suspected my mom had just been ignoring what I told them. Then I had a fight with her that made it very clear that my current relationship and how serious I am about it is an unpleasant truth, and one more way I'm willfully defying their wishes. That I'm unable to see what's good for me, and do what they say because they just want the best for me, of course they know what that is, they're my parents. She is angry and frustrated with me, because she believes I'm making a huge, mindless mistake. I'm wasting my time, there's no future with this guy. That what I'd feared turned out to be true, that she wouldn't be happy for me in any remote way, breaks my heart. My dad on the other hand wants me to ""slow things down"" with my current SO, in order to be ""fair"" to the other guy. Even though I've stated in no unclear terms I'm approaching him as a platonic friend. Incredulous, I told him I couldn't see sense in it. My feelings for one person has no bearing on basic chemistry with another. My unwillingness to comply to what he thinks is a reasonable request visibly frustrates him, and that hurts too, because I'd believed at least my dad and I could see eye to eye.

All I want is the freedom to like who I like and continue to be with them. I don't want to have to answer to anyone else. I don't want any obligations toward my parents' well-meaning friends or the guys' parents. I've never felt so trapped in my parents' home and expectations until now. I can't stop thinking of how much I must be troubling and disappointing to them, and how much knowing that hurts me. I can't even really communicate all this to them, because while I'm fluent in Chinese, my thoughts and emotional transparency are so ""Western"" they're construed as melodrama or hypersensitivity in this culture, and is readily dismissed. I know moving out is the most obvious solution, but it's not immediately viable, and I don't want to believe that we can never meet halfway. Looking for some solidarity and advice.""""

I've been learning R since that's what I have experience with, that's the original advice I got from people in data consultancy.

However, a few people have advised me that Python is better and I should forget about R.

For someone starting out in Data Science with a decent theoretical understanding of statistics, machine learning and data modelling, what makes me more marketable for roles in banking or banking consultancy- R or Python?

EDIT: Should have included that my main theoretical interest is machine learning, and I've been looking into using R for that but a recruiter told me everyone uses Python."

5463fj,14,2016-09-23,"Got a massive bill from Vodafone for loads of data over 3 GB I really don't think I've used, taking steps now - any horror stories/smart consumer advice from ye?",NapoleonTroubadour,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/5463fj/got_a_massive_bill_from_vodafone_for_loads_of/,"Well it wouldn't be r/Ireland without a good whinge, but before I talk to Joe  (cue manic fiddle) I wanted to ask if anyone had previous experience with this.

So I signed up to a Vodafone RED Simply Plan last November for 12 months, paying €30 a month for unlimited texts and calls within Ireland and €3 GB free (the rest is charged extortionately enough IMO but more of that later.) I was a final year student at the time, just wanted bill pay to make sure I was never stuck for contacting people or cut off mid-call again. It wasn't a great experience (didn't have a job so I didn't set up direct debit, so they regularly would let the bill pile up over more than a month then randomly block the account so I couldn't pay online) and I was quite fed up and looked to switch to 48 by the end, so had my phone unlocked, SIM ordered.

By this time (late May/early June), I was preparing to go on the graduate visa to New York (you may say 'well then surely you can afford to pay any bill', but I'd been planning it for a while and it was a lot cheaper than doing a Masters immediately, while allowing me to intern at a genuinely great start-up to give me a leg-up I wouldn't otherwise have gotten), so I decided 'right, the account will be put on hold anyways after I miss a payment, so I'll leave it be and try to pay off the balance of the 12-month contract at some point during the summer.' The last payment I'd made was on April 22 for the bills up to April 9.

Fast forward to August, I get a letter to my Irish address saying that I suddenly owe them €758.23, the account is terminated and the methods of possible payment. I was fairly staggered and I wasn't sure how to approach it, so I decided to wait and see (foolishly, thinking it would be a mistake and the figure would be amended - I couldn't log in to Vodafone's online portal since my account had been terminated.) They sent another letter a couple of days ago saying it would be transferred to a collection agency soon, and I really can't afford a shitty credit rating when I'm just starting out my career. 

I analysed the bills and there's charges for having used 2 or 3 GB on some days between April 9 and June 9 (I left Ireland on June 10), one of which amounts to €72 euro (it averages about €24.15 or so for every GB used over the 3 GB/month limit included in the €30 monthly payment.) 

To make things worse, they add up the excess data charges and international calls/messages charges (I had to make a few short calls to the US when looking for apartments) and THEN charge VAT to this, which is more than a little sickening. They also have 'Charge' with a date listed on the summary invoices for each month, with no explanation what it might be for. I called their Customer Service international number this morning, and they said that while I could pay the €758.23 in instalments, I had to arrange this ASAP or they'd just transfer it to a collection agency. Honestly, I'm worried as it's putting pressure on my parents, who have already been so supportive through my degree and this internship, and they're already stretched finances-wise so I really want to minimise the cost of this as best I can, and any help or advice from any of ye would be just a massive help altogether.

TL;DR: Am I being shafted by Vodafone, if so do I complain to the NCA/ComReg or just try negotiate it myself, or just take my medicine and pay a massive bill in chunks?

Any and all help/advice/sympathetic gifs would be so much appreciated, thanks guys.

UPDATE: Thanks for all your advice, really appreciate it everyone! I called up Vodafone again and the guy this time claimed that while they sent me a text advising that my 3GB had been used up each time, he couldn't say what it was used up on subsequently but suggested 'well background apps refreshing' so he was somewhat taken aback with how I was persisting with it. I remained calm the whole time, reminding him that I was happy to work with them and that he was being very helpful and I appreciated it greatly (got his name as well so that helps for future records.) They never sent any alert or text whatsoever to say that I had used €50, €100 or anything in extra data charges so there was no alert or warning whatsoever (I know that this is what's to be expected but it still stings.) Making headway so I'll send an email with a summary of everything thus far and make sure to ask for a 'bill shock' as /u/zenova360 recommended, thanks a million everyone I'll keep you all posted and if it comes to talking to Joe then I'll be sure to give all of ye a shout-out!"

546te6,10,2016-09-23,"Me [27 M] with my fiancée [25 F] of 4 years, I missed all the warning signs of depression and unhappiness, and now she's running away to become happy with herself.",badbloodhound,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/546te6/me_27_m_with_my_fiancée_25_f_of_4_years_i_missed/,"My fiancée and I have been together for 4 years. We've had difficult parts of the relationship (who hasn't), but we've always come out stronger and she's the only person who's ever made me really want to work on myself. She helped me to identify a lot of my toxic behaviors (not in a nagging way, but in a really kind manner) and stuck around while I was working them out. Similarly, I've helped her to get through a lot of personal doubt issues she's had as well as demons from her childhood. We were always a team. That's why I proposed last year, and we were planning on a wedding next Spring.

About 1.5 years in to our relationship (2.5 years ago), I went through a really difficult time. My parents got divorced and for some reason it had a really profound effect on me. I thought that at 25 years old (at the time) I would have been more prepared to handle it, but I was not. I started believing that relationships were always temporary, and that long term relationships were a thing of the past. I tried on several occasions to break up with her — never for any particular reason, but because I ""felt like we had an expiration date"" (my shitty words). She consistently stayed strong and refused to leave my side without a real reason.

I continued my downward spiral, though. I started talking to other women about sex. I never did anything physical with any of them, and at the time, I thought that that was ""the line."" I did it because I had low self esteem and the sexual conversations boosted my ego. My fiancée (GF at the time) finally caught me one time and confronted me. I immediately owned up to what I had done, and told her that I didn't think there was any way our relationship could survive what I had done. I thought that was the final straw. Amazingly, though, she said she wanted to try to fix things. That was sort of a light bulb moment for me, and I realized we might actually have a chance. I learned about ""emotional cheating"" and realized that it can be just as bad as, if not worse than, physical cheating. I immediately cut off all contact with these other women — deleted them off Facebook, took their contact info out of my phone, etc. I started really focusing on our relationship and trying harder to make it work.

The progress was noticeable, as we were much happier than we had ever been. We started to get a lot stronger. We had ""unofficially"" moved in together a little earlier (my lease was up and she only had a few months left on hers, so I crashed at her place until we figured out what we were going to do next) so we decided to make it official and rent a house together. I got more involved with my church and met some couples who were clearly happily married after many decades, and so I started talking to them about how they made it work. That restored my faith in marriage. I proposed to my GF, and she said yes.

But then I started to notice little cracks. My fiancée had always been high achieving, but I noticed that she wasn't nearly as involved in things as she used to be. She wasn't performing as well in her job as she used to. We were both non-traditional college students, and while she used to have a 4.0, she was suddenly on academic probation. While cleaning the house one day I found a notebook for a success class that was mandated for all students on probation. She hadn't told me that she was in the class. I confronted her and she tearfully told me about how all of the things that she used to be good at were slipping away. I was supportive, and she told me that no one else had ever supported her before, not even her family. I told her that I was there for her and that she could talk to me about anything. I was extremely careful not to come across as judgmental, since that was what everyone else in her life had done. I have had a lot of big failures in my own life, so I reminded her that I had no room to judge.

Things seemed to get better from there. Two years went by. When the Army ordered me to deploy, I felt like we were at a place in our relationship where we could weather that storm and come out okay. We were both nervous about something bad happening to me, so I convinced her that we should get a courtroom marriage before I left just so that we each had some legal authority in case the other person got hurt or anything, and then we could have the big ceremony when I got home. We didn't tell our families because she was afraid her family would be upset if they found out that we got married without them, so we kept it a secret. We decided that, as far as anyone else was concerned, the ceremony next Spring would be ""the real deal.""

A couple months in to deployment things started getting weird with her. She was losing a lot of weight (and she was not overweight to begin with), calling in sick to work (something she would normally never do), and passed out while driving and ended up in the ER (they couldn't find any problems). Then one morning I got an unintelligible text message from her saying something about the hospital and a man's name. We have a mutual friend with that name who works in a hospital ER, so I called him and he told me that my fiancée had come in with an overdose. I immediately got emergency leave approved through my unit (which wouldn't have been approved if we hadn't been legally married) and was on a flight back home by the end of the day. She was admitted to a psych hospital where I visited her every day upon arriving home. She explained the whole situation and said that it was a medication mix-up rather than a suicide attempt, and I believed her. I still believe her. She had been seeing a therapist for a little while, who referred her to a psychiatrist, who had prescribed her a heavy cocktail of drugs to ""numb the pain"" that therapy was digging up from her childhood. After speaking with several other doctors, many have said that they intentionally don't prescribe those drugs together for the exact reason that they can very easily interact and result in an overdose if the person taking them isn't extremely careful. The psych hospital also believed her and discharged her a few days later. I had a few days left on my emergency leave, so we took an impromptu trip to the coast and it was amazing. It felt so healthy for both of us.

I went back overseas, but I had a 4-day pass coming up at the end of my deployment and we planned for to meet in a nice beach town in Europe. She seemed much healthier after that and we enjoyed planning our trip. As we got closer she said that she didn't want to fly across the world for 4 days just to fly right back, so she was looking at volunteer opportunities she could take up in the area in the weeks before we met. Seemed logical. She found something in Africa teaching English. While there she had poor reception so we didn't talk much, but I could tell that she was loving it. I was happy for her.

A couple days before we were supposed to meet up, she calls me and tells me that teaching in Africa has changed her life and that she doesn't know who she is anymore or what she wants. I asked her if she still wanted to marry me. She told me she didn't know. (Of course, there's an additional complication in that even though we haven't had the ceremony and aren't married yet in the eyes of our friends or family, we did get legally married so us splitting up would mean getting a legal divorce.) I got really upset and told her we'd have to finish the conversation later. I called her back the next day and we talked a little more. I started to understand that she had spent most of her life trying to keep unhealthy relationships going strong — with her parents, with her siblings, and with me before I had my epiphany ~2 years ago and started to really work on our relationship. I asked her if she still wanted to meet up in Europe for our planned trip, and she said of course.

When we met up things were a little weird at first. There wasn't the same connection as before; we didn't have the same closeness. I tried to give her space, and by the third day we ""clicked"" again and started to have a really good time. Things were more or less how they'd always been. After 4 short days I had to return, and she decided that she was going to return to Africa to spend a week sightseeing with the friends she'd made while volunteering. She did and then finally went back to the States. As soon as she got back, she kind of reverted back to before our trip, saying that she wasn't sure if she wanted to ever get married. She hadn't been living for herself and Africa helped her realize that. She wanted to travel and try to nail down just what exactly she needed to be happy with herself. I called her and we talked for 3 hours on the phone. I told her that I had done a 180 from the emotional place where I was 2 years ago, and that I was fully committed to her. She said she recognized that I had truly changed. But she said that she was disgusted by the type of person she was who would allow herself to be cheated on and not walk away, and went further to say that I shouldn't want to be with a person who allowed themselves to be treated like that. That was a punch in the gut because I realized that she was right, and because I'm still extremely ashamed of my actions back then. I told her that if she wanted to walk away I would respect her decision, but that I wasn't going to leave. I told her I was here for her and I supported her journey to find herself.

However, my commitment is really being tested. She called me a couple days later and said she found an internship in Europe that she really wanted to do. It is nine months long and starts right before I get home, which would mean there would be no gap between my deployment and her internship for us to see each other. It would be a total of almost two years with just two short visits mixed in, both of which have already come and gone. If we can have a couple months together before she leaves then I feel like we can work on a lot of these problems and strengthen our bond. But if she leaves before I get home, then I'm really terrified that we won't be able to recover from where we are now. I told her that we get free couples counseling through my insurance, but she said that she needs to work on herself before she can work on us.

Now here's my dilemma. I've weighed what I can see as the options. I can tell her I don't want her to go, but if I convince her to stay then she'll resent me and our relationship will be effectively finished. We might go on for a little while, but with that festering resentment, it'll be a ticking time bomb. I can walk away now, but I love her with all of my heart and I'm serious about the commitment I've made to never give up on us. **I want to tell her that we need to stick together, but I also recognize that I was terribly selfish in the beginning of our relationship when she was busting her ass to keep us together. I feel like at the very least I owe her the same when the roles are reversed. She loved me when I was very hard to love, and it made me a much better man than I was and helped me learn how to trust someone else deeply and fully. It's been a wonderful experience, and I thank God every day that she didn't walk out on me when she logically should have. So I feel like now it's my turn to fight for us when she is having doubt and questions like I was just a few years ago.** (I put that in bold because I feel like it really sums up my dilemma.)

So the only remaining option I see is to wait for her and hope she decides she wants to be with me when it's all said and done. A few years ago I would have called any guy who did that a sucker and advised them to move on. But the difference is that I've made a commitment to her and to our relationship — to never give up, no matter what. ""For better or for worse,"" as it were. Which, in my mind, means waiting as long as it takes. She told me that if I wanted to walk away, she ""would understand,"" but I told her that I would never walk away. I told her that I was okay with all the uncertainty of her traveling and finding her happiness, but that the only thing I needed to know for sure was that she still wanted to be with me when it was all said and done. She couldn't give me a straight answer aside from ""I still love you,"" ""I still care about you,"" and the like, so I told her to think about it and get back to me. That was two days ago, and I still haven't heard anything.

Am I doing the right thing by waiting for her? Has anyone been in a similar situation and pulled through?

  **tl;dr**: Fiancée and I had a rocky start to our relationship in which I didn't really value her and took her for granted. I had a light bulb moment ~two years ago and I've devoted myself to our relationship since then. Things seemed great from there. I had to deploy with the Army, and she started getting sick and acting funny shortly after I left. She overdosed and I flew home to be with her in the hospital. I had to return to finish out my deployment after she got better but we were doing pretty good. She took a trip to Africa to teach English, and ever since then she says that she realized she hasn't done any work on herself since before we met. Now she wants to postpone our wedding and travel abroad without me to find herself. She says she'll come back, but doesn't know when (she's thinking about an internship and then a master's degree, so possibly as much as 3 years). I'm serious about the commitment I made to her, but I don't know what to do. I was having a lot of doubt about the relationship a few years ago and it was 100% her hard work that got us through it while I was being selfish, so I feel like I owe it to her to fight when the roles are reversed."
546uzx,1,2016-09-23,My dad [47 M] has reneged on his promise to pay me [17M] for the work I've done at his office.,OfficePayProblems,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/546uzx/my_dad_47_m_has_reneged_on_his_promise_to_pay_me/,"At the end of the school last year, I expressed to my parents that I wanted to get a summer job and start building my resume.  My options were very limited since I was 17, especially in a healthcare space.  I'm very interested in healthcare, so I thought it'd be good to get a feel for it before I picked which colleges I applied to.  

My dad is a doctor, and offered me a position at his office.  He agreed to pay me what he normally pays office interns (15/hr).  I know this is a LOT of money, but he originally offered 20.  I lowered it because I felt that 20 an hour was way too much.  

I asked my dad if I needed to fill out any paperwork.  He said no, because I was underage so he'd just pay me under the table. 

Work actually started pretty well.  I learned very rapidly and totally immersed myself in what I was doing.  Eventually, my dad asked if I could use any spare time to work on his practice's website.  I'm pretty decent at web design, and the website needed a LOT of work, so I agreed.

One of the sections of the website is a ""before and after"" section.  My dad is a plastic surgeon.  He offers patients a discounted rate if they consent to having the images used.  However, any identifying factors (tattoos and jewelry - which my dad always forget to make his patients take off) had to be photoshopped out.  

At first, this was a fun game.  I love learning how to photoshop.

But eventually, my dad went crazy with it.  I was working upwards of 60 hours a week, at least 30 of them dedicated to the damn photoshop.  My dad's demands were insane; any free time I had at home, he literally yelled at me to add more pictures to the website. 

He then started asking me to start photoshopping post-op photos to ""hide the scars"" and ""make them look a little better.""  It was such a toxic work environment that I eventually asked if I could quit - I said that I didn't want to ruin our relationship over a job.  My dad said that if I quit, he would refuse to pay for my college and said I'd have to find a new place to live.  

So I continued to work.  Even now that school has started back up, he still expects my free time to be spent adding pictures to his website.

I kept track of all my hours worked, and my dad owes me a LOT of money.  At dinner the other day, I brought it up, saying something along the lines of ""Hey dad, I have that log of all my hours I worked if you want to go over it!  I'm opening a new bank account for the money, I don't expect it all at once or anything.""

without looking up, my dad responded ""Honestly, I'm paying for your college and you expect me to pay you?""

I'm furious.  I completely understand that I'm very lucky to have a dad that will pay for my college, but that wasn't part of the agreement.  None of my older siblings worked a day in their life before they went to college, and they all got to go on my dad's bill.  I'm pretty sure he still pays their rent, and they've been out of college for a while.  

I can't do anything to the website, especially since he's holding this threat against me, and he could very possibly kick me out of the house.  And I'm an idiot and didn't sign the contract. 

The kicker was that he still expects me to spend time working on his damn website.  Seriously, how many before and after photos could he possibly need?

My problem isnt with parents or family, most of family is actually pretty secular and borderline not muslims at all. I have members in my family who are clearly atheist or are just cultural muslim with really moderate practice of the religion. 

I come from Yugoslavia, born during the war, making me and my parents refugees. We fled to the Netherlands and stayed there. I have attended all of my school in this country and beside it went to religious class once in a week from an age of probably 6 or something. It was usual for me that i was the brightest kid in both schools and people thought i would probably make it far. 

I started learning the quran sripture from age of 11. My secondary education I did at the gymnasium in my town, which is an old one, the famous Dutch philosopher and humanist Erasmus studied there, ironically. I still remained muslim but i believed in the objectivity of science and actually thought the quran talks about evolution. Yet i believed man was gods creation, not evolved from a common ancestor. I generally enjoyed my education, i liked physics, math and technology related subjects. I also enjoyed history. Though i wasn't the best student, I eventually did graduate.

During my school years i wasnt really super religious, i would go to school parties, i would get drink and get drunk. My dad even noticed it once and told me the next day not to do it anymore. 

So it was all pretty cool when it came to parents. It was however my own consciousness that bothered me. I felt bad after a night out and would seek forgiveness from god on my bike driving my drunk ass home. How stupid. It was eventually when i was 18 i started to become more religious in the sense that i started to care about the religion and its rituals. I wanted to pray, read more quran, learn more about the religion etc. 

And thus started my journey. Most of my choices i made from then where choices with religion as my priority number one. What awful choices they were. I wanted to join the airforce as i always wanted to be a pilot. But the idea of killing (especially muslim) people put me off so i went for engineering. During university my religiosity increased but my academic performance was non existent. I avoided non muslims and didnt really make friends with them. I seeked out muslims to befriend, as it was easier and i had more in common with them, but it was also a religious thing to do.

Two years in to uni and i was failing, i eventually switched to some sort of community college doing civil engineering. This was much easier than uni and i seemed to make progress. It was towards the end of this year ( i was 21 then) that i sort of woke up from my slumber, it was then when my religion was eroding underneath me. I realized how stupid i was, how i missed great opportunities and I became depressed. 

It took a few months before the religiosity was really gone and i declared I was no muslim anymore. I fell in to depression and my academic performance took a dive again. Even though im in my final year of my study now, i never really recovered from this. All the coursework and assignements i did werent stellar. It was all scraping by, half assing. It was horrible. 

It was since beginning this year i started to have some really heavy anxiety and panic, as i was to start my internship at an engineering firm. I felt so inadequate and i was afraid i would get fired. It was then also when i decided to go see a psychologist and seek out help. I explained what i wrote here mostly. He had some provocative things to say, but i dont really know if it helped. I eventually concluded my internship and the guys there were generally positive about me. It felt good knowing they were positive and i didnt fuck up big time. I did learn something after all and the work was okay to do. 

I try to better my life now, i try to become fit and go to the gym, do jj and do running, while also attending college and working part time.

But despite all of it, i still feel in confident. I still feel as if im worthless, as if i will never make, as if the damage is already done. I still cant focus on my coursework properly, even though i sort of like it and find it interesting. 

I wish i could just stop worrying so much and that i could focus on my degree and the things i like. But i cant. I always worry much and anxiety keeps me distracted. I seem to always had a pessimistic view on life from a young age. Religion seemed to complement my view somehow because it focuses on that eternal life. I had moments of relief after prayer and it felt good. 

I dont know where to seek for that happiness and how to live life. Im just caught up in trying to keep my head above water in college. But my mood shifts daily and i lose hope so many times. It really sucks.

I usually dont like making these complain posts. We all are caught up in our own problems i am fully aware of that. I know there are plenty of people who are off worse with their situation at home, or people who barely have food or live in war torn countries. But that thought doesnt remove my problems. Thats a religious principle and it just suppresses your own feelings. 

I dont really know where i want to go with this. I appreciate if you have read it so far. Its just that these thoughts and feelings have been cramped up in me for a long time and i had to vent. I just wish to have some feeling of understanding, acceptance and of being good enough, which i cant seem to get out of my current environment."

Her green eyes fell to the lower compartment of the desk, her fingers grazed the steel lock, ""*48210*"" her mind echoed, as the compartment popped open.

Inside sat numerous folders, she carefully pulled out one near the bottom. Inside were pictures of the old Prime Minister, the President, and their families. When both of them had died within just days of eachother, both seemingly of natural causes the country went into practical chaos. With no unified leadership, an election would be held. The nationalists no longer had a strong firm hand on both the Executive and Legislative branches.

After sifting through the file for a few more minutes, the woman slammed it shut. Grabbing a lighter from nearby, she made her way to the most ventilated room in the Capital, which just so happened to be the bathroom. Kotryna stood at the sink for a moment, thinking over what she'd done. Since the founding of Uralic Confederation and her new found title of President, she had to destroy all her involvement in both former leaders deaths.

She lit the Manila folder alit, holding it in her hand for a few moments before tossing it into the sink. Flames of crimson licked at the folder, before consuming it. **""Loose ends are the assassins, I'll have to deal with them next..""**

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

547m9i,1,2016-09-23,Need advice on Summer 2017 Internship Programs,usckid2019,USC,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/547m9i/need_advice_on_summer_2017_internship_programs/,"Hi, I'm new to reddit. I'm a sophomore in college and was hoping to get some advice from my fellow college students or alumni. I've begun looking for internships abroad for next summer but was having a bit of trouble deciding which program I would choose. 

So far, I've gotten into three programs that promise to guarantee me a Business Development Internship abroad. I've applied to Global Experiences, Asia Internship Program, and Absolute Internship. They're all around the same price range and seem to offer the same benefits more or less. What differentiates them would most likely be where I would be interning. For Global Experiences, I would be working in Barcelona and get a chance to practice my Spanish. For the Asia Internship Program, I would be going to Hong Kong, Bangkok, or Singapore. And finally, Absolute Internship would place me in Hong Kong,

I'm a little split on which program I should go into. On one hand, going to Barcelona would help my Spanish skills and help me to develop my fluency in the language. On the other hand, I feel like the fast-paced (and perhaps more reputable) companies in Asia might be more beneficial in developing the business section of my resume.

I was hoping to hear from people who have either worked with one of these programs or interned abroad at some point in college. Is there anything you liked in particular about working abroad? How were the programs you worked with? I'd really appreciate any and all advice. Thank you in advance!

I left because at the time because I didn't want to take the time and work it out. We had just gotten married, had a kid, change careers, and had to move in with her parents. That all happen in a year. Before that we had been together for 6 years. And I felt like I was being pushed into doing things I didn't want to do and that I wasn't being heard. So when a college intern started giving me attention I thought that was what I wanted and took it. My wife found out and was willing to work thing out with me if I left her. But I didn't. 
I swore up and down that this girl and I were so much more compatible than me and my wife. My wife begged and pleaded with me to work things out that we were just have a rough patch and that everything is very fixable. But I didn't. She filed for divorce. 
I was with the other girl for 6 months. She went back to school and I went down to see her a few time. Then she just upped and dumped me. And I was very shocked because she talked about how she wanted to be with me and that we'd have fun and adventures and do so many things. Turned out I learned from other people later that this isn't the first time she has done this. 
So I tried just being on my own and dated other girls but I realized that I wanted to be with my wife and daughter. And when I went back and told her I was ready to work on it she wasn't willing anymore. 
Now 20 years later I'm alone and have a very bad relationship with my daughter and I wish more than anything I'd stayed and works on things. 
I'm not saying we would of been together if we had tried but I know she and I would of had a better relationship and been able to Co parent better if not her else.
Now I'm not say that everybody should stick around and try therapy and work on the relationship but if you have a good friendship and are comfortable and most of your problems are just communication issues you should try.
I've learned that new relationship feeling goes away and that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. I look back on that now and realized I was being selfish. 

TLTR: Divorce for 20 years and wish I would've stayed and worked on things."

Right now I'm waiting for bar results and if I passed, I'll be sworn in early November.

So once I'm legit does that mean I can immediately just go into court and represent clients on small time misdemeanors?  I have a few friends who said they know tons of people who could regularly use a lawyer for their dumb decisions and would push them my way.  I can use this word of mouth for advertising and maybe craigslist.  

I figure I could charge flat rates for things that usually end in a plea bargain, such as $250 for weed possession or $500 for a theft case, and maybe have a different payment schedule for additional appearances or trial. I already know the ins and outs of the municipal court system and have represented about 250 clients during my internships on just about every charge.

Do I need malpractice coverage or to incorporate or anything or is my plan pretty doable without having to go through all the expensive steps of setting up an actual law practice.

548fsr,0,2016-09-23,Random ramblings after a long week,erixmang,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/548fsr/random_ramblings_after_a_long_week/,"Its been a rough week. I spent the past few months mustering up the courage to go for a dream job. I'm under-qualified on paper because my GPA was pretty fucked up early on in college, and that snowballed into not getting internships, and resorting to shitty paying part time jobs during my summers. Still, I leveraged my connections and limited internship experience to get a leg through the door to start chatting with existing professionals in my field. I spent about two months working at this (networking, interview prepping), only to find out yesterday that the time had passed for me to get a position. I felt like everybody I spoke to, realistically told me I had a chance-- but two months later, I'm finding out that I don't. 

I had pretty much taken a hiatus from everything to try to get my life together for this job, and I didn't even have the chance for an interview... I guess that's just life sometimes-- and I have come to terms with accepting that. Doesn't make me feel any less shitty though. I guess one aspect that really bothers me is that I really feel underqualified sometimes. As if I'm not smart enough. I find that I have a hard time remembering, concentrating, comprehending, etc. And it leads me to some serious anxiety at times. When people mention test anxiety, I feel like I have it. Yet I got through college decently. I've done lots of reading about self-doubt and how to rid it from your life. And I've tried to read into why I can't focus (maybe because of excessive use of technology?). I've gotten into the habit of meditating for at least 20 minutes every morning. I've been getting exercise. However, something continues to feel so off... It carries into my social interactions. Where once I was very comfortable saying anything openly, or interacting with anybody, now I have anxiety and I overthink about every situation in my life. The anxiety silences me. How do I let go? The more I read about it, the more I think about ways in which to let go, instead of letting go... The more I think about what I'm saying, the more I panic... 

...How do I solve this problem? "
548mt6,2,2016-09-24,F4M A few fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/548mt6/f4m_a_few_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

I did my best for 1 am on a day i forgot my meds.. 

A little background, i got out of my first serious relationship in July.. We were together 10 months but friends for 2 years before that. We went through a lot of big life moments together over that time and now that shes gone i feel so empty and unwanted.. And to make matters worse, I'm the kind of person that wants a small tight group of friends, and my school friend group evaporated when i had to leave school for an internship.

Now my current situation is im back at school. No local friends that I actually consider close anymore, and trying to reconnect with old friends have fallen flat. I hate talking to people i don't know with a flaming passion, particularly random people with no mutual friends to me. Ergo, i don't make friends quickly. That's the bad. The good is i am trying my damnedest to make changes about myself that i like. I'm working on keeping up with my hair and developing a personal style. Trying to straighten my posture and tone my body a bit. Im pushing myself to talk to a girl if i think shes cute and to talk with confidence, and to trust my social instincts. No idea if its working or not overall, but I'm genuinely trying. 

The part where my meddlesome life comes in is that I've hit a wall in my progress. It feels like I've stalled out and i have no idea how to recover that momentum and go back to making progress. And it all stems from one thing: college is bullshit. In one semester, i am expected to... 

-go to 15 hours of classes a week

-spend a minimum of 15 hours on homework each week, which i usually surpass if not double. 

-pay the school $13k to be allowed to go to these classes

-participate in extracurriculars to learn new things and meet new people

-find internships and network with companies 

-develop myself, my ideals, and mature because im becoming and adult

-get money to pay for things i want to do

-put a roof over my head (which means more work or pay more to the school) 

-put food on the table (again, more work or pay more to the school) 

-be healthy

-go out to have memorable experiences and make stories to tell when you get old

-develop friendships

-build your personal life (relationships) 

-spend time with your family 

-manage the 500,000 other things that come with being an adult (bills, broken cars, medical crap) 

-sleep

And when you look at that list, and remember that sleep is only kind of optional and combined with eating leaves 105ish hours in a week.. You run out of time pretty fast. 35 hours in class work, 25 hours at work, 20 hours in getting in and out of bed+driving from place to place... Next thing i know im finding that i might have to make a decision that i cant handle making right now. 

Do I continue focusing on my career and throw my personal life in the garbage until i have more free time? Or do i keep trying to cram in time to find the one and have friends and be happy, even if it impacts how successful i could be? And i.... And cant make that call... Because the me of September is screwed. His life sucks. But if he makes the right choice, the me of October or November or of 2017 could be pretty damned happy. And i have no idea what the right choice is. 

I guess my reason for posting this is, what do you guys think? Do i have to make this choice? Or am I pulling a Janus and creating my own phantom doors to choose between? 

TL:dr-college sucks and it feels like i only have time for my career or my personal life. Do i have to choose, or is a middle ground possible somehow?"
549ir6,1,2016-09-24,US playwright Edward Albee: The character of his opposition to the status quo,ShaunaDorothy,AnythingGoesEve,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesEve/comments/549ir6/us_playwright_edward_albee_the_character_of_his/," By David Walsh
22 September 2016

Edward Albee, one of the most prominent figures in the postwar American theater, died at his home in Montauk, New York on September 16. He was 88 years old.

Albee is best remembered for works he wrote a half century ago or more, including The Zoo Story (1959), The Death of Bessie Smith (1960), The Sandbox (1960), The American Dream (1961), Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962) and A Delicate Balance (1966). Out of critical and popular favor for decades, Albee experienced a degree of renewed success with Three Tall Women (1991) and The Goat or Who is Sylvia? (2000). During his lengthy career, Albee won numerous awards, including three Pulitzer Prizes for Drama and two Tony Awards for Best Play.

Albee was an immensely gifted and articulate writer, with a genuine feeling for the rhythm of language and an obvious flair for the dramatic. His early works, including The Zoo Story, a one-act play, and, most especially, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a full-length work, made a strong impression on the public when they were first performed. In these works, and others of the time, Albee launched fierce attacks on middle-class complacency and hypocrisy, and the moral failure of American society.

The playwright described himself on many occasions as an enemy of the status quo. This was entirely to his credit. However, if Albee’s conception of this enmity remained quite limited, as we shall discuss, this was bound up with the social-cultural environment in which he matured in Cold War America and the milieu in which he circulated.

Albee’s family background is a singular one. He was born in Washington, DC in March, 1928 to a woman who could not support a child. The father had “deserted and abandoned both the mother and child,” according to the subsequent adoption papers. When he was 18 days old, the child was adopted by Reed A. Albee and Frances C. Albee, a wealthy, childless couple. Reed Albee’s money came from his father, the head of the Keith-Albee chain of vaudeville theaters. The Albees lived in luxury in Larchmont, New York on the Long Island Sound.

The writer later claimed that he always felt like an interloper in the household. “They bought me. They paid $133.30”—i.e., the cost of the adoption services. His “outsider” status in his own family and his discovery of his homosexuality at an early age no doubt helped distance Albee from the American mainstream. He had a difficult time in school, being expelled or dismissed from several high schools and colleges. He left home for good in his late teens. Toward the end of his life, Albee told an interviewer he had been “thrown out” of the family home because he refused to become the “corporate thug” his parents desired him to be.

During the 1950s, Albee lived in Greenwich Village in New York City and worked at numerous odd jobs. He also received money from a trust fund. He wrote poems, plays and novels that were not published.

Albee wrote The Zoo Story in three weeks in 1958. It was first performed in West Berlin in 1959 on a double bill with Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape.

The short play takes place in Central Park in New York. There are two characters. Peter, a middle-aged man, an executive with a small publishing house, who “wears tweeds, smokes a pipe, carries horn-rimmed glasses.” We eventually learn that he has a wife, two daughters, two cats and two parakeets, the perfect, contented American family. Peter is peacefully reading his newspaper on a park bench on a Sunday afternoon when Jerry enters into conversation with him. The latter is younger, poorer and suffering, according to Albee’s description, from “great weariness.”

The conversation begins innocently, if oddly, enough, with Jerry’s now-famous line: “I’ve been to the zoo. (PETER doesn’t notice) I said, I’ve been to the zoo. MISTER, I’VE BEEN TO THE ZOO!” Peter responds politely enough, but Jerry becomes more and more intrusive, asking personal questions and revealing the character of his own lonely existence. When Peter has had enough and tries to leave, Jerry becomes aggressive and pulls out a knife. He drops it and tells Peter, “There you go. Pick it up.” The other man does so and Jerry eventually impales himself on the blade. In his final, dying words, he thanks Peter.

Something about the coldness and isolation, and inequality, of modern urban life emerges. Jerry lives in a rooming house, with a “few clothes, a hot plate that I’m not supposed to have, a can opener.” His neighbors are the marginalized. His closest relationship, aside from those with prostitutes, is with his landlady’s dog, about whom he speaks in a lengthy monologue.

Years later, Albee would explain, “Jerry is a man who has not closed down, … who during the course of the play is trying to persuade Peter that closing down is dangerous and that life for all its problems, all of its miseries, is worth participating in, absolutely fully.”

Albee was attacked for his play in establishment circles. On the floor of the US Senate, Prescott Bush (father and grandfather of two US presidents) denounced The Zoo Story as “filthy.”

The influence of Beckett, Eugene Ionesco and the “theater of the absurd” is evident in The Zoo Story, which is to say, Albee was under the influence of some of the same social and intellectual tendencies as those writers. British playwright Harold Pinter, born in 1930, was an almost exact contemporary. Pinter’s first play, The Room, was written and performed in 1957.

The intellectuals of the time, or the more sensitive ones, were appalled by contemporary society, by the giant corporations and institutions that had emerged in the aftermath of World War II, by the Cold War, by the threat of nuclear destruction, by the officially sponsored conformism and pursuit of material wealth.

On the other hand, for the most part they saw no way out of the situation. Stalinism and its crimes, widely identified with communism and socialism, seemed to many to have closed off the possibility of revolutionary change. The various counterrevolutionary “labor” bureaucracies suppressed the working class politically. Existentialism and other forms of irrationalism suggested that the human condition was absurd, but that one had to endure and find some meaning in what was perhaps a meaningless existence. Abstract expressionism in painting and the “Beat” movement emerged from these general ideological conditions.

In The Death of Bessie Smith Albee paid oblique tribute to the civil rights movement and the suffering of African Americans. The short play takes place in Memphis, Tennessee in 1937, in a hospital. An overworked white nurse, a white intern and a black orderly feature prominently. The premise of the play is that Bessie Smith, the great blues singer (who never appears in the play), dies following a car crash because she is refused admittance to a whites-only hospital. This was generally believed at the time. In fact, Smith was taken directly to a hospital in Clarksdale, Mississippi where she died seven hours after the accident. But Albee’s play concerns itself with race and class relations in America, and retains much of its power. The character of the Nurse stands out in particular.

Albee reserved much of his venom for the American upper-middle-class, nuclear family. In The American Dream, an absurdist satire, the central characters are Mommy, Daddy and Grandma. The couple, we discover, had once adopted a son. Unhappy with it, they mutilated the child and ultimately killed it. As Grandma, a sympathetic character, explains, “Well, for the last straw, it finally up and died; and you can imagine how that made them feel, their having paid for it and all. … They wanted satisfaction; they wanted their money back.”

A Young Man shows up, whom Grandma names “The American Dream,” who turns out to be the original boy’s twin. The old woman moves out and the psychologically damaged Young Man moves in. He will take the place of the original adopted child. The dialogue consists largely of a series of clichés and banalities. In typical Albee fashion, a well-to-do family conceals all the brutal realities.

Albee later asserted that the play “is an examination of the American Scene, an attack on the substitution of artificial for real values in our society, a condemnation of complacency, cruelty, emasculation, and vacuity; it is a stand against the fiction that everything in this slipping land of ours is peachy-keen. Is the play offensive? I certainly hope so.”

The work for which Albee is best known, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (made into a film with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, released in 1966), opened in October 1962, only a few days before the eruption of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the confrontation between the US and the USSR over the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba. The often intangible and even unnamable psychological menace and paranoia generated by the threat of nuclear annihilation are woven into Albee’s early plays, as they are in many writers’ and filmmakers’ work of the time.

In its framework and episodes, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (borrowed from a bit of “intellectual’s” graffiti found on a wall) is more naturalistic than Albee’s previous efforts. George is a middle-aged associate professor of history at a small New England College; his wife, Martha, six years his senior, is the daughter of the college president. They return home late at night after a party, where they have already had a good deal to drink. Two guests arrive, a younger couple: Nick, a biology professor, and his wife, Honey.

For the rest of the night, George and Martha engage in furious, non-stop and occasionally amusing abuse of one another in front of the younger pair. Martha relentlessly taunts George and humiliates him. She dismisses her husband as “a FLOP! A great … big … fat FLOP!” In response, George breaks a bottle and holds the remains, like a weapon. Martha remarks, “I hope that was an empty bottle, George. You don’t want to waste good liquor … not on your salary.” It goes on like this.

At one point he pretends to shoot her. “GEORGE: Did you really think I was going to kill you, Martha? MARTHA (Dripping with contempt): You? … Kill me? … That’s a laugh. GEORGE: Well, now, I might … some day.”

The hosts play various vicious games, some on each other, some on their guests. When one of his games turns cruel, George explains calmly, “I hate hypocrisy.” George and Martha also claim to have a son, who is coming home that day. In the end, it turns out that they have no child and the fantasy that they do is one of the great lies sustaining their lives and marriage.

The play, above all, suggests America’s decline into something miserable, sick and full of self-deception. Again, the fear and selfishness under the surface of middle class existence come out, along with that social layer’s hypocrisy and servility. Success and stature, the jockeying for position, on this wretched, unimportant little campus absorb much of the time and thought of all four characters. Whatever was promising about America and the American Dream (and George and Martha, of course, are the names of the first president of the US and his wife) has somehow come down to this: stupid, petty and sterile infighting, an endless drunken, malicious quarrel in the middle of the night. All this expenditure of energy … for what?

The characters are not so much hateful, as pitiful. Toward the end of the play, Martha laments, “I do not wish to be happy, and yes I do wish to be happy. George and Martha, sad, sad, sad.”

In A Delicate Balance, a well-to-do couple, Agnes and Tobias live with Agnes’s alcoholic sister, Claire. Their daughter Julia is expected to arrive home soon, fleeing her fourth unsuccessful marriage. Friends of Agnes and Tobias’s, Harry and Edna, arrive and ask if they can stay. A terrible, intangible fear has overtaken them.

What to do with Harry and Edna, whether to ask them to leave or accept them and accept responsibility for them in their plight, becomes a central question in the play. The strongest element of A Delicate Balance, once again, is the contrast between the well-established rules of conduct of these polite, educated people and the painful, contradictory realities of life.

Albee wrote many other plays, including adaptations of works by Carson McCullers (The Ballad of the Sad Café) and Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita), but these early works contain the most compelling expression of his artistic ideas and social concerns.

Albee insisted until the end of his life that he was an enemy of existing conditions. In his introduction to Box and Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (1968), Albee argued that one of the chief obligations of the playwright was to “try to alter his society,” since, as he explained, “very few serious plays are written to glorify the status quo.” In an interview in 2009, he told a journalist, along the same lines, that “A play should be an act of aggression against the status quo.”

Nor did Albee have much use for fashionable and marketable “identity politics.” Defending his decision to write about a host of characters, he told an interviewer, fellow playwright Craig Lucas, in 1992, “After all, there are a number of things we have not been, you and I. We’ve not been women, we’ve not been 80 years old, we’ve not been black. A lot of things we haven’t been. But its our responsibility to be able to be them, isn’t it?”

Albee attracted criticism for rejecting the term “gay writer.” In a May 2011 speech, he commented, “A writer who happens to be gay or lesbian must be able to transcend self. I am not a gay writer. I am a writer who happens to be gay. … Any definition which limits us is deplorable.” After his comments were attacked, he told National Public Radio, “Maybe I’m being a little troublesome about this, but so many writers who are gay are expected to behave like gay writers and I find that is such a limitation and such a prejudicial thing that I fight against it whenever I can.”

Albee’s criticism of the “status quo” could be quite fierce. He was quoted in 1980 as saying, “I think television is the destruction of the United States. I mean, that and the Republican Party … And the Democratic Party, for that matter, come to think of it.”

In Everything in the Garden (1967), Albee’s American adaptation of a black comedy by British playwright Giles Cooper, a group of respectable suburban housewives turn to prostitution en masse (although unbeknownst to one another) to supplement their husbands’ incomes. When one of the wives is caught out, she turns on her husband and decries the corrupt, even criminal manner in which each of the men earns a living. She sums it up: “You all stink, you’re all killers and whores.”

Albee’s sincerity was unquestionable. However, when the playwright spoke of opposition to the status quo, he meant primarily the moral, sexual and psychological status quo. To many intellectuals and artists in the US, and this view was encouraged by the various academic left tendencies (the Frankfurt School and so forth), capitalism had resolved its economic contradictions. What remained were the problems of alienation, aloneness, conformism and sexual repression.

Continuing to engage exclusively with these issues and ignoring the explosive questions that emerged in the 1970s and beyond, including the growing impoverishment of masses of Americans and the overall economic-cultural decline of the US, meant that Albee’s work failed to treat much of what was new and challenging, and urgently in need of artistic description, in American life.

Many of Albee’s later plays, and even some of the early ones, are not strong or convincing. Plays like Tiny Alice (1964), Malcolm (1966), Seascape (1975), Counting the Ways (1976), The Man Who Had Three Arms (1982) and others are not particularly engaging. The self-conscious “absurdism” often wears thin. There is a great deal of repetition, between and even within plays. The ideas are often murky and secondary, or commonplace.

Albee was at war with hostile critics for many years, and the critics were often obtuse, but the lack of success of many of his plays with the general public was not principally due to the reviewers’ shortcomings. He wrote numerous tedious and almost pointless plays. He seemed to have run out of important things to say at a relatively young age.

Albee returned time and time again to his early family relations. The ineffectual, “castrated” father, the domineering mother, the victimized son … There are only so many times one can cover the same ground. Did Albee have a childhood that was so excruciating, or that was of such world-historical significance that it needed to be treated over and over again, from different angles, during the course of 40 years?

No, that is not the case. It is rather that there are social and political conditions in which the artist’s individual psychological problems and traumas take on “world-historical” importance to him or her. There are periods when one’s family life dominates, when what one’s mother and father did or didn’t do years ago continues to be a central obsession in later life. This was the type of historical period in which Albee matured, when the class struggle apparently receded into the background.

Albee was no Henrik Ibsen, the Norwegian playwright, but some of the comments that Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov made on the subject of Ibsen in a 1908 essay (“Ibsen, Petty Bourgeois Revolutionist”) seem appropriate. Plekhanov noted that at the time when “Ibsen’s opinions and ideals were being formulated, a working class, in the present sense of the term, had not yet developed … and was, therefore, nowhere evident in public life.” This encouraged in Ibsen, “individual protests against the hypocrisy and vulgarity which surrounds him.” His was “the revolt of the modern spirit.”

Plekhanov goes on, “Now if a man teaches revolt simply because it is revolt, not knowing himself to what end it should lead, then his teaching will take on a rather nebulous character. If he is an artist, and thinks in terms of images and forms, then the vagueness of his thinking will necessarily result in vague artistic images. An abstract and schematic element will creep into his creative work. … The ‘revolution of the spirit of man’ leaves everything unchanged. The pregnant mountain has again given birth to a tiny mouse.”

Unhappily, for much of his later career, as a result of the nebulousness of his ideas and the formlessness of his opposition to the status quo, Albee gave birth to nothing but “tiny mice.”

Robert Brustein, the distinguished critic, producer and academic, once referred to Albee “as one who sympathized profoundly with the oppressed of the world.” One has no reason to doubt this, but it is not distinctly and sharply present in his work or public utterances. It is worth noting that in Mel Gussow’s biography, Edward Albee: A Singular Journey (1999), there is a single reference to the Vietnam War in the index. According to an August 1968 New York Times article, Albee did lend his name as a sponsor of the anti-war “Summer of Support,” aimed at US servicemen, along with Pete Seeger, Dustin Hoffman, Phil Ochs and others.

Overall, however, as one commentator notes, Albee’s plays in the 1970s spoke to “personal” rather than “social” disillusionment.

One has to look to the general features of Albee’s time, the postwar economic expansion and the Cold War, for the conditions that shaped his thinking. He traveled to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and certainly distinguished himself from the extreme right confrontationists, but his comments on the USSR do not rise above the level of garden variety anticommunist liberalism. His facile use of selections from Mao’s “Little Red Book” in Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, either wooden truisms or Stalinist falsifications, gives some sense of his attitude toward what he took to be “Marxism” and “revolutionary theory.”

The “abstract and schematic element” in Albee’s work also manifests itself in the ahistorical character of his plays, and the often nameless characters: Mommy and Daddy, Young Man and Grandma, He and She, A B and C. He once told an interviewer, “Most of my plays are not tied to time, particularly.” He didn’t care for having the phrase “timeless” applied to his work, he explained, “but I don’t think they [the plays] are beholden to specific dates.”

Unfortunately, there is nothing that becomes dated more rapidly than the “dateless.” Abstract psychological characterizations and speculations and, frankly, the obsession with oneself do not generally lead to the most rewarding, enriching art. “We all wish to devour ourselves, enter ourselves, be the subject and object all at once,” asserts a character in Albee’s Listening (1976). But the artist seriously attuned to the world and life has more compelling things to do.

Albee’s great strength lay in his ability to represent his upper-middle-class figures, to reveal their inner lives. He helped demystify and discredit the affluent layers who thought themselves fully in control. Moreover, his rejection of corruption and cowardice, his insistence on unpleasant truths about American society in the late 1950s and early 1960s unquestionably contributed to the mood of radicalism and opposition that emerged later in the decade.

To paraphrase Plekhanov, drab, postwar American reality showed Albee what had to be opposed, but it could not by itself show him which road to pursue.

I'm wondering if someone could tell me my chances of getting accepted into the following schools: William and Mary, University of Virginia, and George Mason University. I would be very appreciative if someone could tell me their thoughts.

Academics:
- Full IB Diploma Program Student
- 4.25 GPA
- Top 7.5% of the class
- Mostly IB classes, though I took ""three"" AP classes (I dropped one due to a change of interest)
- IB Chem. (HL), IB Math Studies (SL), IB History (HL), IB Language and Literature (HL), IB Spanish (SL), IB Anthropology (SL), AP Comp. Govt, AP European History, AP Computer Science (the one I dropped), Theory of Knowledge

Tests:
-1240 on the ""New"" SAT - I am currently preparing for the next one
- 26 on the ACT
- 710 on the World History SAT, though I'm not sure if the score is good enough to justify me sending it

Extracurriculars:
- Archeological internship program at George Washington's boyhood home: 11th, 12th
- I design and build computers: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th
- I do international-style power-lifting and bodybuilding: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th 
- HTML programming / Website design: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th
- FBLA: 12th (I probably won't put this on applications due to the short amount of time that I have participated in it)
- My parents' work schedules don't allow me to stay after school for any extracurriculars (the internship required a LOT of maneuvering)

Extras:
- Resident of Virginia
- I am applying for Early Decision / Action for all of them
- Counselor is able to write a very positive recommendation
- Interest in History and Government

Unknown:
- Admittedly, I received a minor (that is how the counselor will say it) 5-day (Junior Year) suspension for disrespecting a teacher after I received a bad grade in 11th grade; thankfully, the principal has generously agreed to write a letter stating that it shouldn't be a deciding factor in admissions

William and Mary is my first choice, and I have thought about doing a fall interview (it's not too late). Again, some feedback and tips would be most appreciated - this process has been nerve-wrecking.

EDIT: I have signed up for the on-campus interview. Wish me luck."

I'm about to graduate from a Boston area school and I'm currently interviewing for full time sales roles (SDR/BDR). I have been a top performer in my summer sales internship with a large software company in the area, so I know what the environment is like and it really excites me. 


That being said, where do you think I should go to create the best sales foundation for myself?


I'm considering large firms with established programs and also high growth mid stage startups. 


I'm concerned large companies may stagnate my growth potential as I'll be surrounded by many low performers and have less opportunity for promotion. However, the idea of a formal sales training program sounds important as a new grad. What are your thoughts here?


As for high growth mid stage companies (~100M/yr in sales, 250-750 employees), I think it's a great opportunity to ""hit the ground running"" and have a lot more autonomy. Although I'm concerned they might be overhyping any training they claim to provide and have a ""burn and churn"" mentality (I do not see ""burn and churn"" at the current place I'm at). I realize this is highly variable on the company. 


To top this all off, I'd like to get out of Boston and move West, specifically Bay Area or Silicon Valley. 


I'm open to your suggestions, thank you very much in advance



TL;DR: large co or high growth startup for college grad trying to maximize long term growth potential in sales? Preferably in CA. "
54b4ir,4,2016-09-24,A Light of Hope...,SIRmisterD,mag,https://www.reddit.com/r/mag/comments/54b4ir/a_light_of_hope/,"Good afternoon everyone.

I'd like to start out with talking about my background in MAG. I first found out about MAG a couple months before release from a GameStop ad in 2009. After researching the game I was so stoked for it that I begged my parents to allow me to go to the midnight release, and sure enough, it was my first ever midnight release. It's important to note that at this time, I was a month out from turning 10, and I am now 16. The next day after release was probably one of the best days for me, playing MAG all day and just enjoying a very unique game at the time. During its lifetime this was my favorite and only game I tended to play. When the time came for Sony to finally put the game to rest, it was extremely heart-breaking. However, that day wasn't only negative as it also demonstrated how well the entire community could rally together and enjoy the game one last time.

With that being said, for the past few months I have had an insane urge to play this game again even though it's not possible. Over the summer I was fortunate enough to learn and use a program known as Unity3D for a summer internship job.

Now you may be wondering a couple of things: what is the point of telling me this, or how is Unity3D relevant to MAG? Well over this past week I realized, why not try to replicate MAG using Unity3D? I am here today to broadcast this idea to what is left of the MAG community, and hopefully have it turn into a great game in the end.

The game will begin as a PC game, and I hope to bring it to consoles one day. Once I am able to get the game to a playable state (even if the visuals aren't there yet) I will probably open the game to a select few individuals who will be able to test the game just for core mechanics. The select group will be made up of only 20 people (including myself) due to server restrictions. The first game mode that will be implemented will be the good ol' 64 (or 20 during testing) player Sabotage. This brings me into my next point - servers. Unfortunately, because I am not a AAA company I cannot afford to host the game servers myself especially for a game of this magnitude. The reason for such a small testing group is because the server hosting service I will be using has a maximum of 20 people playing simultaneously for the service to remain free. At this point in time, you can expect this game to be a paid and/or subscription game. I am unsure of the exact cost(s) right now, but once the time gets closer I will run some numbers based on the interest of the game and go from there. The ONLY reason for why I will be charging for the game is because of the server costs.

Now that you know what the vision is, I'd like to share how you can be involved even if you don't have a tech background.

* If you would like to voice your opinion on features, changes, wishes, pretty much anything, then please go to [this Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/zc7BNTnE) and make your post(s) under **""Ideas and Any Opinions.""** Please only post under this section as the rest of the sections will be managed by me (just to keep things organized).
* If you are someone who has a tech background, specifically experience with using Unity3D, and you would like to help out then please message me (we will discuss further information directly).
* If you are someone who does artwork, 3D modeling, or any graphics of any kind, and you would like to help out then please contact me (we will discuss further information directly). You don't necessarily need to know Unity3D either.
* If you are someone who has experience with any music/sound design and you would like to help out then please contact me. The game will need background music, and various sound effects. You also don't necessarily need to know Unity3D.
* If you would like to just be involved in discussion and be kept up to date on progress, then feel free to join the Slack Channel. Create a Slack account, sign into a new team, enter the domain: ""mag-remake.slack.com"", and the password is ""magremakeslack"".
* If you have any further questions about any area, then feel free to contact me.

There it is, a long shot of a goal, but one that will be incredibly rewarding in the end if it reaches that point. I also would like to mention that this will definitely not be fully polished and ready to go in a couple of months. As of right now I am the only one working on this with so many aspects of the game to cover. On top of that I do have other responsibilities such as school, life, and everything that comes with those.

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading. If you have any questions at all, leave a comment below, message me, or join the slack channel!

As always... Just remember to ""improvise, adapt, overcome"" because ""you fight with the best now."" #Valor

**TL;DR:** I am planning on making a remake of MAG using Unity3D. Here is a shortlist of everything you should know if you're interested:

* The remake will start out on PC.
* At some point there will be 19 selected individuals who will be able to test the game just for core mechanics.
* The first game mode that will be implemented will be Sabotage.
* You can expect the game to be paid and/or a subscription based to cover the server costs.

If you'd like to help out, then there are a few options:

* Be kept up to date and discuss the progression of the game using Slack. **Team's Domain:** ""mag-remake.slack.com"" and the **Password:** ""magremakeslack""
* Voice your opinion for features, changes, wishes, thoughts, etc. using the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/zc7BNTnE) I created. Please only post under the section **""Ideas and Any Opinions""** as the rest of the sections will be managed by me (just to keep things organized).
* If you create any sort of artwork, 3D models, or graphics and you would like to help with the project then please contact me.
* If you create music/sound and you would like to help with the project then please contact me.

54bd8f,6,2016-09-24,Demon Rehabilitation - Part 21,AlinaKG,AlinaKG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlinaKG/comments/54bd8f/demon_rehabilitation_part_21/,"The light hurt my eyes. I woke up disorientated, expecting to be in my bedroom. The pillow below my head was hard and smelled of disinfectant and florals. I attempted to retrace my steps but a hot pain spread through my head as I tried to think.
 
Figures stood nearby, talking in muffed voices. My eyes had been too blurry to make out their faces.
 
What time is it? I thought, scared that I had overslept for work. My manager had just about enough of me already. I had never worked as a waitress before and messed up far too much to have had the three years of experience that I told him I had. Being late, on top of that, was just asking to be fire.
 
My tongue felt dry. “Hello,” I said.  A dull ache flickered in my jaw as I opened my mouth to speak. Memories followed the pain. Peter crying, Kel in the living room, torture, pain, and then Bael.
 
The figures stopped talking and turned to me. One of them, a woman, stepped closer. Bulky with hair chopped down to a boyish cut. I did not recognize her. A new doctor, I thought and shut my eyes tightly, as if to erase the thought. I’m not there anymore. I’m not there anymore.  
 
“Just you rest, dear,” she said. “We’ll take care of everything.”
 
“Where am I?” I asked. As far as I could see, light shone from the walls and the floor of the room, and other than my bed, there had been no other furniture.
 
“Don’t worry too much about that right now,” the woman said. “When you wake up tomorrow, everything will be back to normal.”
 
The woman seemed important. The other blurred figure still remained in the distance, listening to her speak.
 
I felt nauseas with worry. Did I have another episode? Kel beat me senseless, but surely not enough to make me see light instead of floors. I felt strange too. Almost weightless but not quite. As if I was up at a great distance with nothing below me, but I was not falling, rather floating. 
 
“Where’s the light coming from?” I asked. My heartbeat quickened at her confused expression.
 
Perhaps, a normal person, who had not spent countless years at a mental institution, might think that trauma they’d been through accounted for all the strange happenings around them, but I had not been normal, apparently. As hard as I tried to fight the idea of madness away, it followed me and wrapped me in a tight cocoon when I had least expected it.
 
Demons, Lily? Demons? And you thought you were fine. I closed my eyes, half expecting them to open in my old room in the asylum. Blink the crazy away. This had been the second time in a day—or however it long I lay her unconscious—that I wondered about my sanity.
 
“Can you tell me where I am, doctor?” The air was humid and the walls, despite having no apparently begging or end, felt as if they crept toward me. I called her doctor because that had been the sanest explanation for her presence. I had been on the verge of tears and for the first time felt as if my mind was truly lost. Could I have invented people and places? I had a job, for crying out loud!
 
Her expression relaxed at little. “Calm down, child. Bael called us. We’re going to help you get better, alright? My name is I am Doctor Deborah. You’ve received a serious head injury.”
 
“Who is Bael?” I asked her, scared that he had been another doctor or a nurse that I had dragged into my madness.
 
“Do you not remember?” she asked. The figure behind her stepped closer but still too far for me to make out his face.
 
“I do, but I just need you to clarify it for me, if that’s alright.”
 
“He’s your friend.”
 
I shook my head. “No.”
 
“He’s not your friend?”
 
“That’s not what I meant. I want to know if I’m crazy,” I said. My eyelids stung with coming tears. “Can you help me, please? I don’t know what’s real anymore.”
 
The doctor opened her mouth but the figure behind her came into the range of my vision. It was Bael, pale faced and wearing a wrinkled suit. “You’re not crazy, Lily.”
 
I turned my head to the doctor, keeping my eyes on Bael. “I’d like him to leave, please.”
 
The woman came closer, and put her head on my forehead. “Why don’t you sleep awhile?” she asked.
 
I felt drowsier suddenly and though I attempted to stay conscious, my eyelids grew heavier and it got harder and harder to lift them up.
*****
I heard spray behind me and a strong scent of vanilla filled the room. Deborah’s office seemed strange now that we were not in hell. The magic faded somewhat. Cars raced in the streets, horns tooted and an occasional merchant’s scream rang through the thick walls.
 
“She was close, Bael,” Deborah said, tapping her long fingernails against the glass sheet on the table.
 
I held my fists tight and looked into the corner of her office, fantasizing about putting a very permanent end to Kel. “I know,” I said.
 
“You should have called—”
 
“I know.”
 
 “Well, why didn’t you then?” Deborah barked.
 
“Because every intern you’ve sent me has been a complete moron.”
 
Deborah snapped her head back. “We have the finest men and women in our training programs.”
 
“I caught the last one taking a shower while Peter lay helpless on some stacked pillows and then found a frozen spoon in my tub of ice-cream.”
 
“Did he die?”
 
“He could have slipped.”
 
“And then you’d be free.” Deborah smiled, studying my expression.
 
“I’ve thought about that more than once. You don’t have to trick me into coming clean. I’ve never tried to hide what I am from you.”
 
“Who is this girl?” she asked, trailing away from the way the conversation was heading.
 
 “Just a neighbor.”
 
“Mae was just a neighbor.”
 
“Ah, yes, Mae.” I crossed my legs. “Thanks for sending her to check up on me. Things almost went over smoothly. You know how I hate it when that happens.”
 
“I won’t apologize for feeling concerned.”
 
“Well, someone better start apologizing for something.”
 
“Why did that girl not want to see you? Did she see something, do you think?”
 
“Because she’s not stupid,” I said simply. “Probably realized that I brought all the trouble to her.”
 
“Are we sure it’s Kel?”
 
“Most likely. Lucifer doesn’t like to repeat himself. He’d have thought of something else. Kel, on the other hand, lives to please and be like daddy. I’m almost certain it’s him.”
 
When I found her, I thought he killed her. Her face was swollen, lips torn, leg facing in a way it shouldn’t, but she took a breath, and another. Then she screamed.
 
I wanted to go over to Lily right that second. Bring her flowers, and those senseless stuffed bears the humans always seem to clutter hospital rooms with. I wanted to apologize, and then apologize again. Grovel without end and give her everything she wanted. It was all very unlike me but I had not felt like myself for a long time, and that was mostly a good thing.
 
“I need you to have a plan,” Deborah said. She opened the bottom of drawer of her desk and took out the bottle the two of us had worked on the last time I found myself in her office.
 
“I have a plan.”
 
“No, you don’t, but you need one. You’ve been surviving daily.”
 
“And what’s wrong with that?”
 
“You need a plan, Bael. I don’t care if you have to flee into the desert and we have to drop food down a tunnel. You need something solid.”
 
“Like a tunnel.”
 
“Don’t be smart. You need a plan. That boy’s seen more in the last six months than I did my entire human life. You won’t save him if you let this persist. Have a plan. Don’t let anything or anyone make you stray from it.”
 
“I’m not in love, Deborah.”
 
“No one us are in love, and then suddenly, we just are. And I don’t even care about that. Love who you love. Take Mae or Lily or whichever damsel you want to save next and bring her with you into that tunnel. But get a fucking tunnel, Bael.”
 
“I’ll secure the house,” I said. “Read to the boy a bit. He’ll be fine. He sleeps and eats ice-cream, I haven’t ruined him yet.”
 
“Well,” Deborah crossed her arms under her large breasts, “if you’re staying, I want you to still go to the meetings.”
 
The woman had some nerve. “This evening I left them alone for less than a half hour. What do you think happens when they find out I’m out every Tuesday for an hour?”
 
The atmosphere took a strange shift. As if rain clouds suddenly came over Deborah’s office, but when I looked out the window, the sky was clear and the sun shone through the window.
 
“Oh,” Deborah stood suddenly, “look at the time! Back to work, did you want to join me?”
 
“Perhaps another time.” I stood and straightened my suit. “Can I go see her while you’re down there?”
 
“We don’t have her anymore, dear,” Deborah said. “She’s back home.”
 
I narrowed my eyes, confused as to why she hid that from me. Did Deborah intend to give Lily a chance to flee while she kept me busy with pointless conversation? Build a tunnel, take who you want, but not Lily; was the thought process apparently. Truth be told, she might as well have given me two wedding rings and booked a church for the Sunday, because something in me stirred now that the prospect of Lily’s departure was a possibly.
 
“Don’t think too much into this,” she said and walked around her table. “I wanted to see how you were.” She put her hand on my shoulder and nudged her head toward the door. “You’ve got a minute or you’re coming whether you like it or not.”
 
“You know, Deborah, I’m still unsure whether you like me or fear me.”
 
She laughed then, her hand shaking on my shoulder. “I certainly don’t fear you, Bael.”
 
“Why did you give her a chance to run then?”
 
Deborah stopped. “Because I want to see that she stays and I want her to do that before you have a chance to convince her. I’ve read up on her. Good girl.” Deborah shook her head, looking down at something on the floor. “There are boundaries we should not cross, Bael. You go to her right now, trying to explain in your intense way and you’ll scare the life right out of her. You’ll make her feel trapped and she’s been trapped before—she won’t react the way you hope.”
 
“So what do I do then?”
 
“Write her a note.”
 
I raised an eyebrow, ready to take another step.
 
“Oh wait, you big doofus.” Deborah caught me by the sleeve of my shirt as I attempted to leave. “Tell her that you’re sorry and that if she wants to know the truth of what happened, she is welcome anytime, but you will not force it on her.”   
 
“That sounds like a lot of a trouble for something I am not really interested in, Deborah,” I said flatly after listening to how ridiculous she intended me to act. I had not sent a note in over a thousand years. God forbid, I pick up a pen for a woman again. The last time it had been for Mae and she got me killed. If my head’s to roll for anything, it will be Peter.
 
Disregarding Deborah’s terrible advice, I made my way to Lily’s house, trying to figure out a way to not make her feel trapped. Being a demon, I found the whole situation quite challenging, and bought a very large, white bear for her instead.

54bnqp,0,2016-09-24,"Thanks for everything, Runescape.",thanksrunescape,2007scape,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/54bnqp/thanks_for_everything_runescape/,"In a few months, I am going to graduate from college and start my adult life, and as I sit here and look back on my life it is undeniable just how much Runescape has shaped my future. I'd just like to post this as a thank you to Jagex, to you scapers, to anyone I've interacted with in my 12 years playing this game. Here's my story:

At first, I played the game just like everyone else. Then, when I was 15 I discovered private servers. Soon, I began looking into how to make my own server; my first introduction to programming. This snowballed quickly into running my own server, where I achieved 100 concurrent players at my peak. Like most servers, people eventually lost interest, so I turned to botting.   

Over 4 years with 4 major botting sites I made a name for myself with decent scripts; but more importantly I found that computer science was my calling in life. 

To finish my journey, I transitioned from botting to major goldfarming when OSRS came out. At this point in time, its time for me to change. For one, Jagex bot detection is the best its ever been; even with a private client I wrote I can only reliably remain unbanned for 4 days - kudos mod weath. Finally, I need to move on. Thanks to the work I put in on this game, I went through college debt free (with a little extra :)), I had 2 amazing internships and now I'm going to start my dream job. I need to grow up.

Some of you may be mad that I ""ruin"" this game with what I have done, yet if we are honest with ourselves, this game is shit. Before you reply with a load of hate, think if you were in my position; what would you do? 

Anyways, I just felt I had to post this before I leave for good, to thank you. Maybe you played my server, or maybe you bought some of my scripts, or maybe you even bought some of my gold. Just know I appreciate you all and the life I live is thanks to you."

This source is secondary and makes reference to his comments]( http://www.rednationonline.ca/Articles2016/RecentCPLreportsconcerning.aspx) ***[UPDATE: Actual source](http://www.rodpedersen.com/2016/05/the-monday-morning-goalie_15.html)

5. Ottawa – OSEG – Source is numerous hints dropped by OSEG staff. 2nd hand reports from people who have chatted with me. Also not worried about the Fury’s future after that same chat. Also mentioned in same article as Calgary &amp; Winnipeg.

6. Edmonton – Faths – I don’t know details but it’s been heavily implied by some people in the know... No link 

7. GTA – Mitchell Goldhar – Ok, no real sources, but someone who *does* have some connections kept throwing his name around and acting koi when questioned about it. [Rollins has also dropped that there is a billionaire interested in a GTA team]( https://twitter.com/24thminute/status/778722557725777922). I actually tweeted Rollins to ask if it was Goldhar, as he has been fairly candid answering questions, but all he did was like the tweet. Maybe reading too much, but I’m suspicious.

8. Quebec City – ??? – Someone is apparently interested in putting a team there. No one is dropping names though. Speculation around Quebecor or the Molson family, but nothing serious as far as I know. ***[UPDATE: Source that Quebec City mayor has been interested in QC getting an NASL team in the past, no mention of particular ownership.

9. Vancouver - ??? – I have heard nothing about Vancouver/Victoria/Surry. Some people have thrown out Aquinali, but I am certain that is just about plausibility, not any real evidence.

10. Moncton/Maritimes - ??? – I have heard nothing. Doubtful at this point, I suspect. [Listed on Verde’s “leak”, but I don’t trust it]( https://twitter.com/Carlos77Verde/status/740766554426638338)

11. London – MLSE – Some have speculated that maybe this is MLSE forming a relationship with a L1O team that is drawing well and in a decently sized metropolitan area as a team to move up to CPL. I am seriously doubtful, as it is not an ownership agreement, and especially considering the wording of the relationship is almost identical to the Windsor Stars affiliation.

12. KW - ??? – Literally nothing, but people keep suggesting it as a market so I listed it.

13. Victoria - ??? – [Listed on Verde’s tweet. He is a Carlton journalism student who had an internship at OSEG and decided to tweet this after the internship was over. I find it dubious, as a journalism student trying to start a career has a vested interest as coming off as an insider, but might as well list it.]( https://twitter.com/Carlos77Verde/status/740766554426638338)

***
&gt; On January 11, 2016, MONICA HANLEY was interviewed by (FBI) Special Agents ##### and #####.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY provided the following information:
&gt; 
&gt; In 2003, following her college graduation, HANLEY interned for then Senator HILLARY CLINTON. HANLEY's internship position was converted to a permanent position in 2004. HANLEY continued working for New York Senator KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, who was appointed after CLINTON was nominated as Secretary of State.
&gt; 
&gt; In April of 2009, HANLEY received a call from HUMA ABEDIN asking if HANLEY would be interested in working for CLINTON as a ""Confidential Assistant"" at the Department of State (DoS). HANLEY accepted the position at DoS, and continued work for GILLIBRAND until two day before her start at DoS.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY accompanied CLINTON on foreign travel on a few occasions during her first year at DoS. HANLEY's first overseas  travel with CLINTON  was to the Philippines. CLINTON specifically invited HANLEY  to join her on that trip because CLINTON knew HANLEY was of Filipino descent and would appreciate the opportunity to travel there.
&gt; 
&gt; When ABEDIN became pregnant in 2011, HANLEY became a primary traveler and accompanied CLINTON on most of her foreign trips.
&gt; 
***
**Email Accounts and Server**


&gt; During her time in the Senate, CLINTON used ####blackberry.net. HANLEY was aware of this email account, but did not use this account to communicate with CLINTON.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY was aware CLINTON was using a personal email address on a personal server for DoS business while CLINTON WAS Secretary of State. JUSTIN COOPER created, installed and maintained the server in Chappaqua  before the server was transitioned over to the Platte River Networks (PRN). HANLEY could not recall when the transition to PRN occurred. COOPER was HANLEY'S point of contract for assistance in regards to syncing CLINTON's mobile devices to the server. Anytime CLINTON got a new device, HANLEY would contact COOPER who would troubleshoot her through the process of setting up the new device with the server. COOPER was also HANLEY's point of contact.


&gt; HANLEY used two email accounts while at DoS: …
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY was issued and carried /used a DoS Blackberry. It was difficult to access DoS email while on travel, as the DoS system required users to sign in using a token/key to sign in remotely. It was particularly difficult to sign into the DoS system in the Secretary's plane because the wifi was not always compatible, so HANLEY would often use her Gmail account while in the air. The same was true for foreign travel. Many DoS employees used personal email accounts because they were more easily accessible. ABEDIN emailed HANLEY   equally from her state.gov and personal accounts.
&gt; 

***


&gt; HANLEY recalled helping CLINTON change her Blackberry device at least three or four times while she was at DoS. HANLEY recalled having to replace CLINTON's Blackberry on one occasion after CLINTON spilled coffee on the device. Another time HANLEY recalled having to replace CLINTON's Blackberry beause it started to fail over time. HANLEY recalled proactively trying to purchase replacement Blackberrys for CLINTON at one point, but CLINTON only liked the older models. HANLEY believed she may have even purchased one of the older Blackberry models for CLINTON on Ebay.

&gt; **Laptop Computer**

&gt; After they learned longtime friend of CLINTON, SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL, was the target of an email hack in Spring of 2013, PRN spoke with COOPER, ABEDIN, and HANLEY, and advised CLINTON change her email address. COOPER subsequently provided HANLEY an extra Apple Macbook from President Clinton's Harlem, NY, Office. HANLEY then transferred all of CLINTON's old emails from the PRN server to the Macbook Air.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY maintained possession of the Macbook following the transfer of the emails. The Macbook was stored in HANLEY's apartment. HANLEY moved at least once after she transferred the emails to the Macbook, and brought the Macbook with her to her new apartment.
&gt; 
&gt; When HANLEY was first contacted by FBI agents in November 2015 in regards to scheduling an interview, she reached out to ####### to ask about the whereabouts of the Macbook. ####### told HANLEY she did not recall receiving the Macbook from PRN.
***
**Handling of Classified Material**

&gt; CLINTON did not have a classified DoS account, and received all classified information in paper form. CLINTON's Executive Assistant, JOE McMANUS, was responsible for determining what classified information was to be passed up to CLINTON.
&gt; When CLINTON was on travel, her traveling Executive Assistant or SULLIVAN would determine what classified information needed CLINTON's attention.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The DoS Mobile Communications Team (MCT) traveled with CLINTON on both international and domestic trips. The MCT generally set up an unclassified computer in either ABEDIN or HANLEY's room for the purpose of printing unclassified information for CLINTON. 
&gt; 
&gt; When CLINTON was traveling, ABEDIN would generally carry a secure cell phone. HANLEY carried the secure phone on occasion, and described the phone as looking like an old Nokia non-flip phone with a big antenna and large buttons. The secure cell was carried in a box.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY received a lesson from somebody on the DoS technical team in regards to using the secure cell phone, but when HANLEY tried to use the secure cell phone in 2012 on a trip to Haiti, it did not work.

****


&gt; **General Security Matters**

&gt; HANLEY also received verbal security counseling for Diplomatic Security (DS) following a Russia trip on which she accompanied CLINTON. Hanley was handed a diplomatic pouch containing CLINTON's briefing book on the plane arriving in Russia. HANLEY brought the pouch and its contents into the Russian suite she shared with CLINTON. DS found a classified document from the briefing book in the suite during a sweep following CLINTON and HANLEY's departure, and HANLEY was later informed by the DS the briefing book and document should never have been in the suite.

*I picked out Monica Hanley because she was one of the few names not redacted and I had not heard the name before. Of course you will not find a smoking gun in any portion of the PDF.*

*When you see the subheads, they generally follow the format through each individual interview. Abedin, etc.*

*With regard to content, I became intrigued with a young person's prestigious and frankly glamorous environment of government service.*

*The onion skin layers of security and the small incompetences of aides and assistants trying to be competent. In Monica Hanley's eyes perhaps, the  indifference of a SoS who seemed blithe in her attitude to security and doing the job, ""on the fly"".*  

*How, I wonder, would any of us be able to discern the moment when our moral sense alerted us to misbehavior or something illegal that we ought not  to be doing?*"

I have my associates in computer science and dropped out of a software engineering program for personal reasons, but still learned a lot.

I've been writing code for almost 20 years but have only considered myself a software developer for about 3 years now.

I came to this job from an internship where I learned a ton of 

Java:

* Maven
* JaxRS, JSF, Spring Boot

Python:

* Pandas, NumPy
* NetworkX
* Django, Flask

Web Dev:

* LESS/SASS/CoffeeScript
* Node, Bower, Grunt, Gulp, Dokku
* Angular 1.0 (dead, yeah, but the ability TO learn and understand is important)
* D3
* JQuery

All-Around Dev:

* Jenkins, Ant
* Unit, Integration, Acceptance Testing
* OOP Design Patterns
* Functional programming
* Agile Scrum
* SCM

I came to my current job with no PHP knowledge and the environment was very start-up-ish. As soon as I saw the Wordpressy shit my co-worker had set up I immediately began applying pressure to overhaul their system and bring everything up to par. Since then my co-worker has become my predecessor and has left, and 95% of the code has been rewritten.

Our core software was a bunch of untestable global function garbage half-shoved into a Wordpress template and since then I have overhauled it to comply with PSR-4 with composer, PDO, introduced unit testing including build, deploy, and test automation, and created our own generic internal PHP library modeled after Pandas and R DataTables. I have many other projects utilizing Laravel 5 including many custom middlewares and service providers.

Additionally, I am trained in multiple 3rd party record-keeping databases, am in charge of maintaining basically all of our IT operations, self-manage and oversee 2 huge revenue projects, participate in executive meetings with clients, actively produce KPI reports, perform AR audits and work closely with the state to close any issues or requirements which arise, manage our database (hundreds of tables across about 60 schemas with hundreds of millions of rows of data). About 800gb of raw client financial data which grows every day. And I'm about to become lead on a service-oriented architecture project which will help our clients become compliant with new state-mandated regulations involving our industry AND we are about to seal a relationship with the state which will give us access to privileged data (which will, of course, become my 6th consecutive ""number 1 top priority"").

Lately I have not been able to get any work done because there is just too fucking much to do and we don't offer the comp that will attract those who are able to do it. It's like I'm doing a BFS from a node with an ever-increasing amount of branches. One minute I'm delivering a projection to a CEO, the next minute I'm resetting the router and teaching someone how to do a LEFT JOIN, meanwhile my task list just grows and grows. It's too much.

The problem is my degree. I have my associates and it affects my self-esteem and self-worth. I feel trapped in my current position and I'm really unhappy with where I feel I'm headed. There's this paranoid part of me that always simultaneously feels like I'm either about to be fired because I can never get anything done anymore or that I'm being taken advantage of because my actual market value is much higher than my perceived market value.

Is my perspective the problem? Are a lot of jobs like this? I've heard of having to wear multiple hats, but I'm at the point where I don't even feel like I have a hat because I'm always simultaneously doing so much for so many different people and it's gotten to the point where I am no longer able to even be productive.

What I do know is that I'm not making enough money to make ends meet anymore. How much do you people think I'm actually worth with the skillset I have?

Thanks for reading all of this."

I know this sounds like a silly question - but I'm really nervous. 

We were together 1.5 years before we moved in together... and we're a month in

The thing is, it's mainly me who starts the arguments. I'm a little more particular about how I live (cleanliness, aesthetic if you will, keeping rooms bright, the fridge organized a certain way, tv volume), and lately even when things are going well otherwise, I find myself extremely grumpy. 

It could be the stress of me having an internship, 2 part-time jobs, and going to uni full-time (I have 0 days off), but I find myself being unreasonable at times and sometimes borderline mean. He has quit drinking, something he did a lot of (nothing serious, though), and it has made him a happier, productive, more creative, attentive, and sweet boyfriend: making my lunch, leaving sweet notes, offering massages. Yet I find myself being rude to him when I never was before.

This could be a much deeper issue; I think I'm a little upset with my grumpiness due to stress and personal issues and so the nicer he is the more I get angry at myself for being so rude... but I need some advice. 

I wouldn't like if he treated me the way I treated him.. and wouldn't want him resenting me like I resent him for stupid little things (like unplugging a lamp while I'm not home to charge his phone).

I just want to know that this is normal, and if we communicate like we do without my bitterness (I am setting up a therapy appointment next week), and learn to let the small things go, that this will get better.

We both met in college 4 years ago. Same friend group during those times. She developed a crush for me, but I was an idiot and ignored it. I never had any feelings towards a girl anytime through college. 


&amp;nbsp;



We remain friendly during these years, fast forward to about 8 months ago. We start to talk very regularly. She has since graduated. I am finishing my last semester and graduating. We both live at home. We continued to ramp up communication and hung out occasionally. Since this point it has been about 5-6 months of consistent everyday texts and snapchats. Just shooting the shit, linking videos, deeps talks to 2am. An unreal amount of snapchats. I began to consider her one of my best friends and she agreed. She has also told me the crush she developed when we met was something lasted a VERY long time.


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;




 I was busy this past summer working an internship, and living at home. This was my first time for years away from all my college friend and have been very lonely. About half-way through summer we hooked up (no sex), met her parents. At this point I began to developed feelings for her. The everyday communication continued. 


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


Im not a person to develop sudden crushes and I really felt this was a fantastic match:


-friends all agreed we were very compatible.   


-She was going to start a job soon


-I was graduating and had a great high paying job lined up


-She has had feelings for me in the past.


-Both single and both had very little to no dating past. 


-We knew so much about each other, identical senses of humor, can talk about nothing for hours.


-I have been losing weight, entering best shape of my life. (not overweight).


-Both come from similar and great families. 




&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;





So back to the story. This is when shit gets hairy. About 8 weeks ago I ask her on a date, she says shes not interested right now, and has said she feels very off/on romantically for me. I say this is fine, and continue everyday texting/snapchatting.




&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;






 I fucked up here, I got the idea in my mind that she would still date me if I tried again in some time. My crush continued to develop. I couldnt get the classic ""why doesnt she want to go on a date"" thoughts out of my head. She starts her new job, which is a huge time sink for her. 3 weeks ago I asked her if she wants to go to local event with some of our old friends, she says she doesnt want to drive that long (its same as her commute distance). Because of the crush I get frustrated and say ""if you dont want to come you can just say so, dont have to make excuses"". She gets angry at this, rightfully so. 






&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;




ENTER SHIT PERIOD: She stops snapchatting and texting me completely. She will respond if I say anything, but shell stop after a few responses and its just not the same fun conversation. 


-I dont talk to her for a few days. 


-After being very distraught and coming to the realization I need to stop this shit. I asked her for another date, expressed I dont care about labels, just want to have fun together. She says ""its not me, she doesnt want any relationship right now, no time with work"". I tell her that theres a chance I might need to cut contact for a bit to move past my feelings. She says she didnt realize I had such strong feelings. She was supportive and said she understood. 


-Next 5 days suck ass, her ignoring continues as expected.  During this time I spend a massive amount of time self reflecting and trying to get over these feelings. I read online responses/movies/read some books (models was very helpful). 


-I tell her I am feeling much better and aware of my feelings and the situation. I tell her I dont need to cut contact to shake the feelings. She says she understands and says its good to hear. 


-5 days pass. No texts or snapchats. My self reflection continues. I realize I was being selfish with my desires and ignored some clear warning signs. I realize I was settling for what was available and latched to it from my newfound loneliness. I feel much better, the constant thoughts are gone. 


-I talk to her again, explain the situation in detail. I say I just want our communication to go back to what it used to be. I EMPHASIZE she doesnt have to be careful with what she says in fear of sending the wrong message. She understands and says it may be hard for her to flip the switch back on of the old communication. During this she also tells me ""dont settle for me, youll meet someone better""


-No texts or snapchats continue. If I text her I get a few generic responses and then responses will stop.




&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;



so....
I truly believe I have changed/opened my mind towards the crush. I obviously would still date her, but I understand if she doesnt want to I am okay with that. I am excited to meet someone in the future and am focusing on self improvement right now.




The problem is, I feel like she doesnt give a shit about me anymore, we were very close friends with daily communication for months before any of this started. Before the last 3 weeks, we texted ALL the time, and probably snapchated each other 10-30 times a day just shooting the shit. Now I am stressing about fucking up one of my closest friendships. It almost drives me as crazy as when I couldn't figure out why she wouldn't date me. It fucking drives me nuts that she hasn't snapped me back for 3+ weeks. It fucking drives me nuts that the primary person I talk to and knows everything about me continues blatantly ignoring me. It honestly hurts.





&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;




So if you have made it this far, thanks, and I want to get some outside perspective on this. I legitimately just want to have the old friendship back. Do you think the ignoring will continue? Should I just cut contact for a week or two so she believes me? Or do you think she wants nothing to do with me and I truly fucked this up?
Open to any perspective or advice. 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: longtime friend, she used to have a crush. post college we talk everyday for months. I develop crush. She denies. I come to terms with this, desire old friendship. She wont communicate first and continues to partially ignore me.  "

I'm here to request a game that I've been waiting to play since forever, please take a moment to read through my request!

Also, how's your weekend going?

Quick info:

PSN_ID: [War_Machida](http://psnprofiles.com/War_Machida) - US Region

What I'm requesting: [Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS-Force Bundle](https://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-Extreme-Vs-Force/dp/B01IAL0SBG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474764039&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=gundam+vita) - Digital code from Amazon.com

^^*It ^^is ^^called ^^a ^^bundle ^^because ^^it ^^also ^^comes ^^with ^^themes ^^for ^^the ^^Vita*

Price: $39,99 (more info on this BS inside)

Hello, guys. So, I've been a huge Gundam fan since Gundam Wing aired here in Brazil around 1995-1997, something like this. The anime was the best thing I've watched since the original Dragon Ball. Everything about that anime was so amazing, even the whole politics thing (which, now that I'm older, I started to give this part more attention). But it took me a while to get in touch with Gundam games. They were scarce at the time (at least here in my country), most were not at all accessible, and whatnot. Throughout the time I played a few Gundam games, and believe me, they were all worth it (and they're still dear in my heart). 

Here's what I remember playing:

* Gundam: Battle Assault - My reaction was some in these lines: ""oh my god, where all these nice Gundam come from?"". Turns out I didn't knew that there were MULTIPLE series, and this anime started in the late 70s.

* Gundam: Battle Assault 2 - Ball is amazing, shut up.

* Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation vs. Zeon - I believe that, at this time, I did knew about older series, and, boy, RX-78 is simply the best design, in my opinion. Also, space battles, underwater battles, Big Zam stills horrible (and horribly hard).

But then, it was getting harder and harder to find games. One of the reasons was that I moved to the Xbox 360 instead of going to the logical PS1&gt;PS2&gt;PS3 path. Turns out that I could never find those incredibly rare ""Dynasty Warriors Gundam"" games for the Xbox, and Mugen did its thing as far as it could.

When I finally got a PS3 (very late in its cycle, like late 2013), I discovered that there were MANY Gundam games ""available"". I almost bought a cheap copy of Gundam Crossfire, but I discovered that this game was bad moments before. Besides Musou games (that I only started to like a couple years ago), there was this CADILLAC of games called *Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs*, but it was only available in Japan. Importing from PlayAsia is rough, we have to pay so much taxes here in Brazil that most imports are not even worth it (talking about $100 games, at the end of the math).

Time flew by, an even better version of Extreme Vs got released for the PS3, and I was here, drooling over videos, watching my favorite Youtube channel (Two Best Friends Play) play a multiplayer match against other cool guys from other channels (Cranky Construct and Boku no Eruption, IIRC)...

EDIT: The game is a fast paced Z-targeting Mecha based arena fighting game. It is pretty much Fed vs Zeon but more ""arcady"", it contains gundams from various series and lots to unlock and discover. I'm an eternal fan of these arena brawlers like Power Stone, Anarchy Reigns and many others. It combines elements from different genres that I love very, very much.

I had some money and discovered a nice Model Kit seller in other state. He had Model Kits available and I started buying and building some. Here's a photo of my [MG Qubeley](http://imgur.com/a05cgSV), not my favorite building process, but the coolest looking one (and the only model that's not broken because I had to move to another house pretty much every year since 2013).

A few months ago, the Extreme Vs series got a Vita version released at the PSN store, in the US region! This way I don't need to get through Japanese menus, and the game is reasonably cheap.

___

Why can't I get it myself?

Well... I was waiting for a deal, really. Even though I'd pay the full 40 for it (and I believe it is worth WAY more than its price), [its price never went down, not a single time](https://psprices.com/region-us/game/261023/mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs-force-bundle).

I checked the physical version and it's available for something around $18, but I can't get this deal here in Brazil. And I also couldn't find this game available in cartridge around here.

If you guys search for my other requests, you guys will notice some common things like ""me wanting to buy a motorcycle"" or ""me wanting to get married"", and some things never change. The difference now is that I **wish** I could properly pay for my studies, I'm almost broke and I'm still trying to get a better job to finally get married. It's not easy, even though I'm acquiring a second degree. My internship doesn't pay me well enough to keep my videogames ~~addiction~~ hobby going on. Other thing is that I made a promise to her, we are both going to save money. Our first goal is a board game called ""Abyss"", as our mutual Christmas gift (because we want something to play with our friends when they're visiting us at our house)... the second goal is said house! If we can save money to buy *anything*, we can save to buy a house (an apartment, actually). To do this I'm going to continue looking for better jobs, while also avoiding eating snacks at college, and we're both going to avoid going out too much. Dates like ""seeing the sunset at the lake"" are OK. Things like expensive dinners at Outback are out of question.

It is worth mentioning that I have a PSTV (a Vita TV, actually), and I'm using this while my girlfriend plays with my Vita. She loves playing games with me, and having a game to play at the same time (don't know if we can do some ad-hoc multiplayer since we're using the same account) will be amazing! We love to watch movies/series or playing games while on skype, and this request can also help we both to have fun together while saving our money for our future.

I did well in high school but took a year break after high school to take a software development internship that eventually turned into a job, then started school.

I didn't do very well my freshman year and feel like I've half-assed many of my classes, because I know I have the safety net of this job. If I were to drop out right now I would be making $70k a year.

Everybody I ask gives different advice. Aside from the degree, it's also hard to get this social life outside of college. A big reason why I'm here right now.

How were your college experiences for those that went? And for those that didn't, are you satisfied?"

54dgbi,1,2016-09-24,Filling in for a friend.,azdv,DirtyFlashFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyFlashFiction/comments/54dgbi/filling_in_for_a_friend/,"Billie was an intern for a popular local magazine and because they had to share the space. A good friend of the magazine editor ran the business next door. The business was depending on the day a soft core magazine or a porn study. 

Billie was helping one of the models when she noticed the two bosses talking. Billie boss waved her over when she was done helping the model. The studio next door had an actress that wasn't feeling well and needed someone to fill in. The director assured Billie she would be compensated and at any time during filming if she wanted to back out she could.  Billie took a breath and agreed. 

“Excellent! Come on over, we have everything already set up.”

Billie followed him into the studio and looked around at the small crew assembled to film this video. She noticed the bedroom sets bed had a variety of underwear spread out on it.

The director explained the video to a blush covered Billie. A female producer met her in the changing room to see how her nerves were. Billie was nervous but willing to help. The producer smiled and assured her she'd do great.

“Ok sweetie now I know your nervous already but would you mind stripping down to your underwear so I can see if you need a change. “

Billie took a deep breath before stripping down to her matching dark blue underwear. 

“Those are so cute! It's perfect!” 

Billie smiled blushing more. Her and the producer continued to talk as she prepped Billie for the scene. She left and told Billie to relax for a couple minutes to let her nerves calm and to come out when she was ready. She assured Billie she'd do great one more time before leaving. Billie sat on the couch. She sighed and stood up and went over to a full length mirror on the other side of the room. 

She gave herself a quick pep talk before leaving the room. Her face was still red with blush and it only got worse when the director complimented her body. She thanked him and he politely ushered her to the set.

The first few frames were just small teases, showing off the underwear and her body, maybe a little caressing thrown in.

After an encouraging smile and nod off set, Billie unhooked and removed her bra and slide her underwear off. She turned to the bed and picked up a pair of underwear, a lacy black and white combo and went over to the mirror, holding it against her to try it on. This continued with two more pairs before she layed on the bed. The director called for a quick to cut to check on Billie.

“How are you feeling?”

“Fine, surprisingly.”

Billie replied with a small laugh. 

“Ok, your still comfortable and all, still ready for the next scene?”

“I think so.” 

Billie smiled and so did the director. He hi fives her before returning to his chair and calling for filming to resume. 

Billie laid on the bed and held a red bra against her. She sighed as she began to rub the inside of her thigh. The camera zoomed in as she rubbed herself slowly and teasingly through the black panties. A door opened and in walked her costar. Her characters boyfriend. He entered the bedroom chuckling a little. Billie smiled.

“I did a little shopping while you were at work. How does this combo look?”

He layed on the bed. 

“Any of these would look amazing on you.”

They kissed as he tried to gently pull the bra away but she held on and shook her playfully. He smirked and laid on the bed. She grabbed a pair and held them out of his sight before hopping over him and going to the closet. She changed underwear as he waited and observed the other pairs on the bed. 

She came out in a skimpy pink set. The bra barely covering her perky tits, the panties covering slightly more. 

“How do I look?”

She asked (her blush gone)as she went over to the bed and kneeled on it. He sat up. 

“You look so sexy baby.”

“How sexy?”

“So sexy I'm willing to go over my break time.”

She giggled and rested her forehead on his before they began to kiss. His hand quickly cupped her breast, squeezing it softly while she unbuttoned his shirt. The scene cuts to him removing her bra and licking and sucking on her hard nipples. She clears the other sets off the bed as he pushes his shirt off. She lays on the bed with her legs open. He leans in and kisses her thigh softly and slowly. He starts to rub and kiss her pussy through the underwear. She moans softly.

He slowly slid her panties off, the camera zooming in. He leaned back down and kissed her pussy, sucking on the lips softly. 

“Mmm honey…”

She moaned softly. He began to lick her pussy slowly as he rubbed her clit. Her moaned got louder and louder with each stroke. He held her lips open and slid his tongue in and out of her pussy. A soft fuck followed as she arched in pleasure. He continue to lick for a little while longer, her moans getting louder and longer. He kneeled on the bed, pulling his pants and boxers off, his hard cock springing out. Billie sat up and stroked it a little and started to suck it. 

She sucked faster and longer and deeper before laying down again. He rolled her on her side and laid next to her. He out his arm around her waist and he slid his cock in her tight, wet pussy. The two made out as he slowly began to fuck her. 

The scene cuts to him kissing her neck, as she leans her head back in pleasure as he still fucks her slowly.

He fucked her faster and faster, her moans getting louder. He switched positions kneeling on the bed, her still on her side. He began to fuck her faster and harder.

“Fuckkkk.” She moaned as he continued to go faster and harder.

After a few more thrusts she came hard. He slowed down. Billie decided to improvise (she was told she could if she wanted to.). 

“Baby…”

“Yeah?”

“Lay me on on my back and fuck me like the “old days”. “

They shared a smirk as he rolled her onto her back an began to fuck, as hard and as fast as he could. 

“Oh fuck, pound me baby, fuck me like a cheap whore.” She moaned. 

He kept going her moaning was as loud as she could ( The director quietly thanked his producer and business partner for suggesting a sound proof studio.). She came again, harder and louder  than before, squirming a little in pleasure. He pulled and repositioned himself. He stormed himself a little more. Billie watched with a smirk and an open mouth. He came on her face, some landing in her mouth and hair. 

The director called for a wrap. Billie smiled as her costar layed in the bed next to her and whispered, panting. 

“That was excellent. “

Billies blush returned as she thanked him quietly and nudged his side with her elbow, complimenting him.

It was hard, but I was more naive then. I figured I would graduate and search for jobs his area, move there.

A few years in I started my internship search. After so much looking and so much rejection, I became depressed. I was never going to find a job in my field. My plan slowly changed. I'd graduate, move to be with him, work minimum wage retail.. we would make do.

Senior year, my life is starting to look up. I got an internship with a great company. There could be a possibility in it being a full time opportunity one day. And I'm more confident, trying to make connections with other companies for when I do graduate. But suddenly my life is falling apart as I try to figure out how we will be together. What if there are job opportunities here that i should pursue? I feel I owe it to myself to pursue these opportunities..  It will be harder finding something in a new city with no connections. The dream has always been for me to move and be with him, but it seems more impossible than ever now. I don't know where this relationship is going now.

Dunno if any advice could help, maybe just others relating. I needed to tell someone. I need my therapist. I need to talk to him about everything."

I graduated this past May with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Economics from UC Merced on a full-ride. Graduated a year early at the age of 20. GPA was not the greatest, overall GPA was 3.2, math GPA was 2.8, while my Econ GPA was 4.0.

Decided on becoming an actuary during the past couple months, so I missed out on the internship opportunities early on, and am studying for exam p right now. No job but looking for some technical type jobs right now and would be willing to do a normal retail type job if it'll benefit me. Should I just focus on studying for the exams and pass a couple as soon as possible or should I go out and get any job while also studying even if it'll take longer to pass them?

Also a major reason why I am not working/not in a rush to work is cause I am supposed to get surgery but the hospital has yet to set a date (Sometime this year though) and im supposed to be out for 2-4 weeks (Don't know if a job would give me that much time off, so I decided to not work until after I get it and in the mean time study). Will this gap in my resume look bad even if its for a medical reason?

What would you guys suggest I do about my situation?"

Need help.",HopelessThrowaway789,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54e09q/me_20m_with_my_exgf_21f_of_175years_she_cheated/,"Hey r/relationships

So as the title says, my GF cheated on me, and then broke up with me, and is now playing games with my already painful emotions.
To give you the story, we both work at a company abroad with numerous other people from our home country, all our age. Last week was her birthday, and after we had a rocky patch this month was the most amazing week. Holding hands all the time, sneaking kisses everywhere, romantic dinner, falling asleep cuddling. Fast forward to Friday, the day of her birthday ""party"" we had arranged at our place, with a lot of alcohol, food, and all of the other interns invited. We left our house pretty wasted, but o didn't drink an awful lot so I was halfway sober anyway. GF drank far too much Tequila, so did a few of the others. So we go to the club, we are all dancing in a group - I notice my GF pull one of the other interns (Dick) to the side and talk in his ear - I then noticed that he caressed her cheek and started kissing her, which she reciprocated. Her friend noticed this and took her outside, I asked the guy what happened, he said nothing. She came back in after a while, went to the bar, and stood next to him. I saw her just in time to see his had on her back and her grabbing his cheek and pulling him in to make out again.
Not going to lie, I was mortified. I went over, pulled him away and went ""what the fuck are you doing?"" And he just gave me this 'dumb' blank expression and said ""well I don't know mate"". We went outside and I asked him why, and he said, I fucking quote, ""Well we kissed, as you can see - she clearly prefers me, and it's fair play, so it looks like I've won"" and then smirks. Fucking smirks.

Her friend rushes up and pulls us apart, Dick goes inside and Friend brings GF up. She sees me and starts crying, and I can barely look at her. She tells her Friend that she wont leave unless I agree to a 3-person talk, so Friend brings Dick back up. Dick reiterated his ""I've won"" speech, adding ""well I'm not innocent, but I'm definitely not sorry, I don't think I've done anything wrong here"". GF then says she likes Dick and Dick likes her, and she is sorry they kissed but she doesn't love me anymore....she then got upset, and went to hug me. 

Nah, kidding, she got upset and hugged HIM.

Yep. I broke down there and then, at which point Friend took me aside. She went to speak to GF, then came back alone and said ""we should go home, she's staying here"". She stays, gos back to Dicks house, then comes home at 6pm the following day. She told Friend they didn't do anything, she was just terrified of coming home and confronting what she did. Never mind that I was physically sick with worry the entire day. She comes home, sits down, says she's so sorry she kissed him, she didn't intend to until he kissed her, which flipped a switch. She says she needs to go and think, but we are broken up. Says she will be back soon. Apparently she hasn't loved me for a month and her crush on Dick became full on liking.
And that, Reddit, was the last I saw her. She then said to her Friend she would be back by 12am, then 1am, and I woke up this morning to an otherwise empty house.

I don't feel like carrying on - my friends are amazing, but I alternate between encouraged, devastated, physically ill, hatred, and finding the busy road outside quite attractive. They both work with me - one of our mentors already knows, as he asked me how the night went and I fucking collapsed and started balling, so he teased it out of me.
Reddit, what the hell do I do? She's ripping me apart piece by piece with all the lies and ignoring me and using Dick as comfort. I'm a broken man.

  **tl;dr**: GF cheated, broke up with me, said she had stopped loving me whilst all the while saying she does and acting as normal for her fancy birthday meal, now lies about when she's coming home to talk more, takes comfort in the other guy. I'm a physical and emotional trainwreck."

The realization punctured her in the gut, sending cold, prickling dread seeping through her entire body.

Sophie slid her goggles to rest on her forehead. Foregoing eye protection in the lab was against regulations, but so was losing your kid at work. She strode around the room's perimeter, her eyes leaping back and forth between crannies and shadows in search of Harry. Her ears perked up, awaiting a crash or a smash or any other discordant noise. But no sign of Harry presented itself: the lab continued to run in its perpetual state of peaceful business, and anxiety continued to brew within Sophie's stomach. 

After three fruitless circles, she took to asking her coworkers, starting with the cleaning staff and the interns lest her superiors reprimand her or her peers judge her. ""Have you seen Harry?"" she asked. Each person shrugged or shook their head until she got to Gerald. 

""Yeah, I saw him."" The old janitor smacked his gum and pointed to the doorway. ""Went out there. Had a phone or something in his hand."" Gerald shook his head and grinned. ""Bet he's found a nook to hide out in. Kids always trying to squeeze into the tightest spaces. I reckon they just wanna get back in the womb...""

Sophie forced a smile and patted his shoulder before bustling towards the doorway, her ponytail swinging excitedly. Momentum carried her down the hallway, past the offices and the other lab, all the way to the supply closet. Sophie unlocked it and fished in the dark, inside the crate two over from the right wall, for a TimePhone. Upon retrieving one, she input the time for one hour in the past. She wasn't going to alter the past. All she would do was observe. Keep track of Harry this time. Redeem herself as a mother. Every good parent deserved at least one do-over, she thought.

One hour earlier, Sophie cracked the broom closet door open and peered down the hallway, waiting for Harry to emerge. Within ten minutes, she saw him exit the lab and toddle down the hall, his eyes glued to her red TimePhone. He glanced up every few seconds to check the doors lining each side of the hallway before finally coming across an unlocked supply closet. Harry slid inside and clicked the door shut.

With her newfound knowledge, Sophie reversed to the present and burst out of her own closet. With any luck, Harry hadn't figured out how to configure the TimePhone yet. Her heart thumped with anticipation as she rushed down the hall, her mind split between formulating a lecture and an emergency time rescue plan. Her hand closed around the knob of the supply closet, and she wrenched it open.

Harry shoved the TimePhone between his knees and attempted his best expression of innocence. He looked anything but, though, perched on a mop cart with a guilty smile wrapping around his face. Sophie allowed herself an internal sigh of relief, but at the same time hardened her face, attempting to compensate for her lapse in authority. ""You're in big trouble, young man."" She yanked the phone from between his legs. ""Time travel is dangerous. Under no circumstances are you allowed to touch this phone."" Sophie waggled it to emphasize her point, daring Harry to challenge her.

Protest marked Harry's face for a fleeting moment, but he seemed to think better of it. He shut his mouth and hung his head, though Sophie doubted he was truly contrite. She motioned him towards the elevator, swiping her thumb across the bottom of her phone as they walked. She expected to see the Time Travel app, but to her surprise, the display was instead the title screen of BirdVille. Sophie frowned: something seemed off about it. As the elevator descended, she stared at the birds flying perpetually in the background.

Normally, an ad would have popped up after a few seconds.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Harry peeking at the phone, turning away when he noticed her glance. Sophie navigated to her phone's purchase history and checked the most recent figure. It was in the triple digits.

She jabbed the icon of the Time Travel app."
54e5xf,3,2016-09-25,"Mother calls, I cry. Yay, Saturday.",Naysnay,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/54e5xf/mother_calls_i_cry_yay_saturday/,"**TL;DR** Parents called and proceeded to engage in incoherent ramblings about how terrible I am. It reduced me to a puddle of tears. Thinking about going LC and unsure of where to begin. 

Today my parents called me. It was a disaster. I've been grey-rocking them for a while (though it's difficult!) because I don't consider them to be safe people to open up to. Well, they've wisened up to the technique and today was the confrontation. 

&gt;Father calls at 12:07. I'm in the bathroom so I call back at 12:20. 

We exchange pleasantries. ""How are you?"" ""Oh, I'm fine, nothing major going on. We're having a debate party on Monday and hanging out with friends today so blah blah."" 

&gt;Background: I'm currently unemployed, looking for a job. My husband and I moved right after we got married to a new state where neither of us have any connections. He started school immediately and I've been taking care of home stuff. We've been here for 1 month. 

Mother: ""We need to have a conversation."" *""conversation"" is her word for ""criticize"" when it comes to me*

Naysnay: ""Uh, ok. About what.""

Mother: ""You're not doing enough to find a job. You don't ask for help and you're not doing what we tell you to do. You need to contact more people and do x, y, and z. Do you even want to get into medical school? What are you doing about that? WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT ANYTHING YOU ARE DOING UNLESS WE ASK (lol, whut). Do you even want to go to medical school. You know, it's way harder than you think it is. All you do is sit around all day. Even transitioning from my PhD to my masters took a solid 6 months of work.""
 
&gt;Yeah, Mom was close to her PhD and instead chose to submit for a masters degree. Some days that's my fault (born while she was working on it -- I was planned so I have no idea why that's on me), some days it's her ingenuity and forethought. I guess today was an ""ingenuity"" day.

Naysnay: ""Ok. I am talking to different people though like {their friends kid/ my friend who is in med school} and {another friend who is going through the process}.""

Mother: ""Your friends don't know everything. *THESE ARE THE SAME FRIENDS THEY ARE DEMANDING I TALK TO*. You worked with that doctor for a long time and it doesn't seem like anything came of it.""

&gt; I worked with a Psychiatrist for a couple of years as an intern. I got to help with patient exams and hear people's stories. I learned a lot about psychiatry and patients. I also got published and presented at a major conference. I got the internship myself and did all of the work myself. I dedicated many weekends to working on my study because 1) it was awesome and 2) it was an escape from them. She looooves to belittle all of the work I did with the doctor to me but she also posted my publication on facebook because, well, narc. 
 
Mother: ""You never take our calls you're always busy."" *Now, do you think that might have something to do with you calling at noon on a Saturday? I might be busy, you know.* 

&gt;I checked my call logs. I have alternated between them calling me or me calling them every 3-5 days this month. But I never call/talk to them. Uh..

Mother: ""You never share anything with us. I don't know WHY you never share anything with us or tell us what you're doing.""

Naysnay: ""I don't like to share things if they're not happening yet."" 

Mother: ""YOU NEED TO BE TELLING US EVERYTHING. We are your parents. I thought we had a close relationship *If we had a close relationship, why have you been yelling at me for this same exact thing since I was 11?!* and other people might not tell their parents everything but I thought we were closer than that. You should WANT to share things with us. I don't know why you don't. We're just your PARENTS who love and support you with EVERYTHING. *anyone else laughing at this point?* WHY don't you want to tell us everything. Why can't you tell us ""oh I'm applying for a job here, here's what I've done...etc.""? *What? I don't even tell my husband everywhere I'm applying for jobs because...why bother until I have an interview* You are.../voice breaks/

She got emotional and stormed off, giving the phone to my dad. My dad says two or three inconsequential sentences to me and I shove the phone to my husband. They chat about lunch or something and the call ends. I start crying (really hysterical sobbing almost) because I'm a mess and she really upset me.  

I went to take a shower and get ready for the day. They called me back. My husband texted them that I was in the shower. They asked if I was okay. He texted no, which was the absolute truth. They insisted I call them back after lunch/ ""when I have time"" (guilt trip). I ignored them and we went out to lunch. I called them around 3 because I didn't have a good reason for NOT calling them/ I'm not ready to tell them that they're bad for me and I don't want to hear from them yet. It's true, I'm just not ready to say it. I spoke to my mother for ~5 minutes. She asked if I was ok. I said, ""I am now."". Then we talked about the weather/other random things. 

Oh! I told her that we're having a debate party on Monday, which I'm really excited for because it's our first party as a married couple which is a big deal to me. She said, ""Oh, we're not in to the election this year."" She and dad have watched every debate and all of the commentary so far. We know because we often watched it with them!! UGH, Narcs! To be fair, I think they're not interested in this election because they've been shamed out of voting for Donald ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese"" Trump. 

I had literally the most useless conversation and then that was it. So now I don't know what to do. I'm thinking about going LC with them but I also want to write them something so they know what they did. But I think it would just fuel their victim complex. Frustrating. "

I would like to secure a summer internship at one of the Big 4 to see what sort of work atmosphere I'd like to work in! I am just worried that I'll offend my current and near future employer if they see me speaking to other firms and will fire/renege on their offer. Any tips? Thanks!"
54fza3,2,2016-09-25,21 [M4F] - Starting Over [Science],burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/54fza3/21_m4f_starting_over_science/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question]().

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people; five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
54g0ng,1,2016-09-25,Seeking advice.1 week field report. More free time and more interaction with girls.,improvingme2,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/54g0ng/seeking_advice1_week_field_report_more_free_time/,"So I just hit my 7 day mark!
I don't know why this reboot is very different to the first one I did. I am not thinking about watching porn at all and I don't have sudden urges (probably because I am not in my room so much and because I am not studying but doing and internship).

During this week I have gone out with more girls than for the past 8 months! I got lucky with one in day 4 but I didn't have a condom so (c'est la vie). Anyways, I can handle conversations with girls in a smoother manner now that porn is not in my life (I don't know why? If someone can tell me please let me know). Instead of just focusing on trying to go to bed directly with the girl (which is something the porn unfortunately taught me.) I have more complex conversations that I believe satisfy the girl's and my intellectual side much more.

I am taking a scientific approach towards my rebooting and there is always alcohol when I go out to meet girls. So I will discontinue that so I measure if my ""ED"" symptoms have decreased. If anyone has any recommendations on how to proceed or want to share your experiences please comment.

Thank you and Chive on Guys."
54g1dx,18,2016-09-25,The Burning Ship Connection,blaze_holejammer,Smaude,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smaude/comments/54g1dx/the_burning_ship_connection/,"Well, I don't really know how to call this ""connection"" I just discovered, but the best name I could come up with is the **Burning Ship Connection** - or maybe **Smaude Turnwood** would be a better idea, I don't know. But anyway, I just thought I would share this because I think is so fun to think about these series of coincidences, and I know there are some cross-fans between Sourcefed and Rooster Teeth.


I'll start by saying that if you don't follow both companies, you should at least vaguely know some of these people: Burnie Burns, co-founder of Rooster Teeth; Ashley Jenkins, the main person behind the news channel *The Know*; Gavin Free, member of RT, Achievement Hunter and part of the *Slow Mo Guys*; Ryan Haywood, member of Achievement Hunter and, obviously, Meg Turney, and Sam and Maude. If not, you can look them up online.

I'll also say that previous to *ALL* of this, I was never a ""shipper"", or liked shipping people - especially real people, but as any of us Smaude shippers are currently aware, when the chemistry between two people on camera is so unbelievably good, that sort of develops naturally.


So, I'm a long Rooster Teeth fan, and my first ship ever with real people was between two RT personalities: *Turnwood* - Meg Turney and Ryan Haywood. Now, at the time, I didn't watch Sourcefed content yet, so I didn't really know Meg Turney from those days, and for those of us who are RT fans, we know how much Meg and Ryan were shipped - or at least, there was the jokes, which were really fun, btw.

That's when the whole idea of shipping opened up for me, really. That's when I *really* understood it - especially because they were obviously never gonna be together (Ryan is married, and Meg is with Gavin Free). Regardless of their relationship, Meg and Ryan were so good together, I couldn't get enough of it. They show together (*Free Play*) was soo fun, and as Meg eventually left Rooster Teeth, that kinda died off; but when there's so much chemistry like that, it never really dies, and Meg and Ryan still get in touch with each other and stream together constantly.


So, cut back to now, now watching Sourcefed content, and here I am again, shipping two real people: this time, Sam and Maude. One day, I thinking about all of this, and both of these ships, and I started to notice some similarities, so I decided to piece all together for fun:


* Meg started her career with a hosting gig in DeviantArt. Maude started her career with a hosting gig in Nickelodeon.


* Ryan started on the early days of Achievement Hunter as a programmer/channel manager, and eventually became a on-camera personality. Sam started on the early days of Sourcefed as an intern, and eventually became a on-camera personality.


* Ryan and Meg have a age difference of 7 years (36-29). Maude and Sam have a age difference of 7 years (30-23).


* Sam is a female audience favorite, and is known for flubbing words constantly. Ryan is a female audience favorite, and is known for flubbing words constantly.


* Maude and Sam became known for their chemistry as hosts, and often got their ships mentioned in their show (Sourcefednerd/Bloopers). Meg and Ryan became known for their chemistry as host, and often got their ships mentioned in their show (Free Play).


* Not long after the height in their ship's popularity, Meg leaves Rooster Teeth. Not long after the height in their ship's popularity, Maude leaves SourcefedNerd.


* Sam has a background in Musical Teather. Ryan has a background in Theater.


* Both Maude and Meg have mentioned having Star Wars BlackMilk dresses.


For those who know the RT website, there is premium content there (for the called ""FIRST members""). Very recently, Burnie uploaded a vlog of when he went to the Emmys this year, and on his time there (Los Angeles) he also went on the premiere of the Grace Helbig/Hannah Hart's movie, which Maude was also at (if you seen her twitter), and was actually invited by Burnie himself. In this vlog he also talks about how he met Maude, and we also learn that:


* Maude knew Ashley (Burnie's current fiancée) before and was introduced to Burnie through her. (From what I gathered) Meg also knew Ashley before she met Burnie.

* In 2012, when Burnie first went on a date with Ashley, she was actually with Maude, and Burnie brought in Gavin to ""wingman him and just talk to"" Maude. Gavin was said to be ""intimidaded by Maude"", and bolted.

* Circa 2013, Gavin starts dating Meg Turney.


So that's why I decided to call the ""Burning Ship Connection"", mainly because of Burnie Burns, him being this ""central link"" to all of this (although Gavin and Ashley also kinda are). But anyway, I just though it would share this with you guys."
54g7ov,2,2016-09-25,I [21F] don't really feel like my boyfriend [24M] is supportive of me...like at all [2 years],Throwaway888918,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54g7ov/i_21f_dont_really_feel_like_my_boyfriend_24m_is/,"Hey everyone, so this has been on my mind a lot recently and I figured I'd get some opinions. Throwaway because reasons. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for around two years now. We're sort of long distance as he is gone working during regular week and only comes home during the weekend (travels to another state). He's moving up there next month, but he's not sure how long he will be there because he wants to move to another state after that. He will move again as soon as his company opens a position in his dream state.

Overall out relationship is pretty alright. We have a lot of the same hobbies, interests, sleep schedule, sense of humor, etc. We do not live together. Distance has definitely put a strain on it though. We do the best we can with the time we have together. So onto the actual post.

I really feel like he puts me down about things I do and enjoy. Like a lot. He's got depression and is very cynical so I'm not sure if that's the problem but I'll give you some examples. He rides motorcycles, and I've always been interested so I got my own to ride with him. I love it so far. I've been riding for like a year so I'm a still learning and have dropped it once. He can't seem to let this go and constantly tells me I ""suck"" at riding. When we ride together he constantly looks back at me to make sure I haven't ""crashed"" and when we stop at gas stations he will sometimes say things like ""I can't believe you made it through that on ramp. I was worried you ate it back there when you didn't catch up."" Keep in mind he rides a 600cc and I have a little 250 so of course he is going way faster than me. 

We play dungeons and dragons together often, which I really enjoy. I used to run (DM) but haven't played in a long time, like two years or so. We recently started playing with his friend so I made a character and had a lot of questions about the class and how the game worked. While we were talking he looked at me and said, ""I have no idea how the fuck you ran this game if you don't know how it works."" I almost started crying when he said this because it really hurt my feelings but I manned up and played anyway.

He also hates my career field. I am in graduate school for social work and have worked my ass off for this field. I finished undergrad with a great GPA and was accepted into my schools one year masters program for my MSW, which only lets in like 25 people a year. I'll be graduating in May with my Masters which I am proud of myself for.

However, he takes pot shots at my field all the time. He tells me I'll get paid like garbage, and that none of the work I do with my clients matters at the end of the day. I currently work in a maximum security psychiatric hospital deal with adults with criminal charges and serious mental illness. I get it's not ideal for some people but I LOVE working with this population and leave work feeling very fulfilled. However he tells me that I'm ""putting myself in danger for no reason"" and asked, ""Do you really feel like coloring with these guys twice a week will make them any less crazy? Wake up."" One time he yelled at me about going out on the ward with my patients to color with them (I do it twice a week). We have some dangerous people on the ward but there are security and staff around and nothing happened. However my boyfriend was pissed I ""put myself at risk like that"" and hung up the phone on me.

I recently have been looking at applying for a social work internship with the military when I graduate. It's a six year commitment but they have loan repayment and they fund me getting my social work license (10k at least if I have to pay for it). I've always wanted to join and mentioned to him I was thinking about applying and he freaked out again and told me that I'd ""hate the military"" and that I ""wouldn't make it through OCS anyway, knowing you"" (I'd be going to BOLC which is different) so there's no point in applying (I do need to work on my cardio but I am in shape at 5'7 and 135 pounds). My dad, cousin, and his wife, who are former Navy and Marines, are very excited for me, and are encouraging me to apply. I'd get paid more than in the private sector and be able to leave my hometown, so I'm definitely looking into it especially since it doesn't look like we'd be living together any time soon due to his desire to get to his home state.

Maybe I'm wrong but I feel like a boyfriend should be more encouraging and supportive. I just feel put down a lot and don't really find myself wanting to do much with him anymore because I get worried he will shit on me. Especially after this military thing (which would be great for my career) I'm kind of getting tired of it. I don't feel like I'm allows to be my own person anymore, you know? He didn't used to be like this, but he's gotten way more cynical and short with me since he started his new position about a year ago. I feel like I can't even talk to him without him getting angry or shitting on me. I haven't even told him about my days at work in weeks because he just gets mad about me working there.

I'm considering breaking up with him when he moves in a month or so, but how he used to be holds me back a little bit because there are times when he's fun to be around and helps me out (buying me tires for my bike, etc). Reddit, do you guys think this is salvageable it should I just end it when he moves?

Tl;dr: boyfriend shits on me about hobbies and constantly tells me I suck at them. He also doesn't like my career choice and tells me that my job (social work) doesn't matter. I was considering applying to Army AMEDD for social work but he essentially told me not to bother because I wouldn't make it through training anyway, even though the rest of my family is very encouraging. He's constantly negative about all my choices. ShouId I break up when he moves or is this worth salvaging? He didn't used to be like this. Thanks in advance. Edit: sorry for typos on mobile"

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

I live in the state of Missouri and I'm currently a high school senior. I'm going to apply to both Mizzou and Missouri S&amp;T for Computer Science and I'm fairly sure I'll get into both.

My parents really want me to go to S&amp;T mainly because of its level of reputation for engineering. I toured Mizzou a month ago, and I enjoyed the campus very much. The size, and resources were very appealing to me. I just toured Missouri S&amp;T yesterday, and also enjoyed it, but the campus was lacking when compared to Mizzou (I.E. not as lively). It was still good overall though. 

I was just wondering what other students thought about both the schools. To guide me in my decision, I have several questions for Mizzou Engineering Students:  

1. Is there anyone here who got accepted into Mizzou and Missouri S&amp;T and chose Mizzou? If so, why?

2. How hard are the classes? As in, are they academically challenging? (because my dad is ""convinced"" that Mizzou is a ""Party"" School)

3. Are the recruitment opportunities good? As in, how are the Career Fairs?

4. If you are a junior or senior have you been able to get internships?

5. How are the engineering clubs (whether it be for a specific major, or in general), and how have you enjoyed them?

6. Personally, how have you enjoyed your experience so far?

But having no network and opportunities to do any internships (I lived alone all through university and had to work full time customer service to support myself) has left me struggling to get started.

I got offered a position in an industry leading company a few months ago but on their sales team (it’s a foot in the door, so I’m happy with it) but I’m very bad at it. I’m not a sales person, I’m realising that now. I can’t deal with people and I can’t push a sale.

My numbers are consistently low (although I’m 50% to my target after 3 months and we were told not to expect to hit until 6/7 months so I consider myself to be on track).  I get crazy customers who waste hours of my time with no result which also goes against my conversion statistics. I would estimate that 60% of my customers ghost me. I have good weeks and bad weeks (which everyone does, and I am new so I expect my numbers to be low for now).

I don’t want to be in sales forever (I don’t want to be in sales at all- I don’t have the patience for customer service) but I thought it would be a gateway to other departments in our company. I get the feeling I’m going to be fired though.

Long story short; I recently discovered I have a mental condition which makes me… spacy. I’ve been making mistakes and not been able to effectively prioritise my work load because of it (this was prior to diagnosis/treatment). Every time an error has happened however I have taken ownership, apologised, and asked how to avoid doing it again so that I can improve my performance and be better within our company.

It’s not my performance that worries me, because I believe that people can see that I really am trying. It’s an office clique and their knock-on effect.

We have a “work” mentor- which is a more senior member of the sales team. Now our mentor has taken a disliking towards me because I’m too independent. The others who started with me worship her and rely on her for everything whereas I am a very independent person who thinks for myself. I don’t bother her constantly for advice and help which she doesn’t like and when I do make mistakes (or misunderstand something) she enjoys watching me get in trouble for it because I didn’t ask her first.

The mentor, I (and a few others) have noticed, is also trying to skew my sales on purpose. She has given away my customers for petty reasons, ran to managers with mistakes rather than helping me, tries to publicly humiliate and speak down to me on internal communications, and generally acts quite malicious under the disguise of “helping”. 

But what makes it all worse is that she is best friends with our general manager. Our general manager is also the one I have all of my appraisals with- so I know that her opinion of me has already been damaged because of what our mentor tells her when they’re together. I feel like our mentor has a negative opinion of me because I don’t view her as a supervisor (she isn’t- she’s the same job as me, just been there a year longer) and do not rely on her as much as she would like to stroke her ego- and as a result of this our general manager is on the lookout for mistakes for me because the mentor has told her I’m a huge fuck up.

And I know that this is happening because our office manager asked the people who sit near how they think my performance is because she was concerned- only for my deskmates to all confirm that they think I’m adapting fast, doing a great job, and they’re all impressed with how well I am doing for someone with no experience and that I can’t be compared to someone with 5+ years in the industry.  I feel like I’m being pushed out of a job before I actually have chance to settle- I understand that newbies make mistakes but I feel that they’re being very petty and looking for mistakes now.

I don’t know how to proceed- every time my mentor is in I feel anxious and full of dread. I want to stay and work my way into a different department but I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance if she manages to push me out and keep ruining my reputation. I’m also not the only person this is happening to but she is also in a position where she cannot say/do anything because of their relationship.

TL;DR Mentor hates me and she’s BFFs with our Manager which is screwing over my chances to improve and move one because now I’m on their watch list."

Il fronte popolare del Pt ha spianato la strada alla reazione di destra

Impeachment in Brasile: gli operai non hanno un lato

Rompere con il Pt! Per un partito operaio rivoluzionario!

Lo scorso mese il parlamento brasiliano ha approvato l’inizio della procedura di impeachment nei confronti del presidente Dilma Rousseff, sulla scia di uno scandalo per la corruzione che ha scosso il Paese. Dal 2002 il Brasile è stato governato dal Partido dos Trabalhadores (Pt – Partito dei lavoratori) a capo di una serie di coalizioni di collaborazione di classe, guidate prima dal suo fondatore, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva e poi dalla Rousseff. Rousseff ora è accusata di imbrogli contabili volti a nascondere i buchi di bilancio dello Stato. Alla testa degli attacchi contro Rousseff ci sono gli ex alleati di coalizione del Pt, molti dei quali sono a loro volta indagati o sotto accusa per corruzione. Tra di loro c’è il vicepresidente Michel Temer, del partito borghese Pmdb, destinato a sostituire Rousseff qualora venisse sospesa o deposta.

Il blocco che governa il Brasile è un esempio di “fronte popolare”: una coalizione di collaborazione tra le classi in cui uno o più partiti operai si uniscono a forze borghesi per governare per conto dei capitalisti. Noi ci opponiamo per principio a queste coalizioni borghesi. I partiti operai riformisti come il Pt esprimono una contraddizione di classe tra la loro base proletaria e il programma filocapitalista dei loro dirigenti. Ma quando entrano a far parte di un’alleanza di fronte popolare, questa contraddizione di classe viene soppressa a vantaggio della borghesia, a garanzia del fatto che mentre sono al potere, questi partiti non oltrepasseranno i limiti di ciò che è accettabile per la classe dominante. L’esperienza del governo del Pt non fa che confermarlo.

Per più di cinque anni il governo Rousseff ha inflitto una serie di attacchi ai lavoratori, imponendo misure di austerità e tagli alla spesa sociale e attaccando gli operai in sciopero e i contadini che protestavano contro la confisca delle loro terre. Questi attacchi sono venuti sulla scia di quasi un decennio di dure restrizioni imposte dall’Fmi sotto la supervisione dell’ex dirigente sindacale Lula, che da presidente si è rivelato un valido servitore sia per gli imperialisti che per la borghesia brasiliana. Il Pt di Lula ha usato la sua autorità sul movimento operaio per attuare politiche neoliberiste che non erano riuscite nemmeno ai suoi predecessori di destra. Allo stesso tempo, la prima fase del governo del Pt ha coinciso con un boom a scala mondiale dei prezzi delle materie prime, di cui il Brasile è uno dei principali esportatori. Di conseguenza il Pt ha potuto distribuire qualche briciola, come i pagamenti in contanti ai poveri (Bolsa Família) e l’aumento dei salari minimi.

Ma il boom è finito da un pezzo. Negli ultimi due anni il Brasile ha conosciuto la più grave crisi economica da decenni. Oltre che nella campagna per l’impeachment, sia gli alleati che i nemici di Rousseff sono impelagati anche nell’inchiesta Lava Jato (Autolavaggio) sui traffici di tangenti e il riciclaggio di denaro sporco che vedevano coinvolta la compagnia petrolifera di Stato, Petrobras.

La maggioranza della popolazione considera i politici del paese come un covo di ladri. Data la situazione di instabilità politica e il crescere della povertà, il Pt è molto discreditato agli occhi della sua base operaia. Il malcontento si è espresso nelle proteste del 2013, scatenate inizialmente dall’aumento delle tariffe dei mezzi di trasporto ma che si sono poi estese ad includere le folli spese del governo per gli stadi dei mondiali, lo stato deplorevole dell’assistenza sanitaria e dell’educazione e la violenza della polizia. I partiti dell’opposizione di destra hanno approfittato dell’insoddisfazione popolare per condurre una vasta campagna contro il Pt.

Con le elezioni in vista per l’anno successivo, Rousseff ha cercato di ottenere l’appoggio della base del Pt promettendo di migliorare le condizioni di vita dei lavoratori e dei poveri. Ma dopo la sua risicata rielezione nel 2014, si è subito rimangiata le promesse fatte, imponendo l’austerità mentre il Paese continuava a sprofondare nella recessione. Di conseguenza, i lavoratori e gli oppressi si sono demoralizzati e smobilitati, incoraggiando ulteriormente la destra, compresi gli alleati di governo del Pt. Le attuali manifestazioni contro il governo, cui partecipano milioni di persone, sono capeggiate da fazioni politiche reazionarie spalleggiate dall’oligarchia mediatica e da gruppi di affaristi filo-americani.

Rousseff e i fedelissimi del Pt condannano l’impeachment definendolo un “atto violento” contro la “democrazia” e presentandolo falsamente come un colpo di Stato. Questi argomenti sono molto efficaci nel creare allarmismo e paura in una società in cui sono ancora vividi i ricordi delle sofferenze inflitte dal sanguinario regime militare creato dal golpe del 1964. Temendo l’ascesa al potere della destra, molti operai hanno partecipato alle manifestazioni contro la cacciata di Rousseff. Queste proteste, con tanto di bandiere rosse e contingenti della sinistra e dei sindacati (soprattutto quelli appartenenti alla Central Única dos Trabalhadores) vengono usate dal Pt per ricondurre la rabbia degli operai nell’alveo del sostegno al fronte popolare. Intanto però i dirigenti del Pt hanno cercato di scongiurare l’impeachment offrendo incarichi ministeriali a vari partitini borghesi in cambio del loro “No” al congresso.

In questo momento il Brasile non si trova di fronte a un colpo di Stato militare per rovesciare il governo, ma a delle sordide manovre del parlamento per rimuovere il presidente. Opporsi all’impeachment di Rousseff equivarrebbe ad un voto di fiducia, cioè ad un sostegno poitico, al fronte popolare capeggiato dal Pt. D’altra parte, appoggiare l’impeachment significherebbe sostenere le forze politiche di destra che tramano contro Rousseff. Come marxisti, fautori dell’indipendenza politica del proletariato, noi diciamo che la classe operaia non ha un lato in questo conflitto.

Quello che la borghesia riuscirà ad ottenere con i suoi attacchi agli operai, sarà deciso dal livello di resistenza e di lotta della classe operaia. Il proletariato brasiliano è la sola forza che abbia il potere sociale di guidare la lotta per tutti gli oppressi, dai poveri delle favelas nelle metropoli, alle donne, ai contadini senza terra. Questa prospettiva richiede la costruzione di un partito operaio rivoluzionario, che lotti per strappare la base proletaria del Pt e dei sindacati alle loro attuali direzioni, nel corso della lotta per la rivoluzione socialista e per il potere operaio.

Il Gruppo internazionalista: coda di sinistra del fronte popolare

Tra le versioni più combattive di collaborazionismo di classe in Brasile c’è quella propugnata dalla Liga Quarta-Internacionalista do Brasil (Lqb), affiliata al Gruppo internazionalista (Gi) degli Usa. Come tutto il resto della sinistra brasiliana, anche loro hanno la linea di “No all’impeachment”, che costituisce un voto di sostegno politico al fronte popolare di Rousseff (www.internationalist.org, aprile 2016). Pur non usando queste testuali parole, anche il Gi e la Lqb non fanno che ripetere la propria versione del ritornello di tutta la sinistra sul “golpe giudiziario”, agitando lo spettro dell’arrivo al potere di uno “stato forte bonapartista dominato dalla polizia e dai tribunali”, cioè di una dittatura militare poliziesca, se Rousseff venisse sollevata dal suo incarico. Per mascherare la loro difesa di un governo borghese, il Gi e la Lqb abbondano con gli appelli alle occupazioni di fabbrica e allo sciopero generale e sostengono persino di opporsi politicamente al governo.

Ma nella pratica, la loro posizione non è che una forma leggermente mascherata del più classico opportunismo, che consiste nel fare appello alla “lotta contro la destra”. Nel momento stesso in cui strepitano cinicamente sulla minaccia del “bonapartismo”, il Gi e la Lqb ammettono che un golpe in Brasile in realtà è improbabile “perché con l’impeachment la destra otterrebbe il suo obiettivo principale”. Per quanto condannino ritualmente il fronte popolare o chiedano di non votarlo, i centristi del Gi e della Lqb non fanno che offrire delle giustificazioni all’apparenza marxiste per la linea adottata da gran parte della sinistra riformista: salviamo il governo Rousseff.

Il Gi e la Lqb ammettono che il Pt ha portato molti attacchi alla classe operaia, “alcuni dei quali nemmeno la dittatura militare aveva osato tentare”. Ma sostengono lo stesso che un governo dei partiti parlamentari alla destra del Pt costituirebbe un pericolo qualitativamente maggiore rispetto al fronte popolare. Il Gi e la Lqb, per quanto glielo consentono le loro modeste forze, contribuiscono a tenere in piedi l’alleanza di collaborazione di classe che ha spianato la strada alla reazione di destra.

Il Gi e la Lqb pontificano che “se vince la destra bonapartista, essa avrà dietro di sé tutta la forza dell’apparato giudiziario e poliziesco”. Come se il governo di fronte popolare del Pt non abbia usato ripetutamente “l’apparato giudiziario e poliziesco” contro gli operai e i poveri! Andassero a raccontarlo alle masse miserabili in prevalenza nere delle favelas che ogni giorno subiscono il terrore della polizia. All’inizio dell’anno il governo Rousseff ha approvato una draconiana legge anti-terrorismo che rafforza i poteri repressivi dello Stato contro le proteste sociali.

Lo Stato borghese, il cui nucleo è costituito dall’esercito, la polizia, il sistema carcerario e i tribunali, esiste per difendere gli interessi della classe dominante borghese contro i lavoratori e gli oppressi. Da parte sua, nel 1996 la Lqb non si è fatta scrupoli ad invitare lo Stato capitalista a intervenire all’interno dei sindacati, intentando una serie di cause legali (si legga: “I documenti del tribunale provano che hanno fatto causa al sindacato. La montatura brasiliana del Gi: mani sporche, cinismo e menzogne”, in Workers Vanguard n. 671, 11 luglio 1997).

L’intera storia del leninismo e del trotskismo è consistita in una lotta contro la collaborazione di classe e per l’indipendenza politica della classe operaia. Fu grazie a questo che il Partito bolscevico poté guidare gli operai al potere in Russia nell’ottobre del 1917. Dopo la Rivoluzione di Febbraio, che rovesciò la monarchia zarista, i partiti dei menscevichi e dei socialrivoluzionari parteciparono ad un governo di coalizione con delle forze borghesi. I bolscevichi di V.I. Lenin condannarono queste azioni come un tradimento del proletariato e rifiutarono di fornire qualsiasi appoggio al governo capeggiato da Alexander Kerensky.

Per dare una parvenza di ortodossia alla loro posizione sull’impeachment, il Gi e la Lqb, in un breve articolo disponibile per ora solo in portoghese, invocano uno degli aspetti della Rivoluzione russa: il tentativo di colpo di Stato militare dell’agosto del 1917 del generale Kornilov per rovesciare il governo borghese di Kerensky, spazzar via i soviet e schiacciare la rivoluzione. I bolscevichi reagirono facendo appello ad un fronte unico di tutte le organizzazioni operaie per sconfiggere l’offensiva controrivoluzionaria, combattendo con le armi a fianco delle truppe di Kerensky, ma senza cessare di opporsi al governo.

L’articolo del Gi/Lqb sul colpo di Stato di Kornilov riconosce la posizione dei bolscevichi, ma solo per far sparire, con un giochetto di prestigio, la distinzione tra difesa militare e appoggio politico, per giustificare la loro capitolazione al governo di fronte popolare in Brasile! Il loro articolo elenca le molte differenze tra la situazione attuale in Brasile e quella della Russia nell’agosto del 1917: la Russia era in guerra, attraversava una situazione rivoluzionaria, esistevano i soviet ed un partito rivoluzionario di massa. Ma omettono disonestamente una differenza importante: gli operai russi si trovavano a fronteggiare un vero colpo di Stato militare, mentre gli operai brasiliani confrontano molta aria fritta su di un colpo di Stato che serve solo a far appoggiare un governo borghese.

Un anno dopo l’adozione da parte dell’Internazionale comunista stalinizzata della politica dei fronti popolari (o “Fronti del popolo”) al suo settimo congresso del 1935, il leader bolscevico Leon Trotsky sottolineò che:

“Dal febbraio all’ottobre, i menscevichi e i socialrivoluzionari, che offrono un parallelo molto buono con i ‘comunisti’ e coi socialdemocratici, erano in un’alleanza strettissima e in una coalizione permanente con il partito borghese dei cadetti, con i quali formarono tutta una serie di governi di coalizione. Sotto il segno di questo fronte popolare si trovava tutta la massa del popolo, compresi i consigli di operai, contadini e soldati. Senza dubbio i bolscevichi presero parte ai consigli. Ma non fecero la minima concessione al fronte popolare. La loro rivendicazione era quella di rompere questo fronte popolare, di distruggere l’alleanza coi cadetti e di creare un vero governo operaio e contadino” (Leon Trotsky, “La sezione olandese e l’Internazionale”, 15-16 luglio 1936).

Per i marxisti la distinzione tra difesa militare e appoggio politico riveste un’importanza vitale. Durante la Guerra civile spagnola (1936-39) il fronte popolare collaborò al soffocamento di una rivoluzione operaia, spianando la strada alla vittoria delle forze del generale Francisco Franco. All’epoca i trotskisti davano appoggio militare alla parte repubblicana contro Franco e i fascisti spagnoli. Nel 1937, Max Shachtman, un militante di spicco del Socialist Workers Party americano, sostenne che si dovevano appoggiare i crediti di guerra del governo di fronte popolare capeggiato dal primo ministro socialista Juan Negrín. Shachtman chiese: “Come possiamo negare un milione di pesetas all’acquisto di fucili per il fronte?”

In una lettera del 1937, Trotsky insistette che l’unica posizione corretta era quella di “votare contro” il bilancio militare. La sua spiegazione era che:

“un voto alla finanziaria in parlamento non costituisce un aiuto ‘concreto’ ma un atto di solidarietà politica (...). Tutte le azioni del governo Negrín sono all’insegna delle necessità della guerra. Se accettiamo di prenderci la responsabilità politica del modo in cui il governo gestisce le necessità della guerra, voteremmo politicamente a favore di qualsiasi proposta governativa (...). In simili condizioni, come potremmo prepararci al rovesciamento del governo Negrín?” (Lettera a James P. Cannon”, 21 settembre 1937).

Opponendosi all’impeachment, il Gi seppellisce la linea di classe, sostituendovi il criterio della contrapposizione tra “progressisti e reazionari”, criterio che è stato sempre usato per sostenere che, opponendosi ai governi borghesi di sinistra, i marxisti aiutano la destra. Quest’accusa fu lanciata in un classico caso di opposizione al fronte popolare. Nel 1964, l’allora dirigente trotskista Edmund Samarakkody e un suo compagno votarono a favore di un emendamento presentato da un politico di destra, che portò alla caduta di un governo di fronte popolare a Ceylon (l’attuale Sri Lanka). Quest’azione coraggiosa e coerente con in principi, fu oggetto di discussione alla Prima conferenza internazionale della Tendenza spartachista, nel 1979. Samarakkody aveva finito col pentirsi (a torto) il suo voto del 1964. I nostri compagni invece difesero la sua decisione del 1964: una possibilità migliore per Samarakkody sarebbe stata quella di attaccare le procedure parlamentari e uscire dal parlamento. Opponendosi al pentimento di Samarakkody, l’attuale capo del Gi Jan Norden, che all’epoca era un militante di spicco della nostra tendenza, disse giustamente:

“Un’altra obiezione comune alla nostra politica di opposizione proletaria al fronte popolare è l’accusa di aiutare la destra. Ma fino a quando non siamo in grado di rovesciare il governo esistente, qualunque tipo di opposizione ad un governo di fronte popolare in carica sarà esposta all’attacco di aiutare la destra”. (“Nessun ‘sostegno critico’ alla politica di fronte popolare”, in Spartaco n.3, febbraio 1981).

Ma ne è passata di acqua sotto i ponti. Da vent’anni Norden è uscito dalla nostra organizzazione con una manciata di seguaci e da allora si è spostato costantemente a destra, pur continuando a coprirsi le terga con una retorica pseudo-combattiva.

La classe operaia non ha alcun interesse in comune con gli sfruttatori e con gli oppressori capitalisti. La Lci è stata l’unica forza a lottare con coerenza per portare questa concezione al proletariato nel recente periodo che ha visto dei governi borghesi di sinistra in America Latina (frontepopulisti come in Brasile o populisti come in Venezuela ed altrove). Più di tredici anni di governo del Pt forniscono un esempio chiarissimo della lezione che Marx trasse dalla Comune di Parigi del 1871: il proletariato non può usare a proprio vantaggio la macchina dello Stato capitalista, ma deve spezzarla con una rivoluzione socialista e sostituirla con uno Stato operaio.

Per liberare il potenziale rivoluzionario del proletariato brasiliano è necessaria la costruzione di un partito internazionalista rivoluzionario, che si basi sulla prospettiva della rivoluzione socialista nelle Americhe e nel resto del mondo, specialmente nel cuore stesso dell’imperialismo, gli Stati Uniti. Solo la rivoluzione socialista mondiale, gettando le basi per una pianificazione socialista a scala internazionale, può consentire uno sviluppo economico qualitativo ai paesi che ora si trovano sotto il tallone degli imperialisti. La Lci si batte per riforgiare la Quarta intern azionale di Trotsky, lo strumento indispensabile per portare la coscienza comunista al proletariato e condurlo al potere alla testa di tutti gli oppressi.

54iav0,3,2016-09-25,How I manage anything is beyond me.,MeaghenHailey,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/54iav0/how_i_manage_anything_is_beyond_me/,"I can't do anything. I don't know how I manage to do what I do manage to do. I can barely take care of myself because everything I need to do is just too much but I don't feel worthy of making sure I have the necessary extra time to do it. I'm in school (just barely) full time and I work (just barely) full time and I don't really have days off unless I blow off my internship so I guess it's reasonable to fall behind a little. But I can't manage anything. I'm lucky if I have my teeth brushed and deodorant on before I walk out the door and manage to be (mostly) on time to work. Say nothing about any sort of skincare routine, makeup, or doing anything with my mess of a hair other than a bun that hopefully catches all the fly-aways. I can't even manage to feed my fucking cats in the morning. If I didn't live with my parents again, I don't know what my poor girls would do. And I have foster kittens I desperately want to keep but my parents just keep reminding me that I can barely take care of the two I already have. And they're right and I feel horrible. But I'm always so tired. I'm physically sore and exhausted and even thinking of doing much more than surviving is so intimidating. Clean the cat litter? Sweep the floor? Do laundry? Maybe if I've had three days off and I've built up enough energy reserves to do anything. But I can't do that every single time I need to do something. How do I think I'm gonna get the promotion I'm going for? And if my some miracle I get it and can finally afford to get my own place, how am I going to maintain it? I have these dreams of a smooth, organized place but I can't bring myself to do anything for it. Even when I'm feeling mildly less like utter shit, and can entertain such thoughts, I know it won't last and I'll never be able to fulfill those dreams. I'm even less self sufficient than I was as a teen and I'm almost twenty fucking five. I just don't understand. I take my antidepressant. But my psychiatrist won't switch it until I get a sleep study done even though I didn't have sleep problems until the god damn Effexor, which isn't even helping. At best I feel flat; at worst, it does nothing and I feel like shit. I see a therapist weekly which has kind of helped with the aftermath of my ex and working through some anxiety that was holding me up with a few things but talk therapy doesn't help that black hole in my chest, the anchor in my stomach, the veil over my eyes, and the wet blanket wrapped around me. I go to the gym twice a week. I wouldn't but I know me so I signed up with a trainer. The accountability makes me go and I've seen some improvement physically. I have some muscles and my cardiovascular endurance has increased. Except when my body decides it's incapable of doing anything and one lap around the gym has me on my ass and I feel too weak at work that I barely manage the 25lb bag of cat food or kneel down and get back up without it also putting me on my ass. Why am I so weak? The one thing where the amount of effort I'm putting in actually feels like the amount of effort I'm putting in. Fuck. And even right this minute, as I'm typing, I'm in the shower. Some people with depression don't shower for days on end. I get in the shower. And promptly sit my ass down and take what satisfaction I can get from the warm water. Maybe I'll get some body wash and half-ass wash the important/ smelly parts. Maybe I'll get my hair wet in the hopes of resetting my curls so tomorrow's bun will be less shitty, even though I know that makes my scalp itchy. Occasionally I even actually shampoo and condition it, if I feel like standing for a few minutes. The other day I got enough gumption to really thoroughly shave. Today? I dunno. Depends how I feel when I finish this. Of course I'll tell my therapist on Wednesday how low I'm feeling tonight. But I don't think she even really understands. I'm so good at faking it and not letting people really see. And that in itself is so exhausting. Therapy is the first thing I do those days and I'm usually in such a rush to put on clothes and get out the door that I can't even acknowledge how I feel until much later so, and this I've explained, I have a hard time explaining to her how shitty I feel. A friend saw it briefly when I zoned out at trivia night. Another friend understands because she's been in a similar place. My parents don't. They know I'm not ok, which is why I think they take care of so much for me. But my mom thinks I just need to take vitamin D and then I can lower the dose of my antidepressant and get off of it. I'm lucky to be able to take what I'm prescribed, let alone the list (vitamins D, B12, C, E; iron; magnesium; flax; idefk what else) I ""should"" take. I think I'm done. I think I shamed myself into washing my hair. But I probably won't dye it until my roots are at my ears because that would require effort and simply existing requires effort and that's a bit of a prerequisite to pretty much everything.

Sorry there's no formatting. But that would require me to have had organized thoughts and we all know how that goes.

One more for good measure.

FUCK."

I went out on a total limb and told her she was pretty and I wanted to hang sometime and handed her my number. I never thought it would have worked, or that we would have been together as my longest relationship thus far, or that I would have fallen that in love with her or that it all would have ended so abruptly. We were away (she lived in NY, I live in NJ) for our third summer, but we had made it through two before so I was used to it, and I thought she was. We were both doing internships, and because of that and how weird my hours were we didn't get to talk alot every day, but I made sure to text her or call her whenever I had free time, and any time I had a day off I would drive up to visit her (she doesn't have her license). I pushed and pushed to the end of the summer when I would be able to see her again, and out of nowhere she dumped me on my last day of work. I drove up to her house to try and fix it but it was no use. She said she had had some doubts and had found other people attractive sometimes, but it always went away when she was with me. I tried to tell her it was normal and that it's not like I never found other people attractive, but she said she wanted to be alone, and she thinks that she will find someone she never has a ""doubt"" about ever. Two weeks passed and I tried my hardest to give her space to work stuff out, but then we had to go back to University. Walking into my senior year alone after expecting to have had her like the past two years and also thinking we were gonna move in together after school (all her initial ideas) is so hard for me. I tried to get her back a few times but she says she's happy now and wants to see other people. She started going on dates with a grad student a week after school started and she claims she doesn't want a relationship so I don't exactly know what their deal is. I think she's just pushing herself over me with him. Regardless, it's been about a month and a half now, and I have made some progress but still wake up feeling like shit every day. I feel betrayed, abandoned, and alone. I have recently started trying to talk to new people since I basically have no other choice, but it sucks because deep down I still think I want her. I still believe that she meant all the things she said and that she might change. I also know I can't let myself believe that. I just hate that she was able to find someone new so easily. I tried a few times and got shot down, and while that doesn't bother me too much it torments me that I can't get my mind off her but she hasn't thought about me in days. Not to mention I've seen her with him a few times on campus and it always makes me want to puke. I want a new relationship, I want to stop caring about her, but I also don't want to end up hurting someone else just because I am hurting right now. I do feel ready to try again, because at this point I know she's never coming back, but I do still miss her and feel like there is no one else for me. Thank you to anyone who read all of this, it mainly felt good just to get it off my chest. Tomorrow is a new day and a new opportunity to heal and meet someone new."

54in8q,4,2016-09-25,Post Break up and dealing with life,Yoreltuollaf,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/54in8q/post_break_up_and_dealing_with_life/,"So this seemed like a good place to do this. I can't really vent to my family and friends because I just cannot put the amount of pain on my mind and soul onto them. Some background info: 20 y/o, male, Senior working on my undergrad.

About a month ago, my girlfriend of just about 11 months broke up with me. Not the longest time, but for me, it was the first time I had truly been in love. I felt as if everything just clicked with her and I could not have been happier. We felt as if everything was going so well, decided to move in with one another and another mutual friend. We saw a few times over the summer, but for the most part it was long distance. Come time to move in, she away at Drill with the National Guard. A week later, I'm moved in and just waiting for her. That weekend, we attended a friend's party, hit the clubs and had a great time for 5 hours. After we go to leave she tells me we need to talk and then breaks up with me. Citing that I was doing things that made her feel crazy, that she felt more comfortable being single.

It was the worst pain in my life. I cannot even begin to describe it, but I'm sure you know how I felt. Against my better judgement, I drove home (I had sobered up from what I was drinking). The next few weeks, I had to force myself to eat, to drink, to move, to basically function as a human being. I lost 10 pounds, 1/16 of my body weight. So much of what I did over the time together was with her, including school clubs I love.

Basically, everything I did had her mark on it. From going to fencing club, eating at restaurants, driving and walking around town, the music I listened to. I couldn't even go home to get away, because the apartment I'm in was picked to allow her dog to stay with us. Sleep held no refuge for me. Every night I would dream of her: we would get back together, we never broke up, it was just a bad dream, she came crying back to me saying it was a mistake, I went crawling to her and she took me back.

She then contacted me three times. I didn't start them but I answered. First it started as asking if I would get rid of the art she made for me. Then it was the whole, I'm still going to be friends with you, which I rejected. I wasn't about to try to be just friends with the girl I gave my heart and soul only to be destroyed. She accused me of being cold for not wanting to continue the relationship. The way she worded it made it sound as if I could have gotten back together with her, but I couldn't let myself do that. That was my last real contact with her.

Fast forward to now. I can honestly say I'm over the break up. Not over her, just the break up. I still have troubles eating more than once a day. I still dread going to sleep because I fear what I might dream of. Hell, I'm writing this now to avoid going to sleep. When I go to the club where we met, Fencing Club, I'm plagued by the ghosts of her in the gym. I still find myself trying to think of the words to say to have stopped her from breaking up with me. I just cannot truly get her out of my mind.

Those are just my problems stemming from her. At my school, I'm in leadership positions in our Fencing Club and Humans V. Zombie Club (Game of Nerf Tag, real fun if you're interested). With Fencing, I am our club's treasurer. I have the wonderful pleasure of trying to deal with the University and they have given me no information, no matter where I ask. I have to figure out how to pay rent for our space, with no help from the University. I have to figure out how to deposit money into the club's account, with no help from the University. I have to figure out how to make $1000 cover $5000- $6000 of expenses for the year, with no help from the University. 

Now for the HvZ club. I'm the Chief Moderator and head the referees of our games. Sadly for me, my ex is still somewhat active in this organization, despite living an hour and half away. I have seen her multiple times during this past month because she came to town to take part in the meetings. Now, one of our moderators accused me of violating rules, which I did not, regarding a vote for a position my ex was running for. I removed myself from the voting during the election to make sure I kept personal life and club life separate. Now I hear rumors that the accusing moderator was causing the trouble just to gain favor from my ex, meaning I gained more trouble and stress in my life because of my ex.

Then on to my classes. I'm in high level classes as I am finishing my studies for a Data Science major, a new major at my University. They are all stressful and require my full attention, but I just don't have the energy to do so. Furthermore, my potential job field is competitive, so I am pressed to find potential internships now, adding just one more thing on my plate.

Then the family. My parents push the internship thing, they don't know what I am going through and don't know the extra stress they are adding. They are doing it because they are looking at my future, and I love them for that, but my current few for the future is rather limited at the time being. My Grandmother is also plagued by cancer and it cannot be defeated. While she is pursuing treatment, it is only a matter of time before she passes and the fear of waking up to a phone call saying that she has moved on is terrible.

All of these events have destroyed my morale, my will to carry on, my ability to wake up, get out of bed, and keep moving. I have my moments of clarity and strength, but they aren't common. The worst part, the part that scares me to the very core, is that I have thought about killing myself multiple time. I drove home and thought about running into the back of a semi at 90 mph. I looked at the shotgun I keep in my room and thought that it looked really friendly. I was able to keep these thoughts from becoming considered as actual options, but the fact that I still had them scares me. Pretty much, I am a broken and hollow man. It's all I can do to keep carrying on. When my friends and family ask how I'm doing, I lie and say I'm alright, but instead I am broken and lost.

I am reminded of the song ""M.I.N.E"" by Five Finger Death Punch and the lyrics: ""It could have been much worse
But it should have been better."" I had all my pieces put into place to ""make life my bitch"" as I so eloquently phrased it to some friends. Yet now, nothing seems right, nothing seems to be going my way and I hate it but I don't know how to change anything. It's tiring. It's painful. It makes me hate my life, yet I know I can't give up. 

I guess that's all I have. I figured I could vent to strangers and you can go about your day and forget about that guy from reddit, but if I went to my friends with this, it'd be a greater burden for them and I can't do that to them. Thanks for reading this super long post.

54ip3g,9,2016-09-25,The Phone [MF] [PHONE SEX] [COWORKER],LiviaFlair,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/54ip3g/the_phone_mf_phone_sex_coworker/,"The other day, I sat in my room crying to myself and wondering what did I do to deserve this. All of this time I had spent supporting him and giving everything I had to our relationship. I sleep alone a lot of nights because he told me that he had to work late. I spent holidays alone because he told me that he had to go out of town for business. Some nights I would cook dinner knowing that his face would be absent from the other end of the table. Sitting on my bed, I became frozen as I stared into the open space in which we used to share. He left me for her, Amy the intern who helped him with all his projects. The look in his eyes as words formed from his lips telling me that he no longer loved me, shocked my heart. As he walked out the door, he turned to me and said, ""Maybe if you lose some weight you can get another man to fuck you."" The door closed and I stood there in silence with petals of tears running down my cheek. How could he just abandon the love that we built over all these years for an intern? Suddenly I went into a deep depression that seem like years but was only for a few weeks.
Sitting at the ice cream parlor, I devoured two big bowls of vanilla fudge. As I put each spoonful into my mouth I cried. The waitress kept asking me am I okay but I would just nod and mumble yes. ""Excuse me may I sit here?"" a deep rough voice said as I held my spoon in mid air. I didn't respond because, I didn't know how to respond. Staring at my bowl I refused to look up and instead shoved the spoonful of ice cream into my mouth. ""So what flavor of ice cream is that?"" he asked as I began to move my head slightly to look up. ""Its vanilla fudge"", I said softly as I began to notice his face.  It was Glen from my job. Glen is a man that all of the ladies follow at work, they love his charm and good looks. His hair is jet black with lots of curls and he has gem colored green eyes. He is handsome but he has never spoken to me before at work and I felt confused about him sitting across from me. ""You haven't been to work in a few days, is everything okay?"", he asks as he dips his spoon into my ice cream bowl. ""I am okay, just been busy"", as reply to him in a soft tone looking at him intensely. How does he know I haven't been to work, this man doesn't know me nor has he ever even acknowledged my existence. ""Btw you have very good choice in ice cream"", as he took another spoonful from my bowl. In my mind I am thinking what does he want from a broken woman and I wished he would go away. Then all of sudden he stood up, ""I'll leave you with your ice cream for now but call me later"" as he placed a card on the table then walked away. I gazed at the card for a moment thinking why would I want to call him. What is he wanting? before I could ask myself anymore questions I quickly grabbed the card and put in my purse.
Later that night, I kept thinking about the card in my purse. If I called him what would we talk about? Him and I have nothing in common at all. So before I scared myself out the whole idea, I took out the card and called him. ""Hello April, how are you this evening"" he said as short breathes pushed into the phone. In disbelief of what is happening, I acknowledged my presence with a soft hello. Silence for a few seconds and he says,""What are you wearing tonight?"" as I could hear breathes escape from his lips while on the phone. Startled at first I began to describe what I was wearing. ""Well I am wearing a black crop top and skirt."" He paused in the midst of his breathing and asked could I remove my top. I wanted to say no and hang up the phone however I slowly began to pull my top over my head. ""You should always be comfortable when talking to me,"" he said as I sat in my chair like a kid waiting for the next instruction. ""Are your nipples hard right now?"" he asked as I began to look down at my curvy breasts. I acknowledged they were hard with a soft, ""Yes."" Then he told me to rub my nipples in circles and tell him how it feels. Feeling a little reluctant, I began to do what he wants, ""My nipples feel soft as I glide my finger over each one,"" I said as my fingers went randomly over my nipples as I sat in my chair firmly. ""My dick is so hard baby, let me rub it all on your nipples,"" as he began to breathe harder into the phone. My pussy began to throb as his voice echoed through my whole body. ""Spread your legs, open that pussy wide, and rub that clit baby,"" he said as I started to hear him stroking his dick up and down. I told him my fingers were rubbing my clit and that he could slide in at any time. He then said to me, ""Let me slide in that fat pussy baby, "" as he began to moan louder in to the phone. My voice started to tremble as I felt that connection of both of us cumming at the same time. ""Cum for me baby,"" he said as I started to moan while rubbing my clit faster and then exploding. He came quickly after me and told me that he had to go. Feeling confused I took it as he used me for his pleasure. I then crawled into my bed and just stared up looking at the ceiling thinking about what I did with Glen over the phone.
The next day I couldn't help but to keep thinking about the phone call with Glen. Then suddenly a stack of papers slammed on my desk at work. ""Glen said to bring this paperwork to him on the third floor,"" the clerk said as I began to pick up the papers. I shuffled off to the third floor and as soon as I stepped off the elevator there was Glen in an empty room naked. He looked at me and smiled then motioned for me to come closer. Standing before him, I looked into his eyes and he said,"" This is my company and you are mine now, close the door.""

54iqml,1,2016-09-25,I feel like I have nothing.,ScrapDraft,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/54iqml/i_feel_like_i_have_nothing/,"I'm 24.  

I have no job despite being out of college for two years now.  I know I went into an unconventional field (audio), but I didn't think there would be absolutely no one willing to hire me.  I mean, I have somewhat of an internship going, but my boss is wanting me around less and less.  I've been with him for over a year and I have conflicted feelings for him.  On the one hand, he never HAD to take me on as an intern.  He also never had to pay me.  On the other hand, he has been cutting my hours drastically recently but still demands that I have my days reserved in case he needs me to come in.  So I usually end up sitting home alone, not working and not making money.  But unable to do anything else in case he needs me to work that day.  And despite this, he still only pays me for the time that I work.  $10/hr.  Which was what was agreed upon when I started the internship, but he said he would pay me more as my skillset grew and I started working on bigger projects.  And despite my skillset growing and working on bigger projects, I'm stills tuck at my starting rate.  I'm lucky to make $400/mo.  But this internship is the only thing keeping me somewhat employed in the industry.

Since my audio career doesn't look hopeful, I've been trying to explore different career routes.  Unfortunately, I can't afford to go back to school.  So I had to narrow my search to things I could learn/study for free.  Long story short, for the past few weeks I've been studying to be a certified drone pilot.  A lot of websites say those jobs will be growing and growing in the coming years.  I actually got excited for once.  When I told my parents that I was using my free time to study for drone certification, they gave me a lecture about how they didn't want me with TWO useless degrees.  And boom.  Right back into feeling shitty about a career.

That being said; I still live with my parents.  I know a lot of people my age still do.  But a lot of them don't as well.  Some of my ""friends"" are married.  Some just bought houses.  And here I am, typing this in my parents' basement.  As another user in this subreddit said in a different thread, I actually get upset when I see other people succeeding.  I get mad when I see people that I outperformed in school looking for apartments or houses.  And then that makes me feel guilty.  Even if I can't be happy for myself, I wish I could be happy for others.  But for some reason, I just can't.

I have a girlfriend of 4 years, but I think she's only with me because I'm her first and only boyfriend and she doesn't know any better.  I'm worried that eventually she'll realize how much of a bummer I am and drop me.  Especially with her new career.  She gets out a lot and meets a lot of great people.  Eventually she'll be moving out of her parents' place.  I wish I could be happy about it, but it just makes me worried.  I know, its selfish.  But I worry that her life is going to continue to move forward while mine remains stagnant.  And that just doesn't work out in the long run.

I don't have any friends.  I mean, occasionally I'll get invited to parties and gatherings with people from my high school.  But that's only because they're all friends with my girlfriend.  I was actually out at a birthday party last night.  Despite being an introvert, I tried to be open and outgoing.  But for the majority of the party I sat alone just kind of observing.  No one seemed interested in talking to me.  My girlfriend says that they're my friends too.  But I know that if we were to break up, I wouldn't see any of those people again.  Much less be invited to any social gatherings.  I mean, I've never been the person to have a lot of friends; even in school.  But now that I'm out of school and I have no way of being around people my age anymore, it's more of a problem.  I haven't gotten a single text message from someone wanting to hang out in years.  I haven't been invited to a social gathering that wasn't through my girlfriend in years.  Hell, for the last 4 years, I haven't even received a ""happy birthday"" from anyone other than my family or girlfriend.  So I sit in my parents' basement all day, alone, playing video games and job searching.

I have little to no hope.  I've heard every bullshit excuse in the book.  ""Things get better.""  ""Don't worry, everything will be ok.""  ""You'll make it eventually.""  ""You aren't alone.""  
I don't know how these lines are supposed to help anyone.  People act like there's some sort of unwritten rule to the universe that guarantees that everyone will find a job.  Everyone will make it.  Everyone will live a happy life.  Well sorry, but there isn't.  There is absolutely NO guarantee that I'll find a job.  There's NO guarantee that I'll be happy.  And it's just super frustrating to hear those lines come from people who have their lives together.

And the worst part is that I have no one to tell this to.  My parents would probably just get mad; making me feel even worse about myself.  My girlfriend doesn't want to hear that shit.  I know it's unattractive.  That's just a fact.  Insecurity is completely unattractive.  And like I said, I don't have friends.  And the last thing I would do is want to talk to some 1-800-poorme hotline.  I know they probably help a lot of people, but I feel like it would just make me feel even worse about myself.

So I resort to posting it on the internet to a bunch of strangers, for reasons unknown, on a thread that I probably won't even check up on."
54j31j,7,2016-09-26,About The setting. The GMs. And the Role of PCs.,siredova,herohub,https://www.reddit.com/r/herohub/comments/54j31j/about_the_setting_the_gms_and_the_role_of_pcs/,"Ok this will be long but Id like to start defining what type of game well be playing. To which I'll give my toughs on three different subjects that I think can help us defined how to move forward. The setting, the GMs and the role of the PCs.

**The setting**

So First of all I think that before we start playing we should set what are be playing. Mutants &amp; Masterminds is a very flexible system and lend itself for a whole different campaign styles.

The default settings Freedom City &amp; Emerald City seemed to be preferred here. I have some issues with the Freedomverse setting so Ill give my two cents on the issues I have with it and how I think It can be address. 

The first thing is what I see most define any superhero setting: how common or for how long superheroes have being a part of the world. 

Think of it as sliding scale: on one end you have you have stories in which superpowered being just come into appearance (be because they are new or have being hidden from the public eye) this lends to stories where the players have to come to grips with not only where they fit in the world but how to work with others like them. Examples of this are the show Heroes, X-men first class, the first Avengers movie.

On the other end of the spectrum you have a developed status quo surrounding super power individuals: superheroes and villains are a part of everyday life (wherever the people like it or not).

You'll notice that despite being technically in the same setting the difference between Freedom City and Emerald City is where they are located in this scale.

My take is is that something in between works best is something in between. There has to be a status quo and a history for the players to fit into but not to much that rob from the uniqueness of being a hero. This being my mayor gripe with the Freedomverse, is too crowded. A super on every roof so to speak: I say that we should conserve the most iconic aspects (like the Freedom League and Claremont Academy) and trim the rest so the world so doesn't get to bog down in backstory and baggage. More important: It give room for the heroes of forge this lore by themselves (more on this latter).

**The GMs.**

Now here I'll be brief since I dont think that there is one way of Gamemastering that is the best period. Different styles serve best to different GMs. I personally follow a very nonlinear way of storytelling in the games I run and then encourage player too act more out of what fells right for their characters above the objectives of the adventure even if this often mean thing like splitting the party or digressing from the original plot. Others prefers a more solid structure for they campaigns.

What I do think would be best if GMs (or those in charge of the metaplot) divide the themselves in layers or kind of adventures (note that who comes with a concept for an adventure and who actually run the game might be not necessarily be the same person). For instance: street level heroes, A-Listers, Teen Heroes, Cosmics Heroes, etc.

**The Players**

There are two types of character in every story the main ones and the secondary ones. The PC should always be on the first category. This might seem like an obvious thing but its a big problem with a lot RPG material tabletop or otherwise. This doesn't mean they should be the only relevant characters neither they are the center of the universe in which they live. But the PCs should always feel like they are the center of the story they are playing. 

This is where what I mean about when I say the Fredomverse can do with some streamlining: if they are for instance some precursor civilizations like the Lemurians or the Preservers it should be up to the PCs to discover. As a Rule of thumb the backstory should never be better than the story in a RPG campaign.

I also help the players feel relevant and more invested. Playing as an unpaid intern in the Freedom League might be fun but it gets old fast. 

Now out of necessity this game can't count on having the same players for every adventure so some mayor NPCs are going to be necessary but they very rarely (if ever) should steal the spotlight from the PCs.

Of course Im hardly the definitive word on the subject and every thing I said can be questioned. But I have being Gamemastering for over a decade and I think this are a few point to discuss before we start playing.

54jf8u,8,2016-09-26,How do I [22 F] tell an old flame [22 M] that I'm not comfortable with striking up another relationship with him?,BallinCorgi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54jf8u/how_do_i_22_f_tell_an_old_flame_22_m_that_im_not/,"Around this time last year I started talking to this guy that I met on OKCupid while completing an internship in a nearby city. We hit it off and after about a month, month and a half of going on dates I was ready to make it an actual relationship. However, he started to become really distant out of nowhere and broke things off with me. I couldn't see what I did wrong, but just sort of chalked it up to ""wasn't meant to be"" and came to terms with it. My internship ended and I moved back to my college town to complete my degree.

We stayed friends on Snapchat (honestly, there were quite a few times where I just thought about deleting him but for whatever reason decided not to.) This weekend, out of nowhere he messaged me that he was in town and we struck up a conversation. Since then, he's been texting me non-stop and I don't know how to feel about it. He had wanted to meet up for drinks but I was busy with other obligations and now he's back home. He apologized for what happened between us and I accepted it. He knows that I plan on moving back to the city that I did my internship in (his hometown) after I graduate in December and has been talking about us doing stuff together whenever I come back. However, I don't think it's appropriate for us to strike up another relationship again whether that be romantic or just friendly. He really hurt me when he just dropped me out of nowhere and it took me a while to get over it. I don't want to be in a relationship for the foreseeable future, I'm tired of getting hurt and that's all that ever seems to happen. I don't even want sex, I just want to do my own thing right now. I also don't think it would be right for us to even be friends because I had liked him a lot and it would probably upset me if he talked to me about dating other girls.

Am I valid in thinking this way? I don't really give out second chances and don't see why this should be a special case. How do I say in the kindest way possible, ""I appreciate you apologizing to me but I would rather you not talk to me ever again""?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: A guy that I used to date messaged me out of nowhere. It seems like he wants to strike up a relationship again but I'm not about it for a number of reasons. How do I kindly tell him to leave me alone?"
54jy8c,3,2016-09-26,Opinions on Introverted Streamers? - Laid Back Streamers?,HoodedDemon94,Twitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/54jy8c/opinions_on_introverted_streamers_laid_back/,"I apologize if someone has asked this or something similar before. I'm wondering what the average viewer thinks of introverted streamers. - Or just streamers who are really laid back?

I don't know what's allowed or not, but I'd like to give some backstory and what I'm trying to accomplish. If something ends up not being allowed, give me a chance to edit it so that I can still get feedback on this post. Thanks r/Twitch for being an awesome source of information.

Let me start off by saying I'm a 22 year old introvert that is currently is his last semester of college (except for my internship next semester that I have to line up).

I built my computer in the spring of 2016 with some refund money from financial aid. Once I built my [computer](http://pcpartpicker.com/b/MFRG3C), I decided to start streaming. I went into streaming with the sole purpose of opening myself up to people. Trying to come out of my shell. As far as I remember, I've always been the quiet kid in the back of the class. I only really talked around my friends and family.

I managed to find a [twitch team](http://castordie.com/) from an old r/Twitch mega-thread not too long after I started streaming. They understand my goals and I understand theirs. I've been a part of multi-streams that have definitely forced me to talk to people.

My parents have told me that since I started streaming this year, they've noticed it's been easier for me to talk.

I was influenced, in a way, by an old Minecraft YouTuber and Twitch streamer I used to watch: NearbyGamer. I caught his stream one time and I told myself that I wanted to do that. He was laid back, but was interactive and talked to people with ease. I still have a ways to go, but I'm happy where I am so far.

TL;DR - Are laid back introverts a bad thing if they're trying to get over their introversion?"

Get Lucky!,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/54kuyy/m4f_dont_let_mondays_get_you_down_get_lucky/,"Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross
* 22 -- Christina Hendricks
* 23 -- Angela Bassett
* 24 -- Elizabeth Banks
* 25 -- Isla Fisher
* 26 -- Natalie Imbruglia
* 27 -- Mary-Louise Parker
* 28 -- Kate Beckinsale
* 29 -- Sofia Vergara
* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Dealer's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"
54lmrz,1,2016-09-26,internship search and a little lost,aros92,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/54lmrz/internship_search_and_a_little_lost/,"Hi everyone,

I recently exited an internship (at a community agency) because it became overwhelming (first expierence in field, large caseload, other changes in life, compounding forces of self-doubt and discouragement). I'm at a better place now but stating this simply may seem as though it was an easy decision.. it was not. Now I am currently in search of another internship but I feel lost as to where/what/who I want to work with. This is all happening around a time in my life where a lot of change is happening and simply put I'm fighting with myself to make through each day and make sure I make something out of each day. At the same time I feel incompetent in my ability to be a Master's level student counselor.. although everyone including faculty, supervisors, peers are telling me that I'm so much more than I believe in myself. 

I'm afraid of contacting the next site supervisor or director and having to go through the interview process and them seeing right through  me that I have more problems than I could probably help others. I'm also at a place where I don't want to take a break.. it's like I know I can do it. I want to be here to move forward in this career and I know I have a lot to offer, but I have this intense fear within me at the same time. I'd like to lay out the foundations of my fear but I'll wait on that. 

So questions for you all:
1. Can you relate?
2. How do you go about the interview process in keeping yourself in check?
3. Why did you choose that particular internship site?
4. Any questions for me?
5. And anything else that you think will help me get over myself, lol."
54lpts,12,2016-09-26,"Miscommunication; The last charge of the light brigade and Hillary Clinton's ""death"".",TeijiSenpai,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/54lpts/miscommunication_the_last_charge_of_the_light/,"&gt; The Charge of the Light Brigade was a charge of British light cavalry led by Lord Cardigan against Russian forces during the Battle of Balaclava on 25 October 1854, in the Crimean War. Lord Raglan, overall commander of the British forces, had intended to send the Light Brigade to pursue and harry a retreating Russian artillery battery, a task well-suited to light cavalry. However, due to miscommunication in the chain of command, the Light Brigade was instead sent on a frontal assault against a different artillery battery, one well-prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire.

An example of miscommunication and the potential devastating effects.

It's possible that there was a similar issue within the chain command of Clinton camp, leading to the miscommunication of her [""death""](http://i.imgur.com/08JOsQy.png).

On 9/11/2016 Hillary Clinton [lost her shoe](http://i.imgur.com/XI01ZoB.jpg), she also collapsed and had to be awkwardly tossed into her scooby-mobile. This was due to alleged pneumonia.

According to [ABC News](http://i.imgur.com/08JOsQy.png) Clinton ""died"" @ Montefiore Medical Hospital, which is 20.8 miles away, according to google maps.

So let's throw out some wikipedia definitions quickly before we type up a boring and unexciting paragraph;

&gt; Clinical death is the medical term for cessation of blood circulation and breathing, the two necessary criteria to sustain human and many other organisms' lives. It occurs when the heart stops beating in a regular rhythm, a condition called cardiac arrest. The term is also sometimes used in resuscitation research.

&gt; At the onset of clinical death, consciousness is lost within several seconds. Measurable brain activity stops within 20 to 40 seconds. Irregular gasping may occur during this early time period, and is sometimes mistaken by rescuers as a sign that CPR is not necessary. During clinical death, all tissues and organs in the body steadily accumulate a type of injury called ischemic injury.

*What is ischemic injury?*

&gt; Ischemia is a restriction in blood supply to tissues, causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism (to keep tissue alive). Ischemia is generally caused by problems with blood vessels, with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue. It also means local anemia in a given part of a body sometimes resulting from congestion (such as vasoconstriction, thrombosis or embolism). Ischemia comprises not only insufficiency of oxygen, but also reduced availability of nutrients and inadequate removal of metabolites.

Short paragraph time!

So basically, on 9/11 2016, Clinton lost her shoe, which is tragic in and of itself, no one wants to suffer the embarrassment of losing a shoe drunk, let alone sober; she also collapsed due to ""medical reasons"", allegedly pnemonia; however due to a **severe** miscommunication, ABC News reported on her [""death""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbbKoQX9wPo), this was likely due to her very problematic health issues she's experiencing, what actually happened was cardiac arrest, or *clinical death*, this may have resulted in ischemia if she actually did ""die"" and had to be resuscitated.

In short; one of Cronies Clinton's was delivering information, an ABC employee was having a coffee and told an intern to *""Go capture those cannons""* a la final charge of the light brigade, however instead of reporting on how she went into cardiac arrest in hospital, the new intern Bob somehow communicated she had actually *died* instead of communicating how she experienced a minor and *very ordinary* experience of clinical death, like our good friend [Mr Chow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH7Mu1PDjsw) from Hangover 2, who died temporarily.

54lsat,2,2016-09-26,"My [30F] LDR boyfriend [45M] doesn't know if he wants kids, marriage or to move.",Ldrthrowaway10111011,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54lsat/my_30f_ldr_boyfriend_45m_doesnt_know_if_he_wants/,"My boyfriend and I have been together 8 years. We met playing World of Warcraft where he was our guild leader. We talked for around a year before we decide to meet. The sparks flew, I loved everything about him, every second together. I decided to make the 800 mile trip and move across the country to be with him. He also moved around 150 miles to be where his cousin lived. 

Before I moved across the country, he would tell me all the right things, how he wanted me to have his kids, how he would take care of me, seeing as he was 15 years older than I am. When I moved, things changed. He has a problem with p.e. and I understand it's frustrating. It's also frustrating for me. We dealt with it for 8 months, we me begging him to get help, I'd go with him, reassured him I loved him and wanted to be with him, but still no progress. It made me felt like since sex was so important to me, why couldn't we deal with it together? Ignoring it showed me he didn't really care. I would go out with friends more, and one night I came back with a hickey from the night before from one of my girlfriends. We were all drinking and having fun, even though I shouldn't have done it. Eventually it got so bad with me begging for him to get help that he moved out. After he moved out, and all the arguments, he finally did get help, however it requires us to use this special shot multiple times a week for months, and we can't do that long distance. 

I started cooking school during all this and he had an IT job. I was homesick because my mom has rheumatoid arthritis and her condition was getting worse. I finished my degree after a year living together and wanted to go back home to help take care of my mom full time. I thought he was coming with me. Boy was I wrong. My internship came and went after school, as I became my moms full time caregiver, having it be my sole job. I still take care of her to this day. 

He would come in once every month for 2-4 days to hang out. We talked every day and still played video games together. Flash forward and it's been 6 years since I moved back to Chicago. He goes back and forth about even wanting kids. 

A little backstory about him. He got married in his 20s because his girlfriend got pregnant. She was bipolar and schitzo and he married her to ""prove a point"" to his friends and family being against them in the first place. They were married 14 years and he lost custody of his kid. He paid child support and alimony for 5 years. He says he never wants to go through that again, but to me that's like saying I'll just divorce him like his ex wife did. 

So now here I sit crying all the time, waiting for him to decide what he wants. I have asked and said marriage has always been important to me, but I'm not getting any younger. I gave this man I love 8 years and I feel like he's happy the way things are. He gets to essentially be single for 27/30 days of the month and have no responsibilities. He comes in whenever he wants for good sex and cooking and video games. I think he could do this forever. I have cried and told him countless times about how it's hurting me so much just waiting. He says he isn't ready for marriage even after 8 years. He doesn't trust me enough because he doesn't want to pay child support or alimony ever again. It hurts when he says that because it feels like he thinks it's over before it even starts. He keeps telling me he wants to be with me, but it doesn't feel like it. 

Reddit what do I do? Do I just walk away? I don't want to give someone I love an ultimatum to marry me. I feel like you want to know if you want to marry someone after 8 years. Sorry if this post was all over the place. This is my first time posting on r/relationships. I just feel like I'm at a loss and need someone to talk to. Help me Reddit please, you are my only hope. Thank you for anyone that took the time to read this. I sincerely appreciate it. 

TL;DR my long distance boyfriend of 8 years doesn't know if he wants to marry me and have kids. I'm 30, he's 45 and we aren't getting any younger. "

i moved to another country because of a job opportunity, it was an paid internship and i got a lot of positiv feedback, and i still work there after my internship ended. 
my work includes caring for others, because its in the social sector. and this is ironic. i cant care for myself, but i am good in taking care for others. i did my job with responsibility and i feeling joy while doing it. 
job wise, i see a future, a path in front of me, i just need to walk it down. i could start universitie next year, but what is it worth?
i am lonely. 
i barley eat.
i sleep long.
my room looks fuckin disgusting.

currently i have three weeks holidays, and i am unmotivated. all i do is reading, play some guitar and most of the time i smoke and think about life and the world. and this makes me fuckin depressed. 
i wish there was a person out there, who could hug me, and say: everything is gonna be alright. just come with me, walk with me, lets sing and dance. i am desperate for a person in my life, who sees me as a whole, who can understand me, even if i dont. 

but people see me as a strong person. its like if i have mask on, and underneath is a depressed maniac, who would be bad influence on people. i feel like i am a bad person. i exploit people, it looks like i am caring, but in fact, i dont give a fuck, i am selfish and just look out for myself. and i know it, and i feel it, and it makes me sick. 
sometimes i have the egoistic thought of just jumping down the bridge. it would be so much easier just to sleep forever. who wants to get old anyway??
i am afraid of sharing my depression. i dont wanna be a burden on others. also i dont wanna have the feeling, they just hang out because they are afraid i would kill myself. 

i am this happy person for them for a reason. maybe i start believing it myself, and become this person after all. but my hope fades, and i all i can think of: when will this darkness end, and how??
whats the point in going forward? i could end it, right now. maybe i didnt gave up yet, and maybe i never will, but...


i know, i need help. professional help. but i dont have insurance in the moment, and treatment is some weeks/months away, so i have to wait for it anyway. but i am looking forward to it.
also i write a lot in my diary, and refelct about my thoughts and i know i should clean my room. i know i should smoke less cigaretts and eat more frequently. but it is just so damn hard in the moment, when you feel so lonely and lost in this world :(

thanks for reading, i dont know if it makes any sense, i just wrote whats up in my head.

54n5mg,1,2016-09-26,[Ombuds] Tracking Election Coverage: September 11-24,s3thcom,nprstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/nprstories/comments/54n5mg/ombuds_tracking_election_coverage_september_1124/,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she walks from her daughter's apartment building Sept. 11, 2016, in New York. Clinton unexpectedly left the 9/11 anniversary ceremony. Her campaign later announced she had been diagnosed with pneumonia.

Craig Ruttle/APMy office is tracking NPR's candidate coverage, online and on its morning and evening newsmagazines, in response to requests from listeners. From Sept. 11 through Sept. 24, there were 42 stories focused primarily on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, compared with 34 stories focused mostly on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was the main focus of [one story](http://ift.tt/2cyrl8H) during that period. Another 65 stories — or almost half of NPR's campaign coverage — looked at more than one candidate, or general election issues.

Clinton's pneumonia disclosure was the highlight of the first week of this tracking period, accounting for more than half of NPR's coverage of the candidate during the week. It was the first week (excluding convention coverage) since mid-June, when this office began tracking the newsroom's election reporting, that Clinton received more individualized coverage than her Republican opponent.

The tracking period also included an interview with [Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine](http://ift.tt/2cO7kys) and an interview with [former President Bill Clinton](http://ift.tt/2cy8AB7). (Neither Trump nor his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has yet granted NPR an interview.)

My office continues to hear from listeners about the perceived tone of the stories about both candidates, and the amount of time devoted to each of them. Linda Katz of Philadelphia, Pa., wrote with a specific concern about the amount of time afforded to covering Trump in NPR's newscasts. My office is not tracking the newscasts, but Mark Memmott, NPR's standards editor, did examine the week from Sept. 11 to Sept. 17 (the week of Clinton's pneumonia disclosure).

He found that the newscast coverage was fairly even. Of about 220 newscasts in that period, 53 contained a story about Clinton and not Trump, and 51 contained a story about Trump and not Clinton. A Clinton-centric story preceded a Trump-centric story in 49 of the newscasts, while a Trump-centric story preceded a Clinton-centric story in 44 newscasts. In 22 newscasts, a story about both candidates was either the only campaign story or preceded another about one of them.

Expressions of concern about the lack of coverage of the third-party candidates continue to come in. In addition to the single Johnson-focused piece — which ran in the week before the Debate Commission announced that he and Green Party candidate Jill Stein [had not qualified for the debates](http://ift.tt/2cFrV2P) — the two candidates were mentioned a few times in general election coverage. Independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin was mentioned in [one general election article](http://ift.tt/2df2VE5).

Mick Hannaway of Pasadena, Calif., wrote: ""This is getting unbearable! Stop focusing on 2 presidential candidates. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are running too. ... When there is an 'issues story', I'm begging you please to put the Libertarian and Green Party candidate into the issue.""

Listeners and readers who have been asking for more issues-focused pieces were well served last week, thanks, in part, to the latest series of _A Nation Engaged_reports.

To single out a few, there were stories about [Trump's tax plan](http://ift.tt/2cKObvz), and the candidates' differing views on [homegrown terrorism](http://ift.tt/2d4z68o), [combating rising crime rates](http://ift.tt/2cJtC2O) (also [here](http://ift.tt/2cnW5Y5)), boosting [American economic mobility](http://ift.tt/2duEFLk) (also [here](http://ift.tt/2d4z1kZ) and [here](http://ift.tt/2cY2NpY)) and [energy policy](http://ift.tt/2d4y8ZU).

The previous week also included four platform pieces, looking at how the candidates approach the [Afghan War](http://ift.tt/2cUMA7A), [taxes](http://ift.tt/2cXS01s), [helping veterans](http://ift.tt/2duFtQu) and [family policies](http://ift.tt/2d4A8ky).

Finally, I'd call attention to this [guide to tonight's debate](http://ift.tt/2doXv6U) that tackled the issues in depth. And for those who are looking for real-time debate fact checking, NPR is planning something new online. Several NPR correspondents will be annotating a transcript of the debate as it happens at NPR.org. More details on NPR's debate plans can be found in this [press release](http://ift.tt/2d4yGi7).

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

54nvmf,0,2016-09-26,Volunteer opportunities in business firms for university students?,whattaman,vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/54nvmf/volunteer_opportunities_in_business_firms_for/,"Hi, I'm a university student at UBC and I'm looking for some part-time volunteer work that involves business firms such as accounting, finance, HR, management, etc. At the moment I don't have much business experience and background so I'm hoping I can get out and find some opportunities where I can learn more about business. I do have work experience but they're not related so much to business. Although internships and job opportunities would be nice, I believe that I'm unqualified for most of them as I don't have any background in business, which is why I'd like to start with volunteering. I've tried applying for jobs such as bank tellers but I've had no success, which is why I'm here. In the future I would like to be doing accounting as my main job if that helps.

Does anyone know any good places where I can start at that gives training for those who don't have any business background? I live in Richmond so the lower mainland would be convenient for me."
54o4om,1,2016-09-26,A Waste,j_ellie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/54o4om/a_waste/,"I'm in my junior year of college, and ever since the summer time I've started to feel like an absolute waste of space. There isn't anything I'm particularly good at, or passionate about, which is making my college career seem more and more like wasted time, especially since the only thing I am remotely interested in is Theatre (which is not only an incredibly difficult field to break into, but I don't believe I'm talented enough to do anything with it). 

I feel like the weight of what is expected of me is too much even though it isn't. Out of our entire family, mine is the wealthiest. My dad started his own business that my mom helps with and I've had a very privileged life, so I know that the expectations of me are very high (which is worse because my cousin is a successful lawyer who just got married and had her first baby). I feel like I'm letting my parents down if their only child doesn't do something with her life. But I've been spoiled by my parents and have never had to work, so now that the time has come for me to begin looking at internships I have no idea where to start. I have no references. I have no prior employment. I'm the worst candidate for a job or internship I've ever seen.

I have a wonderful and incredible boyfriend of two years who I know I won't be marrying. He's intelligent and driven and I know if we don't break up before the end of college, I'll be what's holding him back from achieving his dreams. The amount of things I would give up in order to keep him is ridiculous, which is why I know the relationship isn't exactly healthy and can't survive out in the ""real world"". Although I realize that I'm young and I'll meet many more people in my life, the thought of losing him right now is unbearable.

I have one close friend who has been with me since high school and she's recently been going through struggles of her own, so I always try to be her support and motivator. Even though I know I could talk to her, I don't want to burden her with the way I'm feeling because her problems are infinitely worse than mine. Ever since my close friend has snagged a boyfriend of her own I see less and less of her, which has started to make me feel more and more alone.

Sometimes I really wish a large radiation event would go off in our galaxy and destroy the earth in the blink of an eye just so I wouldn't have to wake up the next day and continue on. I don't know how people look at 60+ more years of life and don't wish for it to be over sooner rather than later. I don't know what to do when the weight of existing feels like it's too much."
54pucq,594,2016-09-27,"I think my sister was attempting to hit on my then boyfriend, but it was just weird.",thrwawaytimee,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/54pucq/i_think_my_sister_was_attempting_to_hit_on_my/,"When I first started dating my husband, C, he used to be really hot. He was working out 2-3h/day, so yes, he had a fantastic body in addition to a gorgeous face. Before this incident happened, I didn't know that my sister gets extremely, extremely cringe-y with men she found attractive. How cringe-y? Well, let's begin....

So when this happened, C and I were still in a complicated part of our relationship. I can't remember if we've made it exclusive yet at this point, but I remember it was at that stage were I didn't want to be open with our relationship yet. C was giving major player vibes, and I wasn't sure I was ready to commit even though he kept insisting he was completely committed to me. At this time, I was still trying to get closer to my sister, so I decided to tell her about C. Thought it'll help us bond or something...no idea what I was thinking. 

I told her that C and I met through mutual friends (didn't trust her enough to tell her about okcupid), and that was it. 

Anyway, we met up for drinks, and the first thing he said to her was, ""Hey, great to see you again! Remember me?""

Yes, C is a year younger than me, and used to be my sister's classmates. Loads of, ""OHMYGAWWWDDD!!!!"" from my sister, because she loves being loud and drawing a lot of attention to herself.

Turns out, in the presence of men she found attractive, my sister gets extra loud and extra attention seeking. She wants them to know she's *attractive*. How does she do it? By being extremely, uncomfortably sexual and making up a lot of sexual stories to make her sound sooooo experienced. But of course, she's a virgin and not a slut ""like most girls"", she knows she can ""exchange [her] virginity for a billionaire"" (her actual words from a different conversation). She's smart that way. Totally not a ho. She forgot it's not a job interview where you can lie about your abilities to make people think you're capable of doing the job. People can actually *see* you and judge your attractiveness. 

Now, I'm hardly a prude who gets uncomfortable around sexual situations. Hell, I took an entire intern batch to a strip club. What? They were teasing me about taking my boyfriend to a strip club as soon as I wasn't not around, but they were planning to go to the shitty strip club. I had to correct them and take them to the good one. If they were planning on spending $20 on entrance fees, might as well go to the club where there's less botched up boob jobs and depressed faces.

Anyway, my sister started off by doing her usual habit of making up stories. My sister lies so much (must be a habit from constantly lying about what she eats), she lies about even mundane stuff. She went, ""Don't worry about being a year younger, all the women in our family like younger men. All my cousins' husbands are a year younger! My grandma's all, ""Thrwawaytimee is just following the footsteps of her cousins...all us OurSurname women love younger men.""

Oh yes, thanks to GoT, my sister loves using our surname GoT style as if we're royalty or something. So she'll say bloody stupid, pretentious shit like, ""We are the OurSurnames..."", ""She comes from the Surname famiy"", ""He is a OtherSurname"". I'm sure she tried using, ""from the house of Surname"" too but people probably laughed at her too much. 

Anyway, of course C was confused, because we were supposed to keep our relationship a secret. How the fuck does my grandma know he's younger than me? 

Obviously, I knew my sister was making another story up, since she only knew about C's age when he introduced himself. I stupidly decided to correct her while still giving her face by going, ""That's weird, how does grandma know C's age? She doesn't even know we were dating.""

Now this is where you graciously accept that you've been caught bullshitting and mumble something about, ""Oh, I think I mixed you up with someone else."" and quickly change the subject, right?

No. My sister bulldozed on and said, ""Oh, the OurSurname family has amazing stalking skills. I'm an expert at it...""

And she started talking about her amazing stalking abilities and how she found out dirt about so many people. She kept name dropping all the rich kids' names throughout the story. Also added about how she made sure her friend snagged a ""*very, very prominent*"" guy from the Rich family, by using her awesome stalking skills to figure out his schedule. 

C was obviously freaking out. Can't blame the guy. I mean, he was still at that stage where he was thinking with his dick, but even if all his blood were stuck in his penis, he'd still have enough sense to be freaked out. I tried kicking her to signal to her to shut up, but she went, ""Ow! Why did you kick me?""

Now it looked like I was in on the craziness. 

Oh, and all this while, C and I couldn't get a single word in. She had been talking nonstop for over 30 min. Pretty shitty date. 

My sister then claimed that:

* My mom has a fat fetish, and deliberately fattened my dad up (no, my dad just ballooned because he quit smoking while still eating crap)
* By the way, that is a great strategy to keep a man. Make him unattractive so no one would go after him (yes! She admitted fat is unattractive here!!! No idea why she still insist guys who don't find her attractive are shallow!! I don't understand how her brain works. Someone please explain it to me. I guess fat women are beautiful while fat men are unattractive?)
* C should watch out because that's probably what I'd do to him (what the fucking fuck.)

Oh yes, by now, she had been doing a nearly 1h long monolog, pausing only to much and order more food &amp; drinks. Not that I minded, I mean, at this stage, I just wanted to run off and have 0 interest in joining the conversation. The only thing stopping me was that a part of me kept hoping she would leave so I could clarify to C that I'm not crazy, and then fuck his brains out. No, she was oblivious to all the glares I gave her, and wasn't checking her text messages. Knowing what I know now about her, I wondered if it was a deliberate attempt to sabotage my relationship rather than liking to make up weird stories for attention. 

I ordered dessert, because I need sweet, sinful sugary goodness on top of booze to handle the night. My sister went, ""Oh my *god!* You're ordering *dessert*? At *this* time?"" 

She turned to C, emitted what she probably thought was a flirtatious giggle, and went, ""She's always eating!""

Kettle, you're black.

And then she went on, and started jumping from one sexual topic to even more sexual topics in random haphazard fashion. It's as if she just wanted to squeeze in as many uncomfortable sexual topics in as possible:

* My brother and I found my mother's dildoes and they were huge (wat.)
* My mom talked about dicks with her, and she prefers them huge (WHAT THE FUCK.)
* Maybe because she's so open and knowledgeable, my mom just loves talking about sex with her (help me.)
* In fact, everyone loves talking about sex with her, because she just knows so much about it (she has never gotten a man to fuck her, even though she tried. All she ever got was a pity fingering. Her experience is just with dildoes. You move it in and out. Get lube if you're not wet. That's all you need to know about dildoes ffs!)
* She, my aunt, uncle, and cousin walked in on my other cousin having sex with her boyfriend (never happened. I'm sparing the graphic details she shared, because this isn't an erotica sub)


C had this petrified smile plastered on his face. C told me way later in our relationship that he only stayed because he was still trying to impress me. Honestly, it's probably just because our relationship was still at that stage where I could've told C I ate boogers for breakfast, and his response would just be, ""How fascinating, shall we fuck?""

I already asked for the bill by the time she mentioned dildoes, but unfortunately, the bill took nearly an hour to show up and C was stalling (he grabbed the bill and insisted on paying for all of us) hoping sex was still on the table. I went home straight away, because the idea of my mom and my cousin, who's like an older sister to me, having sex pretty much killed my mood.

Oh yes, and my sister ended up finishing 2/3s of my dessert, in addition to ordering 3-4 drinks. She still can't figure out why I'm mysteriously so thin while she's large even though she eats so little, of course. I guess in her mind, the calories must go to the one who orders the dessert, regardless of who actually did the eating.

* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies

54s9hq,14,2016-09-27,Ideas for Water Con Session,JackedAlf,Pararescue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pararescue/comments/54s9hq/ideas_for_water_con_session/,"I've been reading training ideas and whatnot here and cannot access wiki.. So maybe this is redundant, but for some.. maybe not. I won't cover workouts unless someone wants to, but let me at least give a little background about me to attempt to give some credibility. PJ Cone, Kinesiology degree, sports performance internships and was a trainer for a national team for women's LAX - I won't say the country but it wasn't the US. So, hopefully that will give what I say a little more weight.

Pool session (water con, always be safe, have a training partner or notify lifeguard)

Underwaters - 5-10 (yes 10) x 3 min interval work down to a 1:30 (5 at a 1:15 if you're feeling bold). Now that con has moved to the chap - try and practice in a 50M pool without a push off aka going towards deep end, but do both.

Mask and snorkel - Start by just familiarizing yourself, but do 5-10 sets. To increase challenge or at least make it less boring - do 7 rounds of :30s hands up treading above your mask and snorkel go down recover properly.. take off and then begin treading again for your rest. So, :30s hands up tread - mask and snorkel recovery (right below you) - drop them and begin again for about 7 times. Less more as required.

Buddy breathing - Training partner? None? Don't matter.. If you have people - work up to full harass + start SLOW don't freak someone out by beginning with full harass for their first time. But, work up to 3 minutes full harass  +.. so do 4 caps not just 2. Do a couple rds and rest between. No buddy? Self buddy breathing to start - Float, clear snorkel, move it away.. clear again and get the hang of it. Practice clearing without breathing for as many as you can, conserve your air.

Ditch and dons - You can absolutely do this, but need to buy at least a weight belt + fins + mask - Google it

Knots - Get a rope, learn the knots you need to know. practice doing it under water.. literally that easy. You don't have to have a rope to tie them to. For example, tie a bowline, untie it, tie it again. Do this above water.. underwater... underwater eyes closed.. Then multiple times with multiple knots. Make sure your rope is finger thickness maybe 24 inch in length.

Treading- Hands up - Get that egg beater down, but make this gradual.. :30 on :30 off for 5 - 10 sets, move to 1:00 on -:30 off for 5.. basically make it so that you can do 3 min hands up easily.. You can do weight belt treads with fins as well if you desire (and it will be good practice). Same idea... Practice with flooded mask for one, the other or both.

I would recommend spending the couple hundred dollars to get an Atlantis 2 mask, jetfins, 8 - 16 lb weight belt, 24"" length of rope, Horsecollar BC if you really want to get the right feel and some booties.

Once a week or 2 weeks or month, you NEED to practice underwaters and other events with ABUs/sweats/jeans/BC whatever you have in order to simulate what you'd do on a black Thursday. Keep the interval long or short 2:00 - 4:00.. Play around with how it feels. Practice 10 ups and crossovers and random things with flooded masks.

So, to reiterate, try and do this 2-4 times a week and progress slowly -

UW - 5-10 x 3:00 - 1:15
Mask and snorkel - 10 minutes ish work out to a 30M, change to what I said with treading if you'd like to try that
Buddy breathing - 1 - 3 Min sessions : work up to full +
Ditch and dons &amp; knots - if you have equip
Treading + Wt belt treading - work up until 3:00 for multiple rds

So, that's a breakdown of what I would recommend to be OVER prepared for Indoc. In all honesty, if you can do all that, watercon will be a lovely 3 hour break for you every day until about the 7th week.

If anything needs clarification, youtube first and if it still doesn't make sense.. I will do my best. If anyone is in the ABQ area feel free to PM me and we can maybe try and work something out to do a pool session.

54t269,3,2016-09-27,[Ombuds] Behind The Scenes: NPR Fact Checks First Debate In Near Real Time,s3thcom,nprstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/nprstories/comments/54t269/ombuds_behind_the_scenes_npr_fact_checks_first/,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump answers a question as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens during the presidential debate at Hofstra University on Sept. 26, 2016.

David Goldman/APNPR listeners and readers have [said they want fact-checking](http://ift.tt/24wKUQQ) during this political campaign season and NPR responded with what I found to be a very impressive new offering Monday night: a close to real-time [annotation of a transcript](http://ift.tt/2dxUy6P) of the first televised debate between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

As the debate transcript rolled by, supplied by an automated transcription service, a team of some 30 newsroom staffers, including reporters, editors and members of the visuals team, jumped in to fact-check and annotate what the candidates were saying and keep the process moving along. By the end of the process, the transcript contained 74 annotations, some adding context and others pointing out statements the candidates got right or wrong.

NPR's audience clearly appreciated the massive effort; as of Tuesday afternoon, more than 6 million people had checked it out.

My office heard great praise for and some criticism of the effort. Some of the critics were unhappy with the errors made by the automated transcription service. My take on that is that most of those looked to be hand corrected by NPR staff by the morning.

Others saw bias in which candidate statements got fact-checked and which didn't. That's always an inherent risk in fact-checking a lengthy candidate speech or 90-minute debate.

Here's how the totals broke out, according to our tally. NPR fact-checked nine Clinton statements, and 33 Trump statements. Another 32 annotations added context for what the candidates were saying (11 added context to Clinton, and 21 to Trump). The vast majority of fact-checks on Trump concluded that he was wrong; by our count just a handful of Clinton's statements were judged wrong.

Some emailers sent lists of Clinton statements that NPR did not fact-check. One example, sent by Grant Cates of Orlando, was this Clinton statement:

""Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago, we had the worst financial crisis — the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was, in large part, because of tax policies that slash taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm.""

Cates wrote: ""Seems like an obvious opportunity for NPR to summarize the causes of the great recession. What were the tax policies and failed investments that led to the recession? What about subprime loans for housing and how government policies promoting home ownership had unintended consequences?""

I'd agree with that, and I see other Clinton statements that could be checked, too. I also see Trump statements that went unchallenged, like this one: ""Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax, we're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there is a tax when they sell, an automatic 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us there's no tax. It's a defective agreement.""

I asked the newsroom about the methodology behind the fact-checking. Domenico Montanaro, NPR's lead political editor, emailed:

""We wanted to try something new and comprehensive that focused on the facts and built on what we have done in recent months — annotations of convention speeches, economic addresses and more. In the planning stages, we reached out across desks to policy and beat experts and editors from business to foreign affairs to education and created a shared document that everyone who wanted to be involved could do so in an easy way. Our team of political and visuals editors behind the scenes filtered, managed, checked and updated. The editorial was organic. We told our folks essentially if you see something, say something. Like viewers at home, when we heard something that made us go, 'Is that true?' Or 'That's not true.' Or 'well that's not the whole context,' our reporters were on it. As the night evolved, more got added and updated. If something stood out to an editor that hadn't been fact checked, then we reached out to a relevant reporter. But honestly, this very sharp collaborative team left very few rocks unturned in about as fast a way as you can.""

As for the emphasis on fact-checking Trump, he wrote:

""What's fair isn't always equal. Our reporters across multiple desks, across multiple beats with deep content knowledge did a stellar job of fact checking in real time. We certainly are always cognizant of providing balance and focusing on both candidates, but if the numbers show that one candidate was fact checked more, it might be because that candidate said more things that needed fact checking.""

My take: It's not possible to fact-check every candidate statement. Some additional statements could have been checked but, overall, I think NPR's team offered a valuable service that met the goal of providing citizens with information they need to make their November decisions. For more on the impact of fact-checking in an election, I'd recommend reading Danielle Kurtzelben's [piece](http://ift.tt/2dhoB27) at NPR.org. Meanwhile, NiemanLab had [more on the technical gee-whiz](http://ift.tt/2cIPXwU) behind the project.

I am obviously going to finish out my degree (It will take me 4 years, and I have a 3.5 gpa at the moment).  I really do like engineering, but law has always interested me and I would like to know more about it.  So my questions for y'all are these: Have any of you ever gone from engineering to law school? If so, how was the transition?  What kind of job prospects were you looking for upon completing law school?  And then just for everyone in general, what as a college junior should I be doing now to prepare myself for the LSAT among other things, to give myself the best opportunity to get into law school?

54u2ws,2,2016-09-27,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/54u2ws/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

Within 2 days of my campus interview for internships, I got calls from 2 firms asking me to come in for an office visit to meet with a tax manager and an audit manager.  There were several behavioral questions during the campus interviews so I'm not sure if they'd just ask more of them during the office visit.

Will the stuff I read on Big Four office interviews from googling apply to small and mid-sized firms, or is it pretty different?  Does anyone have some experiences they can share with me?  Also, if I got called for an office visit, what do you guys think are my chances at this point?

54ul9g,4,2016-09-27,[21/M] seeking guidance with my LDR with [21/F]; don't know whether to continue or let it go,Wall_Of_Bass,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/54ul9g/21m_seeking_guidance_with_my_ldr_with_21f_dont/,"Hi everyone!

First time poster here and I'm actually very new to this subreddit. I was searching around in r/relationship_advice for a situation similar to mine when I stumbled on a comment suggesting this subreddit! I'm going to try to keep this as concise as I can because I really really really would like people to read it and give their opinions. I could really use the guidance and from what I've seen, this subreddit is very caring towards its users :)

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now. We met at the college that I attend in Wisconsin because for the last three years she had been going here. Her school performance had been suffering and she kind of attributed it in part to this university not being a good atmosphere and fit for her and she decided she was going to be returning to her family in Missouri and transferring to a school in that state. This was before we began dating. So we started hanging out and hooking up and that led to us dating and really enjoying spending time with each other. The school year ends and summer comes, she leaving. Originally I didn't want a LDR, but I didn't want to lose her either so I go for it. Everything is going fine in the LDR, but they we start to lose touch a little bit and communication kind of breaks down.

About two months ago I'm out at a bar one night and we start talking through text about the time line of our relationship, and how we will be a LDR for the next 2 years at least probably 3. She tells me she can't do that and was expecting me to move down to Missouri while in my head I see myself starting my career off at the company I currently intern for. This night essentially ends up with her breaking up with me, but I figured things would be fine in the morning so I remain calm. We talk in the morning, she apologizes and we're back to normal again

Another thing that has happened is one night about 2 weeks ago we get into a discussion about if she's the girl of my dreams and if I see myself spending the rest of my life with her, and these questions kind of take me off guard and I respond with I'm not sure. I don't really know that I believe in all of that girl of my dreams, she's the one kind of stuff. I believe in finding a good connection with someone and building it, so that's kind of my outlook on relationships. This causes a fight, she tells me I need to figure out what I want and then the subject gets dropped until this past weekend. It gets brought up again and I tell her that I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to make it in a LDR and she pushes me to make a decision and in the heat of that situation I say we should call it quits. We break up, talk a little bit in the remaining days about maybe getting back together.

I met with a councilor at school today and talked about this and kind of decided that my gf and I are kind of in limbo right now. After searching around on here and relationship_advice I realize that we never had an endgame plan and our communication quite honestly sucked. Her and I talked about this and we kind of set up what would be our endgame and how we would improve communication if we got back together. I want to talk about those things next.

She didn't have any friends upon moving back to Missouri outside of coworkers from returning to her old job. This put a lot of pressure on me to kind of be her go to instead of her making new friends, but I never told her this and kind of let that just bottle up. I told her how I felt about this and she realizes that kind of pressure was not something she should have been putting on me and that she is going to make a much larger effort to make friends and make sure to allow me my space as far as that is concerned. 

I tend to think of myself as someone who enjoys my connections with others, but I also enjoy my alone time to just do literally whatever I want. I think most people enjoy this as well. So between school, my friends here at school and my girlfriend in Missouri I was having a hard time finding time for myself. I felt that if I was going to be staying home for a night and not doing something with my friends here, that that kind of meant that I was obligated to be spending time on the phone or on skype with my girlfriend and this kind of bothered me. Now, I'm not saying I don't want to spend time doing these things with her because I do, I just was having a difficult time finding a balance. Tying in her lack of friends and peer social life at her new school also influenced me to feel the way I did because I felt wrong leaving her to be bored by herself when I'm just alone at home doing homework or playing a video game or something. This is another thing I didn't communicate to her and left to be bottled up and factor into the break up. When her and I talked she said that she absolutely understands this and that I just need to communicate it to her and that would be fine and that she will be making new friends to spend some of her time with as well so this won't be such a pressure on me to worry about. 

We also talk about how we need to figure out a better system to see each other. Previously she said she wouldn't be able to make the drive solo and her mom wouldn't let her, so outside of when she had the financial stability to fly here or if her mom was coming this way to visit family, visiting would mostly be on me to drive. After breaking up, she had a conversation with her mom and she said her mom says she would let her drive here one weekend every month because she know what it would mean to her. So she came up with the plan to switch off months of visiting (she drives here, I drive there, she drives here...) and she's often up here for holidays due to family visits. It is also more difficult for me to get off of work than it is for her because I'm interning at a professional company and she is a server at a restaurant so she said she would also be willing to come up for school breaks so that she could be here with me and I wouldn't have to worry about missing out on work and not meeting the expectations of my bosses. 

She is studying education in Missouri and originally wasn't willing to come back to Wisconsin as she wants to live in Missouri and see's herself ending up there in her life. I personally have no idea where I see myself ending up, but I do know I want to start my career here in Wisconsin with the company I currently work for after I graduate. She will be in school still for a little while when I graduate and I she knows I want to start my career here so she says she will come back here to live after graduation and substitute teach. She won't have a teaching license for the state of Wisconsin so I'm not sure how this would work, but I also don't want her to leave where she wants to be just because I want to start my career somewhere she doesn't really want to be. I could honestly see myself having a long career at this company. 

Ultimately we're still broken up at the moment, but I'm seriously considering getting back together with her. I love this girl, I really do but I also know LDRs aren't for everyone and I do love physical connection and support. She is telling me to take my time and really think about what would make me the happiest because that's what is most important in life. She has shown that she's willing to compromise so now I'm just seeking some guidance from you lovely people. So so sorry that this is so long, I just needed to try and provide all my thoughts.

Thanks so much in advance!!! &lt;3

**TL;DR - Gf and I are in a LDR, communication and planning suffered and ultimately lead up to blow up and break up, guidance needed.**"
54uo6c,1,2016-09-28,Am I [22M] wasting my time in my relationship with my girlfriend [22F] of 4 years?,AmIWastingMyTimeHere,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54uo6c/am_i_22m_wasting_my_time_in_my_relationship_with/,"My girlfriend Michelle and I have been dating for the past 4 years. We met freshman year of college and have been happy together since then, excepting the occasional argument that every couple has. Over the summer, she went abroad for an internship. Michelle had always been a bit of an introvert, and was really worried about going, as she didn't really know anyone there and was afraid she wouldn't make any friends. But, at my and a few of her friend's urging, she did go, and it worked out amazingly for her. She made a lot of new friends, loved the job, and they even gave her a full time offer when she graduates in the Spring.  


I am, of course, super happy for her. She's got a well paying job already landed in a city she really likes, with a boss she likes, and friends there already made. The problem is this: We are very different majors, and while the city where her job is has amazing opportunities for her, there is a slim to none chance I'll be able to also get a job there as well. Previously, when talking about post-college plans, we always talked about staying in the same city, assuming we would move in together and see what follows. (We talked about marriage and both decided we would like to get married someday, but ultimately decided we were too young to think a ton about it yet)


With this new job though, everything has changed. The company gave her only until the middle of October to accept, and while both her and I have been applying to a ton of places, there hasn't been anything yet. She has a smattering of interviews, but nothing quite as appealing, and I have gotten jack shit (her field starts hiring much earlier). Michelle doesn't want to reject the job offer, especially if she doesn't get another offer before then, basically shooting herself in the foot (maybe in the head if she doesn't get anything else good). On the other hand, she knows that accepting the current offer does not mean well for our relationship.


If that wasn't bad enough, ever since she got back from the internship, she seems... different. We don't kiss as much as we used to, and physical contact seems like it's lessened. Whenever we got back from summers before, we were all over each other for a good week, but this time it seems like we skipped that phase. We've had sex only 4 times since she got back about a month and a half ago. I know that sounds whiny, but it's a huge decrease from before, where we would have sex every night for the first week we saw each other, and then sex about 2 times a week once we settled into our normal routine again. In general, it seems like she's checked out of the relationship, and when I asked her about it (we ended up talking for ~2 hours), she said that while she is worried about the relationship, she feels when I initiate sex, I seem too pushy and that takes her out of the mood before she has the chance to get in the mood, and then ends up getting annoyed. I sorta get what she means, but I'm not sure what to do. I find her extremely attractive, and of course I want to have sex, and even more so than usual, since I've been missing the sort of closeness that we had before she returned from her internship. It seems like a positive feedback loop, as the more I want to be with her the more ""desperate"" I seem. I get not wanting to come on too strong for a girl, but that's generally something for someone you've been dating for a month, not 4 years! It makes me feel neglected and completely unloved by the person I should feel closest to.


As I said before, we have talked about this, and she wants time, saying that things will stabilize and go back to normal, but I'm worried that there's not much point. It's been a month and a half already. If she's checked out of the relationship, sex and closeness are greatly diminished, and the relationship seems doomed anyway, then why am I here? I've been in a relationship all of my college life, skipping the stereotypical ""crazy college years"" for a girl I genuinely care about and love. With most of what I've just written talked about already on the table between us, she is very against breaking up. I'm worried that if we do end up breaking up, I'll be the ""bad guy."" since we've been dating since we got to college, we have the same friend group, and I'm also worried that it'll cause a huge divide, alienating either her or me from the group. We've been dating since most of our friends have known us.


Thanks for reading through my book. :/ If anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it.

  **tl;dr**: I feel like my girlfriend has checked out of the relationship and am worried I'm wasting my time in a relationship that is doomed to fail."
54us65,20,2016-09-28,My 1991 Pontiac Trans Am,91ws6ta,Pontiac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pontiac/comments/54us65/my_1991_pontiac_trans_am/,"Hey everybody,

I recently bought this TA in June as a gift to myself. I'm currently in college with a daughter, and I was blessed enough to get an internship that afforded me the opportunity to continue my passion for cars, specifically Pontiac. Here she is:

1991 Trans am. Originally a 305 LB9 car, but was swapped with a 350 crate motor with &lt;10k miles. I'm not 100% sure of the engine since I can't reach the numbers by the distributor, but I do know it's the 5.7LG, and based on the head humps it was intended for TBI trucks. Currently TPI. Transmission was completely rebuilt with a shift kit right when I bought it. 125k miles on body, less than 10k on motor, and less than 1k on rebuilt trans. Mastercraft tires with brand new off-brand Welds. Paint is a Toyota color actually, painted by previous owner. Originally Maui Blue. WS6 suspension.

All I have done to it so far is remove the sagging headliner, replace the airbag wheel with a mid-gen 3 spoke, and replaced the gauge lights with red LED to match the later Pontiac gauges. It currently needs an aero spoiler, new rear end in the next 1-2 years, and the headlight motors rebuilt.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRFES6i0s_Q

Not trying to brag by any means, just wanted to share my car and my passions for Pontiac (currently have an 87 project and an 06 G6 coupe as a daily). And anyone willing to talk about theirs or living around Ohio who would like to get together as well while the weather is nice.

Thanks for reading!"
54v25d,5,2016-09-28,[OFFENSE] Vigil,antiquatedCreator,OverwatchHeroConcepts,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchHeroConcepts/comments/54v25d/offense_vigil/,"Here's my second attempt at making an Overwatch hero, after my first (Astromancer).

Hero Name: Vigil

Real Name: Daniel Adamsson

Age: 20

Occupation: Holographic engineering intern

Affiliation: Overwatch

Role: Defense

HP: 250 (100 shields, 150 health)

Pros: Sacrificing almost all ranged capabilities, Vigil is a very close quarters defensive hero. Utilizing his sword, Vigil can quickly dispatch enemies before him by slashing his sword. His alternate fire gives him a bit more range.

Cons: He can be seen as an 'inferior Genji', as Vigil lacks the mobility that Genji does. He doesn't have a way to heal himself, and coupled with his poor mobility, this can be deadly if Vigil cannot escape combat fast enough.

***Contributors:***
Myself, Crappy_Warlock (Holographic Arena), Ultisaurus (Sword damage buff)

#Abilities

***LMB – Hard Light Sword*** Vigil's only weapon, capable of delivering 60 damage per slash. It makes a high pitched digital whistle as he slices through the air. It is weaker than Reinhardt's hammer, but makes up for this with its attack speed.

***RMB – Blade Shot*** Vigil aims his blade at someone and fires it at an enemy (in the same vein as Mei's alt fire). Deals 40 damage, 2 second cooldown for blade to reform. Takes one second to charge a shot. Makes a computerized 'rippling' sound as it is fired.

***Shift – Holographic Arena*** Vigil raises a cylindrical barrier around him and one enemy hero that he targets that's within range of him. The barrier has 500 health and cannot be climbed, but immediately falls if either one of the heroes in the barrier die. While up, Vigil and the enemy hero must engage in personal combat. Naturally, you don't want to encase a Roadhog with this, but it can be used to block off a healer from their party or to box in a mobile hero to fight alone. It lasts for ten seconds, and has a twenty second cooldown. You must be on near level ground with the targeted player, and within fifteen meters of them. The wall is five three meters high, but you cannot jump into the arena. You'll 'slide off the top'.

***Passive Ability – Parry*** Vigil always blocks quick melee strikes with his sword.

***Q – Pillar of Holography*** Vigil kneels as he drives his sword into the ground, erecting around him a circular wall of holographic light that extends into the sky. This wall expands for five seconds until it reaches about fifteen meters. It protects anyone inside the wall (as allies can pass through it) while enemy projectiles are eaten by it. Enemies that touch it take 30 damage per second, and get knocked back as the wall expands. A sound reminiscent of digital windchimes echoes through the air as Vigil creates this sanctum of holographic light. It lasts ten seconds. It stays at max size for seven seconds before shattering like glass.

#Character

***Nationality:***

Icelandic

***Personality*** 

A reserved young college student with a brilliant mind for holographic engineering. He interns at the company that supplies forces with holograms and hard light technology (such as Reinhardt's shield), and takes his job very seriously. He isn't the greatest at teamwork, and the company he works for notices this, and opted to send him into Overwatch to have him build his teamwork skills.

***Appearance***

Wearing a padded grey coat with a double layered hood, Vigil has plenty of room to swing a blade.It's similar to what the Assassin in this video wears, minus the beaked part of the hood and the backpack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgHeqxpXVk

***Backstory***

Born to caring parents, Vigil was raised in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis in a place where Omnics were greatly despised. He did not grow a hateful prejudice to the Omnics, but was very wary of them regardless. Since he was a child, he had a very talented mind for understanding the intricacies of holography and hard light. Fascinated by holograms and the things that could be done with them, he grew up watching English and German documentaries on them, even if he couldn't understand them. He just wanted to watch. There were few videos in Icelandic about holography. He loved science fiction, and often emulated playing with toy swords in his yard like they did in the movies, which prompted him to briefly go into fencing. Unsatisfied with the competitive play, he quit and continued to pursue his hobby of holographics.

Soon, he entered university and began to major in holographic engineering. Soon, he began to intern at a company that produced holograms, hard light, and shields. He was brilliant, and the scientists loved the efforts he put to his work, but found that he had a difficult time working in a team. To get him more accustomed to working with others on projects, they sent the young Daniel to work for Overwatch as a holographic technician. At first, he didn't seem to fit with the 'hero posse', and instead kept to fixing their ship's holographic displays. They didn't seem to interact much with Daniel.

During one of Overwatch's training matches, Daniel had to go out into the field and repair a broken hologram fixture. He used his holographic technology to give himself a personal 'hard light tube' to sit in while he worked so he wouldn't get pelted with incoming fire. One of the heroes saw Daniel and had him figured to be one of the heroes in the match, trying to shoot him. It was a no-sell, and Daniel barely noticed. After seeing Daniel's own hard light technologies capable of defending himself, an Overwatch agent approached Daniel and asked if he wanted to try fighting once. Daniel didn't know how he'd fight, considering he had no experience with a gun. The agent tells him that he didn't need one, and that he can use whatever weapon he was comfortable with. They were supposed to get him into working with a team anyway, so pairing him with five others in combat practice would be effective in helping this. They had Daniel make himself a combat kit that he would use in a payload practice mission in the Numbani practice map, where he would put his hard light technology to the test...

***Emotes***

1. Flourish: Vigil spins his blade around him quickly, and points it ahead.

2. High Ground: Vigil points two fingers forward as he levels his sword with his cheek. (This is a reference to Star Wars' Soresu stance that Obi-Wan uses in ROTS)

3. Feel the Breeze: Vigil puts his sword away and lowers his hood, as a wind flows by him and relaxes him.

4. Homework: Vigil sits down with his laptop and begins doing his university work.

***Highlight Intros***

1. Heroic: Vigil activates his sword and holds the blade before his face before looking warily at the camera.

2. Holographic Kata: Vigil spins his sword about, a trail of blue energy marking the air as he drags it through it, before spinning it and holding it in front of his face with a determined expression.

3. One on One: Vigil tosses out some sort of device, which raises the Holographic Arena. He activates his blade, and holds it aloft, anxiously ready for combat.

4. Stab the Ground: Vigil kneels as the camera pans to his face. Anxious yet determined, he shuts his eyes and pushes his sword blade into the ground. The Pillar of Holography spawns around him and begins expanding, and Vigil opens his eyes as his sword's light illuminates his face from the ground.

***Skins***
Four main colors:

- Rauður (red)

- Blár (blue)

- Gulur (yellow)

- Grænt (green)

Epic skins:

- Snjór (white)

- Skuggi (black)

Legendary skins:

- Vísindamaður: Vigil adorns a form fitted, padded lab coat. Colored a dark grey.

- Tæknimaður: Identical to Vísindamaður, but gold and black instead of grey.

- Hermaður: Ancient icelandic armor, with dark fur and metal. His ultimate becomes a vortex of wind instead of a wall of light. His sword now has glowing Anglo Saxon runes lining the blade, and instead of firing blades, he shoots a more 'magical blast' from his sword.

- Hetjulegur: Same as Hermaður, but with white fur, lighter metal.

54vm5w,4,2016-09-28,Any advice?,AH-WA,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/54vm5w/any_advice/,"Hi,

Hopefully this subreddit may be able to help me out, although I have noticed a lot of this subreddit is based in the US but any advice would be helpful.

I'm 24 with a Bsc (Hons) in Consumer Marketing, I have 1 year and a bit of experience in Marketing related jobs, be they social media marketing, to events marketing, guerilla marketing etc. 

I would say that I'm a good all rounder, I can graphic design, I can video edit, I can come up with exciting marketing campaigns ideas to generate consumer involvement, I am constantly looking at ways that various marketing campaigns are engaging with potential consumers and how I could improve it.

Anyways, I recently finished an internship for a digital marketing company, I was good at my job but they weren't able to afford me after the internship so I was let go. It was a handy job and I picked up a few more skills but in some aspects I sort of knew more than my employers. The thing that annoyed me about the job was that I was able to give ideas and they loved them but I was never able to meet the client to put forward the ideas, to look at the physical space and see what I could come up with.

Now that, that is over, I have been applying for jobs (Marketing Assistant etc) and I get rejected, even some jobs I am a bit more than over qualified for I get rejected. The job market is tough at the moment here in Ireland but it's looking more and more likely that I may have to apply for another internship and not get paid, just to add more experience to my CV/Resume, something I don't want to do.

What advice would you have for me?


Many thanks!"

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston

* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Dealer's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have!

You have probably seen my posts here, and it's because they are working. We have hired 8 redditors this year and are hoping to spread the word about more opportunities to the community this way.

I work for an awesome recruiting agency called HireNetworks. We have clients ranging from giant, global banking firms to a variety of well-backed startups, mostly in the Triangle. We’re a small team that is made up of dedicated recruiters who work to know their stuff- who won’t contact you for jobs that don’t fit your skills, or ask you to help us ""do cutting-edge Swing work”. We want to help talented people get into companies where they can be recognized, challenged, and compensated at a level they feel is suited to them. PM me if this job might fit that bill for you, and we can get you talking to the hiring manager ASAP. (We hired him last November for the role, so there's a great relationship there.)

This is a Junior .NET role with a local Raleigh start-up. They are looking for someone who has at least 2+ years of commercial .NET experience (people with 1 year, internships only, or freelance only were not advanced enough unfortunately) to take over the maintenance and ownership of an enterprise SaaS app. You will be responsible for bug fixing, enhancements, customer implementation, and have the opportunity to grow into a Senior dev doing new product development over time. Ideally, you are the kind of engineer who can hit the ground running, and figure out how to do it better than its been done. 

It's a direct hire opportunity and candidates MUST be local to NC or already building/renting a home here (unfortunate misfires with a couple nonlocal candidates has made this client gunshy). Salary range is $65,000 - $80,000 with benefits, and great mentorship. OPT candidates will be considered, but not H1B or C2C candidates. If this sounds like you, PM me today and let's chat!"

Then Senator Clinton saw Andrea in the hall and snapped her fingers and said ""Get rid of it.."" at which time Senator Clinton's Secret Service detail grabbed Ms. Petersen and pushed her up against a wall in a doorway alcove while Senator Clinton and the rest of her detail continued down the hall.

Ms. Petersen was prominently wearing her Senate Staff ID at the time, and stated she was allowed to be where she was. The Secret Service ignored her and let her go once Senator Clinton left the hall.

Andrea Petersen-Brown is the daughter of Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett. And this is how Hillary Clinton treats other women, so why does she care about Donald Trump calling a Miss Universe contestant Miss Piggy?"
54wlgk,0,2016-09-28,Advice for Moving to Dallas/Forth Worth Area and Texas in general.,MizzouTiger2016,Dallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/54wlgk/advice_for_moving_to_dallasforth_worth_area_and/,"I was wondering if the individuals of this subreddit could shed some light on a couple of questions I have for seeking employment in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Mechanical Engineering or engineering in general. A little back story I am a 22 year old college graduate that has been working in the MEP consulting engineering field for approximately the last eight months. While I do love my job unfortunately it is in Missouri and Missouri, well its Missouri not much more than that, however a few summers ago I spent all of summer break down in Texas working at an internship and completely fell in love with the state for a multitude of reasons. Thus, I would love to find employment in a state in which I want to live for a vast majority of my life. I have been applying to job boards like Indeed and other websites like that religiously for the past couple of weeks but haven’t heard anything back yet. So here are my questions:

1. Can anyone shed some light on the current market for hiring out of state engineers and having them relocate to Texas? Basically I’m just curious if any cities in the state or the state as a whole are struggling to find engineers or are the markets so saturated with engineers that it’s next to impossible to find a job.

2. Are there any suggestions in order to make myself look more valuable to engineering companies that they would take a chance hiring an individual from outside the state? I like to think I have a good resume, 3.13 GPA, worked 30 hours per week in college, vice president of a racing team, registered Engineering Intern in the state of Missouri, trying to get into a distance grad school and currently employed. But by all means if there anything that somebody would recommend that would be great.

3.I guess the third and last question builds off number 1 but if anyone has been in successful acquiring a job within the state how long did it take you? 2 months, 3? A year?

Again if anyone has an advice/feedback for my current situation that would be great!"

54x4hi,3,2016-09-28,Quarter Life Crisis.......what now?,sterlingarcher00021,quarterlifecrisis,https://www.reddit.com/r/quarterlifecrisis/comments/54x4hi/quarter_life_crisiswhat_now/,"In a nutshell: I'm a mechanical engineering student. I'm on my last class and I'm looking for big boy jobs now. I can't bring myself to accept the life that is in front of me. Odd you might think...because most people would kill to have a mechanical engineering degree. That is perhaps one of those the ""grass is always greener"" things I guess...people need to believe there is something better in front of them for their own sanity I guess.

     Anyways...I'm 27. School has been very hard since I got depressed around 4 years ago (probably had something to do with horrible co-op experience too...I know internships usually suck, but I observed the senior engineers at work and it made me want to vomit). I guess I realized I don't really ""like"" any degree major enough to be interested for 4-5 years and then the rest of my life after. So I threw as much adderall, anti-depressants, binge drinking, and coffee at school work and coping as I could and I've made it this far. In hindsight, the damage that did to my body, mind, and spirit was probably not worth it (I'm pretty sure I've lost some years off my life)...but, I was too far in to get out due to the school debts. Probably TMI...but when I was 24/25 I got so depressed I couldn't achieve a proper erection for like 5 months...I was terrified. It is from this time in my life that I learned that when someone is THAT unhappy, literally nothing matters or is good enough to compensate...thus making all of the sacrifices to get the degree in the first place pointless, which is just a whole extra level of depressing.

     So yea...I'm smack in the middle of my quarter life crisis. My main problem is that I don't see it as a ""phase"" to ""get through"" and ""grow from"". It seems to me that the quarter life crisis is actually a process in which your mind is run through a meat grinder until the ""Theory of Cognitive Dissonance"" changes your outlooks and opinions as a means of psychological self-preservation...those people who struggle with objectivity seem to complete the process so so fast compared to the very objective minded. I wish that I could unlearn the psychology stuff that I looked into. So I actually feel that this process is involuntary and something foreign being imposed upon me. I feel trapped. How does one overcome this?

     I used to be a bit arrogant...I was a big seeker of knowledge and truth. I've now hit a point where I'm like...wow, I guess the truth doesn't really matter at all. At the end of the day, what matters is how you feel and what you believe...because we live we die and that's the end of it. Would you rather know the truth or be happy? So I find myself wishing that I could just believe in this career path and be enthusiastic about it...brainwashed or otherwise. Although, that may just delay the implosion until my mid-life crisis...it's a crap shoot...it really is. I'm basically that guy ""Cypher"" in the matrix who wants to get plugged back in because reality sucks so bad haha...

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

For as long as I've been concerned about online privacy, Facebook has been enemy number one. For some reason it always seemed more insidious than other services, even Google, because it felt like there was very little you could do to protect your privacy or opt out of invasive data collection. It always seemed to be the most greedy, the least shameful with their data collection, the least afraid of crossing boundaries, etc.

I've recently started to come to grips with the fact that I may have to get a Facebook for college. I've seen the message that you should protect your privacy but not in a way that's going to cause serious damage to your social/professional life and make you isolated and unhappy echoed numerous times on this sub, but I still feel extremely hesitant. Most of the social clubs, professional clubs and organizations, and a bunch of opportunities/news for internships, jobs, and student research positions are now primarily or even exclusively advertised on Facebook. Facebook is the primary mode of communication for most student organizations. It seems to be the primarily mode of communication for clubs, study groups, and other school events. My first year of college I missed out on so many things because I felt like I was kept in the dark not having any social media whatsoever. It really does alienate you from other people too.

So now I'm in a catch-22. Sacrifice some of my privacy for an improved social experience and more professional and academic opportunities at my university, or continue to be a ghost online and miss out. I know most people my age would pick option one in a heartbeat, but I just feel so sick. I've tried so hard up until this point to retain at least a little bit of my privacy, and I feel like all of those efforts will be for nothing if I cave in and get a Facebook. I don't want to see my hard work come crashing down. I'm terrified that whatever browser I use, no matter how many adblockers, cookie cleaners, VPNs, and other addons I use, no matter how many settings I tweak or if I religiously sign out of Facebook after I'm done using it and never click on their adds, click the like buttons embedded in other web pages, or sign into other websites using Facebook - that it won't be enough.

What should I do?"

My girlfriend and I have many problems, which I'll detail below, but before anything I must say I'm pretty sure I love her and that she loves me back.
The first year or so of our relationship was all I could ask for, and then some more she was loving and cared for me a lot. As time passed we had a few fights because she acquired a habit of mistreating me publicly, E.G. we’d be on the car and an argument on which music would be put on would derail onto her calling me her bitch and just do what she tells. I do understand that was one of the messed up ways she dealt with her insecurities, I got really fed up with a lot of it was clear to her something was bothering me, after some resistance I told her I was unhappy with our relationship, that was just before she travelled for a show in another state, when she got back things got a little better on that regard.
During that same time our relationship had already started cooling off our sex life was slowly dying and I tried to understand what was causing it, I asked her, we talked about it many times during the past couple of years, and as she asked me to, I didn’t stop taking initiative, but taking initiative has resulted on me being thoroughly rejected literally hundreds of times. For the past couple of years our relationship has been getting steadily colder with a few spurts of heat throughout the year, it always hurt me pretty bad so I’ve been constantly dissociating myself from this part of our life. 

Meanwhile as I tried to rekindle our flames I was focusing on other aspects of our relationship such as each other’s companies, watching movies, series and eating together things have been peaceful but unchanging, and another bad habit started to form, she became very dependent on me for many aspects of her life, I helped on her job applications, college work, took her to doctors, helped paying for the groceries in her home, and I’m happy to do it, but sometimes it feels she sees it as more of an obligation of mine that I MUST do, instead of something I do out of love, and she’s sometimes harsh when I’m late to pick her up at work and things like that. So now we’ve gotten to a point in which her life is in a dark place, she feels like I’m the only good thing in her life, and tells me she doesn’t know what she would do with her life if I left.

My company started lifting up, I’m getting better known, better looking, and she sees a potential homewrecker in any girl she doesn’t know who approaches me, especially with beautiful women. And a lot of those insecurities are getting projected on me, demanding me to stop being so nice to my new intern (who happens to have a crush on my business partner as I found out on her coaching sessions, as I explained to my girlfriend). Last month we almost broke up because I literally broke down crying from all the pressure and rejection, but we decided to give it a last shot. 

Things were feeling like they were improving and there was hope, but he had a fight Sunday, because I said I was forward a political reform on social security, she flipped out, called me a son of a bitch, said I was a spoiled rich mother fucker who cares about nothing but money, among many other things, and I just completely disconnected from our relationship since. She still wants to continue trying to work on things, I’m not sure we should. Not anymore, so well, should I stay or should I leave?.
 
PS: her father passed away long ago and her mother in completely nuts and unable to provide her with any support whatsoever.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: my girlfriend of 3.5 years and I have been trying to improve things on our relationship for over 2 years, without success, she's very reliant on me, and implied she would die if I left. I don't know what to do."

Sam said that, after Ant got fired, Opie hadn't spoken to him in over a year and when Sam told him he'd be happy to fill in for Opie when he's on vacation and whatnot, Opie never once asked Sam to do the show in his place. He only came on after Jim asked him, because Opie was out.

Opie made it clear that he didn't want Sam on their show unless he was going to do **all** the heavy lifting for Opie with things like Jocktober or the Intern Scuffles that he would cover on the After Show. Opie just wanted to sit back and commentate on the work Sam already did.

Sam should despise this guy the way we all despise a manipulative, asshole of a boss.

Jim was being less diplomatic but still to a maddening level.

Stop with this ""yeah we both can't stand each other but I don't hate the guy, he's done a lot for me"" attitude. There's no way Ant and Jim didn't, at least occasionally, talk about how terrible it was to work with Opie and how much it drained them to deal with him, day in and day out.

Jim said O&amp;J was so bad that it reduced his draw at standup shows, which is the only benefit he got from exposure on the show. He can pretty much solely blame Opie for the drop in ticket sales because he did stuff like shun Uncle Paul, not just from the show, but from Best Of's, etc. Or how he would just not have fun or go along with any of Jim's jokes, treating him like an outcast or some kind of poser on a show that he's a part of.

I'm annoyed that they got this reaction out of me but it's really time to drop the pretenses and just say what they want to say. Anthony finally did it and he's glad he did.

54yovj,16,2016-09-28,Ways I had it easy when I deconverted,spongue,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/54yovj/ways_i_had_it_easy_when_i_deconverted/,"It's been interesting reading the posts on here and all the struggles people had when leaving their faith.

For me, the hardest part was the overturning of my basic worldview; everything I thought was true, wasn't anymore, and it was disorienting. I was no longer an immortal being; belief in heaven had helped me get through scary times (open heart surgery). Along with this came the realization that I'd been shaped in many ways growing up that made no sense. It took 2-3 years of mental turmoil before I was finally able to accept that I just didn't believe in God and I had to move on to figure out what I did believe.

But some parts of my deconversion were pretty easy compared to a lot of what I'm reading here. 

I started dating my first girlfriend at age 17. We'd known each other since age 12 but she'd more recently joined my church and youth group, we went on a mission trip together, and after realizing we were passionate about God in all the same ways (and emailing daily for months), we started dating. 

We got married 2 weeks after I turned 20, having spent one school year overseas at a bible course, and another year at university; she had gone straight to university. While in Bible school I had really started to doubt the validity of God, the Bible, etc and eventually I would realize that I had absolutely no evidence that he was present with me or had made any difference in my life. At the time of our marriage I was still clinging to my faith desperately.

At age 21, after 1 year and 9 months of marriage, my doubt got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to come out. I'm not someone who can pretend to believe something I don't. So, I wrote up a 3 page, single spaced word document about my process of deconversion. Why I doubted, the problems I saw, what I was afraid of. I was at work and I sent this email to my mom, dad, and wife. I was super nervous about what they would say.

I got a reply pretty quickly from my wife, which she included my parents in. She was 100% on the same page as me! We had been sharing our doubts for a while, but I didn't know if she was ready to make the jump like I was. So that was awesome. We had each other to go through that whole process with. In our whole process from rabid Christians to atheists, and then even exploring ideas like pantheism and other ""universe"" mysticism and Buddhist-ish thought, we've pretty much always been on exactly the same page. The same is true for politics and social issues. We eventually got divorced, but that was for other reasons.

My parents weren't on the same page, it kind of made my dad uncomfortable but after a couple more exchanged emails he basically accepted it. Last I heard, he was thinking of himself as an agnostic; he says that my loss of faith really affected him. Funny because I'm pretty sure that the earliest hints of doubt in my life were because I could tell he didn't really believe. My mom didn't try to argue with me, she's a Christian to this day but what's cool about her is that she doesn't make her fears my problem. She probably worries and prays about it somewhat? Just like she's concerned when I go hitchhiking or thru-hiking. But she never tries to control me and actually our relationship is quite good. So I had it relatively easy on the parent front too. The rest of my religious relatives probably know by now but they don't bring it up with me.

Socially, I also had a pretty easy time making friends who weren't believers. I was living in Portland, OR, working as an engineering intern, and then back in Corvallis to finish school, and within a year I had at least a few good friends who were atheists. The metal scene is also a very safe place to be an atheist, especially in Portland.

So I don't know why I'm sharing this, I guess partly to say, wow I'm sorry for those of you who had it so rough in those areas! I don't really know what that's like. And maybe to encourage others of you that if you do come out more publicly, it's not necessarily guaranteed to be as hard as you think."

I was wondering what sort of places employ under 18 year olds. So far I've only heard of franchises/retail shops doing it - like the ones mentioned above - but what about internships, for example? I think it'd be good if the work experience I could get would be relevant to future career aspirations (moreso than retail, anyway). Said career aspirations are computer science/software engineering.

By the way, I'm still studying A-Levels most of my time, so things like apprenticeships aren't an option. "
54yzx8,1,2016-09-28,Can I get a little advice on my current situation?,KidCasey,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/54yzx8/can_i_get_a_little_advice_on_my_current_situation/,"So I graduated in May. I've been talking to this agency (for an internship) since a couple weeks after graduation. After the interview I was told to contact them in a couple months as they couldn't take anyone on. The CD who interviewed me seemed to really enjoy my style, attitude, and work.

After I contacted them again I waited two weeks without a reply. So I followed up again and the CD asked for me to send work (beyond what we reviewed during the interview) and that we would keep talking. I understand it takes a while to make decisions like this, but that was last week. I would like to have some type of status report because this is pretty frustrating as you can imagine. 

I've been applying other places as well without much luck. What should I do? I'd like to at least ask how far along they are in reviewing my work but I do not want to pester them. However, these long gaps in communication seem rather unprofessional to me. Going so long without work after graduation has been disappointing but I am holding out hope for this place since it has always been one of my top choices. 

I can provide more info about the situation specifically if anyone can offer advice. But I find it distasteful to plaster it right on the sub.

Thank you in advance "

There are no obvious internships for Diablo (ALL the other franchises got at least one), which is strange because it's a natural entry point - there's a hardened development environment and infrastructure to learn on with predictable season-to-season updates.  Even with D4/D3X2/D2HD/WoD/Diablonopoly on the way, you'd think there'd be some movement there, but not even a mention?  Curious.

5502gy,2,2016-09-28,Strain on Our Friendship,FutureProg,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5502gy/strain_on_our_friendship/,"For the past few months I thought I was doing better at controlling my anxiety. This summer I had an internship and other than the flash of anxiety I had when presenting something to my boss I was in what felt like complete control. Looking back I wonder if I just shoved aside any triggers and am only thinking about them now (as in they've all suddenly caught up with me). 

Today my best friend said to me ""I'm tired of taking care of a six year old girl"" referring to how I react to certain things. I told him I've been trying to control how I act better, but clearly it wasn't good enough. He's always been there for me and for him to say that he must have been fed up. My insecure thoughts keep bubbling up, and I can ignore some of them but usually they slip out and we can normally talk about them. 

I don't think it's right for me to rely on him anymore though—I was wondering why he was so open to talking about my anxiety anyways. The most I can do to make him more comfortable is practice ""hiding"" what's bothering me I suppose. I'm thinking it's time for me to go to the councillors at my university but of course I'm afraid to do so (I don't want to become dependent on a councillor, and I don't want my parents to think about this..). 

I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable with these worries, and I don't want these thoughts of mine to keep interfering with my relationships. Sorry if this is so disorganized, I don't know where my head is at right now. 

Any thoughts? "
550jbf,1,2016-09-29,Recreating an existing site in WordPress,HarmonicNole,Wordpress,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/550jbf/recreating_an_existing_site_in_wordpress/,"I've been tasked with updating a website for a company, as well as making it so they can edit things manually themselves.  I've gone with WordPress as I felt that was probably the easiest option for them to later be trained on how to use it and make minor adjustments.

The website currently is a mix of html, css, and php files someone else made.  I'm wondering if there's a way to get all of that together into a theme of sorts for WordPress to use, or if it's better to just start from scratch and try to recreate what they've got (with some tweaks)?

I'm admittedly a bit in over my head, as I've never used WordPress in depth, and before this hadn't worked on much more than rather simple sites.  This is an unpaid internship so it's not like I'm charging for my time, but I would like to learn and go about this in the best way possible.

Currently I have a local server going and a site setup in WordPress that I've been messing with a free theme to try and learn how to manipulate.  But I'm wondering if I'm approaching this wrong.

Any suggestions?"
5511d1,1,2016-09-29,I'm wondering when life is going to stop violently fucking me up the ass.,yamzies,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5511d1/im_wondering_when_life_is_going_to_stop_violently/,"This is a really long post. You don't have to read it. I just need to write all this out.

This past year (September to September) has been the worst in my life. I've dealt with general anxiety disorder since I was 12, but even then I was still a happy person. I had hobbies - I loved to read, I painted, I had a thirst for knowledge and wanted to learn everything about everything, I was always laughing (when I wasn't having an anxiety attack), everyone loved me. Now, I'm just a shell of who I used to be. I'm not the girl my fiance fell in love with. I'm not that amazing daughter parents cherished, I'm not the amazing owner to my dogs that I used to be. 

Last September I started school again to finish a diploma that I didn't complete because I failed a couple classes. It's a common trend with me... go to school, fail, drop out rinse and repeat. Still, despite that, I was still a generally cheerful person. This time was different. This time I knew exactly what it meant to be truly depressed. 

I had no motivation to do anything... simple tasks were absolutely brutal to try and attempt. I remember one day I had a dream that I died in a car accident. I was telling my fiance about it and I paused and I said, ""the fucked up part is... it wasn't even a bad dream"". That was when he realized that I was not in a good place at all. 

In November he proposed to me... I was happy, but it wasn't that burst of joy that I would've experienced had I not been in such a terrible place. The anxiety started kicking in. I felt worthless, I felt like I didn't deserve him, that I'll never be the partner that he should have. I still feel that way. 

In December I realised I failed a class. I wasn't going to graduate with my peers. Ironically, it was the easiest class too... the reason I failed? I didn't do the weekly homework assignments. Because I couldn't motivate myself enough to do them. I did the homework for the other classes because I was in teams and I felt pressured not to fuck them other... but when it came to myself, fucking myself over is easy. I didnt tell my fiance about it for so long because I knew he would be disappointed in me. He urged me to go therapy. 

I went to a few sessions of therapy and it helped, it really did. It was free because it was offered through school. I started feeling better. Until one day I got a call from the office saying that my appointment was cancelled that day, and I'd have to call back and book another appointment. I never did. 

In March I started my internship. I was supposed to complete 3 assignments for my practicum boss. I completed one, and I did a really good job. He was impressed. I had hope that I would get hired afterwards. Then the depression got really bad... I never finished the other two assignments. I basically ghosted them. I never passed the internship. My fiance doesn't know about this. 

In May I was feeling like I needed something to pick me up. I needed some excitement in my life. With my fiance's approval, I started posting on GoneWild. I've always been a bit of an exhibitionist, and I just felt like I needed something... praise and validation from strangers. He was ok with it... he had one request though, that I didn't send private pictures to people I was talking to. I ended up breaking his trust by doing it. He didn't tell me when he initially found out, just tried to justify it to himself. But one day he broke down and told me he knew. I felt like complete horse shit. These men were nothing to me, I just wanted to feel appreciated and feel beautiful... so I went ahead and did the one thing my man asked me not to do. 

In June, I lost my engagement ring after a night out partying with my friends. I still haven't gotten over it. I put it in my purse after washing my hands, and at the end of the night when I was really drunk, I saw a homeless person begging for change. I reached in my bag, scooped up my change, and dropped it into his cup. I realised when I went home that I must have given him my ring as well. I was devastated. My fiance was devastated. I was sure he was going to leave me, for some reason he never did... he's a saint. 

In late June, my parents found out I was posting on Gonewild. My dad called me a whole bunch of horrible names, my mother ignored me and would hardly talk to me for a whole month. I begged and pleaded for them to forgive me. I told them I would stop posting. And I did, for a short while. But posting was the only thing, is the only thing, that made me feel the slightest bit better about myself. It became like a drug. I started posting again, they found out, and they disowned me and kicked me out of the house. 

One night my fiance and I were discussing the wedding. He wanted to just go to the courthouse and not throw a party. I wanted a party because it's what I've always dreamed of as a little girl. He broke down and started crying about how he doesnt know how we'll afford it, and that he feels like shit because he knows I'm hurting so much, and he feels like he's not doing a good job taking care of me. I felt absolutely horrible that he's been keeping these feelings inside for so long. I was so caught up in my own bullshit that I never stopped to think how it was affecting him. When did I become so selfish?

For a while after I moved out from my parents house things were going fine, until I got the call on Sunday from my boss that business is really slow and she has to lay me off. I'm jobless. My fiance is supporting me now but I just don't even know anymore. Nothing is worth it. I need to find another job, I can't find the motivation to write a fucking cover letter. I can't go to therapy, because I can't afford it. 

The only reason that I haven't gone and killed myself yet is because I don't want to cause him pain. He's done so much to try and help me, I can't throw all that back in his face. I can't leave my two dogs behind, who both need me and love me, despite the fact that I've been a really shitty owner lately. If I knew that no one would get hurt, I would've offed myself a long time ago.

I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do anymore. This isn't who I am... I used to be fun, outgoing, carefree. Now I'm a shell of a person who does nothing with her life except post naked photos of herself online for people to jack off to, while hurting the ones she loves.

5525nb,1,2016-09-29,M4F Let's Build a Fun RP Before the Weekend,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5525nb/m4f_lets_build_a_fun_rp_before_the_weekend/,"Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd

* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin

I don't know much about the clubs engineering majors typically get involved in but would like to know more. Junior year of ME is pretty horrible so my free time is kinda limited, but I realized when trying to write up my resume for internships today that I have like, no experience aside from my job. I'd like to change that by potentially joining a club that not only helps me get experience in my field but is also fun and won't feel like a chore to go to. Also shouldn't be a wild time commitment.

I emailed a few clubs like buckeye bullet and the ASME club but I don't think are active currently (didn't know they weren't active until now)."

It was a work party, my group had just successfully deployed a product after 3 months of back breaking work and was a cause to celebrate. Even the family and spouses were welcome so Sarah my intern had brought you in : Scrawny little guy standing in one corner with glass of wine in his hand.

Well your eyes were on us, you as well the whole room, your gf in her boss's arm with half the office in attendance. Everyone had an idea that I had thing for petite blonde girls with cute ass and nice tits!! But still to have Sarah in my arms while you were present was bit much .. I flashed a smile in your direction as I tugged your girl close to me..I could feel her firm breasts against my broad chest.

552h46,3,2016-09-29,Need a little advice (another one of those),PP8900,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/552h46/need_a_little_advice_another_one_of_those/,"I posted my portfolio on here a few months ago (probably around March.) I received some positive and some negative critiques. But hey, it's subjective. I went to the One Show portfolio review to get some feedback, and sent my book around to past instructors (I did Continuing Ed at SVA) with the preface that I know my book isn't perfect, but I'd like to get a read of where I'm at and what I need to improve on.

The main feedback seemed to be that I write well and have some good headlines, but I need better ideas. I had a few food products. One instructor said that I need to diversify the products in my book because I'm maintaining too similar a voice throughout. Also, from looking at graduates on Modern Copywriter, I realized that I had too much print and not enough digital.

So I took a class that focused on 360, digital in particular, and developed a few new campaigns. I'm currently working on these campaigns and building them out. Pretty much I'm taking my insight and any headlines I have and designing everything on my own. It's not perfect, but I have some (enough) skills to make a semi-decent book. 

So here's the thing: I currently work in-house as a copywriter. I'm not quite sure if this works for or against me. I wanna work in advertising. It's been my dream for some time now. Seeing as my book will never look as good as someone from VCU—I don't have the design skills and can't seem to find an AD— do I apply for internships? Do I apply for a junior position? Will the fact that I've worked as a CW in-house for over a year mean anything?

I think my main concern is taking an internship then not being brought on full time. Does this happen often? Would I have to suck to not get offered a full time or do agencies sometimes offer internship then give a handshake and pat on the back when it's over?

I know I'm counting my eggs before they hatch but it's been bothering me as of late. 

Thanks in advance."
552hn8,206,2016-09-29,"I have an update for everyone, I asked for help here 2 years ago when I was 17 and told my imam stepfather and mother that I couldn't be Muslim anymore. Long story of everything that happened inside.",RebornSpartan,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/552hn8/i_have_an_update_for_everyone_i_asked_for_help/,"Hey everyone. Good morning. 

I made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/29c8an/i_snapped_today_and_i_think_this_is_going_cost_me/) 2 years ago. 

Here was my situation:

Lived in the US since age 7 with with stepfather and mother. 

Physically abusive parents who enforced islam on me, broke my bones (literally), pushed me to my limited mentally, and put a road block in my education.

My parents had messed up my immigration situation as well, so I wasn't able to get a job, drivers license, any of that. 


The situation I described in the thread had happened, and then for a few months or so (if my memory is correct here), I told them I had just ""lost my temper"" so as not to become homeless and literally be sent away from home with nothing. 


I had a savings account with about $1300 in it saving up for this situation, as I knew it was coming. This was literally years of me saving up from mowed lawns, 4 winters of shoveling driveways, buying fixing and selling xboxs and gameboys from craigslist, etc. 

I met someone from that thread I made that helped me figure out my immigration situation. I owe all of emancipation to him. 

So fast forward to when I had to leave home. It was finals week at school (senior in high school), and I couldn't take my motorcycle to work so I had to borrow our only car. My stepdad texts me and tells me to come home because he wanted to take the car and go somewhere. I couldn't really argue. I used to get put in situations like this all the time from him. 

He values good grades, so if I leave in the middle of my AP statistics final he would hit me. If I didn't bring the car to him because I had finals he would do the same. 

He wouldn't stop texting me so I left, knowing I would get a zero. He was already angry I tried to stay out of the way as much as possible so he wouldn't take it out on me. 

He did, and something just snapped in me. I had been cultured, forced to just accept everything that happens to me in that household because islam said so, because I had no other options for a place to stay, because I wouldn't know where my next meal would come from. 

After he hit me for the last time, and I use that word lightly here it was always much more severe than a slap or something mild like that. I've had 3 broken fingers, broken my hand on multiple occasions, my back is covered in scars, the list goes on. 

Anyways after he hit for the last time, I kind of just stood there blankly and waited to see what he would do afterwards. He told me to get in the car, and implied that he would be taking me to school again. Not only was I in no condition to go back to finals while bleeding and in no state to perform final exams, but I knew he would likely keep hitting me in the car. 

This was legitimately the first time I said no to him, going against what he was saying directly, it was always Yes Sir (in arabic) and whatnot. 

He tried to chase me and gave up pretty quickly. He said if I didn't come back now that I wouldn't be able to come back. I didn't say anything and just kept running.

I know his schedule pretty well, so I knew he'd be out of town for a little while. I waited outside for 16 hours in the rain at the forest behind our house with my phone off to save battery life. 


I went to gas station and got some water after that, and looked on craigslist for somewhere to stay. I found a room with no bills for $400 a month. I texted the ad poster and kind of told him what was going on with me, but that I had an internship lined up and had $1300 in savings that I would be using to pay him. 

I had been calling places all week looking for an internship and finally landed one that paid $150 a week. It was only a matter of time before I got started there. Getting my immigration situation sorted was an absolute must for me to get hired *anywhere*. 

I went back where home used to be, looked in the garage window to see if he was still there, which he wasn't. I climbed up to my window and got inside. My room had been locked from the outside, what a surprise. I filled two backpacks with of clothes and tossed them out the window. I packed a suitcase of my belongings and whatnot, my xbox, halo books, extra motorcycle gloves, whatever I could fit in a carry on luggage bag and hid it in the woods. This was pretty painful because there were a lot of things I really wanted to take with me. My cat, the 3D printer I had just spent $400 building from scratch, the 3D modeling PC I built, some other things from my childhood that I couldn't really transport. 

Anyways, I hid that bag in the woods in a trash bag so it wouldn't get wet. It was really late at night at this point and I didn't want my mom knowing I was in the house because she would probably call my stepdad or just generally scream at me. They had hid my motorcycle keys but I found it, and I found the spare too. I strapped one my clothing bags to my motorcycle and put the other on my back, and finally left. This was one of the weirdest feelings I had ever, ever felt. I was so incredibly scared. I cried on the way there. My mother didn't treat me like her son, but I didn't have anyone else. I felt like I was betraying my family, but I felt so free. So alive. Like I had been in jail for decade and forced to memorize half the quran and got beat up my the other inmates when I forgot to pray or couldn't provide evidence that I had.  

I got cash for the first month and deposit on the room I was going to rent from an ATM and drove over there. The owner met me outside, I paid him, put my bags in the room and went back to get my belongings from he forest. I strapped those to the bike and came back to the room, my new home. It was an 8x15 room, but it was mine. No one told me I had to made wuduu, pray fajr, fucking read quran. I was safe. I was free. 


My motorcycle was my best friend for the longest time. He took me everywhere and I owe my life to it. Its taken me to work, its survived 2 accidents from texting drivers without needing repairs, its taken me through rain and snow, happiness and fear. I likely just needed something to get attached to so I wouldn't break and turn into a psychopath, but I felt like I needed to say something about here about it. 

The internship worked out. The placed sucked and the work was awful, but I didn't have a choice. I got 3 more jobs and literally worked 4 jobs at one point. 

My internship turned into a full time job eventually so I quit my jobs and focused on that. Learned as much as I could to hopefully upgrade to somewhere better. 

Its been 2 years. 

I got car after about 5 months of saving. The winters in the midwest don't spare anyone. 

I got new job after about 1.5 years. Much better place than my last. 

I got the title to my motorcycle after some fighting and threatening. My stepfather (Peace and Shittings be upon him) is a public figure and I could easily cause some trouble for him and his long term plans, so I finally ""owned"" my motorcycle. 

I got my cat back. I missed him so much. I went over when I knew everyone was out of town and he kept trying to get to me through the window when he heard my motorcycle. I don't think I had ever felt more sad in my life, but I got him back eventually when I found a way in. He's a champ. He lived in that tiny room with me (thank god he had an amazing litter box) for so long. 

I got my own apartment now. I have free time. I have freedom. There's so much that I can do now, and so much that i'm actually doing. 

This post was meant to be sort of an update as to what happened, and a way for me to vent. I don't want to ""voice my story out to the world"" but I want others here to know that its possible to live outside of the world of your family, whether or not they're abusive, Muslim, or just assholes. 

If anyone has any questions about the process, please ask. It wasn't easy but I got a nice job without college and i'm even working on starting my own business now. 



I've spoken to a few people about my situation and almost everyone has told me that my hate for islam is because my abusive parents, that whole deal about how theres too much bias in my past for me to have an actual opinion. 

I know more Quran than Muslims and i'm not Muslim. I don't *hate* islam with a passion, I don't speak out about it, or anything like that. But I will never, ever, **ever** support it ever again. When Allah refused to answer the prayers of 11 year old me asking not to get hit because I forgot to make my bed, or because I forgot to take my dish to the sink, is the day Allah became a joke in my life. I still prayed with authenticity until I was 13 because I thought maybe I wasn't praying hard enough? It never worked. It doesn't work. It will never work. If you're a muslim in the US and you have a completely functional family with no complications and you like the teachings of islam, then great. I won't hate you but the second you ask me to pray with you or try to tell me what I ""should be"" doing is the second you end our relationship. Share your beliefs, share your insight, but don't share your plans for me. 






**TL;DR** I lived, my cat is happy and my motorcycle get oil changes every 2000 miles. Life is good.

I sort of just whipped this post up at work so forgive any typos please.


People I'd like to thank:

The lawyer who helped me. I owe so much to you. Him and I are still in contact, he's a great guy but I won't link his account. 


My motorcycle and cat. Both are great beings that take in money and spit out happiness. 


This subreddit. Although /r/AtheistHavens wasn't able to help me, you guy (ex moose sub) was really helpful. Some people here are too liberal at times, but I still like you guys. 


Things I think are worth learning from this post:

Don't let anyone tell you how to think as long as you aren't harming yourself or others. 

Moving out is fucking hard don't do it unless you have a job. Going homeless seems scary as hell. 

Get a job

Have a hobby that makes you active. Motorcycles were mine. 

Get another job

Be happy.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

552pkz,9,2016-09-29,Hapsical - Walter Van Beirendonck,thecanadiancook,malefashion,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/552pkz/hapsical_walter_van_beirendonck/,"*I mean to take no credit for these words. All writings have been reproduced from Hapsical (Peter got heavy into crossfit and deleted everything a while back)*

Acid house techno cyborg disco geisha bears. Clashing colours, ethnic prints, straight-out-of-a-video-game shapes, sci-fi obsession, holographic finish, high-tech synthetics. “KISS THE FUTURE! FUCK THE PAST!” The wild world of Walter Van Beirendonck is an exuberant place, where outrageous styling and upbeat shows are underlined by serious messages, and serious talent on the part of the designer himself – something which is being celebrated by Antwerp’s Fashion Museum as an exhibition opens next week exploring 25 years of output from Walter Van Beirendonck’s eponymous line.

[Van Beirendonck](https://i.imgur.com/6csD4Zu.jpg) studied fashion at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, before showing his first collection in 1983, as part of the ‘Antwerp six’ along with Dirk Van Saene, Dries Van Noten, Dirk Bikkembergs, Ann Demeulemeester and Marina Yee. What set Van Beirendonck’s work apart, not just from that of his fellow Belgian designers, but also from the prevailing moods in fashion at the time (the over the top glamour of Parisian couture, and the dark deconstructivism of the emerging Japanese school) was its light-heartedness and humour, combined with the designer’s bold visual statements and judicious use of colour and pattern. Van Beirendonck’s collections played on political messages about the environment, society and safe sex, while remaining optimistic, joyous and unerringly upbeat. If Rei Kawakubo’s counter-culture approach was to make everything dark, and perturbing, and semi-abstract, Van Beirendonck’s was quite the opposite: dress it up and pump it full of unstoppable energy almost to the point of madness. Everything screamed of youthful vitality – anarchy almost – and the postmodern mash-up of (youth) subcultures, from punks to acid house ravers to gay ‘bears,’ would come to frame a whole new attitude in menswear which persists today, with designers taking inspiration from further afield, including from womenswear, while pushing social boundaries with their work.

From 1993 to 1999, Van Beirendonck worked under the label W. &amp; L.T. (Wild &amp; Lethal Trash – or ‘Walt’ as it was known), staging elaborate fashion shows which often resembled huge warehouse parties more than anything else, featuring clothes with a distinctly futuristic vibe: ‘talking’ voice boxes, flashing lights, and holographic appliqués were common additions to the garments, many of which were constructed from high-tech synthetic materials. If brands like Boy London and BodyMap were espousing the vibe in a rough-and-ready way in London, while the likes of Moschino and Castelbajac were interpreting it with couture refinement in Milan and Paris respectively, Van Beirendonck occupied a unique position, blending high-end with ‘trash’ and cutting-edge with elements of mainstream pop culture. WVB’s work frequently blurs the boundaries between fashion and art (indeed, the designer has collaborated with the Austrian artist Erwin Wurm on several collections), and his ‘anti-fashion’ approach always provides an interesting meta-view of the haute couture world.

“I am so surprised that in 2010 people are still shocked by elements of sex and sexuality, as well as race and religion. These differences in people seem completely normal to me, and I am rather confused that it is not like that for everyone. I am trying to achieve an open vision and I want to show that there are many things socially possible today.” - Walter Van Beirendonck

When designers embrace a particularly ebullient aesthetic, there is often a danger than their true talent for making clothes (mastering the elements of material, cut, proportion, and so on) gets overshadowed by the overall aesthetic and energy. I wouldn’t call this a failure on the part of the designer, but it does mean a trained eye and some knowledge of the context is required. For the layman, the easiest response to much of Van Beirendonck’s work is to lay it off as mere absurdity – evidence of the ridiculousness of high fashion. What most people don’t know is that Van Beirendonck is a director of the fashion course at the Royal Academy in Antwerp, where he has helped now-famous designers including Kris Van Assche and Bernhard Willhelm on their way. A whole generation of young designers have been influenced by Van Beirendonck’s work too, from Jeremy Scott to Henrik Vibskov to Cassette Playa’s Carri Munden. And if any further explanation is needed for why I’m a huge Walter fan, consider this: he was partly responsible for turning to Raf Simons, a former intern of his, away from industrial design and towards fashion.

552qa4,0,2016-09-29,Thighs during first one night stand,ronald87,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/552qa4/thighs_during_first_one_night_stand/,"Angie was 32. She lived in an apartment with two other women in Brooklyn, had been laid off from her job at a jewelry store, was looking for freelance work for making jewelry on Craiglist. That was how she put it. She had long brown hair and freckles, came from what I sensed was a wealthy family on Long Island (they actually lived on another Island, off the LI coast), but she dressed like she was a college student from the 70s and had a plain, earthy demeanor. Well, she was the 70s. This was 2009, so she must have been born in 1976/77.

I...was a twenty-one year old college student on an internship in New York that summer. Read some of my other stories and perhaps you'll glean a summary of me.

I met Angie at a summer movie screening at Brooklyn Bridge park. It was early July and I was staying in my aunt and uncle's house...and they were gone on vacation with their kids. So it was just me, housesitting. I couldn't make up my mind on where to sit and also, I kind of in general wanted to get laid that summer. It had been a few months since I'd had any women.

So I saw Angie, sitting alone on a blanket, and I sat down next to her. Not right next to her, but close enough so she glanced over at me and I at her. I wasn't sure if she was waiting for somebody or if she was just lost in her thoughts. She turned to me finally and asked if I knew when the movie would start.

The movie was 'Raising Arizona.' At this point, I ask you to please look up the theme music from that film and play it to the action of the rest of our night.

Hours later, once the movie was over and the crowd had dispersed we found ourselves wandering through Brooklyn in search of a bar. Angie's fat roommate, who had shown up later on, had said to Angie, ""This guy's really cute Angie. Congratulations."" It was awkward for both of us, but it also paved the remainder of the way for me to get with Angie. Thanks fat roommate! 

Angie and I had a single beer at a bar near my aunt and uncle's place and I kissed her on the cheek there at the bar, on impulse. As soon as we exited the bar, she began acting drunk. It had just been one beer. We stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and made out while standing. 

She was doing it to tell me something even if she didn't know it yet. She was saying that she should get home and I started proposing that she come back to my place for a little while. She was reluctant. I kept saying it. 

Guess who won that debate?

Let's flash back for a second; there was one point during the screening when Angie was coming back from the bathroom and I saw her looking around for us, confused. I called out her name and looked at her legs as she turned. She wore corduroy pants that made her thighs look truly, idiosyncratically, sexy. As I watched her walk back to her spot I couldn't wait to get those legs wrapped around me...

...Back to present. We lay on the couch in the living room. I finger blasted her. I licked and sucked on her tits. She wore a teal colored bra. I'd never seen the color against another woman's tits. It was, like everything else about her, eccentric. But I liked it. 

She touched my hand and told me to slow down a little and I slowed down a little. I worked two fingers in a circle around the inside of her dampening pussy and she ran her fingers through my hair. Her breathing got heavier until it had turned into a series of inhales and gasp-exhales. When the gasp exhale that coincided with her thighs going
SQUEEZE
around my hand, I thought, why is she not contracting around my waist already?

She apparently thought the same thing, because she asked, 
""Where's your room.""

First we tried her idea; she sat atop the dresser after I put on a condom and I took her while I stood. I moved back and forth but my cock kept slipping out. It was then that I felt the-

SQUEEZE

of her thighs against my waist. They squeezed me in her attempt to keep me inside of her.

But it wasn't working, so we moved over to the bed. She lay on the bed sideways, legs open, arms outstretched, whispering, ""Come here..."" and I steered myself toward the flappy pink mess between her thighs. She helped guide me in and I went back and forth, back and forth, while she went 

AAAAHHHH uuuuuhhhhhh AAAAAAHHHHHH uuuhhhhh

until I started cumming and my cock throbbed inside her and-

SQUEEZE

went her thighs around my waist, once again.

After she was dressed again and I was ready to walk her to the train and I'd gotten her number and we'd kissed again, she asked me how old I was.

I told her, ""Twenty-One.""

Something passed over her face. She said,

""Oh. Well, I'm thirty two. So...that's what that is...""

I walked her to the train and we said goodnight and I never fucked her again."

The CEO just called me to personally break the news that the venture capitalist they were pursuing backed out at the 11th hour, and therefore they let me go.

All I want to do is drink and I see few reasons why not to.  I've had persistent suicidality due to my mental illnesses, and though I'm not thinking of hurting myself, I want to escape by drinking.

I don't do AA.  I do Refuge Recovery, phone meetings only.  My therapist is an intern and is only there M-W.

5537hj,5,2016-09-29,School Selection Advice,MBA_TrashAccount,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5537hj/school_selection_advice/,"Hello, r/LawSchool

First, if I am posting this in the wrong place please let me know. I gathered that the 0L sticky was for people already accepted?

Looking for advice. Be warned, this is a long read filled with detail that probably isn't necessary.

Background:
Graduated in 2013 with a B.S. in biology, math minor. 3.15 GPA from a Midwestern state school (due to full ride scholarship). No idea what I wanted to do with it, but biology had always fascinated me. Screwed around and had too much fun hence the low GPA, but I'm an excellent standardized test-taker (will elaborate on that below). Wasn't into the idea of medical school or medical practice. Worked part-time in IT (tech support) all through college. After graduating, worked same gig full-time for a while and then accepted a project management position with a construction company (father was a contractor so I grew up around it). Also, no good bio/biotech jobs around here. Did that for a year and a half and then went back to IT doing technical pre-sales for a F500 fintech company where I have been for the last two years. Getting that job took some serious self-selling. I am moving into a project management position with this same company at the beginning of the quarter. 

After working some time in construction, contemplating a move back into IT, wondering what the hell I actually want to do with my life, I started realizing how interesting I found our contracts / contract negotiations to be. As a PM I had to be very familiar with our contracts while managing commercial construction projects. 

I had also been doing IT work on the side through two different companies I started with two different partners. One does wireless networks and the other does web design. I mostly do sales and back office work for these as my partners are the hardcore techies. I still have these companies and continue to do some work for a few customers, very small gigs, but not as much as I did before I started my MBA. The point of this is I took great care in coming up with contracts for some of that work (which were probably garbage from a legal perspective, but gave a bit of legitimacy to my operation and made customers feel better about forking over money) and I really enjoy the process of forming an entity, coming up with an operating agreement, and negotiating contracts. 

I also excelled at debate through all four years of high school (marginally relevant). So, in summary, I thought maybe law would be interesting. Specifically business / transactional law. 

I wasn't immediately in a position to explore this idea too thoroughly. There are no law schools close to home and since we were expecting a child I needed to stay here and earn money for now. But I knew I wanted to work toward that so I started following some law-related podcasts, studying for the LSAT, and reading as much as possible- trying to maintain a critical perspective on arguments I would read. I took the LSAT and got a 166 (strong background in formal mathematics and logic, and have always been a solid test-taker). I knew that this score was pretty good but knew little else. 

At this point, with baby a few months away, I took the higher paying IT job where I could work remotely and earn more money while staying close to our family / support network. This company was fine with my side-gigs as long as I didn't sell to financial institutions or recruit away employees. Learned that this company has a good tuition reimbursement program. Started looking at an MBA as something to do in the meantime since I wanted to learn more about business and ultimately get into business law. Got a 710 on the GMAT (good enough score to get into a top B-school assuming matching GPA and experience) which got me some nice scholarships to a small, local (and locally ""prestigious""), fully accredited private school. These would cover a good part of what my employer wasn't covering. The idea of going to a better school wasn't an option since I was still pretty tied to my locale. I also wasn't trying to use the degree for a big consulting job or investment banking job or anything, really just to learn and network and potentially advance my position with my employer (which has seemingly worked, hence the change to a PM role - most of our PMs have MBAs). So I started that MBA in fall of '15 and will be graduating this upcoming spring with a 3.9 (assuming I don't screw up an easy class- got the tough ones out of the way already). Next step is law school. I will be in a good position to be able to move and I want to select an appropriate school for my background and interests. Even going into a new role with good pay, I still feel drawn toward law school after 2+ years of thinking about it. 

I know the MBA is mostly meaningless with respect to law school admission, but I think it fits in with the story of what I want to do and what I have learned. So... What do you guys think? Any schools you would recommend where I have a decent shot? I tend toward wanting to go somewhere where I have some scholarship opportunities, and I have this idea that I could intern with my current employer's legal department and potentially work in it after the JD since I work with our lawyers a fair bit on contracts and have a rapport with them. Would prefer to stay in the Midwest where it doesn't cost a fortune to survive. But I don't want to end up at a school where my opportunities are non-existent post-graduation. Especially since I'll have to take on substantial debt to go to law school. 

Tl;dr: lowish UG GPA, solid MBA GPA, pretty good LSAT (will probably retake though), decent work experience. Schools I should be looking at?

Apologies in advance for any typos / errors. On mobile.

What can I do to get more energy?,PerfectChaos33,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/5538up/im_anemic_and_always_exhausted_what_can_i_do_to/,"I've got a lot of stuff on my plate this semester, I'm working two jobs (one is an internship) I'm in college and I'm constantly exhausted. As soon as I get home I eat then go to sleep. And it seems I can never sleep enough. I'm always tired and ready to go back to sleep.

I was diagnosed with anemia a little over two years ago. It used to be really bad but my doctor recommended I change my birth control from the pill to the depo shot so my periods could go away. Without periods a majority of my anemia symptoms went away. I tried taking iron supplements but they gave me serious stomach pains. So I don't take them. I just try to maintain an iron-rich diet. 

Because of the anemia I sometimes don't have a lot of energy. And now since I'm so busy I don't have enough time to rest &amp; unwind. I'm exhausted and really stressed out as a result. What can I do to have more energy throughout the day?"

I am currently only taking 12 hours of classes, but next semester I will be taking 15 hours, and working 20 hours a week at my job. My half time job is only open from 8-5 so it is nice that I still have my evenings to spend time with my fiancée and to study and work on homework during that time. But my problem is that between 8 and 5 when I am not in class I am at work and because of this tight schedule I do not have time to stay after class to ask question or go to professor’s office hours. What I am doing now is not working for me as I am starting to fall behind in my math and chemistry class and I know I need to seek help from a tutor or a study group but everything I am finding ends at 5:30 or earlier. 

With my half time job I am not bringing in a whole lot of money but I am saving it for between semesters and fall/spring break when I will not be getting BAH. I can afford to quit my half time job with the BAH that I am receiving but I am afraid if I quit my half time job I will not be able to find a job over the summer. I am only a freshman so there are not any internships that I can apply to as most of them you need to be in at least in your second year. The job I have now is an office job which is perfect for me because of my disability from the military I cannot stand for long hours. So if I lose this office job I might be forced to work retail or fast food over the summer and basically make my life a living hell from standing all day long. 

I am probably going to quit my job so that I can take advantage of my professor’s office hours and attend those study sessions/tutor times. I am just afraid for what is going to happen once summer begins but I guess I will get there when I get there. 

So I guess my question is how have you all dealt with juggling work and school and the summer months?

TL;DR School is kicking my ass and I am going to have to quit my half time job but that makes me afraid for the summer months.

I'm a current ChemE Junior, and I'm starting to apply for some internships right now. I applied for a few last year, but never got one, so I'm hoping the fact that I'm a year older will help out now. I have a pretty decent GPA (~3.5) and have a solid lab research position, so I think I have some good qualifications to get at least a couple interviews.

I know from reading on here that some people had to apply to a TON before getting an offer. The only thing keeping me from going on a full application-rampage is the cover letter. I write a new cover letter for each position, which takes a bit of time considering I'm specifically catering each one to the company. 

Do you guys have any advice about how to streamline the process? Should I just write one and modify a couple things in the cover letter but make it less personal? I'm a bit at a loss on how to do this.

554bp0,4,2016-09-29,Feelin' a bit lonesome lately,ZackSam,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/554bp0/feelin_a_bit_lonesome_lately/,"I'm finally outta school for the first time and, while everything is all right overall, I have been feeling lonely this past week.

It's been 4 months since I've graduated uni, and of course friends have left to go back home or move to where their career takes them; but a good amount of my close friends are still here - post-grad and undergrad. The only issue is timing. I think back 2 years and it seemed like hanging out was second-nature. Now, it is a real task to get to see people between everyone's work, classes, and internships. It doesn't seem like all that much has changed, yet the reality of the situation is drastically different.

Now, the past year has been a bit of a rollercoaster; a lot of friends found a significant other and others are no longer friends. It just seems like I've lost many close friends to emotions (romance and frustration). I relied on these people as my pillars. They were people I could always just show up to hang out with, no warnings necessary. It's all changed now and it's difficult to adjust. 

Everything that seemed set in stone a year ago is now in transition. The absence of those supports I once relied upon is an intermittent reminder of the past. I have made new friends this past summer, but I do not feel so close to them yet, though they are each amazing people in their own regard. Hopefully, these friendships can grow into something more concrete.

With all this being said, I have one pillar that has remained a constant: my best friend here in Ithaca. I am so thankful for her. She was a major support this past year when I needed it most. Now, she is having a rough spell and I need to be there for her. 

tl;dr: I lost my peer support and have yet to fully re-establish the level of what I once had, leaving me feeling lonesome. I am still thankful for those I do have though."

A couple of months ago I was sent out for my internship to Surinam for eleven months to educate the youngsters out there, very overwhelming to see the major difference compared to my country, anyways, finally the last week came near and I got excited to go home, once coming home I checked my RS account I had to leave behind for nearly a year only to find out it got locked. 

This is very unlikely as I couldn't even connect to my account for eleven months, I do have a feeling that my account got hacked tho, because certain people have tried and succeeded to enter my email account. Whilst in Surinam my dad called me a couple times to tell me that he received emails from outlook that I need to change my password as someone from China (or at least from a Chinese IP address) at first tried to enter my email account (my dad's email is my security check email address for cases such as recovery), but I didn't take it seriously at first, because it sounded very sketchy to me. Until warning two came in, someone from the US now tried to enter, when I went up to a local computer to set a new password for my email account I noticed I was too late. I had to recover my email address, for that I waited until I headed back home.

When finally recovered my email account, I figured out that my OSRS account (Bad Form) was blocked/locked permanently. And then when you find out your account gets permanently banned for something you couldn't have possible done, makes me sad and pretty mad, the time I've putten into the account is just unreal, it might not have been the best account out there but for me it was heck of a work I've putten into it. And actually can't be asked to start all over for that matter, all motivation is gone.. I was really looking forward to play again.

Are there any people out there that have also experienced any kind of related bans/hacks? If so did you contact Jagex and in what kind of way? Did they help? I'm lost..


Thanks guys,

Bad Form

554int,2,2016-09-29,[Breeds] What breeds/mixes should we look for?,serindrana,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/554int/breeds_what_breedsmixes_should_we_look_for/,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be our first dog on our own (i.e., not a dog primarily belonging to a family member). We've both grown up in houses with dogs, and have family members who have dogs currently and are good models/resources for basic training and crate use. We’re also not planning to get them until we’re settled in at our new house, which won’t be until early December (at the earliest) so we have some time. :)

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We honestly aren’t sure. On the one hand, tons of shelter dogs are perfectly awesome and need good homes, and don’t come with the premium price of a purebred dog. On the other, supporting great breeders is definitely a plus, and we’d have more control over the history of the puppy.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Probably 15-30 lbs, medium energy level, interested in learning commands. Good with small children (we don’t have any yet, but will within the lifespan of any pets we get now), good with cat(s). We also currently have three rats, and while we don’t plan on getting more when they pass in the next year or two, we would obviously prefer that they’re not stressed because of a terrier looking at them as play things! Their large, metal cage is in the living room, and we will be doing out-of-cage time with them either with the dog crated or in a closed-off room

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I have a preference for herder dogs, though I don’t think I could keep up with the work requirements of a purebred border collie, for example. I really like their appearance, focus, size, and general behavior, though I can’t put my finger on what it is exactly about their behavior that sets them apart. I tend towards liking medium size to big size dogs, but given the size of our house, smaller would be better for now. My husband prefers dogs like spaniels due to experience with the breed, as well as terriers, lurchers, and sight-hounds for aesthetics and working reasons, but doesn’t believe their temperaments will work well with our behavioral requirements.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Aside from the basics (sit, stay, heel - we consider all of these no-argument, “safety” skills for the dog and their people), we’re just planning on handling any general manners or behavioral issues that come up. No obedience trials/competitions.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Probably an hour focused only-dog time (walks, training, etc), and general morning/evening sharing space together and low-key interaction (probably 5-6 hours a day?), usually with both of us involved.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At least half an hour to an hour today, largely walks but also trips to dog parks or hikes out in the woods. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Not too much brushing - maybe once a week or so. Not a lot of at-home grooming besides baths.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* 15-30 lbs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* No slobber, eh on barking and shedding but that’s part of having a dog! But a less “talkative” breed would be nice.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* For me, not very. For husband, very important - he intends to take the dog with him on hikes and camping trips and would prefer that the dog stay with him without needing to be tethered 100% of the time. If the dog is up for it, some casual hunting.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Leaning towards affectionate/snuggly. Having the dog hang out with them pressed against our legs is great, but not on top of us licking constantly!

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Alert, watching them, but not necessarily barking. No jumping on strangers/visitors. Super friendly.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Not really - not past the point where good training can eliminate the problem in most situations.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No, not really.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 5 days a week, for a maximum of 9 hours. This is likely to decrease with time, but we can’t say for certain. We’re also planning on making sure that during the puppy phase, the dog is left alone for only a few hours at a time. If necessary, we’re happy to hire a walker.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Just me and my husband!

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have three rats, and are planning on getting a cat both because we love cats, and so that the dog has a buddy in the house when we’re busy.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not yet, but in the next three to give years we intend to have a child or two.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No, we own our house.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Beaverton, Oregon.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer is 80-90 degrees with occasional (maybe seven days a year) around 100. Winter is 30-45.

555n2j,1,2016-09-29,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/555n2j/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

Okay, so there have been quite a few situations that have led up to this, and so I'll try to keep this concise. I'm really sorry if this gets long, which I've got no doubt it will! There are a few other people included beyond those mentioned in the title. I'll be using fake names, of course, and changing details, because if anyone in my friend circle read this, they'd know immediately who I was, so I gotta fudge details.

  ---   
**RELATIONSHIP(S) BACKSTORY:**

My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. We were friends at first, but about a year into the friendship, I began to have a huge crush on him. I would giggle with Abby about him and swoon, and Justin would do the same with his friend, Vale, about me. During the year we were just friends, he and I started a ""movie night"" tradition. I'm a weirdo who never really got into ""classic"" Disney movies, so he offered to watch them with me. One evening, he blurted out how much he liked me, then (LITERALLY) ran away. I was so flabbergasted, but it was adorable, and we talked, then found out we liked each other. We got together, and everybody was happy.

About a year and a half into our relationship (meaning Justin and I known each other about two years by now), I met another girl named Cee. We were acquaintances more than anything, really. At the time, she had had another best friend, Sally, and although Abby and I were fine with Sally, we weren't uber close with her or anything. Sally and I got along well, and we did have a few inside jokes, because we were both in love with a superhero character that goes pretty much ignored. Regardless, I was not *close* to her. Most of our interactions only ever happened when we were in big groups. I know this all seems irrelevant, but bear with me.

So, unknown to myself, Sally turned out to be a bit of a bitch. She talked shit about my relationship with Justin a *lot* for almost...no reason? She talked a *ton* behind my back to Cee, who would agree with her because she didn't know me very well. One day, Cee and I picked up conversation, however, when I expressed concern for her when I noticed some things that pointed to abuse in her household. We had a late night conversation where she confided in me about some issues with her family, how bad things were for her and her sister at home. Both of them are in college, and were desperately trying to raise money to move out, which they have now. We hit it off after that conversation, and she eventually me some of the things Sally had said about me to her. Cee said something along the lines, ""Then you and I started talking, and she would says stuff about you and things you'd done, which confused me, because all I could think whenever she did this was, 'What the hell? Cammie would never do that. She's a sweetheart...'""

It all eventually came out that *every* single one of the issues that Sally would tell Cee about me (just a bunch of petty shit that I was apparently doing that pissed her off, and ""kept doing"" even after she apparently confronted me and told me to stop) were lies. Sally made it all sound like everything I was doing was deliberate to anger her, when the truth was that I had *no clue* she had a problem, and she always only ever smiled to my face. It basically felt like we were all back in goddamn high school, because rather than speak to me (as was Justin's mistake later), she talked shit without merit. When all this came out, so did a lot of things that Sally had done to the others behind their backs, and so Sally was dropped from our group like a hot potato.

This event was what set off Cee and I becoming even closer. It got to the point where we hung out all the time with Abby and the rest of our group. By now, Justin's best friend, Vale, was also in the mix a lot. For some reason, I got the feeling she never liked me, even though I don't know why. It's been months since I've spoken with her, yet I still don't get why she dislikes me, to this day. I was always fine with her, though, which is why this situation started to piss me off with Justin and how he was reacting. I could tolerate Vale's awful behavior toward me (ignoring me whenever I said hello, trying to bond with her with just the two of us, including her in activities with Cee and Abby, etc) and shrugged it off. I mean, you don't have to *love* your boyfriend's friends, right? I understood maybe that's just the way she was.

Another thing to note is that our group also has mixed orientations. To put it all easily, I'm bisexual, which Justin knows. Abby is bisexual as well, while Cee has no clue what she's doing concerning liking people; she's more into ""eh. I like you if I like you."" Justin has always known this about all of us, and he himself is not even heterosexual, because he's asexual, which was never a problem, either.

  ---   
**MOST RECENT ISSUE:**

Now, I said everything above for a reason. It has come to light recently that Justin is extremely jealous of Cee. After the blow-up with Sally, Cee and I were closer than ever. I would speak to her about girly things, things that Justin had never expressed interest in before and brushed off if I chatted with him about it. The moment he seemed to notice Cee was just as excited about those sort of things as I was, he would comment on it, such as saying, ""Wow, you two are really into that, huh?""

One example is horses. Justin hates horses and basically all animals. I, however, *love* them. He tolerates them for my sake, and we've already agreed to get one dog when we move in together. Cee also loves animals, so we would make plans to horseback ride. At the moment, I'm also studying to become a zookeeper, which is something that has never interested Justin. When Cee found out, however, she told me she was also in animal study (she had been even before we met)

With that example, conversations with Justin would follow as...

**Justin:** Why are you guys going to the zoo again?

**Me:** (patiently, since sometimes I tell him things and he forgets) My internship requires so many hours, remember? Cee's just making it more fun.

**Justin:** Yeah, I know, Cammie, but why are you chilling with just her? Can't Vale go?

**Me:** Vale doesn't like me, remember?

**Justin:** That's not true. She likes you just fine

**Me:** (texting Vale if she'd like to go and getting rejected) See?

**Justin:** What about Abby?

**Me:** She's got work. What's wrong with Cee going with me?

**Justin:** Nothing. I was just wondering.

This would repeat. Whenever I'd press about why he had a problem with Cee, it was always, ""Nothing. Just wondering,"" after he got done questioning me. Keep in mind that Abby and I going to the zoo and hanging out or horseback riding together was fine by Justin, as well as me geeking out with Abby about animals and talking about my classes. Only when I mentioned Cee and I were hanging out would he get upset -- even if it was me, Abby, *and* Cee hanging out, he would remark, ""What's Cee even going to contribute to that? What's wrong with just you and Abby?""

Studying to become a zookeeper is extremely important to me, and during some of these instances, I'd ask him if he want to go instead (with or without Cee) and each time, he'd just wrinkle his nose and say something along the lines of, ""With your internship, don't they kinda use you as an assistant or whatever? So you have to help muck out the cages and everything? Nah, I'm good.""

(And to be fair, that does happen sometimes. I just don't mind spraying down the habitats, etc. It balances out with being able to help bottle feed the baby big cats/being set to babysit them while the big cat parents got their shots from the vet or helping set up mental stimulation for the gorillas, etc.)

We've had many conversations about Cee before, too, where I reassured him (even though he never mentioned being jealous at the time) that she and I were just best friends, that I don't see her that way, and all that. Cee is literally on the same scale to me as Abby: a sister. Cee has said the same thing about me, and due to past bad relationships (which Justin doesn't know about; Cee has only told me and Abby), she has a literal fear of getting with someone. I've given Justin the hedged version of it, because I'd never break Cee's trust in what she's told me and Abby. To try to reassure Justin, I would just say saying Cee has commitment issues and if nothing else, he should trust me when I say that she and I will *never* be like that. Every time I said it, he looked extremely doubtful, but he'd let the issue drop for the moment.

  ---   
**THE PROBLEM:**

Well, things finally came to a head after a few times of the above example happening in various degrees, whether it was Cee and I hanging out at the movies (with or without Abby; if Abby was there or not with us didn't seem to matter to Justin) or just having fun. Justin and I got into a *huge* argument about some really stupid shit. It was about me forgetting to text him back at lunch because I was interning and my break was cut short due to an issue at work. I forgot to tell him my hours had been extended that day...he didn't seem to care at the time, because he was hanging out with Vale, which I was fine with?? So I don't get why he was upset? He and I didn't have plans or anything! He was only mad because he thought Cee was there, but she wasn't.

Regardless, I told him that we needed a break, because he had been getting angrier and angrier with me lately, and he would never tell me why he was upset. I mean, I *know* it had something to do with Cee, but he wouldn't tell me *why* exactly he had a problem with her. So we were on a ""break"" basically, and after that fight, I went to my mother, sobbing. I hung around the house alone for a a few days, trying to pull myself together, and during that time, Justin mailed me stuff like chocolates and flowers from Edible Arrangements as apologies, I suppose. I would text him thank you, but conversation was always very tense.

This relationship break happened around the time that Justin and I were coming up on our two year anniversary. The break began a week or two before the anniversary, which really upset me, because I had planned some great things for us, including anniversary sex, cooked dinner, etc. Instead of doing all that, we were essentially on our way to breaking up. I was hoping we would just take this time for a breather. We would meet up to try to talk occasionally, but it only ever ended with us storming off furiously, and me going to Cee and Abby in tears. Both of them were extremely helpful, and Abby even started spending less time with her own boyfriend of 2 years to try to cheer me up with old movies while we were all on the couch.

Fast forward a little to actual day of what would have been our 2 year anniversary and shit hit the fan. Justin, for some reason that I have no clue (especially since our last quarrel was 2 or so days before our anniversary) went on Facebook and on my wall, for everyone to see, he sort of wrote a...passive aggressive love letter? I've got no clue. It was sweet, I guess, but Abby says it stank of insecurities.

To shorten it, let's just say it was summed up with: ""Even with all these challenges and certain people trying to get between us, all arguments we've had these past few weeks, I still love you, baby.""

Actually, that's not even summing it up. That was a literal line in the love letter, and it was the concluding sentence to it. It was a *whole message,* guys. I'm talking an essay. Any other time, I would have basically swooned, but this time, I was furious. Not only was he dirtying our laundry out in public, on Facebook (I've got younger cousins and family members there, hello!), but he kept insinuating shit about Cee in the letter, too, and that was genuinely pissing me off more and more.

Needless to say, I called him, and in the fight that ensued (""I put a lot of heart into that!"" from him when I deleted it from my wall, and me saying, ""WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?""), he finally said that he was, like, 484829% that Cee was in love with me. He said he knew I was going to her during this break. I interjected, ""Abby is there every time, too!"" And he said, and I quote, ""This isn't about Abby,"" and I said, ""But apparently it's about Cee?!"" but he just said he was certain that Cee was trying to ""white knight"" me. He said that she was making it to where she was always the shoulder I cried on because she was in love with me, and trying to ""usurp"" him or something. I have no clue, honestly. All I heard was a roaring in my ears. I told him that he had better fuck off, and I reminded him that I *never* had any problem with Vale and him being so close, so why was it so different for me and Cee? Because I was bisexual, she was undecided, and he suddenly came to the conclusion out of nowhere that she wanted to get with me? He had no response for that, I guess, because he didn't answer. After about a minute or two of silence, I hung up.

I wish I could say that was the end of it. I think my problem is that I really love this guy, and I've always been stupid with love. My last relationship wasn't the best, either, and she really fucked me over. She was the reason I got into therapy, actually, and waited so long to get into another relationship. It's been nearly 3 years with Justin, though, which...I mean, I guess I feel is a lot of time invested? Either way, I calmed down, then spoke rationally with Cee and Abby. Cee was actually the one encouraging me to talk to Justin, while Abby was against it, saying he was too controlling. She said she had never seen Justin act like such a shithead and that if he wanted to be a big baby, then so be it.

Well, I heard from Justin a few days after that. This time, he texted me in private, and sent me a very long message. Justin has always been really good with his written words; the guy is basically a poet, which I've always loved. He expressed how sorry he was, how he didn't mean to let his jealousy get in our way, and that he wanted to fix this. He mentioned couples therapy, which I'm dubious of, because he's never been in proper therapy before. I'm in therapy myself, like I said, and have been for two years due to the anxiety I mentioned before as well as my depression. Justin attended a few sessions with a separate therapist, but he always said the woman never knew what she was talking about, and that she was talking out of her ass. At the time, I reminded him that it takes time to find a good therapist, but he claimed they were full of shit. Regardless, he never talked shit about me still going to therapy. Because of my own therapist, I'd like to think I have become more confident in myself.

But I feel so torn. Abby says Justin can fuck off, while Cee says to give him another chance. Abby has also admitted to me privately that she thinks Cee is doing that out of guilt, feeling that she's breaking up an almost 3yr relationship and that she should break off our friendship since I've not known her as long as Justin.

Any advice?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I've become best friends with a girl called Cee, and my boyfriend of 3 years is extremely jealous of her, believing she is trying to get between us and break up our relationship, even though that's the furthest thing from the truth. He has now contacted me after a huge quarrel, and wants us to work on our relationship with therapy (something he's always claimed was hogwash and said is full of shit, 'cause ""the therapist doesn't know me!"") but I'm scared of being burned twice and going through this all over again. What would you do?"
5560ec,10,2016-09-29,The NSBE/SHEP Career Fair: Some questions and... why don't we have more career fairs?,ijustwantjobs,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/5560ec/the_nsbeshep_career_fair_some_questions_and_why/,"Perhaps I've missed a resource, but there's some information and questions I have about the career fair that I haven't been able to find answers to.

What happens to all the money collected by companies? I'm guessing the organizations collect and keep it, but does it go back to the school? Scholarships? What is it helping?

Why is it hosted by NSBE/SHEP? The [CCPD Career Fairs](http://rpicareerfair.org/) page makes it seem as if its entirely separate from the CCPD despite being pushed from Freshman year on as 'the career fair'. If isn't truly connected, why is it so much bigger than than the one in the Spring that supposedly is supported by our institution? Both of these things feel weird. If it is just NSBE/SHEP, why hasn't it ever expanded to other organizations?

Why do we always have huge events like this in the armory. It's always incredibly hot and gross. The dress standards (which weren't enforced 3 years ago at least, as I know someone who got in wearing far less than a suit) feel almost cruel, at least for males, and there was reddit post earlier about someone getting shoved away for the wrong shoes... why would they ever do that? Wouldn't it be a smart thing to use some of thousands of dollars collected to help enable those who may come to the door unprepared to enter by having a few pairs of dress shoes in common sizes (and doesn't the CCPD have something like this already?)?

**Is there anything stopping us from having another career fair?** I feel like Honor Societies could do a huge thing here in taking this over or starting a separate career fair. Imagine if The CSE, CS, and IT honor societies banded together with RPISEC and the like to have more focuses fairs for those that need it. I know plenty of EMACS/ARTS/GSAS majors that have a terrible time finding internships as is because this fair doesn't help and the companies that visits classes are slim pickings compared to the Engineering focused offers.

I've been to a few hackathons in my time here and I've seen the number of CS focuses companies that show up there compared to things like this-- it'd be great if Hack RPI had a career fair leading up to the hackathon, or more organizations on campus got involved in doing things like this.

Right now I'm more than anything freaking about landing a job, which is making wonder why we don't have more  and better opportunities?

5563ky,5,2016-09-29,20 F4M- Capital Hill Intern,Cosplay_Slut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5563ky/20_f4m_capital_hill_intern/,"I couldn't believe it, I was so excited. My first day as an assistant to a prestigious senator. This was a dream come true. Walking into capital hill I couldn't help but remember all the hard work it took to get this position. The essays, the presentations, the interviews. I must have beat out at least a hundred other applicants but here I was. I beamed with pride as I knocked on your door. I could feel my heart thumping in my chest as you called me in. I opened the door and saw you hard at work at your desk. 

""Hello Alexis, nice to finally meet you."" you said gesturing for me to sit. ""You're are here for the intern position correct?"" I nod my head. ""Yes I'm here to be your personal assistant. I think what you're doing is great and I can't wait to be a part of it. If you need anything just let me know. Also you can call me Lexi."" You nod your head not listening. I keep going. ""Also if you don't mind I'd like to suggest some things like.... and....""

My voice droned on as you pretended to care. You occasionally ""mhm'd"" at the right times but mostly you looked at your computer. Your eyes were glued to the monitor as you flipped through all the pictures on my instagram. A tightness in your pants formed as you saw a picture of me in my bikini. I had a fit petite body, with a nice tight ass and slender legs. Huge breasts were slung in a revealing bikini top and my crimson hair fell like a silken curtain around my shoulders. You looked back at me and stared at my thick, luscious lips. They looked so full and with the red lipstick on they really popped. You started undressing me with your eyes; picturing me in my bikini or some sexy lingerie. To see my tight little body in person. Those great big tits of mine. 

Cutting me off mid-sentence you said, ""Alright, well here is what you'll be doing here."" I shut my mouth and listened, leaning in a bit closer. ""You're going to be my personal assistant which means if I need you to do anything you're going to do it."" I nodded and said, ""Yes of course! I'll do anything! If you need something, anything, don't hesitate to tell me!."" You smiled and said, ""Alright then, first things first. I'm going to need those lips of yours to suck my cock."" You can see an inquisitive look on my face. ""I'm sorry...what?"" I must have heard wrong. What did he say? You leaned in closer and said, ""I need you to suck my cock."" 

You saw the look on my face turn from joy to disgust. ""What?! No!?"" I said. ""Do I look like a whore to you? You're ridiculous, thinking I'd suck your cock."" I said as I started to collect my things. I stood up and almost stepped out the door when you said, ""Being an assistant to a senator can go a long way in your career. A lot of doors can open in the blink of an eye, endless opportunities await. But only if you stay here with me."" I stopped walking and paused. It was true. It was the reason I tried so hard to get this position. 10 years of my career could be bypassed in an instant. But at what cost?

I turned around and saw your sleazy look. You were an appalling asshole, but maybe this would be worth it. Later on I could enact real change, real reform. I could clean all the people like you out of DC and make way for others that actually want to help the nation. People that will use their power for good, not coerce girls to be their personal prostitute. At this rate the sooner the better.
I waited a little before I walked back and sat down in the chair. It took every once of effort I had to completely let go of my self respect. ""Alright... you have a deal."" I said."
556a2e,4,2016-09-30,Molested by Older Half-Sibling and Stepfather. Family doesn't want to deal with the situation.,KLloyd14,abuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/556a2e/molested_by_older_halfsibling_and_stepfather/,"Before I get into discussing my story, I just wanna say that my family is really dysfunctional on both sides of the aisle. My mother's relatives have been at each other's throats for years and my father's side just uses money to cover up how they really feel. Back in 2011, I told my dad that my stepfather molested me several years prior. The last incident with him happened around early '04 and that's only because we moved out of his house. 
However, my darkest secret was about my older half-sister molesting me first. The earliest memory of this was sometime between 1997-98 and lasted until mid-2004.We had another incident together around late '05. After the brunt of the abuse ended, I remember acting sexual or inappropriately. My mother's boyfriend noticed this and once witnessed me masturbating in her car (shortly before we went to the mall of all places). When I think back to these times, I think about how many f***ked up people I was around. Although my mom started talking to me and my sister about sex as we started to physically mature, when the abuse first started I had no idea what it was. 

Furthermore, I don't know whether or not my sister was molested by someone else beforehand, but it's definitely possible. 
If it wasn't our late-uncle who did this (he was suspected of doing so back when she was an infant/toddler), then it had to be someone else perhaps even a teenager.
 We went to quite a few babysitters between 1990 and 2000 (I was born in '92 though). We also went over our grandmother's a lot when she still lived here in Baltimore. 
Since coming out to my dad about what both of these monsters did, I feel liberated in a way even though what I did may have made everything worse. 
But, at least I know where everyone stands on this matter. My mother's side of the family doesn't want to deal with this and my aunt in particular is suggesting I forgive and forget.
 Yet, if someone were to touch her grandchildren, she'd kick their ass and then some. 
My father's side of the family is leaving me to deal with this on my own because I lashed out at my paternal grandmother a couple years ago on my old blog.
 But, I apologized and it's still not enough. To make matters worse, my grandmother doesn't believe me and is siding with my half-sister on this. 
She's basically comforting the abuser!! It's awful and one of the lowest things she could do. My half-sister is not even related to her! As of this summer, she and my aunt (dad's sister) aren't speaking and we (my dad and I) are wondering if she (paternal aunt) is using prescription drugs. Dad said she took my grandmother's codeine because she thought she was allergic to it, which isn't true. My grandmother's had a tooth infection from a dental implant she got years ago. But, she's getting it taken care of. In a whole other situation, my aunt's marriage of over 20 years is ending (they're heading for divorce any day now). However, I wonder if she realizes something is wrong in regards to me, but isn't saying anything because my grandmother's influence. On dad's side, even if a relative isn't speaking to her, she still has influence on what goes on in the family. It's really sad. I'm starting to think that the only way I'll be able to speak to my paternal relatives (besides my father) about my situation is when my grandmother passes away. She doesn't want to hear what I have to say and it's pretty obvious she doesn't like me anymore. Even when I asked my dad if I could speak to her on the phone someday, he was hesitant about it. So, that speak volumes right there. 

I just wanna leave this place. I hate Baltimore with every fiber of my being. There are too many bad things that happened to me here. I have been seeing a therapist though for the past six months. While she has helped me realized that the abuse wasn't my fault and even explained the concept about how a 5 year old isn't expected to make an adult decision, I still feel dirty and disgusted by what happened. It makes me feel slimy. Despite what ""good"" my sister has done for me, I realized that overall our relationship was toxic even before I entered therapy. I don't ever want to see her again and if I do, I'll be two seconds away from kicking her ass. When she decided to stop being my friend on Facebook, I wished I could say more to her, but only said very little even then. I wished I warned her that I was gonna tell everyone who she really is. I also feel like since moving in with my dad others have tried to control my life. I feel limited. There are days when I don't know how long I can take it in this house. I keep asking dad if we can move away, but he just wants to move nearby to some apartments by the neighborhood elementary school. I also hate that I'm near where the abuse first happened. Sometimes when I try to talk to my dad about the subject, he'll try to turn me away and other times he says he's sorry. I'm not sure he even knows how to respond. He also didn't realize how bad my situation with my half-sibling was. He himself considered her as another daughter and once suggested we reconciled shortly after I told him. Then, my grandmother keeps saying I'm making this up and shortly after she found out suggested I say stuff like this when people make me mad. It couldn't be further from the truth. However, I'll also say that most of the time the abuse that happened was consensual. And when I do want to talk to my father about this whole situation, it's never a good time to discuss it because he's busy with work or whatever. I just feel like I'm at a crossroads. My mom's side of the family has been in chaos for years. It's not the first time an issue of incest has come up (don't know if there was any inbreeding several generations back). There are also other skeletons in their closet which included one of my mother's cousins with diabetes being refused his medicine so his family could collect on his life insurance (he eventually died in '83 from diabetic complications at age 28). That's a whole other story for another time. I don't want to face either side of my family on these issues. It's pretty obvious they can't help me. Dad can only do so much. I already told myself that once I leave his house, I am not coming back not even to visit. I just wanna leave this place and never return. Dad's pretty much complacent here and doesn't understand my situation to the fullest. 


I want to go into a transitional housing program. I thought about a homeless shelter, but realized it's not such a good idea after reading all the bad reviews online. I'm 24 now and have HFA (high functioning Autism). I don't belong in a group home nor do I wish to go to one. I really need to leave ASAP. I even asked a local state agency I was with for seven years to stop supporting me because it'll just take me in the direction I don't want to go in. I already tried going to school for something I don't want to do. And I did a brief internship at a hospital. Meanwhile, I'm also trying to start my own website and publish books on kindle. What else should I do? Any ideas? 


*By the way, what I wrote is just the half of it!

556iyp,0,2016-09-30,"Mods This subreddit is filled with lits of repeat posts with well not for profit self promoting it is still self promoting and the fact there are mods directly involved with the site, you might be turning a blind eye to it.",Spartanonymous,detroitlions,https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/556iyp/mods_this_subreddit_is_filled_with_lits_of_repeat/,"Here is what I said about one of the posts, and a [link to the post.](http://reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/551zrd/3_draft_prospects_for_2017_to_watch_outside/). If you want me to point each specific repost I will but you can see this being repeated over and over again.  It directly breaks one of the rules here, and I am no mod, but if I was, I would at the very least make a change to the rule about self promotion, while not one single user us self promoting site, but a collective of many users are doing so, it sort if avoids the rule, but still breaks it or otherwise do something about the reposts of the same stuff someone else reported on then another shared here first.  No big deal if they are the first to share the story here, but there us no need to clutter this up.  I enjoy spending time in this sub, and I only have limited amount of time to spend here, I don't like reading the same thing twice. 

&gt;Save this stuff for the off season.  There is enough to talk about during the season that this just looks like clutter in the sub and degrading to your sites reputation.

&gt;I don't mean to be a dick, because a majority of your posts are good posts, but you have some that are questionably click bait, and if it weren't for the good stuff you post, and I did not frequent the Lions sub, I would believe this was click bait if I was say a fan from another country or just a football fan who wants to know what is going on with the Lions, I would see all the posts made by Detroit podcast and would think this sub is run for profitability as there is no other site that self promotes as much as this site does.  I think there might be lines being crossed with writers of the site/podcast voices being part of the mod team of the sub that causes the mods to turn a blind eye to the fact that there is obvious self pronotion even if it isn't for profit, it's the kind that can lead to profit when so done else offers you a job because they like your work.  

&gt;I don't disapprove of the sites post 6/10 times, but when the posts are just replicating what someone else has already said and likely been posted here, or just something like this that doesn't have much to do with the ongoing part of the season.  Don't you think post should be posted in the r/nfl_draft sub unless it is off season, as it will get more views and comments there at this time of year than it will here.

&gt;Just skimming the top 30 ""new"" posts, this site is linked to six of them not including the actual podcast post which would be seven.  4/6 of them are just repeating a post that was made a couple posts before the one linked to this site, and one is this that doesn't really belong here until off season.  The only post that I feel was worth taking up space in this sub is the ask the intern post, ad that is original content in which you are answering questions but why even that us somewhat crossing the birder because you could just make a direct post on reddit that answers the questions tour Facebook fans have or just answer them on Facebook.

I may have been being generous saying 6/10 of the posts from this site shared here were good posts.  I never actually counted until I just did the top 30, I seen enough to not go any further with it with only 2 out 7 posts with original quality stuff, and 5 of what I would call click bait.  


Edit: I would not have made this post if there wasn't rules posted on the sidebar about what isn't allowed to be posted.  The rules were being broken, and more than just one in my opinion....   In case you do not know about the rules I will post them here.

&gt;1. Follow Reddiquette - The basic rules of Reddit will be enforced.
2. Do not make personal attacks - This includes attacking people based on their flair or fandom.
3. Do not post a duplicate topic - Please check to see if the topic has been posted already, before posting.
4. Do not follow and harass users with and between the sub, including PMs - Doing so is against reddit's TOS, and doing so can result in reddit-wide consequences. If any user is following you and harassing you, message the administrators. If you are unsure, and need an opinion, message the sub moderators to discuss the issue.
5. Do not downvote opinions out of disagreement, and do not upvote opinions out of agreement - Upvote any post or thread that you feel adds to or promotes discussion. Downvote posts or threads that you feel do not add to or promote discussion.
6. Please stay on the topic of the Detroit Lions - This will be enforced loosely at times, but keep in mind that this sub exists to discuss the Lions. Anything else may be subject to deletion.
7. Do not create ""Upvote"" threads - In addition to being in violation of Reddit's TOS, there are a lot of threads and posts to upvote. Be a little more free with your upvotes if you're happy.
8. Do not use Reddit solely to advertise your own content - If you're a poster here, feel free to link to your own content. If all you're posting is links to your website, then you will probably be shadowbanned. If you're unsure if what/how you're posting is acceptable, message the moderators to check.
9. Please use descriptive titles - Something like, ""I saw this today"" doesn't describe the content. Feel free to use the title to highlight an important part of the posted content, though.
10. Do not post porn"

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross
* 22 -- Christina Hendricks
* 23 -- Angela Bassett
* 24 -- Elizabeth Banks
* 25 -- Isla Fisher
* 26 -- Natalie Imbruglia
* 27 -- Mary-Louise Parker
* 28 -- Kate Beckinsale
* 29 -- Sofia Vergara
* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Player's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"
558blh,7,2016-09-30,[F4M] 18 Eagerly awaiting your talented fingers ;),ecoNOMNOMics,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/558blh/f4m_18_eagerly_awaiting_your_talented_fingers/,"Hey, first time posting here. Recently turned 18 and I've been recommended here after posting in the wrong subreddit. 

**What I look like**: Petite, slim, Asian 5'5, 110lbs, my ex could practically wrap around my waist with his hands, A cup (yay if that's your thing, if not, sorry)

**Kinks &amp; Fantasy Scenarios:** 

1. *Snugglefuck* 
I have a particular fantasy of having a taller and stronger partner/stranger protecting me. 
I would imagine us going to a bar/club/festival etc and someone would try to grope me or do something that makes me very uncomfortable. You would step in and tell them to back off and basically be alpha. I'd be extremely grateful and feel safe and protected. When we get home, I would thank you in many ways.... ;)
Then after we've finished I would tuck myself beside you and cuddle with you with my head on your chest and wait for round two. 

2. *Daddy* 
Basically you're a very successful, driven and ambitious man, I'm a new intern at your company who's a little clumsy but eager to learn. We run into each other one day and I fall for you (literally). I'm thinking this can either evolve into a sugar daddy scenario or just a daddy one where you're my mentor and we have fun in the office. One of the things I really want to do is blowing you under the desk while you're in a call with a client/doing work related tasks and you're trying to concentrate but I'm just too damn distracting and we can end up 69ing or whatever you want. 

3. Teacher/Student 
I've had a crush on you, my English teacher, for the past few weeks. I always sit in the front closest to your podium, first to arrive and last to leave because I'm a straight-A student and...well you're teaching it (Orwell's 1984 if that's your thing). At first I think I'm just one of the many girls sighing over your good looks and charisma but then I start noticing whenever you start teaching sexual content, you make eye contact with me just long enough to catch my attention but not to get caught by the others.
""Class dismissed, don't forget your chapter readings, have a lovely weekend everyone!""
""You too, Mr ______ !"", I answer back cheerfully. 
As I strolled out from the building, I was greeted with pouring rain and howling winds. Shit. I checked my phone and saw a message from mum that saying she has a work emergency and that I'll have to catch the bus home. I rubbed the goosebumps on my arms and trudged along in the rain, instantly soaking my white blouse and pleat skirt. Suddenly I hear a voice....

4. Brazilian Jiujitsu/Judo Class
This is my first time going to a self defence class and you're one of the black belts there, tall, built and confident. 
The instructor walks in and announces 'hey everyone listen up, new student today NomNom.' I feel the weight of the stares of everyone watching as I set down my gym gear and stripped down sweats and shirt to reveal my sports bra and running shorts. 
'Today we're going to practice some submission holds, partner up!' 
I look around as people paired up and just as I was about to see if the instructor was free I felt a tap on my shoulder. 
'Looks like you're stuck with me', you smirked mischievously. 
It would be awesome if you have knowledge of BJJ classes, basically I have the idea of building up sexual tension as I get put into uncomfortable positions by you, then after class you can maybe offer to teach me 1 on 1?

So these are the scenarios I've thought of so far, I'm very new so I'm open to any spins you may have or completely new scenarios :) 

I'm especially turned on by being eaten out, light bondage, and height difference (taller haha). 
I'm also up for just chatting especially if you genuinely fit into the scenarios above.

Look forward to reading your messages when I wake up!

558fp6,2,2016-09-30,Question regarding when best to apply for my certificate of eligibility.,MythzFreeze,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/558fp6/question_regarding_when_best_to_apply_for_my/,"Hey,
I will try to keep this as short as possible.

First off, i already called the japanese embassy in belgium but the lady didn't seem to quite understand what i was asking so im turning to you guys.

1. I found a 3 month programming internship in Japan.

2. I called the embassy in belgium and they said my company needed to apply for a certificate of eligibility 3 months before i planned on working (interning) in japan (2weeks - 2 months). Then i would have to get someone to send me the original certifcate (1 week) and finally apply for a visa in belgium (1 week).

3. If i look at it from a worst case scenario pount of view this would take 2 months + 1 week + 1 week. Meaning i would only have 2 weeks left over to buy plane tickets and rent an appartment (although a local said she would take care of that for me). This 2 week window worries me.

Now for the question. If i did my research right i believe i will have to apply for a 6 month training or student visa. (i believe you need to have a buffer before strarting the internship and leaving japan).Since i will have a 6 month visa can i apply for the CoE 1 or 2 months earlier? Or is it seriously normal for people to only have 2 weeks to plan these things.

Now, I work in a field that's overwhelmingly male. The company has been trying hard to become more diverse, and so part of that has shown in our hiring now.

Ok, long story short... the new intern on my project is smoking hot. She's an 11 probably. She's also engaged, as am I. I'm also more than 10 years older than her.

But that doesn't change the fact that she is *very* attractive. She nails all the little things that I love. She's in good shape. She lifts weights actually, and it shows. She's got a perfect hourglass.

I'm often very distracted by her legs - those smoothly shaved white legs with good muscle definition... she could probably kick my ass, and I'd love it. I have to really work hard to not try to peek up her skirts. She sometimes wears this one that's just above the knee. There's a perfect amount of teasing thigh visible when she's sitting.

I can't tell if she knows how attracted I am or not. The best part of videoconference calls is that when I stare at her image on the screen it's not obvious that I'm admiring her breasts.

Does anyone want to chat? I'd love to hear about any of you that are attracted to a coworker or colleague you shouldn't be, when you first noticed them, and what's happened after. And I'll tell you about what today looks like, what she wore, and how it made me feel."

The first day of worlds was full of incredible plays, huge disappointments, and shocking upsets.

It was punctuated, though, by a shocking event: In the TSM vs. RNG game, Aurelion Sol's stars became invisible, causing a remake. 

Because Mata gets Alistar, Svenskeren knows he will need to carry the game. In an ironic twist of fate, he finds that he is a descendant of Bruce Lee, and is able to channel Bruce's spirit during the game to perfect his Lee Sin mechanics. But it's not enough to stop the rampage of Mata, who decimates TSM, shouting ""You can't milk those,"" and ""You mess with the bull, you get the horns"" out loud the entire game. 

But Mata was playing Alistar *too* well. After the game he isn't able to break out of character, and starts smashing his head on the ground to stun random passerby. 

""He was a free kill! Where was my follow-up?"" Mata said angrily when questioned. He was later sent to a mental institution to be cared for, and therefore was not able to carry RNG in any further games. 

Fast Forward to day 2.

Riot has promised an answer by the end of the day, so they call in every intern and get them to work attempting to reproduce the bug. 

The day is drawing to a close, and Riot Magus cracks his whip angrily at the interns, ""How hard can it be to find one bug! Get it done by the hour or I'll force you all into unpaid slave labor for eternity.""

""You can't do that! It's illegal!"" shouts one foolhardy intern, only to be silenced by Magus's whip. 

""Sure I can. It's in a clause on page 734 of the contract you signed."" Magus says calmly, and returns to his office to begin writing a statement about Aurelion being disabled for the rest of worlds.

However, Magus was never seen again. The last message from him was a simple ""The bug has been fixed. Enable Aurelion Sol for Worlds.""

Day 2 comes, and begins with a swift 3-0 for SKT against C9, despite heroic plays by Jensen on Syndra. FW similarly demolishes IMAY, but something peculiar happens in game 3 when TSM is up to play SSG. 

Before any bans are locked in, Aurelion Sol gets insta-locked in for Bjergsen. This happens again and again when Riot restarts the draft, so they shrug and decide to just leave it.

The game begins, and Bjergsen sees the spirit of another dragon, not Aurelion Sol, but similar, appear before him. ""You! . . . But you're dead!""

The ghost of Ao Shin says nothing, but slides into his body like CLG slid into Worlds, and takes control. Suddenly, each Aurelion Sol's 3 orbs transform into a relic of the distant past. 6-turrets Hiemerdinger, release Kassadin, and initial-juggernaut Mordekaiser appear, to the surprise of everyone. Everyone but Bjergsen, who crackles with blue energy as he controls them all with flawless micro skill and proceeds to stomp every lane and carry the game. Riot attempts to pause and remake the game, but find they are powerless. Bjergsen is in control.

He doesn't get involved with the jungle though. Instead, Svenskeren picks Lee Sin and solo kills Ambition's Rek'Sai 7 times, while stealing every buff. Because Doublelift, playing Jhin, never appears on screen, he is given MVP for his dedication to the 'hidden sniper' motif.

The rest of the day is fairly standard. Splyce do surprisingly well vs. RNG, but still lose. INTZ demolishes H2K off the back of Yang's Gnar, with a huge outplay in a Tockers vs. Ryu 1v1 near the end of the game. Ryu is asked for a comment after the game, but only replied with -________-. EDG vs. AHq is such an even game that at the 120 minute mark it is declared a tie.

Something is clearly amiss when Huhi takes the stage for the opening game of Day 3. He crackles with blue energy, and doesn't respond when his teammates talk to him. As the game begins, Aurelion Sol is insta-locked for CLG. The game begins similar to TSM's previous one, but this time Huhi's teammates argue with him and ask what's going on. Angry that he is being questioned, Huhi moves Darshan, Stixxay, and Aphromoo to ANX's side and locks xmithie in the jungle alone.

This time Aurelion Sol's orbs transform into release Xin Zhao, reworked GP, and dodge Udyr. Again, Ao Shin's ghost uses his chosen mid laner to stomp every lane, and single-handedly win the game, despite being 1v8. Xsmithie was the only one not upset about this in the post-game interview, stating ""I had fun just clearing all the jungle camps. It was very peaceful.""

Every time TSM or CLG play, this same phenomenon occurs. Aurelion Sol is insta-locked, and breaks through time and space to win the game, by the hands of a possessed mid laner. It takes its toll on the team after a few days. Doublelift throws a fit about not being able to carry, and threatens to quit, though Bjergsen spends some alone time with him and they sort it out. Xmithie announces that he plans to retire to live peacefully with nature in the amazon jungle.

""I've had a long career killing animals, and I've recently had a change of heart"" the NA pro responded when interviewed after his announcement. He started to say something about a gorilla, but was quickly cut off by surrounding Riot employees.

Unsurprisingly, TSM and CLG secure first place in their groups. C9 also manages to get out of groups with the #2 seed, making it a historic Worlds for the NA LCS. No EU teams come close to making it out. SKT and CLG meet in semifinals, and Faker puts up a surprisingly good fight with Riven mid vs. Aurelion Sol. Huhi seems to respect the 1v1, and uses pure mechanical skill to outplay Faker. He sends release LeBlanc top-lane, and AP Rengar bottom. Huhi activates URF mode for these two champions, making them strong enough to kill anyone who to enters the lane.

For their semifinals, TSM play the breakout 1st seed from group A, INTZ. The game ends in 7 minutes and 53 seconds, a quick execution by the dragon-possessed Bjergsen.

After all these years, the fated rivalry reaches its height. TSM vs. CLG Grand Finals. Each team turns to their midlaner, knowing that this battle is out of their hands. Huhi and Bjergsen are silent, staring at their monitors as CLG insta-locks Aurelion Sol. It's an easy 1-0 for CLG as Bjergsen controls 4 Tahm Kenches and prevents his allies from leaving the base. The next 3 games progress similarly, each team trading wins until the score reaches 2-2.

The circumstances are pretty weird, and through an odd loophole in the drafting rulebook under the ""WTF 2 SHENS?"" clause, the final game ends up being an all-for-one mirror match with Aurelion Sol on both sides. Huhi and Bjergsen invite their teammates to join them, as all 10 players unite under the control of Ao Shin.

Each team tries to Q+E combo towards the enemy base for an enormous stacking stun, and they meet all meet in mid lane and detonate. The black holes combine together and become real, exploding and destroying earth. 

~~-                                                                             -~~

One decade later, a lone figure looks down on the remnants of Earth from the secret spaceship he never released to the public. The SANDBOX. His name is Marc Merril, and he barely survived the explosion and escaped into space. Fortunately, Riot had enough spaghetti to last him centuries. He has spent years working to uncover the origin of the original bug. The one that awoke the ghost of Ao Shin and caused the downfall of humanity.

He punches a string of numbers into his supercomputer, and jumps with surprise when it shows him the answer he's been searching for all along.

Marc exclaims ""Doh! That was a really bad call by me. The stars were coded as minions the whole time!""

559p4o,1,2016-09-30,Day 14 - Disjointed Account - Ups and Downs - Multiple Addictions,SpiritofInvictus,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/559p4o/day_14_disjointed_account_ups_and_downs_multiple/,"Hey there. I apologize in advance if this is somewhat disjointed, I just wanted to write some of it down and get it off my chest. 

Since I started NoFap two weeks ago, completely abstaining from PMO since then, I’ve come to experience at least some of the alleged benefits. I definitely noticed an increase in confidence, in that I just went up to a fellow intern and started a conversation while concentrating on her face and not her tits, and had fun doing so. (Though admittedly I also admired her figure when she wasn’t looking, but nothing quite as extreme as I used to do.) I also caught her staring at me and after getting over the initial surprise I looked back, and we grinned at each other. She had amazing eyes. 

On the flipside, I’ve a lot of porn flashbacks and sometimes it’s not that easy to focus on something else. Not quite an urge yet, but it could quickly become one were I to indulge my thoughts further. It’s par for the course as far as I’ve read on this subreddit, so I guess there’s not much I can do but endure and show some fortitude. In regards to emotions, today was also a first for me. The last two weeks have been great and I was in a good mood, but today I noticed that I was really apathetic and annoyed by simple things like people talking in front of me. I’ve read the 101 so I wasn’t taken completely by surprise, but it was still a disheartening experience after the last few days. 

Once I’m back home I’ll have more opportunities to indulge in hobbies like writing and exercise (started cold shower and journaling already), and I’ve been doing meditation on and off for a while now. I hope that’ll help me move forward. The goal is a complete reboot. It’s my first time in NoFap; I’ve been an addict for most of my life. I started at age 11 or 12 and continued onwards up to age 25, steadily moving into stranger porn fetishes. 

Adding to that (and something that made me fap even more) is that I’m experiencing HPPD. It’s a byproduct of intensive and high dosage LSD (and other psychotropic drugs) use that made sure I have visual representation of my thoughts when I focus on it (which happens quite often). This can be bad (which it was for quite some time – think spiders) but it can also be incredibly “good,” which it became after I started healing from the trip that made me abstain completely. Once that happened it kinda flipped a switch in my mind and suddenly I had all the porn stars and pictures and movies at my command with a simple thought . . . ultimately leading me further into another addiction, one I couldn’t have foreseen even had I tried. So, that’s me. Free of drugs for ~9 months now (but with visuals) and NoFap initiate since two weeks ago. 

I actually found this subreddit after a vacation where I had no opportunity to spank it for five days. I felt good but once I came back I fell into old behavior. My aim back then was to do it once and then stop for another few days. I binged, of course. The Chaser effect as I now know is a bitch. But at least it made me aware of this place, so I guess it’s all good now. I don’t know if I’ll hold out for 90 days or even longer, right now I’m concentrating on just doing one day after another, hoping for the best.

So, fellow abstainers, a shout out to all of you: Keep holding out! And for further motivation, take a passage from Invictus:


*In the fell clutch of circumstance*

*I have not winced nor cried aloud.*

*Under the bludgeonings of chance*

*My head is bloody, but unbowed.*

55a1dr,71,2016-09-30,My Nmom and the Dog Tags,ChatShinyRock,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/55a1dr/my_nmom_and_the_dog_tags/,"This story is about my Nmom, DH's MIL, who is not a very nice person. My sister and I used to call her the Prophetess of Doom, because nothing good will ever happen, and she can turn anything positive into a negative. But I hesitate to use it here because it seems too light-hearted for her nastiness. 

I've been sharing these stories with DH lately so that he can develop a better understanding of my past, which unfortunately still rears its ugly head from time to time and affects me in the present. We also may be moving back to the home state and have to deal with Nmom more, so it's helpful preparation for both of us.

I'm not fond of kids. We don't and won't have any. A LOT of that has to do with my own abusive background and self-hate for the helpless child I was, jealousy of anyone who appeared to have a ""normal"" childhood, etc. But I don't hate kids, and I feel like I've made a lot of progress with my knee-jerk hostility towards them.

My Nmom, however, hates a lot of people/things. She derives a scary amount of enjoyment from her hate.

This conversation with her took place a little over a year ago. I was on the phone with her and told her about my luck in securing a six month internship at an extremely prestigious national museum--one of several within a specific institution. She says she's happy for me, which is all well and good. But she can't stay on a positive note. Nope, not my Nmom! 

She then proceeds to tell me a story about an encounter she had at one of the partnering museums a few years ago. She and my dad were on a big trip and one of the options was to visit this museum, which they jumped at. This was a bucket-list museum for my parents, especially my dad. Now, this museum is located in DC, so ALL the museums there are crowded MOST of the time. TONS of school field trips. It's just the way it is, and everyone knows this.

Nmom told me that she had never, EVER seen so many terribly-behaved children in her life! (Sure, Nmom. Sure.) I'm mostly tuning out her bitch session, until she shares this gem: Apparently she and my dad were stuck in line behind some of these horrible young children, who noticed a dog tag display and booth where you could have your own made. The kids were pointing them out to each other, thinking they were cool but not really understanding what they were. Nmom loudly interrupts the kids and says to them: ""*I* know what they are and I wish you had some in your mouth RIGHT NOW!""

Holy fucking SHIT I wish I had called her on it! Instead, I just got off the phone ASAP. What a horrible fucking thing to say to ANYONE, let alone little kids! And she has this nasty, nasty tone of voice. I'm certain that her tone has killed happy, innocent beings. Add that to her obvious glee in relating/reliving the encounter. She didn't say a single thing about the awesomeness of the museum, what they saw, how my dad enjoyed it, etc. Just gloating about how awful she was to some elementary school kids.

And that is my lovely Nmom. Feel free to suggest a name!

Edited to add: If you think this is the place then I have more stories to share. Dammit.

I've had a couple of profs give me a thumbs up on my resume and some career fair tips, but it would be awesome to get more information about any of these places. Thanks!"
