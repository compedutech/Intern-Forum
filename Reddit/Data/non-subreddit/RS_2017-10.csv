73ikvg,29,2017-09-30,Let's Recalibrate our Bullshit Detectors,needs_more_sprinkles,starwarsspeculation,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/73ikvg/lets_recalibrate_our_bullshit_detectors/,"So, obviously this sub has been flooded with a bunch of leaks recently, and we've all understandably responded to them with a lot of enthusiasm (one way or another). But there are a couple of recurring themes I've been noticing in many of them that instantly set off my personal bullshit detector, and I thought I'd share them here. This obviously isn't a definitive guide--I don't claim to be an expert on this--but it's a good set of questions to ask about a leak before letting yourself get all giddy about it.

1. How much exposure would the leaker have to have to the material to be able to describe it in their level of detail? We've seen a couple of leaks so far where leakers who claim to have seen TLJ can describe it down to individual shots and facial expressions, in spite of the fact that the movie has only been completely finished for a week now. How many times do you think *you'd* have to see a movie in order to be able to summarize it to the level that the leaker is summarizing TLJ? This is, of course, assuming that people at Lucasfilm have not been given personal DVD copies of the movies or PDFs of the script to review over and over again (which they haven't--there's no earthly reason for LFL to take that risk).

2. How high up the food chain would the leaker have to be to be privy to the knowledge they have?  If they claim to have seen a screening of TLJ as part of a special event for the highest-ranking producers of the film, chances are they're full of shit. The people who will have the most knowledge about the film are the ones who have the most to lose by leaking it. I'd go so far as to say that the number of people on earth who know who, say, Rey's parents are is &lt;20 (edited bc I forgot how math symbols work) Remember that only 3 people knew Vader was Luke's father before ESB premiered. Your average camera guy, wardrobe assistant, or social media intern is not going to be able to describe the entire film to you in detail. If they claim otherwise, they're lying.

3. Does the leak seem to focus almost exclusively on a particularly controversial or sensationalized part of the plot? Is 40% of the story centered around describing Rey and Kylo falling in love? Does the leaker spend 2 paragraphs describing the elaborate backstory to Snoke and the First Order, but not summarize a single conversation between Finn and Rose? Does it skip almost completely over the relationship between Rey and Luke (the ""beating heart"" of the film) and spend most of its time describing in detail the scene where Luke throws a Star Destroyer at Kylo Ren and then explodes a planet with force lightning? If so, it's likely that the ""leaker"" has gotten particularly excited about this part of their story and haven't put equal thought into what makes up the bulk of the movie.

4. Does the leaker's tone seem more like they're telling a story than summarizing a film? If I were to describe from memory the scene in A New Hope where Luke finds the burnt homestead (a very emotional and epic scene, to be sure) it would go something like ""Luke and Obi Wan go back to the homestead and find it's been burned down and Luke's aunt and uncle have been killed. Luke decides to leave home and follow Obi Wan on his quest."" That's a detailed description, but it's brief and to the point. It doesn't include lines like ""Luke gazes upon the remains. He gives a look that tells us everything--he knows at last what he must do,"" or ""We know at this moment that Luke has gone from a boy to a man."" This, to me, is the biggest giveaway of most of these leaks--the writers try to seem like they're just divulging the information they can get away with (and usually say things like ""I can't tell you more than that""), but then they get caught up in their own stories and can't help but editorialize.

These are just a few questions I think it's important to ask about these leaks before taking them seriously. If anybody else can think of other good clues, feel free to contribute in the comments!"
73irp1,0,2017-09-30,I (28F) met a guy (31M) who is in an open relationship and now I am falling for him.,asana01,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/73irp1/i_28f_met_a_guy_31m_who_is_in_an_open/,"I met this guy once through friends while he was dating someone. A year later, we met again at a conference where a bunch of us medical students rented an air bnb place. Since the first day, he was very touchy feely so I asked our mutual friend if he was still in a relationship. My friend had no idea or assumed but said last time I heard they were having issues (This mutual friend is a very close friend of mine and was also a good friend of his). There were 3 beds between 5 people (1 couple, 2 guys including him, and me). The couple took one of the beds but the guys offered to give me a room to myself while one of them slept on the living room couch. In the middle of the night, I woke up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and I bump into him (Nathan) who is dying on the couch bc there was no a/c in the living room/super uncomfortable couch. So I offer to let him sleep next to me for the night. It was awkward but fine for that night. All day next day he was flirting with me and it seemed like he was interested. So I asked him if he was still in a relationship. He said yea but it's an open relationship. I pressed further for more information but didn't get much out of him except that he was on the brink of ending the relationship. My friend said him and gf were totally incompatible and wasn't surprised about them having an open relationship. Me, on the other hand, have always been a serial monogamous so this was something new to me.  

We all went out the last night and the entire time he was hanging around me. I found him charming and very attractive. It didn't take much for me to start being interested in him. It felt effortless to be around him. We talked about a lot of things (everything except his relationship). It was no surprise that we ended up having sex that night. The chemistry was intense and totally unexpected for me. I've always been in long-term relationships but never have I ever felt such a connection to a guy. I think it was the same for him too. His flight was in the morning and I think we both didn't know what to say to each other about what had happened. He's from the south and I'm from the north so we both knew how unrealistic any of this was. I had assumed after saying our goodbyes that this was probably the last time I would see him. I figured with long distance, both applying for residency (internship) this year and his uncertain status with his gf, that this was never gonna work. So I went home and never expected to ever see or talk to him again. 

He messaged me to follow up that night to see if I got home safe and we talked about random things for the next two days until l got a call from him. He told me he couldn’t stop thinking about me and that it was more than just sex for him. How he wanted to get to know me better. It was a long conversation with him mostly telling me how he feels and how he thinks we are so compatible and how I have everything he is looking for. I never expected him to say these things but it made me happy to hear that he felt that way. It almost felt surreal. I didn't let myself think these things because I thought we had no chance but hearing him say it instantly changed things for me.

He said he was taking his board exams (which require intense studying every day) and that as soon as he takes it he was gonna break it off with his gf.  This was in response to me saying I wasn’t okay with being in an open relationship and that if he’s interested in me he would have to be monogamous. We continue talking every night for hours, sending pictures etc. He then mentioned we should meet up and suggests to do so during another conference coming up.  I say no I don’t feel comfortable with that and he assures me that time he would end things with his gf. 

I understood his reasons for telling his gf after exams bc from what I know about his gf, she would create drama if he broke it off. You obviously don’t want that in the middle of studying for board exams. We continued talking every day, it was almost like we were in a long-distance relationship up until 2 weeks ago when hurricane Irma happened and he went radio silent. I tried calling him and no response. Then finally a week later, he messages me and he goes I’m sorry it’s been crazy. That’s it. Nothing else. Originally when things were going well we had planned on meeting up again for another conference in early October but bc I didn’t hear back from him I didn’t book my ticket. Different thoughts went through my head, maybe he still wants to be with gf, or he changed his mind, or the novelty of me wore off etc. I mean what did I expect for falling for someone who was in an open relationship or if that was even true in the first place. 

But then he messages me once asking me about the conference. I ignore it first time bc it’s like really you provide me with no explanation and now you want me to come see you when I have no idea if you’re with ur gf or not still. Then he asked me again this time I said I can’t bc you’re not single. His response, “that’s fair”. Couple days later, he asks me again (multiple times in one convo) if I’m coming, even offering to pay for my ticket, I say again no only if you’re single. So then I had enough, I asked him straight up if he sees a future relationship with me and if he ever plans on ending his relationship with his gf. I tell him I don’t wanna involve myself emotionally with you if all you’re looking for is someone to entertain you until you figure things out with your gf. Because I was under the impression by your conference time you would be single. He says I do like you and think there’s a potential for us but you’re right it’s not fair. “I need to sit and think about it.” I even asked what does ur gf think? Does she also talk like this with other men? He goes yes she also talks with other men but I don’t think she has slept with anyone. To me, I am thinking this is some screwed up stuff. I would never wanna be in this kind of relationship. 

I said okay fine because there’s really not much I can say. He has his exams and now I know even if he does break it off with his gf it won’t be for another 2 months (until he takes his exams). So this is obviously different than what he originally told me. This entire time I was under the impression that things with his gf weren’t going well but he just didn’t wanna end it because of exams. But now he has to think about it? Next thing you know he’s sending me a sexy gym picture. I mean WHAT THE HELL! 

I honestly don’t understand his thought process. How did this become a normal thing to do and how can someone think it's okay to play with emotions.  Why tell someone you see a future with them and then backtrack and say I still need to think about it. I don’t know what to feel anymore. I feel I can’t think straight because every time he sends me a message or sends me a picture, I literally just forget these things and fall for it. I am hoping I guess. I know this is some very shady ass shit he’s doing. Our mutual friend told me in the beginning how he’s a great guy and he doesn’t like to play around and I keep thinking maybe just maybe he is not. Why else would he talk to me overnight for hours, send me pictures, and basically act like he’s my boyfriend? 

The only solution I see once he tells me what he wants I can decide to either stop talking to him or talk to him about plans that there’s a future with us. I dunno, if I'm being impatient, paranoid or god knows what because my last relationship totally destroyed my self-worth. Now that I am finally back up on my feet, I feel I am probably heading in the same direction. Should I give him the benefit of the doubt until he finishes his exams or is it not worth it at all?

not sure if this is the right place to post, but I'm interested in a master of science in sustainable energy from SUNY ESF in nys.

I talked to a professor there and they said the program is really focused right now on life cycle assessments and incorparating GIS to evaluate the feasability of different renewable energy systems with a focus on bioenergy. The program is fairly new and they said they don't really have labs right now so it seems most if not all my work will be computer based. I have a good background with GIS, my major was environmental science and I worked as a GIS tech for my internship. Energy is something that has always interested me, especially the chemistry behind different sources of energy. I'm just not sure how well this program will prepare for work in the real world. Another worry is being stuck behind a computer all the time, I really like GIS and programming, but I also love being outside and traveling and would like that to be part of my working life if possible.

any thoughts? What do you think about a program like this? 

Thanks in advance!"

Strategies for fixing this perception?,snortney,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73jngk/i_25_f_come_off_as_a_timid_doormat_to_coworkers/,"Hi everybody. I'm a young professional, highly educated and with a pretty impressive resume and skills. But I've been having a problem with people walking all over me at work.

&amp;nbsp;

I think it's a problem I've brought on myself. I've always been a perfectionist and a serial people-pleaser, so I try very hard to be uber-respectful and polite. I also grew up book-smart and realized the hard way over time that no one likes an overachiever, so I try hard to be humble. I warm up to professional contacts over time, but I'm *extremely* reserved and deferential at first. 

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is that I think that comes across as mousey, unconfident, and spineless. And people have been treating me accordingly. The other day I had a 20-year-old student intern talk down to me over email when I tried to give some guidance. That was a serious low point for me.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd like some advice on how I can be more confident with professional contacts right off the bat so that I don't get walked all over later. But of course, I'd like not to come off as arrogant, either! I guess I'm having trouble finding the sweet spot between those extremes. Any advice? Thank you!

73k7re,1,2017-10-01,Am I actually depressed?,Lahgy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/73k7re/am_i_actually_depressed/,"To start at the beginning, I've always wondered what depression has felt like. In high school I felt extremely sad at some points, but I don't think I was ever depressed. 

I'm a second year engineering major at a fairly large University and with that comes a lot of stress. To start off I have had girl troubles for the first month of the semester. I really connected with a girl and hit it off but out of nowhere she ended things because she had anxiety and wasn't ready for a relationship. The thing about this is that I've never connected with a girl so well before and everything seemed fine on both sides and it was ended unexpectedly which crushed me to be honest. The next thing is that at my University I'm a engineering pre-major, meaning that I have to have a certain GPA by the end of the semester to get into my engineering field. And right now I don't have the necessary GPA to get into my engineering field which sucks because I have to work my ass off to raise my GPA this semester so I can get in. The next thing is that I have to apply to multiple different internships and hope to God that I get one over the summer or I'll end up working for 8 dollars an hour at some random place. On top of that I have my parents harping me constantly and I need to keep a social life with my friends and there are just about 1000 other things on my mind Overall I've never felt so much stress in my life. 

Now all of this stress is causing my mental health to decline rapidly. Lately I have felt different to what I normally feel. I have trouble concentrating on one thing at a time because my mind is in 1000 different places at once or it's the complete opposite where I zone off into nothingness and just sit in one place doing absolutely nothing. On top of this I have lost almost all my appetite to the point where I only eat when I'm starving and might not eat for a full 24 hours at a time. This has led me to lose 15 pounds in a month which I no is not healthy at all. Another thing is that the stuff I used to find fun such as play video games and go out on weekends just seem like a chore now and aren't fun anymore. And to make things worse I've had some thoughts of suicide lately. Don't get me wrong though I would never commit suicide because I've known many people who have killed themselves or tried to and I know the affects on those around them and I would never kill myself. I have just wondered what would happen if I actually did die or commit suicide. To be honest these thoughts have never came into my head until now and it just seems like these are major warning signs of depression. I know that many people have it tougher than me but I've never had to deal with so much in my life before and it has become too much. I just don't know how I deal with it and where do I go if I need help if I'm actually depressed. "

Dr. Acula’s white coat flapped menacingly behind him as he drifted toward the ER. His dark scowl sent the interns scurrying out of the way. He could feel the anger building, but his skin remained perfectly pale and unblemished by the stirring emotion. The nurses put their hands over their mouths; some even gasped as the tall man swept by. They had been here long enough to know that something was terribly wrong when his thin lips pressed together into that tight minus, and his long bony fingers curled into fists.

""Professor Van Helsing,"" the doctor said, bowing slightly. ""I thought we had an agreement.""

""It’s been a long time, Alucard,"" the aging man said. ""Yes, I know…""

""But you decided to show up here anyway… and unannounced!""

""I wouldn’t have unless I had no other choice."" 

The professor stood up, with his trench coat swirling around his legs. The doctor was tall, but Van Helsing matched him in height. The dull gray eyes of the professor engaged the almost coal black ones of the doctor in a dangerous duel. Few men dared to look Dr. Acula in the eye – fewer still had the bravery to lock his dark gaze with their own.

""Well, then,"" the doctor said, and a smirk replaced the glare. ""How may I be of… service? Is it the old back acting up again? Or perhaps hair loss? Those are very common symptoms of aging, I’m afraid.""

Van Helsing sat down in the chair again and crossed his legs. His unruffled countenance was only pierced by a slight twinkle of worry, which manifested itself as a twitch in the corner of his mouth.

""This has nothing to do with my own well-being,"" he said slowly.

""Then why did you come here?""  Alucard said, narrowing his eyes.

""You are a very hard man to get in touch with.""

Alucard remained silent. Apart from the smirk, his face was a perfect mask of blankness.

""This is about an incident… a few incidents, actually,"" the professor continued.

""You know I’ve put all of that behind me. If you’re suggesting that I had anything to do with–""

""That’s exactly what has me worried... your non-involvement.""

""You speak in riddles, old man. Out with it!""

""Do you… I mean, have you by any chance…"" Van Helsing clearly weighed his words carefully. ""Possibly neglected your territory as of recent?""

The smirk that had lingered on the doctor’s lips suddenly melted away. He touched his pale cheek, and the tip of his tongue swept over the white tips of his teeth.

""What do you mean?"" he said in a tone that chilled the very air in the room.

""There has been a couple of rather strange occurrences, right here in the city during the last few weeks. Could it be possible that another one of your kind is encroaching on your territory?""

The doctor snorted. ""Nobody has challenged me in eight hundred years… Nobody would be so foolish.""

""I thought you would say that,"" Van Helsing said and dug out a folder from his briefcase. ""Take a look at these.""

The photos in the folder showed a lady in a white dress with a stream of blood leaking out of two clear marks in her neck.

""That can’t be from around here.""

""Oh, I assure you it is. And it is only one out of four.""

""I haven’t felt anyone… I would know if someone *of my kind* entered my domain.""

""That is very strange,"" the professor said. 

""Very strange, indeed. And while I do appreciate you bringing this to my attention, I’m uncertain of your motives… we’ve never quite seen eye to eye.""

Van Helsing sighed. ""Yes, that brings me to the next part – the part that I think you’ll really dislike… I need your help.""

Alucard took a step back and eyed his old nemesis for signs of deceit. When he found none in the wrinkled face of the professor, he paced over to the medical refrigerator and opened it. The sight of the blood bags made his black eyes flare up red as if someone had fanned the smolder back in a fireplace. His hands ran over the plastic, feeling the squishy succulence under his fingertips.

""Why would I help you?"" he said after a while. ""I have everything I need right here.""

""Do you remember Lucy?""

""Don’t bring her up… not now,"" Alucard said. ""Not after all these years.""

""I’m sorry, but I fear that her granddaughter might be the next victim.""

""What makes you think that?""

""She’s been acting out of character lately, and a strange tiredness has come over her. Last night I found the mark on her neck. I’ve done everything I can, but it’s like my usual deterrents don’t work on this culprit. I’ve tried everything from garlic flowers to holy symbols…""

Alucard grumbled something unintelligible.

""So, will you help me?""

Alucard closed the refrigerator, his eyes red and his gums itching. He had vowed not to start again – he had retired. But the thought of Lucy’s blonde hair and that warm silky skin against his lips… he at least had to see the granddaughter before declining – she had to be in her twenties by now.

""You have me intrigued.""

Part 2

Alucard paced back and forth in his office. The discarded white coat lay in a heap on the floor. He buttoned the silver cuffs of his black tuxedo – was this, perhaps, too much for a home call? He did want to look good for the descendant of Lucy, and wouldn’t have given it a second thought a few centuries ago, but with each generation, the values and expectations seemed to change – humans were strange when it came to social norms and dress codes. 

He shook his head and stepped into the elevator outside. A short surgeon in bright green scrubs leaned into the corner, staring at her phone. As the doors slid shut and his shadow fell over her, he couldn’t help but think how easy it would be. People were so absorbed by their little gadgets these days that they even failed to realize that the deadliest predator on the planet was only an arm’s length away. 

A sharp smell of hand sanitizer filled the elevator, and Alucard crinkled his nose. The hospital was a great place to keep your urges in check, not only because of the blood bags. He would never even consider sinking his teeth into someone who smelled like this.

The elevator pinged and the doors slid open again.  

“Have a good night, Dr. Acula,” Nurse Beatrice called out as he swept by the reception desk on his way out.

“You too, my dear,” the doctor said in a soft tone that still somehow managed to pierce the noise of the hospital. “You too...”

The night was crisp and thin clouds framed the silvery moon above the naked treetops. A smell of fresh rain and soil hung in the air. 

Alucard’s polished dress shoes crunched against the gravel in the parking lot. He halted, and his dark eyes scanned the wet windows of the cars and the shady treeline of the nearby forest. His nostrils flared. Someone was watching him, he could feel it. Was there something out, hiding in the undergrowth?

Suddenly, he heard the thudding beat of a heart behind him, and the flow of blood through excited veins. Then the sound of rapid footfalls. The doctor turned around, and an intern with a flushed face ran up to him.

“You forgot your bag, Dr. Acula,” the boy said and offered him the case of medical supplies.

“My gratitude,” Alucard said slowly and eyed the intern.

He was thin and shied away from the doctor’s gaze. He seemed almost too young and was probably fresh out of med-school. Alucard hadn’t seen him around before.

“You’re welcome!” the boy said, a bit too enthusiastically.

“What’s your name?”

“I’m Jonathan.”

A shadow fell across the face of the old vampire. Naturally, a lot of people were called Jonathan, but the odds of Van Helsing showing up the same day he ran into someone with *that* name seemed unlikely.

“Well… I’ll just… I’ll be going then,” the boy continued when the doctor remained silent. 

The tiny hairs on the boy’s arms and neck stood up, and he slowly backed away before turning and running into the hospital. Alucard licked his lips and walked over to his car. He gave the dark trees of the forest a final glance before getting in.

The road took him to a mansion in the hills just outside the city. It was built in a Gothic design with tall spires and winding arches. Gargoyles with cruel and twisted faces kept close watch over the gate and the alley of naked poplars that led up to the property.

While the mansion was tiny compared to his castle back home, Alucard knew that the Westenra’s were well-off. Almost a century had passed since the family left England and moved overseas. He had decided to make their new home part of his territory for sentimental reasons. His deal with Van Helsing had been to take a break – and that he had. For over a hundred years he had abstained from drinking straight from of the vein. He had kept his word and, in return, the old professor had stayed out of his way.

The massive lion door knocker thundered against the darkened wood. When the echoes faded out, the silence of the countryside took over. A lonely crow cawed from a nearby tree, desperately trying to fill the void. Several minutes went by before Professor Van Helsing opened the door.

“Please, come on in,” he said without a hint of hesitation.

A smirk touched the thin lips of the doctor. Few people possessed the knowledge about vampires and those who did usually refrained from inviting them in. The old professor had always been an exception to the rule, and it seemed like he hadn’t changed one bit.

I angrily tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves. For a moment I’m reminded of some Asian girl whose name I’d already forgotten. She was prettier when she cried.

I sigh loudly – more of a grunt – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns there any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the name **Front desk** shows up first, followed by a simple message: *maid on the way up*.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of the building is familiar to me. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was. 

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

73mict,14,2017-10-01,"Me [31M] and my wife [26F] - libido mismatch, and both of us are getting very unhappy",thrownawaytightrope,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73mict/me_31m_and_my_wife_26f_libido_mismatch_and_both/,"My wife and I have been together a bit over four years now, and we just got married this summer. In most regards our relationship is pretty good, but sex has become a serious, ongoing problem. 

We were both virgins when we met, and it took a surprisingly long time for us to get up to speed on intimacy - it took months of trying before we managed to actually have proper sex with both of us getting off. But once we did, things worked fairly well for a while. I found an old post of mine on a different throwaway account from around the time we got engaged(summer 2015), and I made a comment about how we were getting it on every few days. 

Problem is, we ran into some serious problems after we got engaged. Her job stressed her out so badly she actually got nasty infections from it, and when she was off on disability she decided to quit her job and go back to grad school to pursue her dreams. At that time, I was in a 100% commission sales job, and while it'd been going decently for a while, it was starting to get sparse. So we merged our bank accounts and she saw that I was living off savings instead of actual income, and then she went on disability and her income dried up, and then she realized that I had some fairly serious focus issues that meant I wasn't doing very good work(previously-undiagnosed ADD, since improved greatly with treatment). 

Money became a gigantic running issue, and tbh rightly so - I wasn't pulling my weight, and she had gone to school on the assumption that I would. Her side jobs that she was relying on for extra cash also dried up, and we spent basically all of 2016 living off savings and debt - our combined income for the year was about maybe equal to our *monthly* expenses. And when we're constantly fighting about money and my work ethic, needless to say she stopped feeling quite so amorous towards me. We even came close to breaking up a few times. The money situation has been dealt with since then - I got a great new job this spring that pays the bills for both of us, she's done school and working a nice internship with a good career path going forward, the wedding is 100% paid off, and we're climbing out of the hole that 2015-16 left in our finances. 

But the sexual side effects linger. In 2016, we might have had sex half a dozen times tops. Thus far this year, wedding and mini-honeymoon included, it's been three times. And while the money(and related issues, like the feeling that I was letting her down and breaching her trust) problem has been solved going forward, the pathologies we developed over the issue are getting worse, not better. Every time I even vaguely hint at sex, she flips out - panic attacks aren't rare. I'm finding myself getting deeply bitter about it, and while I try really hard not to be pushy(because I know there's nothing that will make it worse faster than adding even more stress to the situation), it's getting to the point where I want to push really hard, all the time. And of course, we still like each other, so we both feel bad about making the other one feel bad, which just makes it worse. 

I think what's happening on her side is a lot like what happened with me looking for jobs a year ago. There was a sense that it was important, in large part because it was so important to the other partner, but at the same time a feeling that it was futile and hopeless. I put in hundreds of applications and got nowhere, and creeping fatalism starts taking over when that happens. I knew that I needed to keep trying, but I also knew that performing dental surgery on myself was more appealing than doing yet another resume revision to apply to yet another job I'll never get. She'd bring it up constantly, and I'd hate the whole conversation and want to run away and hide in a little hole somewhere as soon as I realized it was the 314th iteration of the money/jobs conversation. She tried to restrain herself from bringing it up too much, and it helped a little bit, but it was still incredibly unpleasant every time the topic came up, because it was so tightly associated with all of our problems and I was so lacking in hope. It seems like what she's going through is pretty similar, except with the added problem of her needing to actually enjoy sex and not merely do it for it to be any good(and of sex being less essential, particularly in her mind, than being able to afford food and shelter). 

I don't want to pretend I'm blameless here either. I've found myself avoiding her a lot more than I used to, both to have time to jerk off in peace, and to make sure that I don't wind up pressuring her semi-inadvertently. Snuggling and sex are very closely linked for me, so even when things start out as platonic snuggles, I usually get into it pretty quickly, and then spend the rest of the time trying to desperately cling to enough self-control to not make things too sexual(and failing as often as not). My methods of initiation have gotten deeply fatalist - I've forgotten everything I used to know about turning her on, and frankly I only really ever try if I fail at keeping my self-control(because I know that it won't work, so if I'm really in control I'm just going to go down to my computer and not bother her), so it's almost always about me feeling nice in the short term instead of about doing anything she'll actually like. And of course for her, sex has become halfway to terrifying, which means that this isn't going to change without something pretty fundamental happening differently, but she freaks out so fast every time the conversation comes up that we can never figure out anything to try aside from slightly different ways of wallowing in resentment and self-loathing. 

I'm really at a loss here. This is a big, big deal to me, and I'm miserable every time I think about it, which is several times a day. She's even more miserable when she thinks about it, even if it's a bit less often that she does. I don't know what to do, and I don't even really know where to look - even when I did start looking online for guides, most of them consisted of ""You're just going to have to get used to the fact that she thinks the vacuuming is more important than your happiness"" and other such self-pitying bitter nonsense. I know she loves me and wants me to be happy, and I feel the same way about her, but we're trapped in a self-destructive spiral that's got me thinking longingly of divorce in some ways, less than three months after our wedding. What the hell do I do? Even some non-crap resources I can check out would be really helpful. 

tl;dr, I like sex a lot, she's developed a whole host of negative associations with it that destroy her mood any time the topic is raised, and I'm not sure how to even try to fix the situation. 

Edit: Opinions seem pretty unanimous here. I think therapy may be in our future. "
73mjlp,23,2017-10-01,[Spoiler] My impressions on Mushoku Tensei for Vol. 7-9 - now with tl;dr and bold text,Hades_Re,LightNovels,https://www.reddit.com/r/LightNovels/comments/73mjlp/spoiler_my_impressions_on_mushoku_tensei_for_vol/,"&gt; Even before the first: Because the text got too long, the important parts are **bold**, so it should be easier to skip trough the text and reading only parts of interest. Actually I hope that that is the case.

First of all: This time I try to be more reader friendly, so you can find a tl;dr for the last post (up to Vol.6) and for this one. As you could maybe see, I posted the last post with the title ""short opinion ..."", since I never planned to write such a long text. If you are interested in the other two posts, [here](https://redd.it/703zkq) is the one for volume 1 and [here](https://redd.it/72j4n2) the second one.

Like last time, I will write volume per volume, but because of the way the plot is handled, I'll have to spoiler sometimes the next volume. I don't believe that this is important for someone, but I don't want anyone to be spoiled.

**tl;dr for Volumes 2-6:**

* Using a journes is a good way to introduce the world to the reader and Rudeus. The atmosphere was well handled and the journey really felt like a long trip.

* Rudeus' reincarnation and so his past life is actually used in the plot and his decisions.

* Eris and Ghyslaine are well written characters, even when they start as kind of bland characters.

* Rudeus' admiration for Roxy is annoying, but Roxy herself of course not.

* The different ways to reflect about the journey was absolutely fantastic. First in volume 5, Rudeus told his father a rose-colored story, but that is exactly the way the reader could feel about the adventure. Later on, it got cleared how many perils they met on their journey. Volume 6 has a well written part about the POV of Eris.

#Volume 7

- **Foreword**

Before even starting the series I already knew about the school arc and I was waiting for it. Knowing that this author knows how to do things well, I wanted to experience a school life arc written with his hands. I expect cliches used in a intelligent manner and a nice SoL/Romance/story with many explanations for the world. I have already high expectations .....

- **Words about Eris**

This volume was quite short, but full of **important characterization** for later. I think taking even more time to explore Rudeus' character changes could have been a good thing. The time skip is big and so the **change of his character**. But that doesn't mean that it isn't understandable what happened. I was already unsure if I like or dislike what Eris had done in Vol. 6, but it seems that I got tricked. Got tricked with the way the story was told. The whole ""what should I do"" was from Eris' view, **the view of her last 3 years** were in packed into a handful pages, but **these were so well written, that I was instantly captivated by her story and was on her side.** 

Now (finally starting with the 7th volume), **I eventually understood what Eris has done from his point of view** and what a **bad choice it was**. In fact, she was like Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother. Making a note and going away. But that doesn't mean that I think she is a bad person, we have her point of view after all. I was never so unsure what to think, so let's stop that here for now.

- **Volume 7 introduction**

Back to Rudeus and his situation. Honestly, I couldn't stop grinning at one point. I finished the first fifth of the volume and most of it was about ED (impotency). Sitting at the train station, reading about his ED and the people passed by, that was fun. But of course, with the importance later on, I can only repeat myself that I really like the **long and well written exploring of the emotional state, in which Rudeus is.** 

What I also liked was the moment Rudeus **killed the red dragon**. Not because it was epic or cool, but because it was so **easily to understand** how great it was what he did. Thanks to the **well developed world and ranking system**, nobody had to tell me what happened at that moment, it was clear. The world, Rudeus lives in, is now thanks to the journey arc established. So the logical consequence is to settle somewhere and use that knowledge. 

With these two things, the stage is set: Rudeus is a loser using the hose, but a winner with magic.

- **Elinalise**

She is a **fun character**, but I wonder why they call her ""something"" a curse, isn't it a blessing for humanity though ? For now, she was like a speaking partner for Rudeus, without her, it would be boring - maybe. Using Rudeus' ED and Paul himself to build **a wall between Elinalise and Rudeus** is a good thing, so it is easy to understand that there doesn't happen something. I think it can get really interesting with her later on.

- **The school examination**

One of the **most important things in this chapter is to sell us that Rudeus can't understand that Fitts is Sylphy**. I didn't had any problems with it. **It was believable**. He had not many clues to work with. Naturally, chantless incantation is really rare, but Rudeus trained his mindset for not riding the high horse his whole life  - means that if he thinks that that person has to be his disciple, it implies that he thinks that there can't be another elf who learns chantless incantation. Going against all probabilities and saying that has to be Sylphy, it would be strange. But of course, I think he was a little bit dense later on. 

- **The first day**

Here are some short **impressions for the characters**:

*Fitts:* Most of the times, it feels kind of natural how they interact, only in some moments, it feels kinda awkward how they try to not name the things, especially Rudeus, since he has no reason not to say the name of Sylphy. Later on (Vol.9), I get more the impression that he forgot Sylphy in some way without forgetting her really. I know he talks about her when he searches for the last missing person, but ... aaah ... that is the problem with the ""the reader knows more than the MC"" setting, when the story is from the 1st person view. 

*Zanoba:* Before this and the following volumes, I expected that he would be the most annoying character. His personality and reactions are most of the time counterproductive for the advancing of the plot. Also I felt some discomfort reading his part in the book before  and including this volume. He doesn't feel like a character I want to have around me. However, his classmates made a good job already beforehand to get him more ""straight"" and the Shishou-disciple relationship between him and Rudeus was nice to read about. But even with that nice turn of events, I expect something gruesome later on.

*Rinia and Pursena:* A nice addition to have characters from that village. Again, it has some feeling of coincidence, yet it isn't such a bad one, since this magic school/university is accepted all over the world, so meeting some princess like persons there shouldn't be a surprise in that case. If I had to choose between them, I would take Rinia, but they have no chance against the main girls.

*Cliff:* First I forgot about him and I needed some time, so it was a nice surprise to read about him being the little brat from Eris' Goblin hunting. Not really important in this volume, and I am in some way afraid that he could be annoying love rival or some even shittier brat later on.

*Ariel and Luke*: Even with the side stories, I have difficulties to form an opinion about these two with only this volume. Thanks to the side stories, I don't feel so lost with these two though.

**The underwear fight and the library moments were nice.** The former was the first introduction of the new Rudeus, who reacts more passive than his old self and the latter was cute, **I already like how Sylphy has problems staying her Fitts-character.**

- **Conclusion / Opinion**

**A nice introduction into the new arc.** Even with the times kip, the arcs felt connected thanks to the side stories and the recurred characters a la Elinalise and Zanoba and the reused family tree of the forest catgirls and co. A school arc gives the author so many possibilities to go wrong, but also to go right and in this volume, it didn't got so clear, where he will go. But it is obvious, that the Sylphy/Rudeus moments will get important later on.

- **Eris vs. Sylphy I**

I think Sylphy is in a disadvantaged position for now. It is nice to see how she developed as a person, since she was with Rudeus and on the way to get his servant (If I can believe the adults from volume 1). **The shy parts are kind of cute**, however she can't go on the offensive and Rudeus is a different person now, **so the romantic moments are less and not as strong as in the Eris arc**. But I hope for some good emotional profit in the end.

**tl;dr for Volume 7:** 

- Interesting change of the main setting

- MC is kind of a new person

- Nice new characters

- Unsure what to think about Eris vs Sylphy

#Volume 8

- **Foreword**

The volume is titled ""Special Student Chapter"" and so I want to say something about that. **I am not happy with the fact, that Rudeus is only/mostly interacting with so few other students.** That way, he gets captured in his own little world, something that wasn't the case during the journey arc. Naturally, **the characters he has to interact with are well written**, as this volume will show us.

- **Zanoba's arc**

This volume is split in the different character arcs. That isn't the best way to handle these kinds of things, normally meshing the arcs a little bit more is what you want. **Zanoba's arc was neat**. The talk about figures wasn't boring and I start to like Zanoba a little bit more. **The slave market was interesting**. On one hand Fitts was cute, on the other Zanoba was frightening, however he listens to Rudeus, which makes him to some extent predictable - I hope so, **since this arc introduces us Julie, a small angel**, who didn't had so many scenes, but she reminds me of the typical little girls from these SoL ""father alone at home"" stories. Only knowing that **she lives together with Zanoba gives me some goosebumps**. She seems to be motivated to do what she should to. Also it seems to be really the case that everyone can learn all these things in (only) young age. That could imply that the power level could skyrocket the moment (+15 years) it gets public. 

- **Rinia/Pursena's arc**

First we get some background explanation. This time about the human-Demon war. I think I never mentioned it, but **I am a big fan of the detailed and explored History.** Already in the library back at Eris, it got more personal and more emotional with Ruijerd telling us the story. Now we got more information about the war from 5500 years ago, which is even in that world a long time. 

Besides that backstory, we got also the not so epic backstory between Zanoba and Rinia/Pursena ....

This leads to the start of this arc which has again a conversation about dolls. One thing leads to another and finally we have **Rudeus and his Roxy is a god complex. I can only repeat myself at this point - he is annoying.** His explanation is fine (she was the person taking him outside), but it is always so long-stretched, personal opinion, but not a fan. The rest of the story is easy told. **Rudeus wins against them, kidnaps and touches them.** In that moment, I wondered what would have happened if his ""son"" would have worked.

The reusing of Beast-sama as a comparison was nice, Zanoba made me worried and **the conclusion of this arc was far better for Rudeus than I imagined. I already thought that the school arc will end in this volume.**

- **Cliff's and Elinalise's arc**

Again, we get first more information about the thoughts and feelings of the arc main character, then we get a talk about some dolls and the story starts. This arc has also the aftermath of the last one: The people are more afraid of Rudeus. With that, my dream of a more lively school arc are destroyed. But at the same time, **I like that Rudeus builds some kind of clique.** Ok, he is never really treated as a friend, he is a master, someone to be afraid of and a boss. Things can always change.

**The interactions with Fitts are my favorite parts in this school arc.** Every time Rudeus goes to the library, I am already happy to know that it will be some fun. At the same time, I like how they delve into the teleport incident. I wasn't a fan of it in volume 2, but now it isn't only some plot convenience for having time with Eris, but also Sylphy. That is truly a great author working here!

Back to the interactions between Fitts and Rudeus. Thanks to the main plot of this arc, the interactions between Fitts and Rudeus gets better and better. For example the conversation about ""someone I know"" was a short, but great.

The conclusion for the Cliff arc was of course interesting. Knowing that there is someone who tries to stop the curse could be important later on, but if I rethink it, it is Cliff, I don't know what to think about him. However, **I guess it is a good think that Elinalise could find someone who stays with her.** Maybe she only plays with him, but I can't believe that he isn't some kind of support for her. 

- **Demon king arc**

That was a great arc. First we learn a little bit how strong Rudeus is, because he has to win against the ""love-troubled"" Beast people. Again some conversation in the library with Fitts. The second part gives us the demon king as an opponent. Thanks to him, we could also learn something about the **small archipelago in the middle sea.** This was one of the last few not mentioned parts of the world. **The duel against Badigadi was interesting** because firstly they actually mentioned again how big Rudeus' mana pool is, around the level of Laplace, and secondly we could finally see Rudeus' for-now-strongest (?) attack. we knew that he could hit Orsted, but that could also have some kind of different reason with all this curses and magic rules. This time, he blew up an enemy (and that we'll learn later in the side story of this volume), who couldn't be hurt by the attack of Nina. 

The backlash is naturally even stronger than after kidnapping case and now, it will be interesting how the school handles him in later parts of the story and **how the world will react on his power**, since there were many eyewitnesses, it should spread like wildfire. Also this part 

&gt; It seems that the reason why I ended up being rejected by Eris has become because of the illness.

&gt; Well, it's fine though.

&gt; The things about Eris are already fine, I'm over them??!

is surprisingly fast.**In the seventh volume Eris was often mentioned, now this was the first**  (?) time in the eight volume and that is his reaction.

The demon king himself is a nice guy, I like him.

- **Nanahoshi's arc**

The beginning is about his position in the school, being a superior compared to all the other students. That is in full contrast to the next scene, in which he trembles and **wants to run away after seeing the white mask again**. Reading that part was so exciting.  And while the conclusion was rather unspectacular, the information we got are kind of explosive. After the information that **Nanahoshi is a Japanese girl**, I wondered why I didn't understand it earlier, since she was the only one with a Japanese name. Maybe I consume to many Japanese products ... 

[Also this part makes some problems to adapt. Taking it as obvious that the characters would speak nonstop Japanese up to this point (because everything else would be annoying by the time), this part gives us a scene in which Japanese is really needed.]

Back to the story. **I was already spoiled that there is at least one more person who is reincarnated thanks to the tagging system on Novel Updates**. So I didn't stop suspecting everyone who was new to the story and was a little bit better than the normal person. But of course, I forgot to put a girl with a mask onto that list *sigh*. 

It is a nice change to the story to add not only a second reincarnated person, **but also one with a different rule set**. Being forever 15 is a nice thing, but starting alone on the world could be a problem in itself. I don't know how the story develops, but the fact that she is there at the school implies that at one point Oersted would come back, if he has some kind of relation to her. Also she says that he is away for now, so it seems she knows what he has to do and how long it will take ?! 

She did what I would do: **Introducing the new world to superior knowledge**. It seems that it would be kind of easy to write a whole story with her as the main character, she is way to interesting for a side character introduced after completing the first third of the whole series.

**The conflict between Rudeus and Nanahoshi about the travel back to the original world** could also lead to some disaster. Ah, now it got fucking interesting. **Alone the knowledge that the teleport disaster has now its reason is a good thing.** 

Btw. Fitts is cute during the whole discussion.

- **Daily Life**

This is like some conclusion chapter. The relationships between Rudeus and the others and as well for the not named students changed drastically. His daily life is also different to the one he had at the beginning of the book. **So after getting introduced to the stage in Volume 7, the stage got designed in this volume.** The way he interacts with all the others and their behavior were developed in a way I like. So after this, it can only get worse - hopefully not

- **Conclusion**

**I said, that this arcs don't mesh, but it is interesting how Fitts is involved into every arc, helping Rudeus.** So saying that the arcs don't mesh at all is wrong after rethinking it a little bit more. The way their relationship changes thanks to the arcs of others is well made and something I like. It was surely obvious to some how the author positioned Fitts as the helping hand in every arc, for me, it was more under the surface, I never did forget what she did for Rudeus, but I never thought it completely through.

This is also often the case in better harem stories, in which the main girl doesn't get her own arc, instead she gets closer to the main character with helping him throw the story. This is not really different to this one. But luckily, even with so many girls around him, **it isn't so harem-like like I expected it to be** - for now. Rudeus' ED is helpful for that, but also his fast love-like feelings for Fitts are a good way to get the focus on one character. 

- **Side Story: Eris the mad dog**

Ok, **this side story was brilliant.** The MC is some kind of girl named Nina, who witness Eris' character. Even with all her character development in the journey arc, she is still offensive, loud and full of violent energy. People don't change so easily. Knowing why she is there and how she feels, it is easy to understand her, even if she isn't the POV character. After some nice fights, she got enrolled. Some time later, she boasts with her love live and Rudeus. Because of the self placed rumors, which were introduced a book ago, Nina can easily find him and she sees the demon arc for herself. I like changing the POV in general, and **changing it into a person from the crowd during the fight was great**. 

Now we also learn **how small the distance between Eris and Rudeus is**, but at the same time they are more distant to each other than never before. Rudeus is in love with a maybe-guy and also tries his best to forget Eris, which is also symbolized by his weakened ED status. 

&gt; After that, she became a true rival to Eris but... That's another story.

That was also written in the end of many Ariel side stories, so I expect some more of them. I wonder if this implies really the love rivalry, which I can't see working.

- **Eris vs Sylphy II**

For myself, I think **I am routing more for Sylphy than Eris at this point**. She is in a good position after this volume. Instead of being only a follower, she could help Rudeus in so many situations, most of the time it wasn't something big, but the way Rudeus showed his gratitude, it got obvious, that he really thinks very positive about these small moments. That is something that Eris wanted to be. 

But for now I liked the interactions between Eris and Rudeus more.

#Volume 9

- **Foreword**

A chapter called Sylphiette Chapter. That builds up some expectations. I can also tell at this point that I normally read the books on the train, so at the morning and at the afternoon, normally reading around a third of a book and this time, and this time I had a bad time waiting for the next reading session.

- **Sylphy's backstory at the castle**

**There weren't many surprising new facts.** The side stories already helped to unterstand what happened there, but of course, I was glad to get the full backstory at some point, since there were some uncleared questions. Additionally we get more information about the intern fights between the different families and more information about Ariel, especially the dildo attack is something that I won't forget so easily. The backstory also helps to develop Sylphy's character more and more. Being absent for ~~5 volumes~~ 3 years hurts for the connection which was build between her and the reader in the first volume.

I have to compliment the way the text was written. In this part there was a frequently use of the word ""she"" or in some other parts there was a nonstop use of ""Sylphy"" without referring to her once as ""she"". It felt kind of distant, which was a good way to implicate that the story is already in the past. The sentences were also most of the time really short and unemotional written. 

- **The First day at school - again**

**Now, we get the opportunity to see the first day through the eyes of Sylphy.** We learn that Ariel was behind the letter and that she allows Sylphy to tell Rudeus even the secret about her identity. That came kind of as a surprise, since she got never to that point. The moment she meets him in the gym/ battle arena, she gets doubtful, once because of Elinalise, but also because it could be that Rudeus have forgotten her. That is a simple, but easy to understand problem.

Of course, Sylphy can't stop admiring Rudeus and his backstory, she realizes herself that that is her weak side and that it isn't the way she should be, since she trained all the time to get on the same level as Rudeus. **That all feels similar to the thoughts of Eris about the relationship between her and Rudeus.** 

Another good change of the POV is the one to Ariel. She sees Sylphy as a person, who should be much more stronger than Sylphy shows it after meeting Rudeus the first time. At the same time, she sees Rudeus as a ""shabby man"" and as someone with a much lower worth than Sylphy. 

After that, we time skip throw the events we already knew, but now from Sylphy's perspective: Opening ceremony, underwear case and library research. **it is rather cute to read about that events from her POV** and it gives a little bit more insight into her personality - but mostly it is cute. Oh, and Rudeus seems to be rather weak with words, since he is often misunderstood at the first try.

**This book and the whole series has as one of the biggest leitmotifs the perception of oneself and how it differs to the perception of others about yourself.** This different perceptions lead then to different perceptions about the relationship between characters and in the extreme case a girl runs away from her lover. 

- **The arrival of adventurers**

I don't know exactly why there are at the school. I think there will be something later on, but for now, I can't even remember exactly what they did. After skipping through the text, it was only a short passage.

-  **Development between Rudeus and Sylphy**

**First, the meeting in the city.** After reading about the magic rings with the ability to change the appearance of oneself, it was clear from the outset that there will be a meeting with false Fitts and Rudeus. It was shorter than expected and even Rudeus' reaction was different than expected, but it was fun nonetheless. Sometimes I have the feeling that the author only has to go two steps into the wrong direction to create the second misunderstanding-light novel. But everything is more serious here and so the relationships between the characters move forward, steadily, but slowly.

**Folowing that is the search of Rudeus** who wants to know what gender Sylphy is and so he searches for some clues. His verbal attack against the teacher was great.

&gt; If you don't talk, my thick, hard Stone Cannon may make a mess of your ass.

And the first time, I was happy about a TL note which only says, yes, that is the correct translation. After searching, he meets Sylphy in the library again and after some racket, Rudeus gets the impression he *has* to defend the secret, but actually Sylphy wants to end it. Maybe we fall eventually into the pit of misunderstanding. 

**The change to Ariel's POV was great again**, so much insight about **how Sylphy reacted after the different arcs from the previous volume.** Every time when she comes back, she is extremely emotional and unsteady. She tries to be help to Rudeus she wants to be, but actually she takes to much pressure on herself. She is so close to Rudeus that she knows of things she shouldn't know of and learns things about Rudeus she shouldn't know of as a girl.

- **The protected secret**

After all that ruckus, Ariel and Luke wants to step in and gets that to an end. The plan was kind of ... bullshit, and the way Sylphy explained it to Rudeus was fun, but not helpful. **Then in the room we jump between Rudeus and Sylphy's POV,** which really remembers me of some misunderstand story with games ... The moment Sylphy was alone in the room, I thought she would find Roxy's underwear and everything ends there. Luckily, but not luckily, nothing happened at all. The moment the reader gets the information that Rudeus is awake the whole time, while Sylphy climbs up and down, I couldn't stop facepalming and grinning.

- **The forest**

Now, Ariel tries to think about a new plan. It was insightful to learn that Rudeus is kind of diffiult to read, which isn't surprising, since he doesn't know himself what he wants to do. After being asked, Sylphy dreams about her perfect future with Rudeus and wow, that was such a cute fantasy. Ah, a really great paragraph. 

The strategy to get him into the forest, start a weather change, getting into a cave, being wet from the rain ... Let's be honest, that plan sounded even more absurd than the last one. Surprisingly it worked.

**Now in in the cave:** Of course, being the moment I waited since ages, I was more than happy. The undressing was slowly, but well written without any unsensible ecchi comments. Then Sylphy started to cry after revealing her real identity.** instead of getting mindlessly into the H action, the author chooses to go on the emotional way and I am relieved that he did that.** Because only that gives me as a reader a real fulfillment. That short little talk between them, that was a great climax.

Then exactly after her telling him that she likes him, **he starts to think about Eris and that moment 3 volumes ago.** I was afraid that he would now change his opinion on the matter, that he would stop the things between him and Sylphy or that he would say something absolut dumb. Nothing like that happened fortunately. He said also that he likes her.

He fails with his son though. That again made me think that someone there will be saying something dumb, but again, they got the right course. In the end they clear every open question, especially about Ariel and the secrets.

- **aftermath**

in this two short chapters it happens much more than I ever expected.

First we change into the POV of Sylphy, which is kind of a shame, since Rudeus told her some things about his past, especially about Eris and it would be kind of interesting how he told it and what he thought then. After that it is about Sylphy and her meeting with Luke and Ariel, who again makes a new plan to get Rudeus and Sylphy physical together. 

**The final plan is about using some drugs and alcohol.** Again, thanks to another story, I was afraid that that backfires, but nothing. It works out well, The scene was again well written. It is kind of interesting, how exciting waking up can be. **The slight moment before Rudeus knew that Sylphy was also lying in the bed was way to exciting.** The second after that, it was a charming moment and I didn't think it could get better ....

In the end, Rudeus thinks the best way to handle the situation is going to Ariel. In this volume has one emotional climax after the next and the way this conversation ends was the biggest surprise.**A marriage.** 

- **Conclusion**

This volume was better than I thought it could be. There was one moment after another in which I heart skipped a beat, maybe I am to empathetic right now, but that was a great story. I already thought, that it couldn't get any better and everything has to collapse already. I hope the story won't be too gruesome at any point, I like my SoL romance with plot development here and there very much. But not only the story, also the way it is written and the way the character thinks are exactly what I want it to be. Not too pervert, not too clean, not too dumb, but also not the way that someone knows everything. **I am really happy right now.**

- **Eris vs. Sylphy III**

**I personally ship more Sylphy than Eris with Rudeus.** Because I think that Sylphy understands Rudeus better. However, the whole backstory between Eris and Rudeus isn't unimportant and I could easily imagine that he has more feelings for Eris, maybe she has only to explain why she did what she did. Eris' character was kind of basic, being a tsundere, but it was so well written and interesting. Sylphy's arc was cute and she has a better position than Eris, understanding that she (Sylphy) can help Rudeus, even if it is only small things. So I hope at least. 

In the end I like both and I wonder, what will happen next with Eris after that marraige at the end.

**tl;dr for volumes 7-9:**

- Great emotional story about the relationship between Rudeus and Sylphy

- The plot gets into the right direction with Nanahoshi's reveal

- The SoL parts are nice, the character relations gets better with every volume and makes more fun to read

(this isn't a good tl;dr, I know ......)

----

After writing all this, I wonder if this isn't way too long. Not writing the whole post on one day but here and there a short part leads to something like this. So I have to admit, that I don't think that someone will read all of this, which is kind of dumb of me, writing something that I don't expect to be read, but luckily I had fun with all this, to think over what happened. Since I read this on the train, there are days, when the other passengers are loud or in any other way annoying. taking my time at home to reminisced is a nice thing.

Also this was only the first half of this arc, I hope very much that it will be shorter, ah, it will be shorter, because I don't have the time for such long texts.

Thanks for reading!"

I am a big fan of many threads on this sub and have already collected some great advices. This time, I decided to make my own and ask around.

So, here is a little background. I'm trying to get into sales properly. Currently doing an internship in the small company, around 15 people, in the IT industry, selling an app.

I've done it for a little over a month, which was a time to learn about the product, get to know procedures and so on. It has been great. 
I collected my first batch of mails of potential leads and sent it out last week. I got a great response rate which I didn't expect (I read multiple articles on how to perfect an art of cold mailing) and next week starting Tuesday I got online meetings with clients everyday (some of them being pretty big which freaks me out).

I'm trying to prepare for those as best as I can and would like to ask for some tips regarding delivering a demo. Honestly, since this is my first time doing it, I don't even care that much about closing deals and such. Mostly, I just don't want to make myself sound like a tottal disaster and avoid burning bridges for later. Im still young and I'm aware that if there is a time to make mistakes, it's now, but still.

Anything that I should definitely focus on? Write a script for multiple situations? Ask many questions, get straight to the topic or ask how the day has been so far?

Thanks"

I've had two difficult fall-outs in the past couple of years and it wasn't easy.  I just needed to get this out for my own sake, and also to seek your opinions on my actions/your experiences with falling out.  If you don't feel like reading about the specifics, please jump to the TLDR below.

###Friend 1 
Met him through a meetup and hung out somewhat consistently after that.  About a year later, he got accepted for a prestigious international internship.  Seeing that it was difficult to find an apartment/roommates and that the internship was only a few months, I offered to hold out one of the rooms in my apartment for him upon return.  However, it was only later that I found out through mutual friends that his internship was actually going to be closer to a year - he had, whether intentionally or not, disclosed a different duration.  Moreover, he had a lot of demands for the living arrangement - e.g., stashing his belongings + car at the apartment while he was gone, insisting on getting a spot in the parking garage (when the other roommate parks on the street), even the amount of rent he's willing to pay, which was below-market.  For fuck's sake, before I found out, I was even considering living in the living room so that he could get the master bedroom because of his sleep apnea (he was ok with the idea too).  When I told him that the deal was off because he told me misleading information, he just kept insisting that we had an agreement as if it wasn't a big deal.  Now that he's returned from his gig, he's secured a living arrangement elsewhere and has been trying to reconnect, but I've just been turning him down, while the mutual friends in that group still hang out with him, even though they are clearly aware of what had transpired.

Sitting down here and writing down these qualities makes it seem almost silly that I even care so much about dropping this friend, but before this happened I really, foolishly trusted him and didn't see all the warning signs of his douchebaggery.  I don't think his intentions were malicious, but then again he looked out for only his interests the entire time.  What still bothers me now is that I'm like the bad guy in the group for not hanging out anymore.

###Friend 2
She's a colleague on the same team at work.  Very bright but incredibly selfish and dishonest.  Both of us don't really fit in with the firm culture, so we got along right from the start because of that.  However, over time I noticed that she would do a lot of distasteful things to benefit her position and treated me with increasing disrespect.  For example, one project on which we collaborated, she commandeered the most important parts and kept me in the dark until it was virtually completed so that she claimed credit for it, even though I actually came up with the original idea and invited her to work on the project in the beginning (I stopped after that with future projects of course).  On another occasion, she's even leafed through other people's files on the counter in the lady's restroom, and for whatever reason she trusted me enough to tell me that.  The last straw was when she told our boss that she's written up some code related to one of my projects, with my boss insisting that I use her code to avoid re-inventing the wheel, only to discover that the code's terrible.  My boss being a horrible manager and our firm's goal to ""promote diversity"" meant that it would only hurt me if I complained about her.  After that I completely stopped talking to her unless absolutely necessary.  Obviously she noticed this and reciprocated by ignoring me as well.  

Finally, after a few months of zero communication and awkward hallway glares, she asked to talk to me yesterday and said that we should at least communicate professionally to prevent any further misunderstandings, even if it means that we won't be ""friends"" anymore.  She asked if she's done anything that offended me, and if so she apologizes and claims it's unintentional.  She also said in passing that my latest project was sort of on her turf, but she's okay with it.  I agreed with keeping some level of communication open, but I refrained from being specific on why I did what I did, because I have doubts about her real intentions (my boss had asked her to pick up some of my work, so she had to come talk to me anyway), and her remark on my intrusion onto her turf was untrue and quite fucking patronizing/tactless for an attempt at mending a relationship.

###TL;DR
 Sorry that this has been a rant.  Both friendships shared a common theme where I felt that the friend was 1) taking a mile when given an inch, and 2) very dishonest.  It wasn't easy because I'm not good at dealing with conflict and it's very easy for me to get riled up about being taken advantage of.  Many times throughout these two friendships I thought to myself that I could be the bigger person and try to salvage the relationship or at least explain to them why I don't want to associate with them anymore, so that perhaps they could improve as human beings.  But then I think to myself, fuck that, that's not my responsibility.  I've already been more than generous with putting up with their bullshit, and I shouldn't be guilty of not providing them a report card on what kind of friends they are - especially the 2nd case with the colleague, because who knows how that might be used against me.  While I try to remind myself to be compassionate, I also need to make sure that I'm not a pushover.

P.S. both friends were bright, only children who seemed to have been coddled throughout their childhoods.  Probably a sign."
73nxkj,4,2017-10-01,how does this look on the outside?,blobcat123,Petioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petioles/comments/73nxkj/how_does_this_look_on_the_outside/,"Hi all! 

I just wanted to make a post about my current situation, and I wanted to see what you all thought about it. Long post so I apologize. I'll post a relevant historical summary, the current scenario and my concerns going forward. Basically I am looking for an analysis to make sure that there aren't any parts of this that would defeat productivity and allow me to slip into old ways!

In the past, my freshman year of college I was into weed, HARD. I went from smoking on the weekends to smoking on fridays too, to smoking everyday after lecture ended. I got into other drugs like acid, and suffice to say my grades tanked. After freshman year ended, I went back home for the summer and basically did the same thing. Smoke everyday at the first opportunity, and behaviors included hitting up people (close friends, people I didn't talk to; didn't matter. whoever could reinforce my habit) and trying to smoke with them. Then halfway into my summer, I had a difficult shroom trip where I realized I might have ADHD, and I wanted to get sober. So I gave my grinder, my pax 2, basically all my nice stuff to parents in a black backpack and told them I was quitting but don't throw away the backpack because I might want it later (like when I'm 30). So then I visited a clinic to check out my options for getting tested, and they wanted a year of sobriety. Fuck. So I kept on my sobriety until summer ended and got back to my sophomore year at school. 

My sophomore year at school started and I got more into drinking than before. I stayed off the drugs like I said I would. But come the weekend I would get hammered. ""There was just nothing else to do"", I told myself. But I never drank when I wasn't supposed to, and as the weekends progressed, I started controlling myself more. I was able to start employing a ""one-cup rule"". Wherever I went, I made sure to only have one drink the whole time at the party. It worked well! So I curbed my drinking habit by second semester. In fact, I turned 20 in that second semester and swore off alcohol completely, because I wanted my 21st on a college campus to mean something (and I still haven't drank since, it's been 200+ days going strong!!!) This whole time, I was self medicating with caffeine pills and l-theanine for sleep. Second semester, I picked up a pack of cigs and I used nicotine when it was too far into the week to use caffeine. I also took caffeine breaks like if I knew I didn't need it for a few days, I stayed off of it and drank plenty of water. But seriously, I had the same pack of cigs (american spirits - dark green I will never forget my first one OMG) from February when I bought them, to July when I still had three left (and I never bummed any from anyone). I was also lifting at this time too, so I was working out a lot. Then this summer happened, and I went back home to get tested for ADHD, because I had finally completed that year of sobriety (I justified it by saying everyone drinks at college and my therapist had even said that I could drink a bit from time to time)! So this summer I got into bulking, I put on 15 pounds and got swole while maintaining a meal plan I created and cooked for! I got my diagnosis for ADHD, and got put on meds. It changed my life. Even during sophomore year sobriety, I wasn't performing well. I took an econ course over 16 weeks and got a C-. I retook the course in the summer after getting meds and I GOT AN A+, IN AN ACCELERATED 4 WEEK COURSE! Same material, same depth but in four weeks. Wow. I digress. 

Currently, I am at school in my junior year. I don't use cigs because I have a vape at 3mg nicotine that I don't feel like increasing, and I don't feel like using it sometimes, only when my medication comes down and it feels gritty. I don't use any caffeine anymore aside from a cold coke sometimes for enjoyment. I don't drink because I still want to hold my pact (in fact I don't think I would even like it anymore because partying seems lame). But basically I get 7-8 hours of sleep a night, sometimes less because of the amount of work. I work all day from wake up to bed time, and I am responsible with my medication. I work out when I know I it's too late to take my meds for a redose, eat a big dinner (I don't eat food all day because meds but I am starting to drink protein shakes during the day) and try to get to bed after doing some mental unwinding. I think I'll start carrying around a notebook to jot down distraction-thoughts and reflect in it a lot more. The thought of writing or using a diary/journal sickened me before but now it seems ultimately effective to staying on track at work or school! My grades are amazing and getting better, and when I hang out with friends (if I have time) they are productive and positive-minded people. I am drinking plenty of water too! When I do eat dinner I make sure to eat veggies if I can but mostly carbs and proteins! 

When the weekend hits, it is a completely different story. I smoked weed for the first time in 410+ days three weeks ago. I loved it. It felt SO good to be that relaxed when I am usually working all the time during the week. Ever since, I have been smoking weed once a weekend for the past three weekends including this one, and I just picked up some of my own quantity (a gram) and smoked some with my gf last night. There's no hang over from this so I know it's fire. I plan on picking up a 50 sack soon. I want to have this around for sometime if it means there's no hangover and I can still work on Sunday (I don't indulge on Sunday night because I have chapter at 6pm and school in the morning the next day so if I smoke it is usually just on friday or saturday but not both days). The past weekends I have been junking food when I get high because I love to munch on something and healthy food is expensive for munchy food. During the week though, no unhealthy food. 

Bottom line, I want to pick up this 50 sack, I want to keep working hard throughout the week and be responsible with my meds, work out more, be healthy and keep up the progress I am making in my career and at school with my grades. I want to smoke again on weekends because nothing compares to that blissful feeling of not having to run my mind at a million miles a minute. But I am also aware of my addictive personality, and I don't want to keep doing this if I will lose the intensity of the high over time, and it will go back to being like it was in freshman year even though I'm only doing it every weekend. Also, if I get intern offers I want to be able to get clean for a hair or urine test in a month or even two weeks at the most. Thoughts?

**TL:DR I have been ""addicted"" to weed before in my freshman year (addicted means self-medicating ADHD I wasn't aware of). Now, it's my junior year, and I am awesome at self-moderation and my self-awareness. Does this plan or mentality look good or healthy for good tolerative policy?**"

73p4yp,789,2017-10-01,Just had our first FM. HotWheels and SIL (psych major),throwawayfamsquabble,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/73p4yp/just_had_our_first_fm_hotwheels_and_sil_psych/,"**UPDATE ON COMPANY** SIL (21) is 2/3 of the way through her Bach in Psychology and she is an intern at a juvenile correctional facility.

MIL visited SIL this morning. About an hour after she left, SIL texted DH and asked if they could talk about plans for her birthday. After being assured that she’s alone and his mom isn’t there, DH called her. 

So she asked if we could have dinner with her and the rest of the family (including MIL/FIL) when she comes to town on her birthday. He told her no but that she is welcome to come by anytime to spend time with DD and that we’d be haippy to take her out to lunch. She wanted to know why we won’t see the family, and DH told her the story about what FIL had told him, the stuff within the last two weeks leading up to it, etc. 
She said she hasn’t “talked to Dad to yet to see what he says” but that it was obviously wrong for him to say that. But, she said that FIL and MIL were going to close the company down next week. That he’s just been so stressed and he didn’t mean to cut DH out. He probably couldn’t “have a conversation” with DH because DH wouldn’t hear him out. 
So then she started asking about MIL and DH and her were talking about it. SIL disagreed that MIL is a narcissist and said, “She’s not a narcissist and I work with these types of people so I don’t think that’s what she is. I do think she has really low self esteem.” And she went on for awhile about how she has to carefully explain things to her mom to get her point across and how MIL had gotten upset at SIL when she moved to another town for school because SIL didn’t have time to text her all day. 

The phone call went around and around for about an hour. To sum up, SIL thinks that: both sides have valid points (that we are overreacting about the hot car and that FIL shouldn’t have given us that ultimatum), that both sides just need some space and to leave the other alone (she sited something about how people can’t be rational when they’re upset in an argument and that DH doesn’t know how to communicate with them when he’s arguing), and that we need to think about how hard it’s going to be for everyone around the holidays and that SIL wants the family to be able to spend quality time with each other. 

Oh! And she asked to be put on speaker phone at one point to ask me a question. A few weeks ago, I posted a picture of myself and DD on Facebook with the hashtag #nofilterneeded. I regularly post on Instagram to build a following for my art and writing. DH made the comment that I never post on Facebook, so I shared this one to Facebook from my Instagram. “When you posted that picture with #nofilterneeded, was that a jab at Mom? Because she had just posted a picture of herself and DD with a filter on it and she thought you were directing that at her.”

I said, “No. I post for my art on Instagram, but there’s another example of her only thinking of herself.”

Anyway. She said she wasn’t going to push us and that she’d like to stop by, alone, to visit with us and DD when she comes to town. 

ETA: I know I’m only 4 years older than SIL... but right now it feels like those years are significant. I don’t know how else to say it. 
Another ETA: SIL is intelligent (although hella naive) and undoubtedly in the top of her class right now. Her advisor, also the department head, loves her and has bent rules so that SIL could have the internship she has. She’s studying criminal psychology. 

**ETA DAY AFTER also in comments: announcing that FIL/MIL did not get the contract. It was awarded to another company. They are now laying everyone off and closing shop. I have a really hard time feeling sorry for them right now. I also know they’ll be just fine. They’ll figure it out. **"
73pf2o,3,2017-10-01,"My sister convinced my parents to buy my 13-year-old brother a $2,000 birthday present... and put her name on it",ellieopp0,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/73pf2o/my_sister_convinced_my_parents_to_buy_my/,"My brother will be turning 14 this month so I've been looking for a good gift to buy him. He loves comic books and video games so I usually get him the latest Xbox game or sometimes some vintage comic books. The price range is usually $30, sometimes $45 when I have extra cash. However, I'm a junior in college and I just quit my part-time job to do an unpaid internship for my major to graduate, so money is kind of tight.

Meanwhile, my sister casually mentioned that my brother's favorite Youtube star/IDOL was going to be in town but tickets were sold out. I said that was too bad since I know he'd kill to see him live (I'm not sure what Youtube stars do at venues but I know he loves this guy, it's some gaming channel).

So here is where I got upset... a few days later my dad told me he knows someone who got him two tickets to see the Youtube star. I guess he got front row which is $1,000 a ticket, but he got them at half price because of his friend. I told my dad that was awesome and him and my brother would have a blast.

Except he didn't get them for him and my brother. He got them for my sister and my brother for my brother's birthday, and my sister already said she got him it as his present. I was shaking. There is NO WAY I can compete with $2,000 worth of tickets for my brother's ABSOLUTE IDOL. I told my dad how angry I was and he said I was overreacting, that he would help me pay for a gift this year. He said there is a $40 toy my brother wants, or they were planning to put shelves in his room and I could say I did that.

They do not think what they did was wrong at all because they said they'd get an expensive gift for my brother and say I did it. But that isn't the point. They could spend $1 million on toys and gifts but the EXPERIENCE of seeing his idol with my sister is priceless. My sister never even offered to make this a family gift, and she already told my brother she gave it to him (him not realizing she's 19 without a job or student loans, my parents pay for everything for her).

Am I wrong? Should I just be happy that he is happy? Or am I allowed to be upset? What should I do about a gift idea? Do I get him a $40 toy and just suck it up that it won't compare?

**tl;dr:** My parents got $2,000 tickets for my brother and sister to see his absolute HERO in concert and said my sister got the tickets, now I am left unable to get him a gift that even compares. I am mad my sister took the credit and my parents don't care. I'm not sure what to do?"

***

VendingMachineKing got up early in the morning to make a drive to Munster. There, along the way he was active on social media where he posted beautiful images of the local scenery, making short videos on snapchat and instagram. He was responding to tweets when someone along the way they were driving towards noticed the path they were on, asking them to detour a bit to meet their grandfather. Naturally, the campaign bus decided to veer a little off course where we met the Topp family, and Christopher.  

Christopher was an 18 year old excited to vote this election, for the NDP. “It’s in my blood. We’ve got NDP activists in our family for many generations. In fact, my grandfather Colin was a canvasser all the way back into the CCF days!” VendingMachineKing found that remarkable, and got a photo of him and his grandson. ‘Great to see the Topp family maintaining a proud tradition of NDP activism!’ he tweeted. Christopher said he was planning on meeting me at the farmer's market, so VendingMachineKing asked to know a bit more about him. Christopher was a student at Carleton University, studying Food Science and Nutrition. “I’m quite passionate about agriculture and food policy, I’ve written quite a bit about it in my essays.” he said. VendingMachineKing found that remarkable and asked for some links about his studies, which promoted several progressive policy alternatives for the government he developed during an internship at the Experimental Farm. After getting those links off facebook messenger, he wished the Topp family well.

VendingMachineKing gave those reports a read, and found them to not only be deeply detailed, but greatly credible.

Once he arrived in Munster, he was able to meet a woman named Melissa who asked to host a short campaign event at her house and farm. That’s where a speech was made about agricultural policy from New Democrats.

&gt;“From farm to fork, our agricultural policy must be equipped and active. It’s vital we have an engaged strategy that works with the farmers of Canada, and rural communities.

&gt;We’ve been doing our best to implement our vision, and are proud of our work this term. I did my part by drafting the Canadian Wheat Board Modernization Act, submitted by our leader CJrowens. That bill passed the House, and is now law. And I’m glad it is, as we now can have a truly Canada wide approach for a public wheat board. That’s a wheat board that we want to stay public, as it works for producers and all Canadians. This will promote the rural economy as an active part of Canada wherever you live, and protects the income of many Canadian farmers.

&gt;Of course, it’s always been important to the NDP to protect the agricultural sector. It was under my leadership where we invested tens of millions in research and development to Agriculture and Agri-food Canada. The $66 million per year was part of a three year program, which would have needed continued investment to see completion for our farmers. In the last Liberal budget, no money was left behind for this initiative. Other than a mere $2 million to fund FarmStart, the only thing really left behind was our farmers.

&gt;Surprisingly enough, the government did not submit any piece of agricultural legislation this term. That’s despite the fact that one of the more active cabinet ministers, redwolf177 was in charge. He’s our Deputy Prime Minister, and a previous agriculture minister, so I can’t say I’m anything but disappointed.

&gt;In contrast, our vision for agriculture is clear. We as New Democrats want to work on grain inspection, to create a global leader in quality by empowering grain inspection agencies to ensure we can keep our great reputation. This will increase the standards that go into our food. 

&gt;On top of that, we’d continue our investments with an immediate $66 million that would go into our research and development practices. This would go hand in hand with the last time we put money in, to finish what we started.

&gt;This would foster the sort of rural economic development that communities like this in Munster, as well as the neighbouring ones in Lanark and Renfrew county need to create jobs and raise living standards. Agricultural investments that target the support of young people who are currently underrepresented in the rural economy would be a great first step. Let’s get real with proper skill development, and mentorship programs.

&gt;This development must be in tandem with our support for a clean environment and clean eco system, which is why we’d earmark money for animal welfare standards as well as soil management. And that’s animal welfare which goes beyond funding a useless cat sanctuary program that not even volunteers can get behind.

*crowd laughs*

&gt;To summarize, our agricultural policy has been proven, with steadfast commitments that have become policy and law. That’s why we want to move forward even more, for a better rural economy and better Canada, now.”

*applause and whistles of support from the crowd, made up mainly of farmers and local business people in town*
 
VendingMachineKing then got into his bus, to make his way to the Ottawa Farmers' Market on  Exhibition Way.

On the bus, he sent a message to Christopher asking if he was going to see him there. Christopher replied, saying he’d be there. After complimenting his research, he was asked to come with him and take some pictures as well as saying a few words at the event. Christopher was overwhelmed with joy, sending VendingMachineKing about six emoji’s and to gifs to attempt to capture his excitement.

Once arrived, he got to see some of the produce that people in the national capital region have prepared and were ready to sell. Everything looked delicious, and most importantly clean. Keeping Canada fed with food that tastes good and is healthy is vital.

Once he connected with Christopher, VendingMachineKing invited him to the podium where he spoke to supporters.

&gt;“Hi, my name is Chris and I wanted to say that I’m so happy to see VendingMachineKing run in Ottawa again. I was very inspired by his work in the Commons over the last few years pushing for an agricultural policy that leads us in a more progressive manner. My work at the Experimental Farm has taught me that we need to keep working at better policies that are putting people first, and especially research. I worked with people everyday who do such important work who are capable of doing more. But in order for that to happen, they need the funds. I was happy, like my co workers, to see an initial investment into research and development. Things were finally moving, and our facilities could expand our reach. But a lot of our work was halted once we got word that we weren't going to see another increase.

&gt;The NDP has promised to bring it back, so we can work with facilities nationwide and advance our research for the sake of science and agriculture. I think that’s really important, just as it’s important for us to make sure we elect a government made up of people that are committed to agriculture.

&gt;I’m happy to say I’m going to vote NDP, as well as campaign. I hope you all join me!”

He was met with a round of applause, and VendingMachineKing got to speak with him about the next event he’ll be hosting shortly.

73pv7w,1,2017-10-01,Alice/Spectral,CyranosPanache,CyranosMadness,https://www.reddit.com/r/CyranosMadness/comments/73pv7w/alicespectral/,"** Alice/Spectral** 


**Age:** 8


**Physical appearance:** Small slip of a young girl dressed in a dirty and frayed pink hoodie, jeans and old tennis shoes. Her features are pretty plain with her long straight jet black hair and and green eyes.


**Mentality:** With what she has been through she has been made to grow up quickly.  Due to some of her mental traumas, Alice tends fall back on a child-like facade as a defense mechanism. Barring acting a little childish at times when one gets to know her they might see glimpes of a girl that is actually extremly mature.   Given she is generally seen conversing with invisble people she is often seen as a little crazy and creepy. The creep factor tends ratchet up to 11 when she starts talking about things she should not know or when he voice changes to accomodate one of her ghost possessing her. She tends to fall back on her child-like behaviors to try to cover up her.


**Backstory:** Alice lived in the poorer side of town, her father was often absent, either working at the office or drunk at a bar. While away her mother would bring in various men for ""fun"". Given her mother never was the motherly type, Alice quickly learned to take care of herself. They both tended to avoid her father due to the physical and mental abuse he would give out when he was home.


This was her life until one fateful day after stealing from her moms wallet when she had gone to the corner store to pick up some groceries.  It was during this incident that she had the misfortune to catch the eye of a certain individual.  All she remembers is having a conversation with a kindly man in line then having a pair of strong hands grabbing her. This was followed by a sickly sweet smell and blackness.


When she awoke she was trapped in a small room with what seemed to be a tinted window taking up one wall. Through the window she saw what seemed like her home. The walls seemed to be plastered with pictures of her plastered on the walls. She watched as her parents fought in the other room. 


A screen turned on showing the man she spoke to before wearing a mask. He introduced himself as a villian known as the Mortician. Parents are given a chance to tell a damaging truth about themselves about themselves then end their lives or pull a lever to kill their daughter.  A recorded video displays on the screen of her sleeping with a knife to her throat.  They unfortunatly pull the lever. A door opens and the Mortician walks in.


 Alice watches as he kills them slowly in the most gruesome way imaginable. As they lay flayed and disemboweled the two-way mirror falls away.  Mortician beckons her forward which she listened to in horror. The Mortician spoke to her in a friendly manner As her mother mewled and reached for her with her final breath.  She completely broke.  She trigger with her mother having a deathgrip on her ankle.


The Mortician experienced Trigger shock but continued to try to speak with Alice even as the Ghost of her mother manifested behind him.  He was so distracted that he did not even notice  his discarded scalpel rise up from the ground..  


Alice watched as her mother stabbed the man in the back 67 times. By the end  of the ordeal she was covered in the mans blood. Alice ran away and has never stopped running. Ever since then, she has been living on the streets and when too much attention is drawn to her she moves to the next town. It is thanks to the ghosts that she has been able to make it this long. While on the road she has collected ghosts to make up a small surogate family to help her out.For those few ghosts that she finds that she builds a connection with she creates a doll and takes it allow her journey. 


Unfortunately for her the Mortician is one of the few ghosts she unintentionally collected. As it appears you cant always run from your problems

**Resources:** she is currently homeless, besides the clothes on her back, a backpack she stole to carry stuff she doesnt have much. She keeps a thin blacket, a sewing kit and what food she can keep. She tends to steal only enough to get by.


**Alignment:** Non-Aligned


 **Equipment/Weaponry: **  Has a knife that she has been keeping for protection. 8 Rag Dolls


**Specializations: ** Due to poor parenting she knows how to cook, clean and sew. Due to the sideeffects of her powers her skills and knowledge may vary on occasion based on if she is being possessed.


**Versatility:**:  She is a pretty creative little girl even though her powers are not always under her control. 


**Power:** Thinker Master Phantom


Alice's ability allows her to see and control ""ghosts"".  Ghosts are a reletive term for what Alice actual sees. Her powers are temporal sight attuned to locations and objects linked to a deceased individual. She sees silent snapshots(More like a grainy spliced loop of old film) of long deceased individuals carrying out actions as if they were still alive. The act of her touching a ghosts allows her to empower it to be able to speak and interact with the world to a degree.From her powers perspective she creates body composed of invisble force to house a copy of the mind of an individual a few moments before they died. Any ghost she manifests has a positive attitude towards Alice. 


Ghosts are unseen by anyone that does not have an ability attuned to sense force fields. They can be detected by the minor electronic disturbance they create when they get too close to sensitive electronic equipment.  Ghost have selective etherealness, While they generally pass through living things they can interact and touch nonliving things.  By focusing they can shift topass through nonliving material or briefly interact with living material(Any force directly done to a living subject is instantly minimized. A ghost can not punch someone but it can briefly lift Alice off the ground). When a ghosts shifts to pass nonliving things, ghost gives up any ability to interact with the world. Ghost have a psuedo ability of flight and would be better described as slow floating. Ghost maintain a durability of a natural human protected in body armor. If enough force is applied to kill a ghost it will discorporate and reform near its focus after a few seconds.  Strength of a ghost is on par with the strength the spirit had in life.


The strength of her ghosts is determined by the number she has manifested. Strength and weaknesses noted above are example of when only one or two ghosts are manifested. As more are manifested strength is diminished as the ghosts substance is spread among many targets.  With more ghosts, going ethereal becomes mare easier , but the looses coordination to effect the world, they may sustain more damage before incorporating.(Think of it in terms of a balistics gel density with each new ghost causing the material to be less dense.)  By 7 manifested ghosts each one has the strength and consistency of a breeze. Manifested ghosts have a range of 100 yards from Alice with their physical strengths quickly diminishing at 50 yard mark.


If a ghost passes through alice(or Alices touches it) The ghost can possess her. Normally she must give her consent to be possessed but consent is waived in moments of emotional weakness or distress. It is because of this that Alice acts the way she does given a ghost could take over if she is not careful. When she chooses they become an amalgimation of two minds, while if one takes over during a time of distress she tends to take a backseat. Ghosts tend to develop a fondness for Alice, they will never go to far away from her wishes but given some might have different mindsets the means they go about completing the task may differ.


Generally a ghost is limited in manifesting in the location of death or around its body. If Alice keeps an  dobject linked to the death site or that of the person in question she maintains the ability to manifest that specific ghost as if she were at that location. She normally keeps theses totem object in handmade dolls she makes. Creating new totems above some noted below requires an equipment post. (For the most part this allows her to keep a number of ghosts in reserve and keep me from just BSing random generic ghosts or bothering mods all the time)  
People do not believe she is a master given people do not see her ghosts, because of this when she starts talking about her imaginary friends people just think its her coping with her semi-uncontrolled powers believed to be a Telekinetic with Thinker capibilities.


(TLDR: Girl summons ghosts or girl summons psychometric mental snapshots a few seconds from a subjects death and stores them in psuedoreal human shaped force evelops or girl with uncontrontrolled psychometry nd telekinesis.)


Name|Description
-------|-------
Amos|Amos was a Homeless Drifter that was caught ungaurded in his sleep and Beaten to death by a group of stupid kids. Amos has a lot of experience living on the streets. In his youth he had made his money as a thief,con man and a gambler. As he got older he got slower, got caught and went to prison. His street life began through not being able to get stable work thanks to being an ex-con. Amos appears to Alice as a Wily old man in tattered and worn clothes. Given she uses his advice to keep safe and avoid people she values him greatly.  In a fight he is a more of a scrapper or brawler.
Desmond King/Mortician|Psychopathic supervillian and former psychiatrist that  suffered from severe blood loss from being stabbed in the back by a ghost. Desmond was a cerebral mastermind type of supervillian that reveled in breaking down people even though his powers were physical based.  He was well known in his time knowing full well how the great game of heroes and villains works. Skilled with knives and hand to hand combat.  Had an obsession  with anatomy, and psychology which he used in his former life.  To a lesser degree he liked studying Chemistry and enginering which he often used in setting up deathtraps to play his games in. Alice herself has been marked as one of his death sites allowing him to manifest without a doll.  He oddly has a protective fondness for Alice, hurting anyone that would threaten her. Given she is not able to get away from him she has undergone  stockholm syndrome to a degree. Given he is protective of her she unconciously sees him as a father figure but would never admit it.
Sigmund Green|Death by choking on a fatty piece of steak.  Sig was a CPA to the public and a number of government offices.    In his down time he was a man that enjoyed the arts, a good book, historical documentaries, good food and fine wine.Sig was a cowardly type generally trying to avoid conflic. He is a clutz, lacks social skills and could not fight his way out of a wet paper bag. Given she is only 8, an accountant is not very useful to her day to day life but Alice for some odd reason sees him as cool.
Fujiwara Kenji|Meeting his end crushed under a bookcase this immigrant spent most of his life behind a computer monitor. He specialized in computers, security  and surveilence systems.  He made his wages as a security consultant for companies and government agencies by being paid to break into their system and then improve them. Later in life he began growing more and more paranoid seeing enemies around every corner.  Alice being a young girl on the streets doesnt understand his skills but she makes use of his parnoia to help her stay off child services radar. Made a doll for him after he ""withdrew"" funds from an atm.
James Bryant|James was a young boy around her age that died from an terminal illness. She created a doll for him after realizing that she was feeling lonely and wanted someone to talk to around her age. He knows a lot a games to play . He is actually a pretty upbeat individual given his circumstances.
Cheryl Morgan| Cheryl was strangled to death while on the Job. Her Job happens to be a high priced ""escort"" something she tends to gloss over when speaking to Alice. Alice just sees the stylish dress and grownup way she acts and sees someone that stepped out of one of those fasion magazines. She see her as an older sister to ask advice from.  
Detective Lacy Stein |Former PRT officer that transfered to the police force.   She was unfortunatly killed when an investigation brought her to the apartment of a supervillian. She was too smart for her own good and pick up clues  that outed the villian. She was killed for the secret.  She is straight laced(pardon the pun) always tryig to be Alices's good concious. She know PRT and police codes and conducts like the back of her hand.  She is good at deductive logic and investigation basics. She is pretty good with a hand gun.  A
KIKI| KIKI was an academic, a scholar or in other words a bum of a career college student. She has the collective credit hour for 6 undergraduate degrees, 7 minors and was finally working on a masters when she died. Ironic that she would be struck by a care because she was trying to study more while walking. Things had been looking up, she finally found a track that fit her, she got an internship in a lawfirm while she worked on getting through law school.  She has a lot of book smarts, but is not really good in a fight.Alice sees her in a similar way to Cheryl as an older sister to look up to, just in a slightly different way. While Cheryl oozed femininity Kiki is an adult who is cool and smart.
FRANCI |She met Franci when she stumbled into a hospital parking lot with a raging fever. She had manifested Franci while half delerious.  Franci helped her by stealing some meds and helping her. Franci was the overly caring type, to the point that she was killed by a druggie that she was trying to help. Alice views her as a surogate mother in some ways.

73q33r,1,2017-10-01,m4f Fun with the Parents,MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/73q33r/m4f_fun_with_the_parents/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.


2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.


3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.


4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.


5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters.


I'm happy to substitute step-siblings or parents if your prefer to play that way."

This is more about a married couple spicing things up.


COUPLES' CABIN This is a fairly straightforward setup. Two couples (or more, if you prefer) spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods where the fireplace is warm, hot-tub steamy, and walls are thin. Over the course of the weekend, they all start to loosen-up and let go. This might include some voyeurism (listening/spying on the other couple); exhibitionism (showing off for the others); bi-play (girls and/or guys get friendly with one another); swaps; or group sex. I'd be ok with some jealousy, reluctance, or other drama if you want to spice things up too.

I'd also be up for anything involving a married couple spicing things up."

### Pre-race
While not entirely new to running (I ran my first marathon in April), I have yet to race a 5K. In the one year I have been running, I have made great progress. Going from a ~17:45 two mile run for my university's ROTC APFT test last fall to a ~14:30 at the end of the spring semester. This summer I hadn't run as much as I wanted as I was very busy with my internship and summer school work, but I trained as much as I could. I needed to run a 5K to gauge my ability at the moment. I thought my university's small 5K wellness run would do just that.

### Race
Being my first 5K race, I didn't know what to expect. My goals were low. I can run 3.1 at ~8:00 pace relatively comfortably so I just wanted to reduce that by 30 seconds for the race. I also wanted to do well comparatively to those in my age group. Once we took off, I gunned it. I may have gunned it due to being in the middle of the pack and wanting to reach the front, but I gunned it. After a while I realized this was an unsustainable pace and slowed down a bit. I tried my hardest to keep up with those I had caught up to from gunning it, but I also slowed down a bit to keep myself competitive and not burn out.
As hard as I was running, I was surprised to see myself do so well. That served as my motivation to continue pushing myself. Around mile 2 is when I started getting tired of pushing. As my splits reveal, I slowed as the race went on. Nevertheless, I continued to tell myself it would be over soon enough and to continue to push. Around what I believe must have been 2.8 miles is when my legs began getting tired. Not wanting to give in and add time to my finish, I pushed through as I was nearly finished. As I cleared the corner and came to the straight-away to the finish line, I began to hear the cheers of the spectators and I cranked up my pace. I looked at the clock, reading a time below 22 minutes, and I was shocked.
I didn't expect to do so well as I had never ran a 5K race and I had no idea what to expect. I didn't think my training would have taken me this far, especially with my bad summer running habits.

### What's next?
I finished my first 5K race with a time of 21:26 according to my Strava. For some reason, my chip did not work and my time was never published online. But comparing my Strava time to those online, I would have finished 10th in my age group for males who ran this small 5K. While a small race, this race helped me better gauge where I am physically. Beyond this, I am beginning my base building for my marathon training which is set to start in the last full week of this month. I am set to run a half-marathon in December in Memphis with my girlfriend (her first!) but I will not be training to compete, but rather just see where I am at the beginning of my marathon training. I hope this run provides me with motivation to push myself further in my runs so I can lower my marathon time (my first was 4:10:04).

73qmh3,2,2017-10-02,"Help, I'm a [27/F] and I think my best friend [25 M] has feelings for me!! He's like a brother to me!!!",Living_On_A_Prayer,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/73qmh3/help_im_a_27f_and_i_think_my_best_friend_25_m_has/,"I apologize if this post is way too long, scroll down to the end for the long story short. For several years, I've been lurking on Reddit, just content with reading people's posts and comments. However, now I'm in a bind and nobody I know can help me. So, People of Reddit, you're my only hope.

I've been friends with Scott (not real name) for a decade now and we're very close even though he lives about 8 hours away. We met in high school where I was the bullied, socially-awkward book worm, that later blossomed into a social butterfly. I had very few friends, never mind a boyfriend. Meanwhile, Scott was in a similar situation but better off than I was in high school. 

Fast Forward to Present: I'm working on my Master's, an Internship and other various activities. I barely have any free time, and I don't get to see most of my friends very often or get to go out to have fun. As a result, I've never dated and guys, my age, rarely show interest in me. Therefore, I'm completely obivious in the dating world and have no idea about any signals a guy might give off. However, over the years, I noticed there are certain things Scott does that seem abnormal for friends to do, but didn't think anything of it. These signs I put off as ""that's what friends do"" or ignored increased until I realized that it's probably not friendship for him. These signs are:

- Texting me Every Single Day without fail.

- Scott saying he Loves me (I believe in more than one type of love, but yeah I'm an idiot for not noticing this sooner).

- His face changes when I said that I'm glad I'm not in a relationship or wouldn't consider being in one right now from happy to sad/frustrated. It's just a quick glimpse, but it's there.

- He finds excuses to hug me, or touch my shoulder and small of my back when he visits.

- It takes a long time to end a call or visit. (This was pointed out to me, I just thought it'd be the same for any friend that lives far away.).

- He says that if he had to chose between his girl friend (past and current) or me, that he'll chose me every time. 

- He calls me ""His Dear Friend"" when we talk.

There are probably other signs, but those have been the ones I picked up. All of this happened so gradually throughout the years and he kept dating different women, I really don't know what to do. We're very close, weathered through the storm and he's the closest thing I have to a younger brother. I don't know what to do or if I'm just imagining this. Please help!!!"
73qnks,3,2017-10-02,"ISTP vs ISTJ? I get the cognitive functions fairly well, still not sure",[deleted],mbti,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/73qnks/istp_vs_istj_i_get_the_cognitive_functions_fairly/,"Background, both of my parents are ISTJ accountants so I think the ISTJ ways may have been embedded in me even if I am not an ISTJ. Also my sister is an ENFP. So 3/4 of my family has the same set of cognitive functions lol (Si / Te / Fi / Ne).

Yes I know the straight dicotomies are less reliable than cognitive functions but I am pretty sure about ISTx.

**1) What do you yearn for in life? Why?**

I want to make good music and have a stable career

**2) Think about a time where you felt like you were at your finest. Tell us what made you feel that way.**

In 6th grade I nearly won a spelling contest, I was the 5th best speller in the central region of my state. It was quite difficult, I had to know about 5k words, and then the contest opened up to include the entire dictionary which was probably 80k words.

Also I got into a good school for my intended career field, and I have had several internships so far.

**3) What makes you feel inferior?**

My social skills are not great. This is definitely my primary weakness

**4) What tends to weigh on your decisions? (Do you think about people, pros/cons, how you feel about it, etc.)**

I've never thought about people primarily when making a big decision, even when making a moral decision I will make it based on whether X is a good character trait, it doesn't directly have anything to do with how it would affect the person. For more cut and dry amoral issues (which is most of the decision I make), I do weigh the pros and cons.

**5) When working on a project what is normally your emphasis? Do you like to have control of the outcome?**

 How to do it efficiently using the available resources so I can get back to being productive at something else

**6) Describe us a time where you had a lot of fun. How is your memory of it?**

Friday night I finished a rough draft of a song around 4:20, it was a fun time.

Every day from 8pm-bedtime (varies between midnight-2 am usually based on the first events of the next day) at least I try to work on music, the rest of the day I am usually working on something school related so i schedule in a decent amount of ""fun""

**7) When you want to learn something new, what feels more natural for you? (Are you more prone to be hands on, to theorize, to memorize, etc)**

I figure out why it makes sense (if it is hard enough that I have to think about it). Most of school isn't hard enough that I have to consciously think about it, I can typically take a test in autopilot mode and still get an A. Homework does take me longer than most people but I do things very slowly and rigorously until I know it in and out whereas most people skim through things half-heartedly and then panic about a test. This is a pretty poor way to learn IMO. My ENFP sister is very smart but is always forgetting how to do even the previous week's assignments. She is 2 grades below me and sometimes I will help her remember what the previous week's math topic was.

**8) How organized do you to think of yourself as?**

Pretty organized, my ISTJ perfectionist parents would probably beg to differ but 90% of the objects in my room are in a perfectly logical place, I would guess my room is much cleaner than most male freshman dorm rooms

**9) How do you judge new ideas? Do you try to understand the principles behind them to see if they make sense or do you look for information that supports it?**

It feels like I pour the information into my brain, it's like a dreamlike state, often I can figure it out before I know why it works that way. This is often the case while I am programming, I will know the solution but not know why it works

**10) Do you find harmony by making sure everyone is doing fine and belonging to a given group or by making sure that you follow what you believe and being yourself?**

I don't try to belong to any groups, I've never been part of a friend group,  if I want to hang out I will ask 1 person. Often my friends are friends with each other as well but I have never understood the point of friend groups.

**11) Are you the kind that thinks before speaking or do you speak before thinking? Do you prefer one-on-one communication or group discussions?**

I speak before I think; I have said some very unintelligent things in the past. I have been assaulted by some very ""trigger-happy"" people in the past for this (mainly my abusive parents). I try to guard my mouth around bosses / references / teachers but otherwise I say whatever I want. I try to not offend people so sometimes I will tell a white lie but I'm never going to hold back the truth because I am insecure about if the person will accept me for it, I think honesty is a sign of strength- if you can afford to be honest, you don't give the other person power over you, because lying is really going out of your way to form an alternate reality of yourself for someone else, which shows that you are very weak, too weak to stand on your own merits.

**12) Do you jump into action right away or do you like to know where are you jumping before leaping? Does action speaks more than words?**

I think an intuitive wrote these questions, they are too vague for me haha. Undecided for the first one, yes for the second

**13) It's Saturday. You're at home, and your favorite show is about to start. Your friends call you for a night out. What will you do?**

I don't watch TV, only thing i'm doing saturday night is making beats, but if a friend called me it would probably be for disc golf, and I am pretty reclusive as it is (most weekends I don't talk to anyone for example) so I would probably go for it

**14) How do you act when you're stressed out?**

I take an antihistamine and I get to work. I don't have time or energy to throw a pity party for myself when I'm stressed out

**15) What makes you dislike the personalities of some people?**

Dishonesty / superficiality, the kind of people with 800 ""friends"" who barely know any of them and seem to use them purely for social validation without any actual vulnerability or sharing with the other person. My friends aren't my soulmates ofc but I am always completely open with them, if I couldn't be they wouldn't be my friend

Also laziness, it seems most people have no desire to achieve anything important with their life aside from netflix and sleeping

Also excessively emotional people, the type who will say things they don't mean when they are angry, make massive emotional demands, etc. (I can say a lot about what I don't like in people, my parents are narcs)

**16) Is there anything you really like talking about with other people?**

I don't really like talking, it's inefficient and I usually don't care about the other person's views, unless it's my sister, a friend, etc. Talking for the point of learning isn't useful when I have the Internet (excluding teaching)

**17) What kind of things do you pay the least attention to in your life?**

My social life, 4 hours of social contact per week is good for me. Also dating, sex, etc, basically anything involving other humans (unless it's someone I really care about which is almost no one)

**18) How do your friends perceive you? What is wrong about their perception? What would your friends never say about your personality?**

They perceive me how I am, because I am who I seem to be, except that I seem to be more secure than I actually am just because I am very honest and inexpressive emotionally, 1 day my sister was telling me about how it's impressive that I don't care what anyone else thinks

That I am dishonest, insecure, etc.

**19) You got a whole day to do whatever you like. What kind of activities do you feel like doing?**

This is pretty much every day for me. Aside from going to class which is &lt; 15 hours a week, I get to fit in homework, eating, and making music (that's really all I do) wherever I want in my schedule"
73qxjn,562,2017-10-02,A cranky hospitalist's top 100 pet peeves in inpatient medicine,medschoolprof,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/73qxjn/a_cranky_hospitalists_top_100_pet_peeves_in/,"Feeling a little crispy after 6 straight weeks on inpatient wards, I decided to share my top 100 pet peeves, almost all of which came up during this month and a half. Feel free to agree or disagree, or to add your own.

(For the record, I certainly don’t claim to deliver perfect patient care, and have been guilty of committing more than a few of these myself!  Categorization into fields isn’t meant to imply that specialists in each field are the primary culprits.)



**Cardiology**

* Admitting a patient for “r/o MI”, and not mentioning their ECG in the admission H&amp;P (bonus annoyance points for instead documenting “ECG: NSR”).

* Reflexively checking BID electrolytes in every patient on diuretics (sometimes appropriate, but often not necessary)

* Reflexively repleting every patient’s K&gt;4 and Mg&gt;2. (How did this practice become ubiquitous?)

* Reflexively checking a troponin in response to a brief episode of asymptomatic NSVT (bonus annoyance points if the ordering doc doesn’t bother with a follow-up troponin)

* CT surgeons, anesthesiologists, or emergency med docs who cannot reliably interpret an ECG.

* Fluid restricting patients with heart failure exacerbations. (it’s sodium restriction that’s helpful)

* Placing a patient on two hemodynamic drugs simultaneously which have directly antagonizing effects. (e.g. midodrine and hydralazine, dopamine and metoprolol, etc…)

* Describing a patient as “preload-dependent” because of [aortic stenosis/pulmonary hypertension/ diastolic dysfunction/etc…] (all patients are preload-dependent!)

* Micromanaging the blood pressure in a patient with no other cardiovascular disease (e.g. orders for prn hydralazine for SBP&gt;160).

* Continuing statins in hospice patients.

* Placing a patient on a low fat “cardiac diet” because of a history of CAD. (hospital food is already bad tasting enough!)

* Assuming a patient with an irregular pulse has a-fib without checking an ECG.

* Stating that a patient can’t have tamponade because he/she isn’t hypotensive.



**Pulmonology**

* Admitting a patient for pneumonia, and not mentioning the CXR in the admission H&amp;P.

* Admitting a patient for any pulmonary complaint, and relying on the formal interpretation of the CXR without even looking at it oneself.

* Assuming that a patient with a chronic cough and strong smoking history must have COPD.

* Diagnosing pneumonia based solely on CXR findings, irrespective of the presence or absence of consistent symptoms/signs/lab tests.

* Stating that a patient can’t have a PE because he/she isn’t hypoxemic.



**Critical Care**

* “Renal dose dopamine” (yes, our hospital still has docs who insist on this!)

* Using the heart rate as a primary indicator of volume status.

* Reflexively giving Lasix to every patient with pulmonary edema.

* When there is no room for your sick medicine patient to move to the ICU because the CT surgeons refuse to transfer out their post-op CABG patients who have been stable for days.

* When your patient codes, and no one gets around to informing you until hours later.



**Renal/Fluids**

* When a patient with mild hyperkalemia and no ECG changes is given the full smorgasbord of hyperkalemia treatment - calcium, insulin + glucose, bicarb, albuterol, and tons and tons of kayexalate. (bonus annoyance points if no one even checked for ECG changes before ordering all of that)

* Conflation of “prerenal AKI” with dehydration. (AKI from heart failure is “prerenal” too!)

* Not checking a UA in patients with AKI.

* Giving sodium bicarb for a moderate metabolic acidosis.

* Reporting the results of a UA as “dirty”.

* Placing a patient on overnight IVF when they are NPO from midnight for a procedure scheduled for 8am.



**GI**

* Ordering a stool guauic for a patient whose stool is visibly bloody or melenic. (bonus annoyance points if the intern is only checking it because the GI fellow insisted).

* Ordering a PPI for a soft reason, which will likely be continued for years before another doctor reexamines whether it’s appropriate.



**Endocrine**

* Placing an insulin-dependent diabetic on only a sliding scale.

* Continuing qid finger sticks for weeks in chronic patients whose diabetes is controlled well enough to never require insulin.

* Deciding against the use of metformin in a patient solely because his/her creatinine is 1.6 - and above a traditional, arbitrary, and evidence-free cutoff of 1.5. (bonus annoyance points if the doc actually wants to prescribe it, but the pharmacist declines to approve the order.)

* Checking TSHs in critically ill patients (exception: the very rare patients whose critical illness could be predominantly due to thyroid disease)

* Seeing a diabetic food tray full of non-diabetic-friendly food. (bonus annoyance points if it includes an Oreo brownie)



**Rheum**

* Confirming or refuting a diagnosis of gout in a patient with a hot, swollen joint using a serum uric acid level instead of arthrocentesis.

* Ordering 25 different autoantibodies in a patient presenting with a vague, multisystem disease “just to be sure it’s not autoimmune”. (bonus annoyance points if a 1:40 ANA then prompts a formal rheum consult)



**Hematology/Oncology**

* When an oncologist declines to consult on a patient with suspected malignancy until the malignancy is confirmed via pathology.

* When a proceduralist/surgeon requires a patient’s INR to be below some low and arbitrary threshold prior to a procedure (bonus annoyance points when they express no interest in the patient’s bleeding history – a much better predictor of bleeding risk).

* Reflexively transfusing at an arbitrary hemoglobin, irrespective of symptoms or other medical problems.

* Using a higher-than-normal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion simply because a patient has a history of CAD. (it’s *active* ischemia that should be a reason to transfuse to higher Hb goals)

* Diuresing an anemic patient for the primary purpose of hemoconcentration.



**ID**

* Daily ESRs or CRPs

* Feeling obligated to switch to PO antibiotics for 1 day prior to discharge, to make sure the patient’s infection doesn’t worsen due to narrowed coverage or poor absorption. (It will take longer than a day for the infection to worsen to a point that you’ll be able to observe.)

* Insistence on always using the same temperature cutoff as constituting a “fever”, and reacting to every “fever” in the same way. (i.e. sending blood cultures on every patient whose temp is &gt;=101.0, and on no patients whose temp is &lt;101.0)

* Being excessively dogmatic with antibiotic courses in situations of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. a patient with known Staph bacteremia who is estimated to have a ~10% chance of endocarditis must be treated with 6 weeks of IV antibiotics because endocarditis wasn’t “ruled out”).

* When infection control won’t let us take a patient off respiratory isolation for TB until they have been formally ruled out, despite the order having been placed accidentally. (yes, this really happened!)



**Pain management**

* Dosing narcotics less frequently than their duration of action. (i.e. oxycodone bid)

* Ordering acetaminophen as the only prn pain med in a patient whose chief complaint is pain.

* Refusing to give narcotics to an inpatient with a history of substance abuse, irrespective of how severe their acute pain is.



**Neuro**

* Documenting a patient’s neuro exam as “non-focal”. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was a neurologic symptom)

* Not assessing the gait of a patient on admission. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was “weakness” or “falls”)

* The use of a stethoscope head as a reflex hammer.

* Reflexively ordering a vitamin B12, TSH, and RPR in every patient presenting with altered mental status.

* When the reason for a patient’s admission and/or their documented chief complaint is “altered mental status” without any further description (e.g. excessive drowsiness, agitation, hallucinations, disorientation, etc…)

* Reporting the results of a head CT as “negative”.



**Psych**

* Calling a psych consult on a medicine inpatient with stable depression. (bonus annoyance points if the patient will be discharged within a day and already has a close relationship with an outpatient psychiatrist)

* Overreliance on antipsychotics for delirium before first attempting non-pharmacologic strategies.



**Orthopedics**

* When a ortho resident attempts to turf an admission to medicine because the patient is “too medically complex”, despite the fact that the ortho service is comanaged by a dedicated hospitalist 24/7.



**Urology**

* When a medicine resident calls a urology resident for help placing a urinary catheter that the nurses couldn’t place, and the urologist requests that the medicine residents try to place it first. (bonus annoyance points when the urologist then becomes irate when informed that the med resident subsequently caused urethral trauma)



**Emergency Medicine**

* When the ED calls to admit a patient for “r/o chest pain” without first getting an ECG.

* When the ED gives antibiotics without first acquiring relevant cultures.

* When the ED tells the only family member who can provide critical collateral information that they can go home before the admitting doc has had a chance to speak with them. 

* When a medicine R2 debates with a ED attending of 25 years’ experience about the need for a patient to be admitted without consideration of their unequal years of experience.



**Radiology**

* When a radiologist determines whether a patient with impaired renal function can receive contrast for either CT or MRI based only on the serum creatinine, without considering age, muscle mass, comorbid conditions, indication for scan, or the availability of reasonable alternatives to the scan.

* When the interpreting radiologist for a scan doesn’t address the stated indication for the scan within the interpretation.

* When the primary team orders a radiology study and doesn’t include an accurate indication in the request.

* When a radiologist won’t approve a seasoned hospitalist’s request for an MRI brain until a neurology R2 concurs (bonus annoyance points if it’s July).



**Communication/Charting**

* Charting “Code Status: DNR/DNI” in an admission H&amp;P without any indication as to how that decision was made.

* When a consultant stops seeing a patient without communicating that they are signing off.

* When a consultant conveys to an intern on the primary team that they feel really strongly about a particular course of action, but then don’t speak with the hospitalist directly, and don’t convey the strength of that recommendation in the chart.

* When a consultant conveys to a patient that they will/will not be discharged that day, without first discussing it with the primary team.

* Referring to a family member as “the wife” or “the son”. (it’s his/her wife, his/her son)

* Referring to the patient as “Mr.” or “Mrs.” so-and-so when speaking to a family member. (much better to say “*your* father/mother/brother/sister/etc…”)

* Ignoring the nurse during walk rounds, despite he/she standing right there at the bedside.

* When housestaff signout to the on-call team and spend 30 seconds on each of 10 patients, rather than handing over a list of 9 patients, and spending 5 minutes discussing the one patient who is particularly sick/complicated.

* Documenting a chief complaint that consists of a laundry list of 15 unrelated medical problems (“Ms. Smith is a 60 year old woman with a past history significant for hypertension, smoking, homelessness, osteoarthritis, CKD, COPD, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer s/p mastectomy and chemo, DVT in 2010, onychomycosis, and chronic low grade transaminitis, now presenting with LLE cellulitis”)

* Documenting an assessment in an H&amp;P that’s word-for-word identical to its chief complaint.

* Failing to look at the reason for presentation as documented by the ED triage nurse (it’s amazing how often the ED triage nurse, ED doc, and admitting medicine resident’s chief complaints are inconsistent)

* When the med list in the discharge instructions, med list in the discharge summary, and the official outpatient medication list in the EMR all disagree.

* When the respiratory rate of every patient on the ward is documented as either 18 or 20.

* When I/Os are fastidiously recorded on patients for whom it’s irrelevant, and patients with renal failure are recorded as having “bathroom privileges”.

* Stating “the patient *failed* such-and-such chemo regimen”. (Patients don’t fail chemo regimens; it’s the chemo regimens that fail patients)

* Stating “the patient *refused* their 3am lab draw”. (Better to say “the patient *declined* their 3am lab draw”.)

* Getting worked up over the difference between “historian” and “informant”. (This is one word choice on the wards that does actually seems trivial.)

* When a doc talks disparagingly about NAs, RNs, NPs, and/or PAs as an entire profession.

* When a non-doc talks disparagingly about docs as an entire profession (bonus annoyance points if it’s an NP wearing a “heart of a nurse, brain of a doctor” shirt)



**General**

* Referring to professional society guidelines as if they were laws that must be followed.

* Lean

* Referring to patients as “customers”. (bonus annoyance points if it’s during a daily huddle to discuss lean management techniques)

* When someone cancels a lab order and doesn’t inform the ordering doc. (bonus annoyance points if it’s a phlebotomist who felt that a delirious, semi-comatose patient “refused” the blood draw)

* When an outside hospital transfers a patient and fails to include a discharge summary. (bonus annoyance points if they include 100+ pages of nursing notes)

* Attempting to discharge a patient without first assessing how the patient is going to get home.

* Citing a study in a progress note that doesn’t actually support whatever point the writer was implying it supported.

* Failing to question an unexpected, bizarre lab value as possibly being “bad data”. (“Sure, I suppose this person recovering from a hip fracture, whose sodium yesterday was normal, could have a sodium of 90 today, but maybe we should recheck it first before starting the 3% saline…”)

* When a PMD insists that the patient they are trying to directly admit to a particular medicine ward is appropriate for that level of care, despite the doc never having stepped foot on the ward in question.

* Making a medical decision primarily based on metrics or patient satisfaction ratings.

* Failing to adequately incorporate a patient’s personal preferences and social situation in crafting a treatment plan.

* When one runs to the coffee shop to make it just before closing, only to find that they decided to close 5 minutes early."
73swx6,7,2017-10-02,"[REQUEST] Batman: Arkham Knight Premium Edition (13.50$ from 40.00$, 66% discount)",EpicChiguire,GiftofGames,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/73swx6/request_batman_arkham_knight_premium_edition_1350/,"Hi! This is EpicChiguire and you are on Gift of Games. So, I must admit that I don't have high hopes for this post because the offer ends in 3 hours and a half (silly me just saw the offer about five minutes ago). Anyways, it won't hurt if I try.

[Batman: Arkham Knight](http://store.steampowered.com/app/208650/Batman_Arkham_Knight/?snr=1_7_15__13) (which costs 40.00$ but it is on sale for 13.50$) is a game developed by Rocksteady Studios and it is the last game in the Arkham Trilogy (that if you don't count Arkham Origins, developed by WB Games Montreal). It was a mess at launch, but I've heard that it's been improved since then. So, aside Life is Strange, Assassin's Creed, Tomb Raider (both before and after the reboot) and FIFA, Batman: Arkham is one of my favorite sagas. I don't put 1000 hours into my games, but I have 55,5 hours between Arkham Asylum, City and Origins (if you check my Steam profile, you'll see that my most played game, Deus Ex: Human Revolution -now that I think of it, that is also one of my favorite games- has about 35 hours played, followed only by Civ V and Age of Empires III), which is quite a loooooot (at least for me). Now, thank God I could upgrade my PC and now someone helped me to get a very good laptop, one that can actually let me play last titles with almost no problems at all. Playing Arkham Knight wouldn't be a problem for me. I've played it a bit before, but I mean, it is way better to have it on Steam with all the achievements, support and stuff.

Now, as for the game itself... Batman is my favorite superhero. A brooding vigilante that is the night, that likes to call himself vengeance? Hell yeah! I grew up watching Batman: The Animated Series, and man, I had toys, and even a lunchbox with a still from the show (it featured Bats and Robin in an alley... it was freaking cool, I loved taking my lunch to school and show the lunch box off to my friends). I even loved Batman Forever when I was a kid (it sucks tho), and man, I can really relate to him because of the themes and motifs of Batman (loneliness, melancholy, resilience, the struggle of one man against the world, a broken man struggling against himself, etc). I remember the first time I played Arkham Asylum and I felt my skin go chicken mode when hell broke lose in the Asylum, that eery piano tone whenever you entered a certain area, the fear when you did the Killer Croc section... how powerful I felt with the Detective Mode... just majestic. Then Arkham City came and wow, even better. Everything I loved became bigger, better, and even cooler. The ultimate Batman game. I loved the Catwoman sections, and man, I felt a pyrrhic feeling of victory when Joker ... in Arkham City. Arkham Origins had its ups and downs, but boy, did it have good boss battles. Bane, Copperhead, Deathstroke... great gameplay and a rather good story (I was pleasantly surprised with it). So yeah, even though I've played some Arkham Knight before, and even though I saw the whole *movie* on YouTube because I told myself that I'd never get to play it (things change, tho), I really want to have it. Now, why can't I buy it? I'm a broke Venezuelan guy who is in Argentina taking an Internship, and I really, really have no money. I made it here as a part of a miracle, and I really need to save every single *peso* (the Argentinian currency) I can get for my personal expenses. So even though a 13$ game might not be too expensive for you guys, it is a hell of an expense for me.

So if you could help me to get Arkham Knight Premium Edition, so I could finish the Arkham saga once and for all (with all their DLC glory), I would be really, really grateful. Here is my [Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/id/coqueroman/) Thanks for reading! Blessings.

73t5w6,180,2017-10-02,[MF] Sex in the lobby (cheating),PM_YUR_PIERCINGS,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/73t5w6/mf_sex_in_the_lobby_cheating/,"One summer in college, I stayed in town to take an extra class and continue working as a bar tender. My girlfriend took an internship 3 hours away. We saw each other when we could, but schedules made it difficult. 

After my shift one night, I was hanging in the bar when I noticed a guy holding a purse away from a girl I knew. It didn't look like a cool situation, more like a bully teasing someone. When I went to check it out, I was right.

Apparently they were on a date, and he got drunk way too fast, and had tried to get a kiss. She said no, and tried to leave. The obvious answer was to steal her purse, and demand a kiss. 

I stepped in, grabbed the purse, pushed him to the ground, and called over the bouncer. Got the girl a drink, and say with her. She had been in the bar before throughout the summer, so we at least recognized each other. To me, she was a tiny Paris Hilton, and she was maybe 5 feet tall, with the tiniest little body. She was hot. 

We had a few more drinks, and she asked if I would walk her home, giving the excuse that the douche bag knew where she lived. The walk was a few blocks, and we stopped once or twice to make out. Every time, she stopped it, saying ""What if Sarah knew?"", as she knew my girlfriend. 

Finally, we got to the lobby of her building. Since it was summer, there was no campus security, and we started making out harder. My hands starting grabbing her ass, going up her shirt to her almost flat tits, but the nipples were rock hard. 

She never pulled away, but would ask about my ex, all while rubbing my hard cock through my jeans. When I suggested we go upstairs, she said her roommate wouldn't like it. 

I pulled her to a couch in the a little nook of the lobby, and started pulling her shirt off. No bra was in the way of my mouth sucking on the perfect pink nipples on her pale skin. 

She straddled my, grinding her body into mine, and stood up, holding her, and then moved her onto the ground. I pulled off her pants and dove my face into her pussy. It was hot, and wet, and sweet, and sweaty. It was delicious. 

With her thong pushed to the side, I licked every bit of the smooth lips, barely getting one finger into her. Surprisingly, she was totally open to me trying a finger in her asshole, even pushing into it. I felt both holes clench on my fingers as she came. 

Crawling up her, I made out with her more as I undid my pants. I wasn't incredibly hard, due to the drinking, but knew if I could get into her, I would be fine. ""Fuck me like you fuck Sarah. Fuck me so hard."" Nothing worked - she was just too tight and I was only semi-hard, despite being sopping wet. I would need to be a diamond to get into her. 

She rolled my over, and assumed the 69 position. My finger was back in her ass, and she ground her pussy into my face. Her mouth wrapped my cock, and she jerked with one hand. It was a Top 3 blow job of my life. The more I worked her tight little hole, the more enthusiastic she sucked. I was rock hard, ready to fuck her, but she wouldn't stop. Eventually, I blew my load into her mouth, and quivered as she continued sucking, swallowing every bit, then licked my cock clean. 

By now, it was almost 2 AM, and she kissed me passionately good night. 

The next day, I got an AOL IM from her: ""Can we talk about last night?""

Apparently someone came in while we were in the middle of it all, and saw us. She was written up for it. She wanted to talk about it, as the memories were fuzzy. We made plans to have me come to her room that night... that turned out to be more fun. "

My first thought when something makes me laugh is: ""She'd love to see this!"" We used to be partners, and more. We'd do a lot of crazy stuff together. We'd stay up all night outside her dorm on campus under the rain. She was a year older than me. We had a class together during my second semester, but never talked. She made me dream and fantasize at night about how it would be like with her. I just sort of let those thoughts sink in, deep inside. A few years later, we happened to be in the same 8 am class. I would go to class late after barely waking up, random clothes on and sandals on my feet. Sometimes, life lottery would make us sit next to each other. Every time, EVERY TIME I sit next to her, she would look at me over her left shoulder, and just say ""Good morning"" with the brightest of the smiles on her face. At times I could barely respond with my lips sealed together from the 4 hours sleep I had got. We happened to be in the same team for a project, and ended up eating outside and going to the pub with her friends now and then. One night, we were trying to catch up to her friends to get a cab, something just clicked then, and we kissed under the winter trees, with our legs shaking from the cold. We chose to walk back to campus even though snow made it a bit hard. That was the longest and hottest walk I have ever experienced in my entire life. We would wrestle in the snow-covered grass, and slowly switch it up to kissing and cuddling. At some point, she showed me the piercing she had on her belly button. I touched her belly with my frozen hands, and she let out a cute ""Ahhh~"" then looked at me in a way that said ""I'll get you back for that later..."" That was during our last day on-campus. And we both knew that it was the end of it because she had her internship after, then I had mine, and by the time I was gonna be done she would be doing her masters somewhere in Europe, then I'd be doing mine somewhere (else, probably)... During the break, I asked her out over texts, I thought it was lame as f*ck, but she said yes. We would chat all night, share music we liked, talk for hours on the phone when I got back to Uni... One day she told me she was having a hard one at the company she was interning at, I told her to tough it up a bit, and that I had to go for an Ultimate Frisbee game (I was the captain of our team). Next thing I know, some people calling me from afar, saying that there's someone to see me. It was an indoor field, so I went running to the entrance, with sweat dripping down my face and a large white shirt with sweat stains all over it. It was her, she came to see me and gave me one hell of a surprise. We spent that night outside in the apartment she rented. It was chill, with a few of her friends around, and just warm a comfy moments together after quite the long separation. That night was also one of my first times with a girl... I was so scared of losing her because I knew that in our country people who sleep together usually mean it as a one-night stand, and that long-lasting couples don't do it until they get married. Anyways, it happened, it was sloppy and kind of awkward, but we had so much fun doing it, and we laughed so hard at every little detail. We made so much noise that her sister downstairs yelled at us at some point. This was one of the happiest moments in my life. I started feeling that we could do this. We could go a long way with our story, it was something special. Out of nowhere, a few weeks after, some arguing happens over the fact that she couldn't spend the night with me because of her period. She said she was gonna tell me the morning after when she'll be at the cafeteria, so I could join her. She didn't. I went there out of habit to get my morning coffee before class and find her with her friends. I just leave because I'm not in the mood to argue again over why she didn't say anything. She goes back to her internship without saying anything. We don't talk for months. And that's literally it. This is the worst thing that happened to me. We just ""Air-broke-up"" because I don't know... because we didn't talk to each other to protect our pride ? because we were confused ? or didn't want to lose the ""I won't be the first to talk"" competition ? I have no clue. And it's been torturing me forever after. I literally don't live a single day without thinking of her. I'm starting to forget what she looks like from up-close. I'm forgetting the smell of her perfume. I'm forgetting the softness of the long sleeves she'd wear. I... I forgot what it was like touching her skin. I forgot her smile, her laugh, her voice. I forgot how sparkly her eyes would look when she was having fun. I forgot how cold her hands were 24/7. I forgot how tall she was compared to other girls. I forgot how fit she was even though she didn't do sports. I forgot how beautiful her hair was. Sorrow is grabbing me by the throat as I'm writing this... Thinking about her when I'm high is the only way I can remember every detail about her and actually enjoy doing so.
TL:DR : She's the best thing that happened to me. We unofficially ""broke-up"" because we didn't talk to each other after an argument. I can't get her out of my mind."

73u32v,9,2017-10-02,Dumped by my INTJ,katiietokiio,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/73u32v/dumped_by_my_intj/,"Hi everyone, I've been a member of this sub for two and a half years. I am an ISFP and last week I was dumped by my INTJ partner. I am making this post because I need outside perspective, I have been completely blindsided and heartbroken by his decision.

So myself and D met while travelling on a gap year two and a half years ago. I live in Ireland and he in England. We fell very hard, kept in contact when I went home and he asked me to be his girlfriend while he was still travelling. We were both starting university that year. We saw each other during our breaks, and made sacrifices to do so, which we were always happy to do because we were very in love.

Anyway I don't want to bog this down too much, I'll fast forward a bit to this year. D had been visiting me for two weeks from about 3 weeks ago. He had just finished his summer internship in London and I had started a new job in Ireland as part of my university course. I was living in a new city and so excited to experience it with him. Our trip was going well, we weren't fighting, we were having nice weekends and meeting up after work every day. He was doing pre reading for his final year at uni, so I didn't feel bad about leaving him alone. He is as I suppose you might guess, independent and hardworking. Anyway.

Last Sunday we were lying in bed deciding what to do with ourselves for the day, I was suggesting a lot of things and he wasn't giving me anything back, so I naively asked was anything wrong, he said no and I pushed him again. He said he can't do this relationship anymore. He said he had a flight booked home for the following day and now wanted to stay in a hotel that night to not make things worse. I got very upset. I was blindsided. He had not suggested a single issue to me in the nearly two weeks he had been there. He said it was a 'feeling' that had been growing. He said he didn't feel like we were compatible anymore and he didn't want to do two more years of long distance and have to make a decision for his life while considering me. He said this coming year in his final year would be too hard.

So I'm shocked, my world is turned upside down. Why had he not been communicating any of this to me. So he leaves for the hotel and I'm stuck there. It makes no sense to me that we can go from cuddling and laughing literally the night before to this. So it begins to dawn on me that a couple of times in this trip he mentioned the fact that this coming year was going to be tough. I always knew it was going to be tough. I knew that since we got together, and I had been suggesting he look at graduate positions in Ireland and see if he was interested in those when he mentioned it. Bar that what could I say.

So, he leaves and I set to work making a plan to get him back. I downloaded an ebook about getting an ex back (I know), and I really truly tried to see things from his perspective. His statement about our incompatible nature's hurt me the most. We had always loved the fact we were near opposite MBTIs, and worked very hard to understand each other's thought processes. He said since that he can't talk to me about abstract philosophy which he studies, and always did but now feel like thats a big deal. 

So I started thinking about the fact that we haven't properly talked about our issues in about six months. we were obsessed with out respective placements and internships, we didn't spare a thought for how difficult the next year might have been, or tried to make a game plan for visits like we had done in the past. We had a trip Lisbon booked in two weeks and a trip at Christmas which was only booked about a month ago. I understand his (hurtful) logic of wanting to make life decisions in a vacuum, but what hurts is neither of us know what we want. We both wanted to settle down, to love abroad for a while and after that it was open. I talked about not loving London as much as he did quite a bit, and wanting to settle in another place, but I don't understand why he's pre-emptively ending things before we know what we want ourselves. Surely these should be decided together.

Anyway, when he went home abruptly I couldn't stop messaging him. I asked him to call me on Friday, and I decided I needed to explain to him why his fears were unfounded, and based on the fact that we have u resolved fears about our relationship. I made a presentation to show him because I knew he'd take it seriously (and think it was cute). I systematically broke down his points and appealed to him emotionally. He said he needed even more time to think, so we called again yesterday. This time he said he was sure of his decision and he didn't feel the same about me. He said that any differences are insurmountable if people want to put in the work but he didn't anymore. He said he still cares about me and wants to be my friend since we get on so well, but he needs time and space to heal as do I.

So you can't really argue with that can you. I think he is denying the fact that external factors (massive amount of work to do in final year in the top University in the world, lack of communication between us, freaking out about future) have all contributed to what he calls incompatibility and falling out of love with me. This hurts me beyond belief, I have lost my best friend in the world.

What I need to know is is this situation hopeless. I know there isn't anything I can verbalise to him, he is stubborn, and to be honest I think the way he ended it was absolutely awful and immature. But in the future I don't know that we can't be friends and maybe more. Do I give him space to realise what he wants in life and his future (which I know he can't envisage me in right now, but he could again once he knows himself I believe). Do I cut contact with him and try to absolutely get over him. Will he ever come back to me and try to work out out? And WHY DIDN'T HE TALK TO ME? WHY DID HE THINK IT WAS HOPELESS?

Writing this out it sounds pathetic, but I know he cares, you can't turn your feelings off for someone in the space of a few weeks. He has convinced himself that this is right and maybe it is, but what can I do to improve my chances of him giving this another chance. I have in my opinion been mature about it, I have given space when asked and been respectful of his opinions. Maybe it's easy to say we're not right for Eva other, and the timing is wrong or whatever, but this feels wrong. Why would he do it like this.

73utlq,1,2017-10-02,"Camille Paglia on Hugh Hefner's Legacy, Trump's Masculinity and Feminism's Sex Phobia - by Jeanie Pyun (Hollywood Reporter) 2 Oct 2017",FinnagainsAwake,WomenLiberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenLiberation/comments/73utlq/camille_paglia_on_hugh_hefners_legacy_trumps/,"The pro-sex feminist, cultural critic and author tells THR why Hef's art of seduction is needed today and how Gloria Steinem is not a role model for young women.

With the death of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner on Sept. 27, cultural historian and contrarian feminist Camille Paglia spoke to The Hollywood Reporter in an exclusive interview on topics ranging from what Hef's choice of the bunny costume revealed about him to the current ""dreary"" state of relationships between the sexes. 

Have you ever been to a party at the Playboy Mansion?

No, I'm not a partygoer!  [laughs]

So let me just ask: Was Hugh Hefner a misogynist?

Absolutely not! The central theme of my wing of pro-sex feminism is that all celebrations of the sexual human body are positive. Second-wave feminism went off the rails when it was totally unable to deal with erotic imagery, which has been a central feature of the entire history of Western art ever since Greek nudes.

So let’s dig in a little — what would you say was Playboy’s cultural impact? 

Hugh Hefner absolutely revolutionized the persona of the American male. In the post World War II era, men's magazines were about hunting and fishing or the military, or they were like Esquire, erotic magazines with a kind of European flair. 

Hefner re-imagined the American male as a connoisseur in the continental manner, a man who enjoyed all the fine pleasures of life, including sex. Hefner brilliantly put sex into a continuum of appreciative response to jazz, to art, to ideas, to fine food. This was something brand new. Enjoying fine cuisine had always been considered unmanly in America. Hefner updated and revitalized the image of the British gentleman, a man of leisure who is deft at conversation — in which American men have never distinguished themselves — and with the art of seduction, which was a sport refined by the French. 

Hefner’s new vision of American masculinity was part of his desperate revision of his own Puritan heritage. On his father's side, he descended directly from William Bradford, who came over on the Mayflower and was governor of Plymouth Colony, the major settlement of New England Puritans.

But Hefner’s worldview was already dated by the explosion of the psychedelic 1960s. The anything-goes, free-love atmosphere — illustrated by all that hedonistic rolling around in the mud at Woodstock in 1969 — made the suave Hefner style seem old-fashioned and buttoned up. Nevertheless, I have always taken the position that the men's magazines — from the glossiest and most sophisticated to the rawest and raunchiest — represent the brute reality of sexuality. Pornography is not a distortion. It is not a sexist twisting of the facts of life but a kind of peephole into the roiling, primitive animal energies that are at the heart of sexual attraction and desire.

What could today's media learn from what Hef did at Playboy?

It must be remembered that Hefner was a gifted editor who knew how to produce a magazine that had great visual style and that was a riveting combination of pictorial with print design. Everything about Playboy as a visual object, whether you liked the magazine or not, was lively and often ravishing. 

In the early 1990s, you said that Hugh Hefner ""ushered in a revolution in American sexual consciousness. Some say that the women in Playboy come across as commodities, like a stereo, but I think Playboy is more an appreciation of pleasure of all kinds."" What would you add to his legacy today, if anything?

I would hope that people could see the positives in the Playboy sexual landscape — the foregrounding of pleasure and fun and humor. Sex is not a tragedy, it's a comedy! [laughs]

What do you think about the fact that Trump's childhood hero and model of sophisticated American masculinity was Hefner?

Before the election, I kept pointing out that the mainstream media based in Manhattan, particularly The New York Times, was hopelessly off in the way it was simplistically viewing Trump as a classic troglodyte misogynist. I certainly saw in Trump the entire Playboy aesthetic, including the glitzy world of casinos and beauty pageants. It's a long passé world of confident male privilege that preceded the birth of second-wave feminism. There is no doubt that Trump strongly identified with it as he was growing up. It seems to be truly his worldview.

But it is categorically not a world of unwilling women. Nor is it driven by masculine abuse. It's a world of show girls, of flamboyant femaleness, a certain kind of strutting style that has its own intoxicating sexual allure — which most young people attending elite colleges today have had no contact with whatever. 

I instantly recognized and understood it in Trump because I had always been an admirer of Hefner's sexual cosmos. I can certainly see how retrograde and nostalgic it is, but at the same time I maintain that even in the photos that The New York Times posted in trying to convict Trump of sexism, you can feel leaping from these pictures the intense sizzle of sexual polarization — in that long-ago time when men were men and women were women! 


My 1960s generation was the gender-bending generation — we were all about blending the genders in fashion and attitude. But it has to be said that in terms of world history, the taste for and interest in androgyny is usually relatively brief. And it comes at late and decadent phases of culture! [laughs]  World civilizations predictably return again and again to sexual polarization, where there is a tremendous electric charge between men and women. 

The unhappy truth is that the more the sexes have blended, the less each sex is interested in the other. So we’re now in a period of sexual boredom and inertia, complaint and dissatisfaction, which is one of the main reasons young men have gone over to pornography. Porn has become a necessary escape by the sexual imagination from the banality of our everyday lives, where the sexes are now routinely mixed in the workplace. 

With the sexes so bored with each other, all that's left are these feminist witch-hunts. That's where the energy is! And meanwhile, men are shrinking. I see men turning away from women and simply being content with the world of fantasy because women have become too thin-skinned, resentful and high maintenance. 

And American women don't know what they want any longer. In general, French women — the educated, middle-class French women, I mean — seem to have a feminine composure, a distinct sense of themselves as women, which I think women in America have gradually lost as they have won job equality in our high-pressure career system. 

Trump has certainly steadily hired and promoted women in his businesses, but it has to be said that his vision of women as erotic beings remains rather retrograde. Part of his nationwide support seems to be coming from his bold defense of his own maleness. Many mainstream voters are gratified by his reassertion of male pride and confidence. Trump supporters may be quite right that, in this period of confusion and uncertainty, male identity needs to be reaffirmed and reconsolidated. (And I’m speaking here as a Democrat who voted for Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein!) 

Ultimately every culture seems to return to sexual polarization because it may be in the best interest of human beings, whether we like it or not. Nature drives every species to procreate, although not necessarily when there's overpopulation!

Gloria Steinem has said that what Playboy doesn't know about women could fill a book. What do you think about that?

What Playboy doesn't know about well-educated, upper-middle-class women with bitter grievances against men could fill a book! I don't regard Gloria Steinem as an expert on any of the human appetites, sexuality being only one of them. Interviews with Steinem were documenting from the start how her refrigerator contained nothing but two bottles of carbonated water. Steinem's philosophy of life is extremely limited by her own childhood experiences. She came out of an admittedly unstable family background. I’m so tired of that animus of hers against men, which she’s been cranking out now for decade after decade. I come from a completely different Italian-American background — very food-centric and appetite-centric. Steinem, with that fulsomely genteel WASP persona of hers, represents an attitude of malice and vindictiveness toward men that has not proved to be in the best interest of young women today. 

So would you say that her other comment — that women reading Playboy feels a little like a Jew reading a Nazi manual — is just an expression of her animus toward men?

Oh Lord, how many times is Gloria Steinem going to play the Nazi card? What she said about me in the 1990s was: ""Her calling herself a feminist is sort of like a Nazi saying he’s not anti-Semitic.” That’s the simplistic level of Steinem's thinking!

Gloria Steinem, Susan Faludi, all of those relentlessly ideological feminists are people who have wandered away from traditional religion and made a certain rabid type of feminist rhetoric their religion. And their fanaticism has poisoned the public image of feminism and driven ordinary, mainstream citizens away from feminism. It’s outrageous.

I hugely admired the early role that Steinem played in second-wave feminism because she was very good as a spokesperson in the 1970s. She had a very soothing manner that made it seem perfectly reasonable for people to adopt feminist principles. She normalized the image of feminism when there were a lot of crazy feminists running around (like Valerie Solanas, who shot Andy Warhol). That was Steinem’s great contribution, as far as I'm concerned. Also, I credit her for co-founding Ms. magazine and thereby contributing that very useful word, Ms., to the English language, which allows us to refer to a woman without signaling her marital status. I think that's a tremendous accomplishment.

But aside from that, Steinem is basically a socialite who always hid her early dependence on men in the social scene in New York. And as a Democrat, I also blame her for having turned feminism into a covert adjunct of the Democratic party. I have always felt that feminism should transcend party politics and be a big tent welcoming women of faith and of all views into it. Also, I hold against Steinem her utter, shameless hypocrisy during the Bill Clinton scandal. After promoting sexual harassment guidelines, which I had also supported since the 1980s, Steinem waved away one of the worst cases of sexual harassment violation that can ever be imagined — the gigantic gap of power between the President of the United States and an intern! All of a sudden, oh, no, it was all fine, it was “private.”  What rubbish!  That hypocrisy by partisan feminist leaders really destroyed feminism for a long time. So now feminism has rebounded, but unfortunately it's a particularly virulent brand of feminism that’s way too reminiscent of the MacKinnon-Dworkin sex hysteria of the 1980s.

Is there anything of lasting value in Hugh Hefner’s legacy?

We can see that what has completely vanished is what Hefner espoused and represented — the art of seduction, where a man, behaving in a courtly, polite and respectful manner, pursues a woman and gives her the time and the grace and the space to make a decision of consent or not. Hefner’s passing makes one remember an era when a man would ask a woman on a real date — inviting her to his apartment for some great music on a cutting-edge stereo system (Playboy was always talking about the best new electronics!) — and treating her to fine cocktails and a wonderful, relaxing time. Sex would emerge out of conversation and flirtation as a pleasurable mutual experience. So now when we look back at Hefner, we see a moment when there was a fleeting vision of a sophisticated sexuality that was integrated with all of our other aesthetic and sensory responses.

Instead, what we have today, after Playboy declined and finally disappeared off the cultural map, is the coarse, juvenile anarchy of college binge drinking, fraternity keg parties where undeveloped adolescent boys clumsily lunge toward naive girls who are barely dressed in tiny mini skirts and don't know what the hell they want from life. What possible romance or intrigue or sexual mystique could survive such a vulgar and debased environment as today's residential campus social life?

Do men need a kind of Hefner for today to give an example of how to interact with women in a sophisticated manner?

Yes. Women's sexual responses are notoriously slower than men's. Truly sophisticated seducers knew that women have to be courted and that women love an ambiance, setting a stage. Today, alas, too many young women feel they have to provide quick sex or they’ll lose social status. If a guy can't get sex from them, he'll get it from someone else. There’s a general bleak atmosphere of grudging compliance.

Today’s hook-up culture, which is the ultimate product of my generation’s sexual revolution, seems markedly disillusioning in how it has reduced sex to male needs, to the general male desire for wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am efficiency, with no commitment afterwards.  We're in a period of great sexual confusion and rancor right now. The sexes are very wary of each other. There’s no pressure on men to marry because they can get sex very easily in other ways. 

The sizzle of sex seems gone. What Hefner's death forces us to recognize is that there is very little glamour and certainly no mystery or intrigue left to sex for most young people. Which means young women do not know how to become women. And sex has become just another physical urge that can be satisfied like putting coins into a Coke machine. 

This may be one reason for the ferocious pressure by so many current feminists to reinforce the Stalinist mechanisms, the pernicious PC rules that have invaded colleges everywhere. Feminists want supervision and surveillance of dating life on campus to punish men if something goes wrong and the girl doesn't like what happened. I am very concerned that what young women are saying through this strident feminist rhetoric is that they feel incapable of conducting independent sex lives. They require adult intrusion and supervision and penalizing of men who go astray. But if feminism means anything, it should be encouraging young women to take control of every aspect of their sex lives, including their own impulses, conflicts and disappointments. That's what's tragic about all this. Young women don't seem to realize that in demanding adult inquiry into and adjudication of their sex lives, they are forfeiting their own freedom and agency. 

Young women are being taught that men have all the power and have used it throughout history to oppress women. Women don't seem to realize how much power they have to crush men! Strong women have always known how to control men. Oscar Wilde said women are complex and men are simple. Is it society or is it nature that is unjust? This was the big question that I proposed in Sexual Personae, where I argued that our biggest oppressor is actually nature, not society. I continue to feel that my pro-sex wing of feminism, which does not see sexual imagery or men in general as the enemy, has the best and healthiest message for young women.


There is a big push/pull happening in the entertainment industry about female voices and representation around directors in Hollywood. Surely there's nothing wrong with that, right, in your opinion?

All this constant complaining by women in Hollywood, I really don't understand it. I’m disturbed by women acting as if the world owes them opportunities, when there are so many hugely rich women stars in movies and music who should be using their millions to fund the creation of production companies precisely for the kind of hiring that they want. All those wealthy performers with their multiple houses — how about selling one of them? And let them do whatever feminist projects they want and see if they can sell it to the general public.

Look at the way you had George Lucas and Steven Spielberg coming together when they had nothing — they were just young men with a dream, with a vision, and they made an enormously successful series of films with global impact. Look at how many young male billionaires dropped out of college, and you got the Apple computer and Facebook.

I blame women for their own lack of imagination. There was a period when there were so many really unique and memorable films by women. Lisa Cholodenko's High Art is an example. That’s an amazing film. And what about Donna Deitch's Desert Hearts? A knock-out film with vivid characters and a wonderful sense of place.  But I know how difficult it is to get the funding for films. It can be like a five-year process, and it saps people’s creative energies. And it's kind of a double whammy — when women are able to produce movies that bring in big bucks on the international stage, that’s when woman directors will get more chances. But women can certainly cut their teeth by making really important, low-budget films. I want to see them! Show us. Show us the quality of your mind and your work, okay? At a certain point, it’s counterproductive when you're claiming that someone else always has to open doors for you. 

You have discussed the issue of imagery — what are your thoughts about the Playboy bunny costume?

Feminists of that period were irate about it — they felt that it reduced women to animals. It is true it’s animal imagery, but a bunny is a child's toy, for heaven's sake! I think you could criticize the bunny image that Hefner created by saying it makes a woman juvenile and infantilizes her. But the type of animal here is a kind of key to Hefner's sensibility because a bunny is utterly harmless. Multiplying like bunnies: Hefner was making a strange kind of joke about the entire procreative process. It seems to me like a defense formation — Hefner turning his Puritan guilts into humor. It suggests that, despite his bland smile, he may always have suffered from a deep anxiety about sex. 

There are all kinds of complex currents in men’s relationship to women that feminism refuses to acknowledge.  The main one is men’s often very unstable or ambivalent relationship with their mothers. That's what I see in Hefner's notorious lifestyle in the Playboy Mansion, where he stayed and worked in his bedroom all day long, dressed in pajamas and a robe. It's a blatant regression to the womb world exactly as Elvis Presley evidently desired. Elvis’s wife Priscilla complained that all he wanted to do was stay in his bedroom all day long in the dark, watching TV and having hamburgers brought in. There was a strange kind of craving there for maternal nurturance. I think feminism is wildly wrong when it portrays men as the oppressor, when in fact men, as I have argued in my books, are always struggling for identity against the enormous power of women.

Hefner created his own universe of sexuality, where there was nothing threatening. It’s a kind of childlike vision, sanitizing all the complexities and potential darkness of the sexual impulse. Everybody knows that Hefner’s sexual type was the girl next door, in other words, the corn-fed, bubbly American girl who stays at the borderline of womanhood but never crosses it.

The limitations in Hefner's erotic system can be seen when one compares Playboy to the other great magazine that it inspired, Penthouse: Its U.S. editor, Bob Guccione, was then married to a very stylish British woman, Kathy Keeton, who gave her particular cosmopolitan perspective to Penthouse. It projected an adult vision of sexuality in a highly sophisticated urban environment — people flirting in limousines, glamorous women who were as free and dominant as a man about town.  

When we look back at Hefner's girl next door, we see that she's kind of like a high-school cheerleader or the ingenue in a postwar musical comedy like Oklahoma. Hefner was a Midwesterner who took a very long time to change his residence from Chicago to Los Angeles, where he was suddenly moving in the fastest currents of American culture.  

Hefner’s women may have been uncomplex as personalities, but they were always warm and genuine. I never found them particularly erotic. I much preferred the Penthouse style of women, who were more femme fatales. Hefner’s bunnies were a major departure from female mythology, where women were often portrayed as animals of prey — tigresses and leopards. Woman as cozy, cuddly bunny is a perfectly legitimate modality of eroticism. Hefner was good-natured but rather abashed, diffident, and shy. So he recreated the image of women in palatable and manageable form. I don’t see anything misogynist in that. What I see is a frank acknowledgment of Hefner’s fear of women’s actual power.

For ideological feminists to go on and on about how we cannot have women treated as sex objects is so naive, so uncultured. It shows a total incomprehension of  the history of art, which flows into the great Hollywood movies and sex symbols of the 20th century. The whole history of art is about objectification. That's what an art work is: it's an artifact, an object. Because of our advanced brains, it is the nature of human beings to make sex objects — objects of worship. Turning a person into a beautiful thing does not automatically dehumanize her.

All you have to do is look at the long history of the gay male world, beginning in classical Athens. No gay man has ever said when gazing at a beautiful young man with a perfect body, “I am making him passive beneath my gaze.” That would be stupid beyond belief. Every gay man knows that youth and beauty are supreme principles that deserve our admiration and veneration. When we worship beauty, we are worshipping life itself.

With the death of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner on Sept. 27, cultural historian and contrarian feminist Camille Paglia spoke to The Hollywood Reporter in an exclusive interview on topics ranging from what Hef's choice of the bunny costume revealed about him to the current ""dreary"" state of relationships between the sexes.

Have you ever been to a party at the Playboy Mansion?

No, I'm not a partygoer! [laughs]

So let me just ask: Was Hugh Hefner a misogynist?

Absolutely not! The central theme of my wing of pro-sex feminism is that all celebrations of the sexual human body are positive. Second-wave feminism went off the rails when it was totally unable to deal with erotic imagery, which has been a central feature of the entire history of Western art ever since Greek nudes.

So let’s dig in a little — what would you say was Playboy’s cultural impact?

Hugh Hefner absolutely revolutionized the persona of the American male. In the post World War II era, men's magazines were about hunting and fishing or the military, or they were like Esquire, erotic magazines with a kind of European flair.

Hefner re-imagined the American male as a connoisseur in the continental manner, a man who enjoyed all the fine pleasures of life, including sex. Hefner brilliantly put sex into a continuum of appreciative response to jazz, to art, to ideas, to fine food. This was something brand new. Enjoying fine cuisine had always been considered unmanly in America. Hefner updated and revitalized the image of the British gentleman, a man of leisure who is deft at conversation — in which American men have never distinguished themselves — and with the art of seduction, which was a sport refined by the French.

Hefner’s new vision of American masculinity was part of his desperate revision of his own Puritan heritage. On his father's side, he descended directly from William Bradford, who came over on the Mayflower and was governor of Plymouth Colony, the major settlement of New England Puritans.

But Hefner’s worldview was already dated by the explosion of the psychedelic 1960s. The anything-goes, free-love atmosphere — illustrated by all that hedonistic rolling around in the mud at Woodstock in 1969 — made the suave Hefner style seem old-fashioned and buttoned up. Nevertheless, I have always taken the position that the men's magazines — from the glossiest and most sophisticated to the rawest and raunchiest — represent the brute reality of sexuality. Pornography is not a distortion. It is not a sexist twisting of the facts of life but a kind of peephole into the roiling, primitive animal energies that are at the heart of sexual attraction and desire.

What could today's media learn from what Hef did at Playboy?

It must be remembered that Hefner was a gifted editor who knew how to produce a magazine that had great visual style and that was a riveting combination of pictorial with print design. Everything about Playboy as a visual object, whether you liked the magazine or not, was lively and often ravishing.

In the early 1990s, you said that Hugh Hefner ""ushered in a revolution in American sexual consciousness. Some say that the women in Playboy come across as commodities, like a stereo, but I think Playboy is more an appreciation of pleasure of all kinds."" What would you add to his legacy today, if anything?

I would hope that people could see the positives in the Playboy sexual landscape — the foregrounding of pleasure and fun and humor. Sex is not a tragedy, it's a comedy! [laughs]

What do you think about the fact that Trump's childhood hero and model of sophisticated American masculinity was Hefner?

Before the election, I kept pointing out that the mainstream media based in Manhattan, particularly The New York Times, was hopelessly off in the way it was simplistically viewing Trump as a classic troglodyte misogynist. I certainly saw in Trump the entire Playboy aesthetic, including the glitzy world of casinos and beauty pageants. It's a long passé world of confident male privilege that preceded the birth of second-wave feminism. There is no doubt that Trump strongly identified with it as he was growing up. It seems to be truly his worldview.

But it is categorically not a world of unwilling women. Nor is it driven by masculine abuse. It's a world of show girls, of flamboyant femaleness, a certain kind of strutting style that has its own intoxicating sexual allure — which most young people attending elite colleges today have had no contact with whatever.

I instantly recognized and understood it in Trump because I had always been an admirer of Hefner's sexual cosmos. I can certainly see how retrograde and nostalgic it is, but at the same time I maintain that even in the photos that The New York Times posted in trying to convict Trump of sexism, you can feel leaping from these pictures the intense sizzle of sexual polarization — in that long-ago time when men were men and women were women!

My 1960s generation was the gender-bending generation — we were all about blending the genders in fashion and attitude. But it has to be said that in terms of world history, the taste for and interest in androgyny is usually relatively brief. And it comes at late and decadent phases of culture! [laughs] World civilizations predictably return again and again to sexual polarization, where there is a tremendous electric charge between men and women.

The unhappy truth is that the more the sexes have blended, the less each sex is interested in the other. So we’re now in a period of sexual boredom and inertia, complaint and dissatisfaction, which is one of the main reasons young men have gone over to pornography. Porn has become a necessary escape by the sexual imagination from the banality of our everyday lives, where the sexes are now routinely mixed in the workplace.

With the sexes so bored with each other, all that's left are these feminist witch-hunts. That's where the energy is! And meanwhile, men are shrinking. I see men turning away from women and simply being content with the world of fantasy because women have become too thin-skinned, resentful and high maintenance.

And American women don't know what they want any longer. In general, French women — the educated, middle-class French women, I mean — seem to have a feminine composure, a distinct sense of themselves as women, which I think women in America have gradually lost as they have won job equality in our high-pressure career system.

Trump has certainly steadily hired and promoted women in his businesses, but it has to be said that his vision of women as erotic beings remains rather retrograde. Part of his nationwide support seems to be coming from his bold defense of his own maleness. Many mainstream voters are gratified by his reassertion of male pride and confidence. Trump supporters may be quite right that, in this period of confusion and uncertainty, male identity needs to be reaffirmed and reconsolidated. (And I’m speaking here as a Democrat who voted for Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein!)

Ultimately every culture seems to return to sexual polarization because it may be in the best interest of human beings, whether we like it or not. Nature drives every species to procreate, although not necessarily when there's overpopulation!

Gloria Steinem has said that what Playboy doesn't know about women could fill a book. What do you think about that?

What Playboy doesn't know about well-educated, upper-middle-class women with bitter grievances against men could fill a book! I don't regard Gloria Steinem as an expert on any of the human appetites, sexuality being only one of them. Interviews with Steinem were documenting from the start how her refrigerator contained nothing but two bottles of carbonated water. Steinem's philosophy of life is extremely limited by her own childhood experiences. She came out of an admittedly unstable family background. I’m so tired of that animus of hers against men, which she’s been cranking out now for decade after decade. I come from a completely different Italian-American background — very food-centric and appetite-centric. Steinem, with that fulsomely genteel WASP persona of hers, represents an attitude of malice and vindictiveness toward men that has not proved to be in the best interest of young women today.

So would you say that her other comment — that women reading Playboy feels a little like a Jew reading a Nazi manual — is just an expression of her animus toward men?

Oh Lord, how many times is Gloria Steinem going to play the Nazi card? What she said about me in the 1990s was: ""Her calling herself a feminist is sort of like a Nazi saying he’s not anti-Semitic.” That’s the simplistic level of Steinem's thinking!

Gloria Steinem, Susan Faludi, all of those relentlessly ideological feminists are people who have wandered away from traditional religion and made a certain rabid type of feminist rhetoric their religion. And their fanaticism has poisoned the public image of feminism and driven ordinary, mainstream citizens away from feminism. It’s outrageous.

I hugely admired the early role that Steinem played in second-wave feminism because she was very good as a spokesperson in the 1970s. She had a very soothing manner that made it seem perfectly reasonable for people to adopt feminist principles. She normalized the image of feminism when there were a lot of crazy feminists running around (like Valerie Solanas, who shot Andy Warhol). That was Steinem’s great contribution, as far as I'm concerned. Also, I credit her for co-founding Ms. magazine and thereby contributing that very useful word, Ms., to the English language, which allows us to refer to a woman without signaling her marital status. I think that's a tremendous accomplishment.

But aside from that, Steinem is basically a socialite who always hid her early dependence on men in the social scene in New York. And as a Democrat, I also blame her for having turned feminism into a covert adjunct of the Democratic party. I have always felt that feminism should transcend party politics and be a big tent welcoming women of faith and of all views into it. Also, I hold against Steinem her utter, shameless hypocrisy during the Bill Clinton scandal. After promoting sexual harassment guidelines, which I had also supported since the 1980s, Steinem waved away one of the worst cases of sexual harassment violation that can ever be imagined — the gigantic gap of power between the President of the United States and an intern! All of a sudden, oh, no, it was all fine, it was “private.” What rubbish! That hypocrisy by partisan feminist leaders really destroyed feminism for a long time. So now feminism has rebounded, but unfortunately it's a particularly virulent brand of feminism that’s way too reminiscent of the MacKinnon-Dworkin sex hysteria of the 1980s.

Is there anything of lasting value in Hugh Hefner’s legacy?

We can see that what has completely vanished is what Hefner espoused and represented — the art of seduction, where a man, behaving in a courtly, polite and respectful manner, pursues a woman and gives her the time and the grace and the space to make a decision of consent or not. Hefner’s passing makes one remember an era when a man would ask a woman on a real date — inviting her to his apartment for some great music on a cutting-edge stereo system (Playboy was always talking about the best new electronics!) — and treating her to fine cocktails and a wonderful, relaxing time. Sex would emerge out of conversation and flirtation as a pleasurable mutual experience. So now when we look back at Hefner, we see a moment when there was a fleeting vision of a sophisticated sexuality that was integrated with all of our other aesthetic and sensory responses.

Instead, what we have today, after Playboy declined and finally disappeared off the cultural map, is the coarse, juvenile anarchy of college binge drinking, fraternity keg parties where undeveloped adolescent boys clumsily lunge toward naive girls who are barely dressed in tiny mini skirts and don't know what the hell they want from life. What possible romance or intrigue or sexual mystique could survive such a vulgar and debased environment as today's residential campus social life?

Do men need a kind of Hefner for today to give an example of how to interact with women in a sophisticated manner?

Yes. Women's sexual responses are notoriously slower than men's. Truly sophisticated seducers knew that women have to be courted and that women love an ambiance, setting a stage. Today, alas, too many young women feel they have to provide quick sex or they’ll lose social status. If a guy can't get sex from them, he'll get it from someone else. There’s a general bleak atmosphere of grudging compliance.

Today’s hook-up culture, which is the ultimate product of my generation’s sexual revolution, seems markedly disillusioning in how it has reduced sex to male needs, to the general male desire for wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am efficiency, with no commitment afterwards. We're in a period of great sexual confusion and rancor right now. The sexes are very wary of each other. There’s no pressure on men to marry because they can get sex very easily in other ways.

The sizzle of sex seems gone. What Hefner's death forces us to recognize is that there is very little glamour and certainly no mystery or intrigue left to sex for most young people. Which means young women do not know how to become women. And sex has become just another physical urge that can be satisfied like putting coins into a Coke machine.

This may be one reason for the ferocious pressure by so many current feminists to reinforce the Stalinist mechanisms, the pernicious PC rules that have invaded colleges everywhere. Feminists want supervision and surveillance of dating life on campus to punish men if something goes wrong and the girl doesn't like what happened. I am very concerned that what young women are saying through this strident feminist rhetoric is that they feel incapable of conducting independent sex lives. They require adult intrusion and supervision and penalizing of men who go astray. But if feminism means anything, it should be encouraging young women to take control of every aspect of their sex lives, including their own impulses, conflicts and disappointments. That's what's tragic about all this. Young women don't seem to realize that in demanding adult inquiry into and adjudication of their sex lives, they are forfeiting their own freedom and agency.

Young women are being taught that men have all the power and have used it throughout history to oppress women. Women don't seem to realize how much power they have to crush men! Strong women have always known how to control men. Oscar Wilde said women are complex and men are simple. Is it society or is it nature that is unjust? This was the big question that I proposed in Sexual Personae, where I argued that our biggest oppressor is actually nature, not society. I continue to feel that my pro-sex wing of feminism, which does not see sexual imagery or men in general as the enemy, has the best and healthiest message for young women.

There is a big push/pull happening in the entertainment industry about female voices and representation around directors in Hollywood. Surely there's nothing wrong with that, right, in your opinion?

All this constant complaining by women in Hollywood, I really don't understand it. I’m disturbed by women acting as if the world owes them opportunities, when there are so many hugely rich women stars in movies and music who should be using their millions to fund the creation of production companies precisely for the kind of hiring that they want. All those wealthy performers with their multiple houses — how about selling one of them? And let them do whatever feminist projects they want and see if they can sell it to the general public.

Look at the way you had George Lucas and Steven Spielberg coming together when they had nothing — they were just young men with a dream, with a vision, and they made an enormously successful series of films with global impact. Look at how many young male billionaires dropped out of college, and you got the Apple computer and Facebook.

I blame women for their own lack of imagination. There was a period when there were so many really unique and memorable films by women. Lisa Cholodenko's High Art is an example. That’s an amazing film. And what about Donna Deitch's Desert Hearts? A knock-out film with vivid characters and a wonderful sense of place. But I know how difficult it is to get the funding for films. It can be like a five-year process, and it saps people’s creative energies. And it's kind of a double whammy — when women are able to produce movies that bring in big bucks on the international stage, that’s when woman directors will get more chances. But women can certainly cut their teeth by making really important, low-budget films. I want to see them! Show us. Show us the quality of your mind and your work, okay? At a certain point, it’s counterproductive when you're claiming that someone else always has to open doors for you.

You have discussed the issue of imagery — what are your thoughts about the Playboy bunny costume?

Feminists of that period were irate about it — they felt that it reduced women to animals. It is true it’s animal imagery, but a bunny is a child's toy, for heaven's sake! I think you could criticize the bunny image that Hefner created by saying it makes a woman juvenile and infantilizes her. But the type of animal here is a kind of key to Hefner's sensibility because a bunny is utterly harmless. Multiplying like bunnies: Hefner was making a strange kind of joke about the entire procreative process. It seems to me like a defense formation — Hefner turning his Puritan guilts into humor. It suggests that, despite his bland smile, he may always have suffered from a deep anxiety about sex.

There are all kinds of complex currents in men’s relationship to women that feminism refuses to acknowledge. The main one is men’s often very unstable or ambivalent relationship with their mothers. That's what I see in Hefner's notorious lifestyle in the Playboy Mansion, where he stayed and worked in his bedroom all day long, dressed in pajamas and a robe. It's a blatant regression to the womb world exactly as Elvis Presley evidently desired. Elvis’s wife Priscilla complained that all he wanted to do was stay in his bedroom all day long in the dark, watching TV and having hamburgers brought in. There was a strange kind of craving there for maternal nurturance. I think feminism is wildly wrong when it portrays men as the oppressor, when in fact men, as I have argued in my books, are always struggling for identity against the enormous power of women.

Hefner created his own universe of sexuality, where there was nothing threatening. It’s a kind of childlike vision, sanitizing all the complexities and potential darkness of the sexual impulse. Everybody knows that Hefner’s sexual type was the girl next door, in other words, the corn-fed, bubbly American girl who stays at the borderline of womanhood but never crosses it.

The limitations in Hefner's erotic system can be seen when one compares Playboy to the other great magazine that it inspired, Penthouse: Its U.S. editor, Bob Guccione, was then married to a very stylish British woman, Kathy Keeton, who gave her particular cosmopolitan perspective to Penthouse. It projected an adult vision of sexuality in a highly sophisticated urban environment — people flirting in limousines, glamorous women who were as free and dominant as a man about town.

When we look back at Hefner's girl next door, we see that she's kind of like a high-school cheerleader or the ingenue in a postwar musical comedy like Oklahoma. Hefner was a Midwesterner who took a very long time to change his residence from Chicago to Los Angeles, where he was suddenly moving in the fastest currents of American culture.

Hefner’s women may have been uncomplex as personalities, but they were always warm and genuine. I never found them particularly erotic. I much preferred the Penthouse style of women, who were more femme fatales. Hefner’s bunnies were a major departure from female mythology, where women were often portrayed as animals of prey — tigresses and leopards. Woman as cozy, cuddly bunny is a perfectly legitimate modality of eroticism. Hefner was good-natured but rather abashed, diffident, and shy. So he recreated the image of women in palatable and manageable form. I don’t see anything misogynist in that. What I see is a frank acknowledgment of Hefner’s fear of women’s actual power.

With the death of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner on Sept. 27, cultural historian and contrarian feminist Camille Paglia spoke to The Hollywood Reporter in an exclusive interview on topics ranging from what Hef's choice of the bunny costume revealed about him to the current ""dreary"" state of relationships between the sexes.

Have you ever been to a party at the Playboy Mansion?

No, I'm not a partygoer! [laughs]

So let me just ask: Was Hugh Hefner a misogynist?

Absolutely not! The central theme of my wing of pro-sex feminism is that all celebrations of the sexual human body are positive. Second-wave feminism went off the rails when it was totally unable to deal with erotic imagery, which has been a central feature of the entire history of Western art ever since Greek nudes.

So let’s dig in a little — what would you say was Playboy’s cultural impact?

Hugh Hefner absolutely revolutionized the persona of the American male. In the post World War II era, men's magazines were about hunting and fishing or the military, or they were like Esquire, erotic magazines with a kind of European flair.

Hefner re-imagined the American male as a connoisseur in the continental manner, a man who enjoyed all the fine pleasures of life, including sex. Hefner brilliantly put sex into a continuum of appreciative response to jazz, to art, to ideas, to fine food. This was something brand new. Enjoying fine cuisine had always been considered unmanly in America. Hefner updated and revitalized the image of the British gentleman, a man of leisure who is deft at conversation — in which American men have never distinguished themselves — and with the art of seduction, which was a sport refined by the French.

Hefner’s new vision of American masculinity was part of his desperate revision of his own Puritan heritage. On his father's side, he descended directly from William Bradford, who came over on the Mayflower and was governor of Plymouth Colony, the major settlement of New England Puritans.

But Hefner’s worldview was already dated by the explosion of the psychedelic 1960s. The anything-goes, free-love atmosphere — illustrated by all that hedonistic rolling around in the mud at Woodstock in 1969 — made the suave Hefner style seem old-fashioned and buttoned up. Nevertheless, I have always taken the position that the men's magazines — from the glossiest and most sophisticated to the rawest and raunchiest — represent the brute reality of sexuality. Pornography is not a distortion. It is not a sexist twisting of the facts of life but a kind of peephole into the roiling, primitive animal energies that are at the heart of sexual attraction and desire.

What could today's media learn from what Hef did at Playboy?

It must be remembered that Hefner was a gifted editor who knew how to produce a magazine that had great visual style and that was a riveting combination of pictorial with print design. Everything about Playboy as a visual object, whether you liked the magazine or not, was lively and often ravishing.

In the early 1990s, you said that Hugh Hefner ""ushered in a revolution in American sexual consciousness. Some say that the women in Playboy come across as commodities, like a stereo, but I think Playboy is more an appreciation of pleasure of all kinds."" What would you add to his legacy today, if anything?

I would hope that people could see the positives in the Playboy sexual landscape — the foregrounding of pleasure and fun and humor. Sex is not a tragedy, it's a comedy! [laughs]

What do you think about the fact that Trump's childhood hero and model of sophisticated American masculinity was Hefner?

Before the election, I kept pointing out that the mainstream media based in Manhattan, particularly The New York Times, was hopelessly off in the way it was simplistically viewing Trump as a classic troglodyte misogynist. I certainly saw in Trump the entire Playboy aesthetic, including the glitzy world of casinos and beauty pageants. It's a long passé world of confident male privilege that preceded the birth of second-wave feminism. There is no doubt that Trump strongly identified with it as he was growing up. It seems to be truly his worldview.

But it is categorically not a world of unwilling women. Nor is it driven by masculine abuse. It's a world of show girls, of flamboyant femaleness, a certain kind of strutting style that has its own intoxicating sexual allure — which most young people attending elite colleges today have had no contact with whatever.

I instantly recognized and understood it in Trump because I had always been an admirer of Hefner's sexual cosmos. I can certainly see how retrograde and nostalgic it is, but at the same time I maintain that even in the photos that The New York Times posted in trying to convict Trump of sexism, you can feel leaping from these pictures the intense sizzle of sexual polarization — in that long-ago time when men were men and women were women!

My 1960s generation was the gender-bending generation — we were all about blending the genders in fashion and attitude. But it has to be said that in terms of world history, the taste for and interest in androgyny is usually relatively brief. And it comes at late and decadent phases of culture! [laughs] World civilizations predictably return again and again to sexual polarization, where there is a tremendous electric charge between men and women.

The unhappy truth is that the more the sexes have blended, the less each sex is interested in the other. So we’re now in a period of sexual boredom and inertia, complaint and dissatisfaction, which is one of the main reasons young men have gone over to pornography. Porn has become a necessary escape by the sexual imagination from the banality of our everyday lives, where the sexes are now routinely mixed in the workplace.

With the sexes so bored with each other, all that's left are these feminist witch-hunts. That's where the energy is! And meanwhile, men are shrinking. I see men turning away from women and simply being content with the world of fantasy because women have become too thin-skinned, resentful and high maintenance.

And American women don't know what they want any longer. In general, French women — the educated, middle-class French women, I mean — seem to have a feminine composure, a distinct sense of themselves as women, which I think women in America have gradually lost as they have won job equality in our high-pressure career system.

Trump has certainly steadily hired and promoted women in his businesses, but it has to be said that his vision of women as erotic beings remains rather retrograde. Part of his nationwide support seems to be coming from his bold defense of his own maleness. Many mainstream voters are gratified by his reassertion of male pride and confidence. Trump supporters may be quite right that, in this period of confusion and uncertainty, male identity needs to be reaffirmed and reconsolidated. (And I’m speaking here as a Democrat who voted for Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein!)

Ultimately every culture seems to return to sexual polarization because it may be in the best interest of human beings, whether we like it or not. Nature drives every species to procreate, although not necessarily when there's overpopulation!

Gloria Steinem has said that what Playboy doesn't know about women could fill a book. What do you think about that?

What Playboy doesn't know about well-educated, upper-middle-class women with bitter grievances against men could fill a book! I don't regard Gloria Steinem as an expert on any of the human appetites, sexuality being only one of them. Interviews with Steinem were documenting from the start how her refrigerator contained nothing but two bottles of carbonated water. Steinem's philosophy of life is extremely limited by her own childhood experiences. She came out of an admittedly unstable family background. I’m so tired of that animus of hers against men, which she’s been cranking out now for decade after decade. I come from a completely different Italian-American background — very food-centric and appetite-centric. Steinem, with that fulsomely genteel WASP persona of hers, represents an attitude of malice and vindictiveness toward men that has not proved to be in the best interest of young women today.

So would you say that her other comment — that women reading Playboy feels a little like a Jew reading a Nazi manual — is just an expression of her animus toward men?

Oh Lord, how many times is Gloria Steinem going to play the Nazi card? What she said about me in the 1990s was: ""Her calling herself a feminist is sort of like a Nazi saying he’s not anti-Semitic.” That’s the simplistic level of Steinem's thinking!

Gloria Steinem, Susan Faludi, all of those relentlessly ideological feminists are people who have wandered away from traditional religion and made a certain rabid type of feminist rhetoric their religion. And their fanaticism has poisoned the public image of feminism and driven ordinary, mainstream citizens away from feminism. It’s outrageous.

I hugely admired the early role that Steinem played in second-wave feminism because she was very good as a spokesperson in the 1970s. She had a very soothing manner that made it seem perfectly reasonable for people to adopt feminist principles. She normalized the image of feminism when there were a lot of crazy feminists running around (like Valerie Solanas, who shot Andy Warhol). That was Steinem’s great contribution, as far as I'm concerned. Also, I credit her for co-founding Ms. magazine and thereby contributing that very useful word, Ms., to the English language, which allows us to refer to a woman without signaling her marital status. I think that's a tremendous accomplishment.

But aside from that, Steinem is basically a socialite who always hid her early dependence on men in the social scene in New York. And as a Democrat, I also blame her for having turned feminism into a covert adjunct of the Democratic party. I have always felt that feminism should transcend party politics and be a big tent welcoming women of faith and of all views into it. Also, I hold against Steinem her utter, shameless hypocrisy during the Bill Clinton scandal. After promoting sexual harassment guidelines, which I had also supported since the 1980s, Steinem waved away one of the worst cases of sexual harassment violation that can ever be imagined — the gigantic gap of power between the President of the United States and an intern! All of a sudden, oh, no, it was all fine, it was “private.” What rubbish! That hypocrisy by partisan feminist leaders really destroyed feminism for a long time. So now feminism has rebounded, but unfortunately it's a particularly virulent brand of feminism that’s way too reminiscent of the MacKinnon-Dworkin sex hysteria of the 1980s.

Is there anything of lasting value in Hugh Hefner’s legacy?

We can see that what has completely vanished is what Hefner espoused and represented — the art of seduction, where a man, behaving in a courtly, polite and respectful manner, pursues a woman and gives her the time and the grace and the space to make a decision of consent or not. Hefner’s passing makes one remember an era when a man would ask a woman on a real date — inviting her to his apartment for some great music on a cutting-edge stereo system (Playboy was always talking about the best new electronics!) — and treating her to fine cocktails and a wonderful, relaxing time. Sex would emerge out of conversation and flirtation as a pleasurable mutual experience. So now when we look back at Hefner, we see a moment when there was a fleeting vision of a sophisticated sexuality that was integrated with all of our other aesthetic and sensory responses.

Instead, what we have today, after Playboy declined and finally disappeared off the cultural map, is the coarse, juvenile anarchy of college binge drinking, fraternity keg parties where undeveloped adolescent boys clumsily lunge toward naive girls who are barely dressed in tiny mini skirts and don't know what the hell they want from life. What possible romance or intrigue or sexual mystique could survive such a vulgar and debased environment as today's residential campus social life?

Do men need a kind of Hefner for today to give an example of how to interact with women in a sophisticated manner?

Yes. Women's sexual responses are notoriously slower than men's. Truly sophisticated seducers knew that women have to be courted and that women love an ambiance, setting a stage. Today, alas, too many young women feel they have to provide quick sex or they’ll lose social status. If a guy can't get sex from them, he'll get it from someone else. There’s a general bleak atmosphere of grudging compliance.

Today’s hook-up culture, which is the ultimate product of my generation’s sexual revolution, seems markedly disillusioning in how it has reduced sex to male needs, to the general male desire for wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am efficiency, with no commitment afterwards. We're in a period of great sexual confusion and rancor right now. The sexes are very wary of each other. There’s no pressure on men to marry because they can get sex very easily in other ways.

The sizzle of sex seems gone. What Hefner's death forces us to recognize is that there is very little glamour and certainly no mystery or intrigue left to sex for most young people. Which means young women do not know how to become women. And sex has become just another physical urge that can be satisfied like putting coins into a Coke machine.

This may be one reason for the ferocious pressure by so many current feminists to reinforce the Stalinist mechanisms, the pernicious PC rules that have invaded colleges everywhere. Feminists want supervision and surveillance of dating life on campus to punish men if something goes wrong and the girl doesn't like what happened. I am very concerned that what young women are saying through this strident feminist rhetoric is that they feel incapable of conducting independent sex lives. They require adult intrusion and supervision and penalizing of men who go astray. But if feminism means anything, it should be encouraging young women to take control of every aspect of their sex lives, including their own impulses, conflicts and disappointments. That's what's tragic about all this. Young women don't seem to realize that in demanding adult inquiry into and adjudication of their sex lives, they are forfeiting their own freedom and agency.

Young women are being taught that men have all the power and have used it throughout history to oppress women. Women don't seem to realize how much power they have to crush men! Strong women have always known how to control men. Oscar Wilde said women are complex and men are simple. Is it society or is it nature that is unjust? This was the big question that I proposed in Sexual Personae, where I argued that our biggest oppressor is actually nature, not society. I continue to feel that my pro-sex wing of feminism, which does not see sexual imagery or men in general as the enemy, has the best and healthiest message for young women.

There is a big push/pull happening in the entertainment industry about female voices and representation around directors in Hollywood. Surely there's nothing wrong with that, right, in your opinion?

All this constant complaining by women in Hollywood, I really don't understand it. I’m disturbed by women acting as if the world owes them opportunities, when there are so many hugely rich women stars in movies and music who should be using their millions to fund the creation of production companies precisely for the kind of hiring that they want. All those wealthy performers with their multiple houses — how about selling one of them? And let them do whatever feminist projects they want and see if they can sell it to the general public.

Look at the way you had George Lucas and Steven Spielberg coming together when they had nothing — they were just young men with a dream, with a vision, and they made an enormously successful series of films with global impact. Look at how many young male billionaires dropped out of college, and you got the Apple computer and Facebook.

I blame women for their own lack of imagination. There was a period when there were so many really unique and memorable films by women. Lisa Cholodenko's High Art is an example. That’s an amazing film. And what about Donna Deitch's Desert Hearts? A knock-out film with vivid characters and a wonderful sense of place. But I know how difficult it is to get the funding for films. It can be like a five-year process, and it saps people’s creative energies. And it's kind of a double whammy — when women are able to produce movies that bring in big bucks on the international stage, that’s when woman directors will get more chances. But women can certainly cut their teeth by making really important, low-budget films. I want to see them! Show us. Show us the quality of your mind and your work, okay? At a certain point, it’s counterproductive when you're claiming that someone else always has to open doors for you.

You have discussed the issue of imagery — what are your thoughts about the Playboy bunny costume?

Feminists of that period were irate about it — they felt that it reduced women to animals. It is true it’s animal imagery, but a bunny is a child's toy, for heaven's sake! I think you could criticize the bunny image that Hefner created by saying it makes a woman juvenile and infantilizes her. But the type of animal here is a kind of key to Hefner's sensibility because a bunny is utterly harmless. Multiplying like bunnies: Hefner was making a strange kind of joke about the entire procreative process. It seems to me like a defense formation — Hefner turning his Puritan guilts into humor. It suggests that, despite his bland smile, he may always have suffered from a deep anxiety about sex.

There are all kinds of complex currents in men’s relationship to women that feminism refuses to acknowledge. The main one is men’s often very unstable or ambivalent relationship with their mothers. That's what I see in Hefner's notorious lifestyle in the Playboy Mansion, where he stayed and worked in his bedroom all day long, dressed in pajamas and a robe. It's a blatant regression to the womb world exactly as Elvis Presley evidently desired. Elvis’s wife Priscilla complained that all he wanted to do was stay in his bedroom all day long in the dark, watching TV and having hamburgers brought in. There was a strange kind of craving there for maternal nurturance. I think feminism is wildly wrong when it portrays men as the oppressor, when in fact men, as I have argued in my books, are always struggling for identity against the enormous power of women.

Hefner created his own universe of sexuality, where there was nothing threatening. It’s a kind of childlike vision, sanitizing all the complexities and potential darkness of the sexual impulse. Everybody knows that Hefner’s sexual type was the girl next door, in other words, the corn-fed, bubbly American girl who stays at the borderline of womanhood but never crosses it.

The limitations in Hefner's erotic system can be seen when one compares Playboy to the other great magazine that it inspired, Penthouse: Its U.S. editor, Bob Guccione, was then married to a very stylish British woman, Kathy Keeton, who gave her particular cosmopolitan perspective to Penthouse. It projected an adult vision of sexuality in a highly sophisticated urban environment — people flirting in limousines, glamorous women who were as free and dominant as a man about town.

When we look back at Hefner's girl next door, we see that she's kind of like a high-school cheerleader or the ingenue in a postwar musical comedy like Oklahoma. Hefner was a Midwesterner who took a very long time to change his residence from Chicago to Los Angeles, where he was suddenly moving in the fastest currents of American culture.

Hefner’s women may have been uncomplex as personalities, but they were always warm and genuine. I never found them particularly erotic. I much preferred the Penthouse style of women, who were more femme fatales. Hefner’s bunnies were a major departure from female mythology, where women were often portrayed as animals of prey — tigresses and leopards. Woman as cozy, cuddly bunny is a perfectly legitimate modality of eroticism. Hefner was good-natured but rather abashed, diffident, and shy. So he recreated the image of women in palatable and manageable form. I don’t see anything misogynist in that. What I see is a frank acknowledgment of Hefner’s fear of women’s actual power.

For ideological feminists to go on and on about how we cannot have women treated as sex objects is so naive, so uncultured. It shows a total incomprehension of the history of art, which flows into the great Hollywood movies and sex symbols of the 20th century. The whole history of art is about objectification. That's what an art work is: it's an artifact, an object. Because of our advanced brains, it is the nature of human beings to make sex objects — objects of worship. Turning a person into a beautiful thing does not automatically dehumanize her.

All you have to do is look at the long history of the gay male world, beginning in classical Athens. No gay man has ever said when gazing at a beautiful young man with a perfect body, “I am making him passive beneath my gaze.” That would be stupid beyond belief. Every gay man knows that youth and beauty are supreme principles that deserve our admiration and veneration. When we worship beauty, we are worshipping life itself.

73uvnw,0,2017-10-02,"reflecting back: 10 year's ago I was sitting there, crying on the bus",WaterMnt,Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/73uvnw/reflecting_back_10_years_ago_i_was_sitting_there/,"Redditors of Portland, this may sound dramatic, but you were my last hope.

I moved here from Florida about 10 years and 5 months ago. Got dumped, laid off and diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety all within the span of 6 months. I needed to get out of Florida and for the most part, my stay here had been ok, but I hadn't been able to find a job anywhere.

Quickly realizing how absolutely broke I was, I sold all of the things that I could sell, worked every freelance job I could work, and pinched every penny by eating nothing but rice and canned beans for 3 months.

I know that lots of people had it worse than I do, as it very apparent by the abundant homeless population. My heart truly goes out to them

I’m reached out to all of you 10 years ago to plead with any of you who might know of anywhere to get a job. I had a degree in mass communications and experience in my field, but it seemed like no matter what I did, I couldn't get a job anywhere. I got turned down by Target twice.

I honestly didn’t know where to go or who to turn to. Anything, anything at all would have helped. Even just comments to tell me to keep my head up because at that point I needed it.

That's when many of you reached out to me and gave me so leads for jobs and ways to address my mental health. I can't believe its been 10 years. We've still got Comrade Trump as president and that's pretty damn lousy, but you wouldn't believe how my life has turned out, and how far I have come. 

I started working a dishwasher part time and doing some side gigs with a local media company. From there I ended up on a project team for a large ad campaign at the marketing company and was able to quit my dishwashing job. After about a year and a half of 60-70hr weeks (my money problems were gone!) we launched our campaign and it was a smashing success winning many industry awards! 

On the side, because my income was non-existent, I was about to sign up for OHP and get linked up with a therapist through Multnomah County Health Services. It took some help and a bit of phone calls and various forms to really get things going but this ended up being the best therapist I've ever seen. I'd seen a bunch and we often seemed to discuss life but not really go anywhere. Maybe it was just me who was ready to dive into my own problems, but they seemed like a perfect reflector, leading me to realize choices I needed to make in my life and helped me to establish new patterns for interacting and being aware of my feelings. As I made more income and gained my own health insurance, I continued to pay out of pocket to see this therapist. Over the course of 3 years, focusing a lot on myself I was able to wean off of my medications as I had established new and healthy routines.

Anyways, back to the professional development, due to the success on the big media campaign, and the fact that I had helped with a lot of the gritty work on the ground along with offering some creative contributions that were appreciated by a few of the project directors, and the work schmoozing events that happened after it debuted, I had formed a decent network of who's who in town in my field. I managed to get a really great paying job at a new avante garde ad firm, who also helped pay for me to get my masters in strategic communications in an evening and weekend program through UO's satellite program through their school of journalism here in town. About 6 years after I was here crying on the bus, I had my masters degree, lots of connections, and a great basis to start off on my own consulting company. I've worked with a variety of entities throughout the region as an contractor and make more than I could have ever imagined.

It's now going on 10 years and in happen stance I came across a young person on a job I was consulting for, who had just moved here from Florida, down on their luck, with a degree in digital mass media. Thinking of my own past and my own difficulties I reached out to them to see if they wanted to help me on a different project that I thought they'd be a great fit for. Well they did awesome with the job and nailed it just as the client was looking for. No surprise after that I was able to get them a paying living wage internship with a company I frequently work with.. and I just had to be thankful for how life has unfolded in the most unexpected of ways. I am so grateful for the opportunities and help I got from you when I needed it most."
73v1b8,3,2017-10-02,My [23F] recent trouble with sleeping is driving me insane,AlmightyStrawberry,askdoctors,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdoctors/comments/73v1b8/my_23f_recent_trouble_with_sleeping_is_driving_me/,"On phone so sorry for possible weird formatting. I'm trying to keep it short. English is also not my native language so there might be some wonky sentences in this post, I'll do my best to avoid grammar errors. Also sorry for the rambling, I have some troubles thinking straight atm.


Since the end of August my sleeping pattern has taken a very, very annoying turn. I'm a morning person AFAIK. In the summer I spend six weeks getting up between 2:45 and 3:20 AM to get to my summer job that I loved. My friends thought I was absolutely nuts, but I loved waking up early and going to my summer job. I had this job from early July until mid August, a week before I started my internship.


I noticed that almost immediately after starting my internship I can't seem to even wake up before 7 AM. When I do wake up, no matter how much I slept, I am completely exhausted and need to really put up a fight to get up. There has been instances were I woke up and was able to move my eyes to check the time, but not the rest of my body because I was simply too tired or even half-asleep. This is problematic as I am expected in my internship to be present at 7:30 and I have to commute at least 45 minutes.
On days off, in the weekends and lately even sometimes on a workday or school day it has happened that I wake up at around 9 AM. This is very late for my standards and aside from obvious stress about coming in late at my internship and interfering with school work I usually plan in the morning when I usually have the most amoubt of energy, it is also starting to mess with my mood, I think. I'm agitated, frustrated and tired. All I think about all day is either 'let's hope these three hours fly by soon so I can go home and catch a bit of extra sleep' or 'how do I regulate the amount of time I sleep? Maybe I'm tired simply because I think sleeping is the answer' or 'how do I keep my eyes opened for another thirty minutes?'. If it weren't for my mother (I still live at home) who is very aware of the situation, I would have started skipping meals just to catch a bit of extra sleep.


My intenship is very understanding, I've been apologizing for forever, notifying them that I am seeing a doctor and taking other precautions. The people at my internship have known me since I was about 16, and they know it's very unlike me to oversleep, especially at this high rate.


So far, these have been my precautions:
- Never go to bed later than 2215. I should note that as of now, it is basically an achievement for me to go to bed late in the evening, it's almost as hard as getting up in the morning. Most nights I don't make it past 2100;

- Put my notifications on completely silent at 2000 to make my phone as easy to ignore as possible (I also used it as my alarm clock until I got my Clocky, then I turned it off);

- Avoid caffeine as I had read it actually makes sleepiness worse. I kept this up until I was so sleepy in class one time my head actually made a fall big enough for the professor (who had already commented on how I looked drowsy) to notice. I don't know if caffeine scientifically does something beneficial to your energy levels and concentration but after that embarrassing incident I just started drinking coffee again, never more than two black coffees or one espresso a day, never later than 1800;

- Exercise more. I have been taking up jumping rope, running and (beginner level) weight lifting again and I notice a sudden boost of energy soon enough, followed by a further drop of energy after about 15 minutes of exercising, no matter the intensity;

- I still live at home and my mother wakes me up in the morning if she gets the chance to (she tends to oversleep herself and when she does she simply doesn't have the time to wake me up until she is in her car). She often calls me but even though I have a very loud ringtone I also tend to sleep through that sound more often than not. She then decided to mainly just barge into my room and shake me, flip on the lights or pour water on me (at my request), but I most times sleep through that, too. Sometimes I do wake up and respond to her, only to fall asleep again and wake up with no recollection of her trying to wake me up;

- Early September I bought a so-called Clocky, an alarm clock that makes an obnoxiously loud noise and rolls away when it goes off. It had been succesfull a few times, but it has happened more often that I woke up a with the Clocky rolling over my floor, making the obnoxious sound. Just like with my mother flipping on my light or pouring water on me, I sometimes wake up just enough to notice the lights are on or that my head is a bit wet and gross, but it usually takes another 10 minutes to sometimes 2 hours to finally have enough strength and energy to get up and do someting about it/finally start my day.
My mother, who still comes into my room regularly in attempts to wake me up, has asked how the Hell I manage to sleep through my Clocky. My mother has compared my problems with waking up to those of my two older brothers but noted that she has never caught me up and awake past 2230, not even for a midnight toilet break, and I have definately become much, much harder to wake than any of my brothers have ever been.

- I visited the doctor to have blood tests done among other things. The doctor noted that I quite often have (mild) fevers (between 99.9 to 102 F) when I came to see him in the past two years and that I seem to have some symptoms relating to my low blood pressure (usually around 90/55 mmHg) including frequently feeling dizzy and sleepy. He suggested drinking regularly, drinking at least one cup of coffee and some, but not too vigorous amount or intensity of exercise. The blood tests I have done so far indicate that according to the doctor I am in 'extreme good health'. I am far from having vitamin deficiencies, blood tests also indicate no abnormal organ functions, a very high amount of hemoglobin, no infections, nothing to indicate that there's something physically very wrong with me.


I feel a bit awful to say this, I feel like a hypochondriac for saying this, but I am actually disappointed that there's probably no physical problem here, because that seems easier to identify and treat than a psychological problem. I also wouldn't know where to start tackling my sleeping problem if the cause is not a physical one. I'm relatively comfortable, motivated and happy in my internship and my courses, I actually fear that my inability to be properly energised and come in on time, will ultimately lead to me being strapped from the few responsibilities I actually have right now.


So dear doctors of Reddit, what do you think my next step should be? Do you have any tips for extremely heavy sleepers? Is there something in my attitude, my psychological functioning or even my body that I missed and could well explain my sudden loss of energy?

Thank you very much for reading."
73v3yi,276,2017-10-02,Legal action? &lt;Release&gt;,Urashk,talesfromcallcenters,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/73v3yi/legal_action_release/,"As per u/Sigilus request, I have a story about the first time I ever put on a headset. Ever.

TL;DR: Threaten to sue, performance ensues. Newbie watches.

Cast your mind back to the dim, dark age of 2005 (Shut up. It's a long time for me.) I was working retail ""hardware"" at a large Candian chain store (I'm still finding the ""money"" around the house), when I saw an advertisment in the local paper, for inbound call centre agents, at $3 over minimum wage. Grade 12 and police check required, but that's it. I had just been refused a promotion to department manager (probably correctly, but it was still a factor), so I thought ""What the hey?"", and dropped off my resume. The *next day* I got a call from the HR recruiter's intern, for an interview and test. No alarm bells, they were in a hiring frenzy due to expansion. Hence the intern making the call. (Legitimate intern - 1 or 2 week ""work experience"" as part of a business or HR diploma from the local college). For anybody tracking my career via Reddit, this was an outsource contractor for US cell carrier $Pink, in their ""credit-challenged"" queue.

So I go in, and (as far as I can tell) I waltz through the computer test (simulated call, multiple choice test). Then the regular interview (with the intern. O_o ) Then on to the most interesting portion; the call floor. I sit down next to, with hindsight, a veteran call centre agent. I could tell by the nicotine stains on his right index finger and thumb. By the dead eyes that stared at the screen. The monsyllabic grunt and hand wave that passed for ""yes"" when the HR intern asked ""Can I place this applicant with you?"" The multiple, empty, energy drink cans.

I settle into the chair, and gingerly place the headset on my ears, for the very first time. 

**Beep!**

&gt; $John (in a peppy voice, completely at odds with his expression): Thank you for calling $Pink, my name is $John. How can I help you today.

&gt; Angry Lady: Y'all have cut ma phone off! Cut it back on! Naow!

(Sorry for the spelling, but that is as close as I can force myself to writing out her words phonetically. I won't torture you any more.)

&gt; $John (still peppy): I'm sorry to hear that. Let me see what I can do to help. :) 

Account verification ensues. The weirdness of the peppy voice coming from this dead-eyed automaton was starting to creep me out. Put alongside the obvious anger of the customer, I didn't know what to think.

&gt; $John (*still peppy*): So I can see you have exceeded your minutes, and reached your account balance. At this point, a payment of $XX is required to turn your service back on.

&gt; $AL: WHAT?? ~~Ah've payed ma be-ill~~ I've paid my bill! You need to cut my phone back on! I could have a family emergency!

&gt; $John (**still peppy**): Is there a family emergency?

&gt; $AL: I don't know! I CAN'T USE my PHONE!

&gt; $John (yep...still peppy): Well then, we just need a payment of $XX to restore your service.

&gt; $AL: ~~Yew know whut?~~ You know what? I'm going to get my cousin, who's a lawyer, to sue you!

&lt;Snap&gt;

I practically heard $John's entire personality change, without him saying a word. His posture straightened, his eyes became bright and alert, and a genuine smile spread across his face. As his right hand elegantly extended towards the release button on the phone, like the CanadaArm controlled by a retired Prima Ballerina with OCD, his next words were uttered with such passion and conviction, that Sir Lawrence Olivier would retire in shame, Robert de Niro would become a pasta chef, and Tom Cruise would join the Church of Scientology.

&gt; $John (utterly serious, even reverent): Ma'am. As you have decided to pursue legal action regarding this matter, I have no option but to terminate this call, and direct your representation to our legal department at 123 Fake St, Springfield, State, Zip code. All future discussion of this matter will be via written correspondence only, and I have noted your account as such. Thank you for being a valued customer of $Pink, and I hope you have a blessed day.

Such was his control, that as the last word ""day"" escaped his lips, his finger made contact with the release button, and gently, yet firmly, pushed it.

&lt;Click&gt;

$John slumped back in his chair, practically the pictorial definition of post-orgasmic bliss. He turned to me, and noted my wide-eyed expression.

""That, my friend, is how it is done."" 

He turned back to the computer, and added his notes to the caller's account.

""Cx disputing pymnt to restore. Legal action threatened. Legal Dept info provided and call released as per article AA-23""

Save. Exit.

Deep sigh. Auto-in.

I still took the job."
73vgzk,4,2017-10-02,"Brother is 27, but with the disposition of a 7 year old.",OrbitalMarx,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/73vgzk/brother_is_27_but_with_the_disposition_of_a_7/,"I have an older brother who's now 27, and after he graduated college he has always lived with my mom (about 5 years now). He has never lived on his own, and doesn't help my mom with the mortgage payment, do chores around the house, help with the car payment for the car she gave him, or even help with the cell phone bill. He doesn't have plans at all to move out, and has never held a job (all of them manual labor) for more than 4 weeks without getting fired. His last job he 'think he got fired, but never followed up' because he just simply stopped showing up and didn't communicate with his managers on why. He also would frequently complain about his coworkers, looking down on them because they didn't have a college degree. He would devise petty plans to sabotage them, like mess up their timing cards for their shifts and talk nonstop about how everyone hates him, blaming his unhappiness on them. This pattern repeats for almost every job he has, and he claims that he can't stay in any job because 'everyone is out to get me'. Personally, I wonder how every single coworker he meets is out to get him, or if really he's the one at fault. 

In addition, he also has never helped around the house. When I come home from college, I help cook/clean/mow the lawn, and my mom is astonished because she isn't used to having someone else help her. He refuses to help, but then gets angry when my mom or I don't cook meals for him. He complains to me that my mom stopped cooking for him when I left for college, and now he eats smoothies and protein shakes every day, never bothering to wash his own dishes.

He now mostly spends his time on his phone indoors. He also fussed for my mom to buy a laptop for him, which he only uses to browse reddit or watch dumb videos. He currently has no job and no social skills, and is extremely prideful and rude. I made food for him the other day, and he responded with 'you think I want that shit? fuck you' when I offered. There were leftovers the next day, which I was going to eat, but took the bowl of food away after saying 'you think someone would just leave a bowl of food for you? How much of it did you eat already?' 
I also think he has Munchausen's syndrome- where he constantly thinks he is dramatically sick in some way. Recently, he thinks he has needed surgery on his shoulder, surgery on his forearms, thinks he hurt his eardrum, and injured his back and can’t walk. All of these ended up not being anything, and every time I come home from college it’s something different. Any money he gets he spends on expensive tests and MRI scans, racking up bills and debts he cannot pay off. He goes to the gym every day and is a lot healthier than the average person, so none of these illnesses make sense to have if he’s able to swim a mile a day and squat 250 lbs (I’ve been to the gym with him). 

It's not like he wasn't raised right- My mom raised us the same way, I attend a prestigious university on almost a full scholarship for engineering, and secured an internship in NYC. I actively work on my own to I try to get anything I want in life, be humble and listen to people as much as I can. My mother is kind and generous, and I learned everything in life from her. I don't understand how he turned into such an asshole, and it’s not like he grew up depraved and without human contact.

Anyway, I could go on and on about how he’s entitled and piece of shit. He's a total loser and lets his pride get in the way of everything, and me and my mother can't take it any longer. Speaking to him is like walking on eggshells- if he hears something he doesn’t like he will shut down and forever be resistant to that idea in the future. He just needs so much to be corrected with himself that I don’t know how to help him.

*Where is this fucking bitch?*

I angrily tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves. For a moment I’m reminded of some Asian girl whose name I’d already forgotten. She was prettier when she cried.

I sigh loudly – more of a grunt – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns there any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the name **Front desk** shows up first, followed by a simple message: *maid on the way up*

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of the building is familiar to me. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

I'm not in trouble with my finances, yet. What I'm having trouble with is finding an internship for this upcoming summer. I know it's far away, but the hunting season is already underway here at my campus.

I'm a Junior Finance major at a Big Ten school and I have a strong GPA (3.68). However, I'm lacking experience. My previous work experience is in a kitchen. I wasn't in our business school this time last year so it was difficult getting any hits for an internship.

I have gotten about 35 No's. and 2 interviews. One interview at a purely commission job doing work that just makes me feel bad. The other at a failing company.

Does anyone have tips on how I can spruce up my resume? Or what to say to recruiters? We have a big career fair on Thursday, and I'm really hoping to land something there.

TL;DR junior finance major with a good GPA but I'm struggle trying to ""woo"" prospective employers since I have no experience.

**Part 5**

The waning summer heat of August still carried well into the evening, sticking to the dusty cobblestone of the London streets even after the sun had left the sky. A breath of chilly autumn air swept in over the rooftops, riding the updraft into the city’s heart. People shuddered and closed their windows. Some pulled their blankets tighter; others put a log in the fireplace for the first time in months. 

Hortensia, orchid, and amaranth perfumed the garden air with their sickly sweetness. A candle burned in the window on the upper floor of the massive villa. Alucard felt like a moth, helplessly reeled-in by the light. Jonathan Harker had told him about his fiancé’s best friend, but he had to see the golden hair, lean frame, and pale unblemished skin for himself. Desire had brought him out of his castle in Transylvania and taken him across Europe. He was far from his native land, but it felt like he had come home.

He whispered her name, and the breeze lifted his words to the windowsill and into the house, filling the sleeping mind of the girl on the bed. The midnight cape fluttered behind him as he stepped off the grass and floated upward, following her name on the gentle wind.

The girl in the bed shifted in her sleep, agitatedly throwing the bed sheets off her hot body. The summer night sweat caused the thin garment of her nightgown to cling to her back, outlining the crease of her dainty neck and the tender valley of her spine. Alucard’s fingers twitched, he could probably fit his hands around that tiny waist. Dizzy with hunger and lust, he stared at the spotless white skin of her arm and the bloodred nails on her fingers. Then girl flipped over and blonde hair pooled around her angelical face like a Gloria. 

That fool, Harker, was a rotten storyteller who hadn’t at all been able to capture the true beauty of the young lady with his rudimentary descriptions.

“Lucy Westenra.” The name warmed his tongue like the blood from a freshly opened vein. “I’ll return for you, my dear. We shall dance together in the moonlight. I’ll set you free.”

***

The hinges of the coffin whined. Alucard sat up, soil tumbling off his chest. He hadn’t dreamt about Lucy in a long time, and the fresh memories tickled that old urge. 
He stepped out of the coffin, spilling earth over the concrete floor. 

The bottommost level of the hospital had been intended as a second morgue, but after the renovation in the 80s the entire floor had been put out of commission and sealed off. It wasn’t as cozy as a crypt by any standard, but it had that clingy dampness that he liked, and it served his needs just like the plastic bags in the refrigerator.
 
After a quick shower, he picked out a clean white coat from the rack and watched the timer on the microwave tick down. It pinged, and he bit into the bag, feeling the sweet taste of iron on his tongue. He drained it in seconds still feeling a hollow emptiness within. He was a lot hungrier than usual. With a growl, he tossed the bag into the trash and slipped out of the abandoned basement. It didn’t at all compare to the real thing.

“Good evening, Doctor!” said Nurse Beatrice as he swept by the reception desk.

He ignored her. He was in a foul mood. 

During his rounds, he noticed that intern, Jonathan, clumsily trying to stick a needle into the arm of a female patient. The woman wore an expression of pain and disbelief on her face, as she was repeatedly stabbed by the needle.

“Out of the way,” the doctor snarled and snatched the syringe away from the intern.

Blood dotted the fold of the patient’s arm where the needle had pricked her skin. He quickly found a vein and finished the procedure. Jonathan looked at him, with his eyebrows pulled up in surprise. Alucard thought he could see a hint of amusement too, playing in the corner of the boy's mouth.

“Sorry, I’ve never been good at that,” he said.

The doctor was just about to scold him for his incompetence when he felt a certain smell coming from the parking lot outside. He took a big whiff, and his face grew darker. He stomped out of the hospital into the icy autumn night. 

The smell instantly intensified – fresh soil and Violet de Sicile. It was a scent that he knew all too well and that definitely didn't belong here.

Unable to contain his anger, his feet left the ground, and he sailed across the parking lot, his white coat beating behind him like bizarre wings. His gleaming red eyes picked up movement between the trees of the dark forest. He knew he had felt someone watching him the other night.

73xzsx,1,2017-10-02,Got rejected By a Company,drArtem3s,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/73xzsx/got_rejected_by_a_company/,"Not going to name names, and trying not to sound to entitled here. So I am a college student seeking a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. I started doing electronics and programming as a teanager, and have since padded up my resume by going to a prestigious school, getting big name internships, and doing a bunch of random personal projects, hackathons, research, whatever. Anyways the point is usually if I submit a job application I get an interview (and usually an offer), and am generally a people person when it comes to a professional environment so recruiters like me. 

There is this company for which I submitted a resume last winter. I submitted the application late one night. Literally at 9 am the next morning I had an email asking for an interview. It kept getting delayed both on their end and my end, and I just happened to be going into what was to become my most severe manic episode to date. I ended up hospitalized, and lost access to email. I managed to convince my social worker to use my phones a few days to keep coordinating with potential employers (I also had another offer from a company and was going through the team matching phase). For some stupid reason I decided to stop postponing the interview and to just have it in the hospital (or maybe I thought I would be home by then, idk wtf I was thinking). Obviously it didn't go well, as my brain was fried and I was doing a coding question on a social worker's desktop with my phone on speaker and the social worker in the room. 

Fast forward to this semseter and career fair. I decide to reach out to the recruiter I was working with last winter and explained that there were extenuating circumstances, that I had been a patient in a hospital at the time the interview took place. She told me I should just apply online, so I did. I applied for the same position I applied for the previous semester, with the only difference in my qualifications/resume being that I had taken another course in my department, had a successful internship at a big tech company, and had obtained a really good research position. I promptly got a rejection email. Fuck them, I'll go work for a competitor. 

Am I being unreasonable or are they discriminating though? Like if I was good enough last time, now I'm better, how could they deny me an interview?

Any similar experiences?"
73y6ym,1,2017-10-03,My girlfriend [23/F] was my first sexual partner but I [23/M] wasn´t hers. I feel i may need more sexual experience. To add things up we are in a long distance relationship. Please i need some advice,Redditor12341,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/73y6ym/my_girlfriend_23f_was_my_first_sexual_partner_but/,"I [23/M] have been with my girlfriend [23/F] for two years. We met at college during her semester exchange program. Since then we have traveled to see each other. In total we have been 1 year in the same place and 1 year in a ldr. She is from Europe and i am from South America so it is more difficult to see each other regularly. When she came for her exchange program we became closer and we had sex and that was my first time but for her it wasn't since before that she had two other boyfriends. I know as well when we were just becoming friends she had sex with another guy that i knew from high school but i really didn’t like him at all. I know she was single for one year between her boyfriends so i assume she at least had another sexual partner.
What bothers me is:
- I don’t think it is fair that she has had the opportunity to experience sex with other people and i will never be able to.
- I hate the fact she had a one night stand with that guy from high school particularly 
- It hurts me and makes me feel bad imaging her having sex with others. I feel like she isn't as pure as me when we compare each other. (I never wanted to be a virgin until marriage that’s why it makes me uncomfortable when I compare myself to her). 

It is way more difficult for me to be in a ldr than it is for her. She always wants to chat and be as close as possible but for me sometimes all of that becomes annoying. 
How bad is it to start an open relationship or take a break now that we are apart and be back to a monogamous when we are together. I feel that by experience having sex with others I won’t have this sexual frustration that i feel now. 
It is difficult for me to judge since a part in me wants to experience sex with other girls but I know that would probably hurt my girlfriend. I am afraid she wouldn’t want me back after.  
At the beginning all of this didn't bother me but it began to hurt me later when I began to love her more and see a future together.  I am really happy when I am with her and we are always planning to be together. I am even planning on going to do an internship and a master close to her so i could be with her. She loves me a lot and I am sure she is capable of leaving her country and coming to mine in order to marry and be together.  
I feel bad having this thoughts knowing how much she loves me and what she is willing to do for me. The problem is that when I have this thoughts I don’t want to talk to her and I reject her in different ways and I know that hurts her. 
I have told her all of this and she feels guilty and worried this is something that could ruin our relationship. She always tells me she loves and cares for me and she really wants that i get over this. 
I come to you for some advice, similiar experience or opinión.  I really appreciate your answer.

Not a native speaker. And I am using a throwaway account.


I have been interested in hedge fund since elementary school (I once saw the foreign exchange rate fluctuating at a bank that made me wonder why don't people make money from the fluctuating exchange rate until I learned Hedge Fund).


Right now, I am enrolled at Carleton College (a top 10 liberal arts college, but not a target for any hedge fund in any way) as a math major.
My goal is to work as a Quant at a Hedge Fund in the future.
Since there is no HF recruiting event at my school and my school career center does not offer much on HF, what should I do to start finding internship?
I have looked at the big HF website and on most of the websites, I couldn't find where to start applying for a quant intern in the summer of 2018.
One of my weakness is I only start taking CS class (Python) this term and JAVA next term, as I know CS knowledge is very needed as a quant. I am not sure I can even get a quant intern since I am not very experienced with programming.
If applying to a quant intern is not the option, what should I do in the summer of 2018 to increase my chance of getting a quant intern in the summer of 2019?
I basically don't know what to do and where to start to help me set up a quant career, but I am EAGER to do things to make it happen!

73zh8h,9,2017-10-03,"I [22F] find it difficult to get along with and relate to my boss [50M] and colleagues, how can I improve this in the future?",poorgirl1123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73zh8h/i_22f_find_it_difficult_to_get_along_with_and/,"I took on an engineering internship not too long ago [2 months] and I feel that my boss doesn't really like me. Why I feel that way is that there is another intern [21F] who works with me and we started working at the same time but I can feel a difference in treatment. My boss would choose to interact with the other intern more and even if I was in the conversation and tried to contribute and ask a question, I would be ignored.

I don't think that my boss really dislikes me but I feel that his preferential treatment is due to the fact that we don't have much in common to talk about and it's mainly due to culture and social class. When he talks to the other intern, they would talk about holiday houses/areas, driving experiences of expensive cars e.g. BMWs and alcohol. I can relate to none of that. I came from a rather poor household with not much to spare and I don't even drink. I guess it could also be that the other intern has a way with words, she's also very animated when she talks - this is something I can't bring myself to do because, not saying she is, but I will feel fake. 

I do get along with some colleagues more than others but these are noticeably Asian (the same as I am) and more quiet/toned down. I was born in the country I am working in now, so it's not to say that I am completely Asian but I don't identify as strongly with Western values as a Caucasian would. I have questioned if it was a matter of my attitude, like I'm a complete asshole or something but this is not my first job albeit not in an engineering environment and I've never had a problem like this before. No one has complained about my personality and I go out of my way to help where I can and I complete my own work. At most, I am not as socially smooth as others.

Anyway, the internship is going to end soon, and I don't think this is a place I am suited to stay in. Now, I have another role lined up but I had a look at the team I would be working with and I know some of these people (our field is quite small) and they're all Caucasians who have a bit of money. I am afraid that the same thing will be repeated in my new workplace which I'm really looking forward to working in. Any advice to avoid this from happening? 

Thanks for reading!

**TL;DR;** : I don't get along very well with my boss and some colleagues because I can't relate to the topics they talk about. They talk about things I wouldn't have a clue about which stem from the difference in our social class and culture. I'm going to start a new job soon and am afraid the same thing will happen, how do I avoid or minimise this from happening?"

Back in May, they even promoted me to a student supervisor position. However...today, I'm quitting. As much as I used to love my job, I just can't handle it anymore. Lately, the people (who used to be my favorite part) have been awful and mean. Some of them talk about me behind my back and I feel uncomfortable. 

It's a part-time job at 25 hours but I feel like all I do is work. My grades starting slipping right before I got the job because I entered the depressive episode I'm still in now. However, I have not been able to bring them back. This is partially just my fault but having to work almost every single day makes it hard to have energy leftover for my schoolwork. 

I have other jobs lined up. Some of the public libraries are hiring and have contacted me. I have an interview for a paid internship tomorrow. I've applied to a few other positions. It's not the working...it's the work environment, the high hours, and very low pay. If I was going to stress this much, I would like to at least make $10 an hour ffs. 


My thing is...am I wrong? My boyfriend has listened to me through all this and is supportive. He has a salaried job and has promised that he'll help me out if I need it. I just feel like I can't talk to anyone else. 


The worst part is that I just can't put in a 2 weeks notice. I know even here people will berate me and say I should. I know I should but...I can't bear to push through another 2 weeks there. I just need a break even if it's a week. If I have to go back to the job, I feel like I'll have a breakdown. 

Am I wrong for this? Is it okay to leave a job based on the toll it's taking on your mental health? "

I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my floating around sipping your drinks](http://www.clearwatercolumbus.com/two-women-pool-float.jpg). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later. The sun is still out but it is time I head back in to the house. I grab my towel and head for the back door...
______________________________________
I will let you decide what happens from there. Do I walk in on you and my mom going at it? Do you go back home and invite me over? Do you spend the night and find a way to sneak to my room/somewhere else in the house? Do we include my mom as well? (if you cannot tell, a kink of mine is definitely incest). We could both play the role of her and direct her based on whose turn it is. You can determine your age in the RP, add more back story to your character, and make any other changes you like.

I went to Ohio, then to Seattle, then down to Florida. When I was in Florida..."" etc.)

I cannot stop it, and the only way it really stops is if my body gets tired enough that it falls asleep. Maybe 3 times a week I actually end up sleeping a solid 4 hours, but the rest of the time I just wake up 3 hours later and it feels as if someone has just turned on a television in my brain and the volume is at maximum volume. 

It's just random, meaningless thoughts or catchy songs i've heard on the radio earlier in the day.

Yesterday I had 3 hours of sleep, and this morning i've had 2. I feel light headed and I have classes all day and my internship. I feel like guzzling vats of coffee but am afraid it's going to sabotage any attempt on trying to go to sleep tonight. I've tried meditation, but my mind does not shut up. People tell me to turn off the screens before going to bed, to try to relax, and clear my mind but it is impossible for me. My brain just doesn't stop. 

Melatonin has never worked, and i've tried all kinds of brands and amounts. Its come to a point where I feel like I need Ambien or some kind of medication, but i'm afraid i'll become dependent on that and then i'll really never be able to naturally fall asleep.

Today I don't have any advice or words of wisdom. I'd just like to share some of my story with this community. Thank you for all your help along the way. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Betting on love*

I fell in love my last semester of college. That summer was the most exciting summer of my life. I spent weeknights talking to her for hours and weekends getting drunk with her and my best friend. We baked cakes together and ate them by ourselves. We spent entire days at cafes, drinking cup after cup of coffee, not noticing the hours slipping past. 

Only three months later, and I was all in. It was my first true love, and I had fallen fast and hard. But our relationship already had an expiration date: I was enrolled in graduate school for the fall. I tried to come to terms with that, but when the end of August arrived, I wasn't ready to let go.

I remember hugging her goodbye for the last time before I moved out. She was crying. As I drove away, tears came to my eyes, too. I wasn't ready to let go, and neither was she. We decided to go long-distance. 

I went to school. I spent my time in class dreaming about the weekends. I spent my weekends driving back to her. Three and a half hours each way. We cherished the weekends. Nights partying and days walking the campus, hand in hand. I don't remember how hard it was. It felt like the only thing to do. 

After one semester, I quit school. I wanted to be near her. I didn't care about school. I'm not sure if I even gave it a chance. 

We lived in the same house for the next two years. My first instinct is to write that things were perfect. But they weren't perfect. We fought. We argued. It was difficult to balance my work life with her college life. But we got through it together.

She spent summers away in Washington, at an internship. I wanted the best for her career, but I was also lonely. 

She got a job in Virginia, so we moved. I worked one hour away. Her commute was worse because my hours were flexible and hers weren't. We moved closer to her work. 

We didn't have as much time together in the evenings, so I started doing more of the chores. I did the shopping alone. I did the cleaning alone. 

I soothed her when she got upset. When she wasn't happy with work. When she wanted more friends. When she messed up. I took the burden of her emotions willingly. And if I couldn't share my emotions, it was because I needed to be the strong one. 

I was struggling, too. 

She spent more hours at work. She was making friends there, and I wanted her to. I thought it would help her adjust. So I didn't complain. 

I bet on love. When something went wrong, I doubled down. I put in more effort. More communication. I could always do more. I didn't ask for much in return. Eventually, I asked for nothing.

She broke up with me after five years. To be with her coworker. Is that relevant? I'm not sure anymore. 

I bet on love. I lost. 

I think a lot. What are the odds of a winning bet? I don't know. But I think I was close. 

I found a new home. New job. New friends. I found my hobbies again. I found myself again. 

I would do it all over again.

I bet on love. I always will. It's the only way to win.

I think I won.

A Riviera Beach resident tried requesting documents related to the firing of the city's top bureaucrat. But when he went to city hall to pick them up, a clerk said the city attorney's office blocked the request. City Manager Johnathan Evans wanted to know why Councilwoman Lynne Hubbard spent taxpayer money to pave a private driveway.

CityPlace's developer [failed](http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/analysis-what-tipped-vote-reject-story-waterfront-office-tower/v1ED9Ou9dZ8VAJ6IcHNeaM/) to get approval to build a 25-story office skyscraper last month. On Monday, West Palm Beach commissioners met to talk about how to let developers build bigger without angering neighboring residents, but did not mention the skyscraper. City planners are writing rules that would let developers build bigger in parts of Dixie Highway, Belvedere Road, Southern Boulevard, Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard and 45th Street. The catch: Builders would need to add cheaper housing, public parking, theaters, libraries or gardens to their projects. Building heights would also be restricted depending on if they are next to houses, condos or shops. The proposal could be voted on in five or six months.

A second Democrat has entered the Congressional race for the swing district currently held by freshman Republican Congressman Brian Mast. Lauren Baer, whose extended family owns Baer's Furniture store, would first need to beat Democrat Pam Keith in the primary next year. Mast's Democratic predecessor, Patrick Murphy, praised Baer while calling Keith negative. Murphy and Keith fought in last year's U.S. Senate primary. Murphy won that battle, but lost to Senator Marco Rubio in November. If Baer beats Mast, she would be the first Congresswoman in a same-sex marriage.

741wt2,1,2017-10-03,The Cover Letter Is Alive and Well. Here’s How To Write a Good One.,Q4QdiGHfk,paperwritingteam,https://www.reddit.com/r/paperwritingteam/comments/741wt2/the_cover_letter_is_alive_and_well_heres_how_to/,"As hard as we wish, the reality is that the cover letter is not going away. Although the debate rages on about how many employers take the time to read them – the consensus among career experts is that you should always include one. The key is to keep your cover letter short and targeted to each employer.

In a recent talk on Facebook Live, Director of Career Education and Innovation Alyssa Hammond shared her top tips for taking the pain out of writing a cover letter.

**1.Remember: This is a Business Letter**

Remember that a cover letter is not a personal letter. There are specific formatting guidelines for writing a cover letter. For example, the letter needs to include a date, your contact information, their contact information, etc. It needs to be set up properly. So the first thing you need to do is go to Google and type in, “What does a business letter look like?” Follow the set-up you find.

**2. State Your Business (in the first paragraph)**

The first paragraph of your letter might be all they read. It should have the most relevant info about why you are writing. It should include, who you are, what you want, and why. Here’s an example: “I’m a second-year student majoring in marketing at Bentley University and I’m writing to apply for a marketing analytics intern position for the summer.” Provide that clear information right away so they know what you’re applying for and why you’re the right candidate.

**3. Grab Their Attention**

Once you state your business, you need to grab their attention or else you lose them. The way to do this: show them what it is about this particular company and position that’s special to you. Answer the question: why do you want to work for them?

At Bentley, many students apply to the Big 4 accounting firms. Just saying you want to be at a Big 4 isn’t good enough. You need to be specific. For example, why do you want to be at Ernst &amp; Young? Tell them what attracts you to the company. You’ll need to do some research that goes beyond looking at the home page of their company website. Do some digging, find out what other companies, consumers and even employees are saying about them. Find out what makes them interesting to you. Google “Ernst and Young press releases” to see what the organization is saying about itself.

You don’t need a lot -- just a couple of sentences letting them know you took the time to learn something about the company besides the very obvious stuff.

**4. Draw the line.**

So your first paragraph is done and now you’re ready to tackle the body of the letter. The approach to this is what I call “drawing a line.” Take your resume and take the job posting and -- either in your mind or on paper -- draw lines between what the job posting asks for and what on your resume applies to it. That’s what you talk about in the body of your letter.

So if the job posting reveals the company is looking for interpersonal skills, see where you showcase this on your resume. Use the actual words – “I have interpersonal skills built by this experience which makes me a good candidate for this position”.

Do this for the top three or four qualifications or skills they are looking for and turn it into digestible paragraphs.

**5. End strong by being short and sweet.**

At this point, they have your contact info and they know how to reach you because this information is on your resume. Don’t waste space, or their time, with information in the cover letter about where to call you. You should wrap up by thanking them for their time and letting them know you hope to hear from them soon. Don’t say “I expect to hear from you soon” or “I look forward to interviewing.” End things on a gracious note.

I'm pretty sure I'll be okay for the application overall. I've got relevant work and internship experience, good grades from college a couple years ago, I currently work to help immigrants and refugees get healthcare, etc. I already sent an email to the PC office informing them of my mistake and also mentioning that I'm willing to serve anywhere in Asia, Central Asia, or the Pacific Islands (I studied, worked, and volunteered in 7 countries in Asia over the course of 2 years so that's just where I have the most knowledge / am of the most use), but I still really want to emphasize China. Any advice on how to move forward to make sure my application is written out the way I mean it to be without coming off as an indecisive selfish butt face?

I really want to move to NYC or LA someday to pursue my creative work. I’ve been to NYC a couple times, but with friends and I love it. Would love to go there on a solo trip, but wouldn’t know what to do, how to find out what to do, etc.
I definitely want to check out LA or San Francisco, but honestly wouldn’t know what to do there by myself when I get there. I mostly want to get the vibes from these cities, and see where I would want to live in the future by actually experiencing them. 

Any tips on Airbnb’s, cheap flights, finding things to do, etc. would be very much appreciated! 

Would also love to hear your guys’ personal experience when you wanted to experience an area before you actually moved there.

**Flying out of:** DC

**Budget:** ~$400

**When/For How long:** A random weekend during the semester for probably 3 days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

**Have you been to these places?**
*NYC:* A couple times with friends, but this is probably my main priority on where I want to move in the future
*LA:* Once when I was 9
*San Francisco:* Never

**Interests:** I am interested in Filmmaking, Music, and Technology. I am a Filmmaker and make a bunch of videos on youtube, have gotten a lot of hits online and possibly pursue as a career. I make music, which tie into the videos. And have a passion for technology, hence engineering student.

**Places to find/do**
I know in New York there is a lot, in such a small space. I really want to go to different areas and see the cost of living per location. Check out different spaces where creators and artists work. Different startup locations etc.

742t3j,6,2017-10-03,Marriage Based Immigration,Jubacka,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/742t3j/marriage_based_immigration/,"Hi everyone,

I graduated this August from an American university. I am enrolled in the OPT program and looking for a job. However, I only have a month left and I'm not very optimistic about my chances. I also have private student loans to start paying off in January, so an unpaid internship is not an option. I am left with two choices if I don't find a job by the end of my 90-day OPT period: move back to Europe and try to find a job there or marry my girlfriend of 5 years.

I have been looking at my options in Europe, and I have found that it would make more sense, financially and career-wise, for me and my girlfriend to stay in the states. My girlfriend is still a student and will graduate in May 2018. If I do move back to Europe we were planning to get married so that she would be able to stay and work there. We were also planning on eventually returning to the states anyway.

So our options are to either get married now, or June next year. If it makes more financial sense and would benefit both of us career-wise we would prefer to get married and stay here. However, we are nervous that our application for my green card might get rejected.

Do any of you have an advice pertaining to our situation? If we do get married, what chance is there that immigration services will reject my green card application?

edit: If we do get married, do we need to live together? Some websites state that you should have joint insurance and bank accounts. Can't find any mention of that on the official USCIS website."

74567o,3,2017-10-03,I've got skills and experience and I've tried and tried to get involved with local filmmaking but keep failing. Please advise!,wwwillyjam,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/74567o/ive_got_skills_and_experience_and_ive_tried_and/,"Hey people! I'm nearing the end of my rope here and am reaching out in hopes of help. I've got some real filmmaking skills as a DP, camera op, and editor/color/vfx artist. Over the years I've shot and edited around 200 music videos and short films etc. I made a music video that ended up on MTV at one point a few years ago. I've worked on award winning short films. I even have my own DJI gimbal!

I graduated with honors from the film program at the state college I attended but they've been no help at assisting me with finding work. I come from a family in poverty and worked my way through college, and basically the only way to land a job through the school's program is to take part in the fall and summer internships where students are sent to NYC and LA to work on film sets and meet industry people. Those programs cost upwards of $5,000 a month and I was not able to take part in them, so I feel left out in the cold. Several people I knew in college now work at companies like ILM and Sony, but no one has been helpful when I've reached out to them and most have ignored me completely, including people who won awards for their films that I was instrumental in creating. Basically, I have no network.

My problem is that I'm now very underemployed and as a result, living with family in a small town area in the deep south where the local film scene is sort of small and I don't know anyone at all. I've been trying for about 2 years now to get involved in the scene here and I just can't seem to make it happen AT ALL. 

There's a wide range of material being produced in nearby major cities including micro-budget to mid-level features. There are 2 local FB groups for filmmakers with around 3,000 people each (lots overlap of course.)  I've joined both and have tried many, many times to introduce myself, my work, my skills, etc. Every time I am met with nothing. I've offered to work for very little. I've offered to work for free. I've offered to show up and pull cables and fetch sandwiches for nothing. I've applied for every local/near local video and production job I can find, still nothing. 

I see other people posting links to objectively terrible amateur work and getting tons of feedback and offers for collaboration etc. I'm starting to feel like I'm going crazy or I don't actually even exist. It's so weird. It's just like... nobody wants to work with me, period. It's not like I have a bad reputation as nobody here even knows me. I see people post crew calls for all sorts of stuff and I respond all the time, but people won't even return my messages to say ""no thanks."" I feel like a ghost, haunting the land and unaware that he's already dead. 

I really just want to be doing SOMETHING as I have not shot or produced anything in a few years. I can't shoot shorts with my friends on weekends because I don't have any. I feel like I'm stagnating and accomplishing nothing at all and it's making me crazy. I've got a lot to offer if someone will give me a chance, but nobody seems to want to. My work is pro quality, which I know for a fact because I've worked as a pro for years in the past, so that's definitely not the problem. Honestly, my skills are on par with or better than 90% of everything local that I've seen. I'm not trying to be arrogant, that's just an honest objective assessment. I've contacted tons of local businesses about shooting commercials, testimonials, all sorts of things, but nobody is interested. I've responded to Craigslist ads seeking someone to shoot an event and never get an answer at all. I can't currently afford to leave this area and I can't seem to make money locally to try and save up to get out. 

I'd appreciate any advice at all and I welcome questions, discussion, and suggestions. Have you ever felt like this or experienced something similar? How did you get out of it? 


TL:DR - I've got tons of skills in the area of film and media and no way to apply them or profit from them. Please help."

Now for this idea, there are many different opportunities, of course there's the boss, coworker, intern, secretary ideas. But maybe give some love to the other guys, the janitors, warehouse employees, and whatever other jobs you could think of? I would be willing to take on more dominant roles like boss/manager, but I definitely play better when I'm sub. But, each to their own.

I would definitely call myself a sub, but, for the correct scene I would be more than willing to attempt a dominant role, although don't expect too much dominance from me haha. 

My kinks would be rough sex, anal, dirty talking, spanking, hair pulling, light biting, light slapping, risky sex/hold the moan, cheating, rimjobs, footplay, clothed sex, ageplay, interracial, larger men, cream pies, facials, being man handled and being bent over.

My limits being animals, rape, bondage (the whips and chains stuff doesn't do it for me), toiletplay, vomit, snuff, hard violence (slapping is as far as I'll go), slavery and gore. If it's not mentioned in this paragraph, feel free to suggest it, I'll more than likely be on board.

If I'm taking on the role of myself,I will happily give you a relatively detailed description of jolly old me if you'd like one? But I wouldn't mind one in return too?

Now for this idea, I'm totally up for it being a quick one and done, I understand that some people want to have a quick roleplay to blow their load before bed. But, I'm also more than willing for a slower paced, longer term roleplay. I like to think I can handle both of them pretty well with the correct partner.

As for characters, I'd love to have some of your pretences, and eventually come up with a character that is perfect for you.

So yeah, if you're interested in this kinda thing, please message me with either; a character description of who you'd like to play, a scene idea, some kinks, or just a general addition to the roleplay that we could incorporate? Thanks.

7463id,143,2017-10-04,Hey Guys: Just wanted to Share some General advice about the Match process that my wife went through last year,Chicken65,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/7463id/hey_guys_just_wanted_to_share_some_general_advice/,"My wife is a categorial resident (intern year) at an academic program for general surgery in the U.S. I worked extremely closely with her last year starting with the application process all the way through now as she copes with the rigors of her new life as a resident. I just wanted to share some general advice for anyone who needs some, as someone who just went through this whole cycle not too long ago. There are a LOT of things we both wish we knew that we know now. I used to religiously check the ERAS threads every hour this time last year, so I thought maybe I could share what I've learned in the past year:

1) If you have an ""average"" candidacy for your specialty according to Charting Outcomes (test scores, research, etc) then you will almost certainly get around the average number of interviews for your specialty. Do not fret. It's still extremely early in the process. At this point last year a fellow med school student of my wife had 5x more gen surg interviews than my wife, and that other student didn't even end up matching (due to some poor decisions on her part trying to go for ortho and gen surg at the same time). My wife applied for probably 90 general surgery programs and ended up getting more interviews than she could even go on (I would say she was an average candidate with above average LOR's from a below average big state med school). We took the pessimistic approach and overapplied. Doesn't really hurt anything except your wallet. I don't feel strongly one way or another if people should over apply, we took the stance that we'd rather spend a few grand now versus risk losing a year of her career in case she didn't match. In the end she matched at her #2 choice, but that program was definitely not the second most prestigious or competitive on her list of about 20 programs.

2) If there's a program you REALLY want to interview at because you did an away there or have some kind of connection (maybe you met someone from a program at a conference once), then you could email them and express your interest and possibly get an interview, but be warned that I don't know of anyone who matched at a place they got a courtesy interview from. I know people on this forum last year REALLY frowned upon doing this, my two cents are that it's a waste of time in terms of your chances of matching there,(if the interview you got was a courtesy and not earned) , but if it's your dream program then who can stop you.

3) This is probably my most important takeaway (and perhaps it's only true for gen surg): There appears to be no correlation between gut-feeling/your personal post-interview analysis of a program and how the program actually is once you get there. In other words, from the candidates perspective the interviews/socials are mostly useless in trying to get a feel for how the program really is. I was just hanging out with a bunch of gen surg interns and I asked them this point blank and they all agreed. One program my wife interviewed at last year which she absolutely fell in love with (the residents, the way the program was sold, the opportunities) ended up going on probation because those same residents wrote scathing reviews of their own program in the survey. We luckily found out a few days before rank lists were due and adjusted accordingly. People outright lie at those pre interview socials, I'm not sure why. Maybe they are afraid of retaliation, or maybe they are just too exhausted from their last shift to tell you the truth. The takeaway here is that you should put more emphasis on average resident scores and other data you can compare across all residencies. That's not to say that your gut feeling doesn't count for anything, just be very skeptical of what you hear!

4) Finally, make sure geographic location is an important part of your rank list. Your happiness and ability to be near family/friend resources is going to be so key to your survival in a residency. In my opinion, if program A is a hair more prestigious than program B, but program B is in your hometown or somewhere of some familiarity or significance to you, you should pick program B hands down. The variables that are affecting my wife's happiness so far have nothing to do with the attributes of the program , it's mostly the attitudes of the people she works with on any given day. You can't really screen for this in an interview or a social. Only a handful of residents show up to those anyway.

Anyways, those are the big things that came to mind. Feel free to ask a question in the comments and I'll give my two cents. Like I said, I was very involved in everything, I even had my wife's login for eras so I think I can answer most questions. Good luck everyone."
746l5n,3,2017-10-04,I feel like I fuck everything up and I feel like shit.,myfirstthrowaway823,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/746l5n/i_feel_like_i_fuck_everything_up_and_i_feel_like/,"So, this is a long story and I'm not even expecting anyone to read it, but I need to get everything in writing so here it goes. Sorry if it feels like I'm rambling or my english isn't very good. Not my first language and I'm a little drunk. Also, this is kind of a rant to myself so whatever.

I'm 24 years old, about to graduate college. I started 5 years ago a computer science career. I was a stereotype. Smart, a little lazy, socially awkward and a bit of a loser, no history with girls whatsoever, but with a good group of friends. So I start college in my home city, where I still live with my parents, most people here do, and everything is going fine. After a couple of years I start failing some classes, start losing interest and things like that. I was thinking of changing degrees but I thought I had already invested a lot of time and money on it so I might as well finish my degree. I keep failing classes but by an act of god I somehow got a summer intership at a major software company in the US (My country is south from there, you know what I mean). 

So this is an amazing opportunity and I'm getting paid a shit ton of money, even more compared to my peers. So naturally, being how I am, I fuck up the internship and don't get an offer for a job, which most people do. I was already planning my life based on that but it ended up fucking with me and I changed everything. The good thing is the recruiter told me I could apply again and I'd at least get an interview, a year later.

Next semester after this, I fail half my classes, I was thinking of going for a semester abroad but end up not doing it because of my failed classes, and I have to take another semester after summer to make up for everything. At this point I meet a girl. She is cool, funny, pretty, intelligent. She's amazing, and we start dating and very fast we end up hooking up. This was the first fuck up. Before sleeping together we had a talk and I told her I was a virgin and she told me she wasn't. I obviously didn't ask more but it kind of bummed me out a little. I know there's nothing wrong with it but still, it would have been nice if we had been each other's firsts. Anyway, one night after we were both very drunk and I thought this was the time to do it so we did it. It was extremely underwhelming since I was very drunk and she was too (we were both conscious and we had talked about it before) but still, not the best first time. After this we continued dating and we were boyfriend and girlfriend, everything was going great.

Now it's about to be summer and I have no plans. I have the money from the internship, I have 3 months free, and my gf was going to europe for a month for a summer class. Gues what I do? I decide to pay for a super expensive summer course in the states for a class I have no interest in a super expensive city just because it was near the place I had been last year because I thought that's what I had to do get back the job I thought I wanted. A friend from school told me he was going and I just thought it would be a good idea, I didn't even research what else I could do. After a couple of weeks I realized the mistake I made and got really depressed because I was wasting my money in a course I didn't want, in a city I didn't liked, living in an awful house, with people I didn't like. I could have been traveling in europe with my girlfriend, going to great places and spending way less money on everything, but I'm an idiot.

After the summer ended and I came back I realized I had been living my life all wrong, doing things because they were easy and because people would suggest them. Everything I have done was because someone told ""man this would be cool"" and I'd be like ""yeaaah"". Whenever I wanted to do something I'd need someone else to do it with me, or someone to organize and plan something and I'd tag along. I started to think what I really wanted and I got kind of tripped about what I'm doing with my life. This semester I decided to work on myself and I put some goals for myself, the main one was getting the job back. I got an interview with the company I did the internship, got to the final round, and fucked it up. This was my goal for more than a year and I just fucked up the interview. I just didn't study enough. Somehow ended up thinking that my girlfriend was holding me back because I didn't know what I want and I was confused about everything. After two months I haven't done shit for my goals. Still lazy, still the same.  And for whatever dumb reason, I broke up with my girlfriend. Also, a few weeks earlier I kind of broke contact with my friends because I realize I hate most of them. 

Here comes a weird part of the story. I went to a bar with some guys I know, and at the bar I lose them. So I'm wandering around and I talk to a girl and a guy starts fucking yelling at me that I shouldn't talk to her. So he starts getting in my face and I yell back at him shit, and suddenly he says ""oh shit, I know who you are! I recognize your ugly face. I fucked your girlfriend. I fucked your girlfriend! HAHAH"". It was fucking insane but I thought he was talking shit so I just said some shit to him and he hit me in the face, which I didn't respond to. After a couple of days I ask a guy who went with me to the bar who that guy was and it turns out he's my gf (or ex)'s ex. So that shit he yelled was true. Now I feel like such a fucking loser and I can't get that out of my head. It's awful.

So now I'm feeling like shit, living with my parents, graduating with a major I don't like after five years, without a job or money, very little experience working, without my friends, whithout my girlfriend who I now miss a lot, and without knowing what I want to do, and with the realization I'm a fucking pussy. A year ago I was on top of the world. I was about to make 100k in the best city in the world at a great company with awesome people, and I lost everything. Because I fuck everything up."
747wfh,3,2017-10-04,[M/26]Been together for 8 months with [F/25]. Going through some weird and its driving me crazy because i cant see what will happen.,Klrhrmnn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/747wfh/m26been_together_for_8_months_with_f25_going/,"With my GF i had an amazing 7 months and then a weird 3 weeks. We were extremely attached to each other and then i went on a 3 week holiday to my home country(we're both foreign students abroad). When i was away, she had a crush on a guy that, funnily enough, looked exactly like me physically. In any case, she dealt with him, removed him from her life(he was working in the same research group with her, she finished working there and left the group, deleted contact etc) but then hit me with "" we are not independant in this relationship anymore,at times i feel pressured by you, i want some time to stay single and figure out what i want, who i am. From what ive been reading on relationship forums, the usual from GF's. Except shes not interested at all in meeting new guys, shes extremely busy with her new internship and said it'll either be me or single for a really long time.

During this time, i also reflected a lot on myself and realized that before her, i was alone but not at all lonely and i had so much stuff to do, 24 hours a day wasnt enough for me, so much that in the first 3 months i'd push her away at times to be able spend time alone on my things. Then i realized towards the end i became a person who couldnt live without her, that i was extremely miserable alone and lost joy in nearly everything i liked to do alone before her.
So i opened up to her on this and we reached an agreement where we spend time together as usual, cooking, watching stuff, going to places except we never talk about relationship stuff for a while, we dont put any pressure onto each other and we see what we feel after some time. And then we proceded to cook together and watch a movie while being very intimate. And we talk and text through out the day as usual. We still see each other every other night as before.
One thing that occured to me on my part was that i went from ""i like you"" to ""i want you"" and then to ""i need you, cant be without you"". This 3rd stage I am not happy with and we talked if we can go back to ""I want you"" again, we'd call ourselves GF/BF again.
At the same time, i started training in the gym, starting going more hardcore on my cycling, picked up couple new hobbies like drawing and writing short stories and whenever i feel miserable i go out for a walk or cycling.

We are very good friends, romantic or not, we really enjoy doing stuff together and after everything i still see her as someone who i could spend my life with.

Thing is, at times i question myself about whether spending time and being intimate is an indication that we'll get back together or if shes just used to my care so she doesnt mind. If we can improve ourselves and get together again without being too needy of each other, i'd like that. I still have romantic feelings for her. Also staying just friends would be too painful for me. It's a weird dilemma. There are romantic feelings, but we turned into two people who couldnt be happy with their ownselves alone.

Also i'd like to add that in the 10months since we got to know each other and 8 months we were romantically involved, we never had a single argument that lasted more than 15minutes and wasnt solved by talking calmly. We never once yelled at each other, never said a one single bad word to each other. To me and to everyone who knew us, it seemed like we were a perfect couple, at least from the outside.

TLDR : We didnt like who we turned into in the relationship so decided to take a break to get back our individuality, as weird as that sounds. It's killing me that I cant see whether we'll improve and be happy together again.

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this."
74870p,92,2017-10-04,"After smoking everyday for the past 5 years, I've decided to give it up.",stswartz,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/74870p/after_smoking_everyday_for_the_past_5_years_ive/,"Hello, I'm new to r/Leaves. For the past 5 years I've smoked weed practically every day ranging from 2-10 times a day. I still love it of course, but after recently being denied life insurance due to it showing up from a doctor's visit, I've realized that I have to put my family first. Starting today I'm packing up all my paraphernalia and changing my life. 

With my wife and I trying to start a family, I have to give up my girl Mary Jane. It has affected us in the past as well. 5 years ago, before I started smoking regularly, I was discharged from the Army for a positive urinalysis. This was a huge event in our lives as I lost my income, and we moved back to our home town. It also put a big strain on our relationship and I think that is what hurt the most. The only thing that matters in this life is my family and those that care about me. All of my reliefs I get from weed will have to be put on hold for now.

Since getting out of the Army, I have worked pretty much the entire time and used fake urine to get a few jobs so it hasn't affected my employment negatively. I've also started on my BS in Construction Management and have an internship now with a construction company. If anything were to happen while I'm at work, it could seriously hurt our future. I also have done really well in school getting on the Dean's list one semester and President's another.

Weed has been a great companion to me. It helps me with my anxiety, it helps me with my chronic back pain, puts me in a better mood, and makes me better to be around. I realize this is not going to be a cakewalk for me since I love weed so much, but I know what has to be done so I've come here to have more of a support system.

Starting today, October 4, 2017,I am changing my life. Thank you for hearing my story and hopefully for the support to come."

749clg,2,2017-10-04,Is it usual to just not ever get a call or email back after an interview?,Bancroft97,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/749clg/is_it_usual_to_just_not_ever_get_a_call_or_email/,"Last year I had a 3.2 GPA with literally nothing else. Only got one interview out of the firms I applied. Got the internship. 

This year my GPA is a 3.36 (accounting GPA dropped a bit due to intermediate and me not being ready for the difficulty spike). I have experience at a public firm working in tax season now. 

Received interviews from 3 out of the 4 firms I applied. Decided to decline one because I could literally find no info on the company what so ever. 

The first interview I had with a decent size firm in my city (about 50 accountants) went great. They talked to me about for my experience, and based on the things they told me I would be working on and my current experience, it seemed as though I was overqualified. I felt 100% confident about that interview and knew I did the best I could do. They said they would get back to me in a week. It's been three and I haven't heard anything. I'm tempted to email them, though I feel that's probably pointless. 

The second firm I interviewed with a little over a week ago. This was a bigger firm. The interview was with the recruiter who asked me a bunch of just like general life stuff and values. I literally made myself seem like the most selfless and determined person I could (in an authentic way), and we got off topic and chatted for a while about each other's personal lives as well. Again, I felt this couldn't of gone any better. She told me she would get back to me in a week and a half. I made sure to send her a thank you email as well (I couldn't find a way to contact the other firm I interviewed with that wasn't just their general company email). I'ts been a week and a half. Sent them an email asking if I did or didnt get the internship. Raido silence.


I don't know if I just got these interviews to fill space in case more qualified candidates chose other firms. Makes me feel really disappointed. Also makes me wish I would of just been a man and gave up my Fridays for BAP. I should've also taken that other interview. 

Is it usual to just never hear back after an interview?"

I'd hope it's immediately clear that the bulk of this incident took place in May of my Senior year at high school. High school prom drama is definitely something I made an effort to shed going into college, so I haven't paid much mind to this until very recently. The GF in question and I broke up amicably shortly before the Semester started, even though I was staying in town to start school elsewhere in January. She started classes normally at a local campus, so we're still close by and I often frequent locations near her school. 


Two nights ago, my relatively new college girlfriend, ""Etta"", was working on her ASL language lab project with a few friends. Etta goes to the same school, but not the same campus as my old GF, ""Nina"". But through sheer chance, she found herself in a shared language lab with my ex. Terrific right? Things seemed to be going... o.k. until Monday night, when Etta get's a wall of text from Nina. The text said not to show me, she did anyways, but I'm not here to vocalize someone's pain so I'll summarize: basically it's a big warning that I'm secretly a huge asshole who will drop her from my life as soon as she becomes inconvenient. The entire rant is almost entirely founded on a single sad and hurtful betrayal (her words), our senior prom. 


So I was pretty alarmed. I was described as a predator and a manipulator, a tone I genuinely never thought existed between Nina and I. It's fair to assume people don't get mad about isolated incidents, and that this is a manifestation of behaviors I'm editing from my post. But I've never thought myself as that guy, and I've never had those traits attributed to me. So here's **my** wall of text of my as objective as possible retelling of my betrayal. This whole thing has me feeling sick, especially as someone who liked to think they were pretty introspective and considerate. Anyways, some feedback would be appreciated.


**What Happened**

As Prom 2017 approached I had made it pretty clear I didn't want to go. School dances make me miserable, and I offered to bring her on a huge romantic date elsewhere instead. She seemingly agreed, noting she already pushed me into going to homecoming (I had also not wanted to go, and after staying for ~half hour, she said I was right and we bailed). 

But as May grows closer, as well as the pre determined end of our relationship of 2 years, she has second thoughts. She approaches me, says she really wants me to go with her, and asks if I'm willing to suffer through it. Of course. No question. If it's really important to you, it's really important to me. 

So I'm feeling virtuous, and I plan an elaborate prom invitation. Decorations, home cooked picnic, a rouse put on by her family. A proper romantic gesture, she loves it. 

Fast forward to the actual month of May. My boss at my internship has strongly recommended me for a special assignment at one of our shows. A management position in Las Vegas. I would be flown down, put up, and given charge of a team of 8 people for a 20,000 person strong event. For an 18 yo this was huge. It's a little over a month from prom and it would 100% conflict with our plans.

I call Nina, tell her this opportunity is incredibly important to me. I was careful to ask her if she was ok with me doing this, and I offered to take her with me and stay an extra night. I had intended to make it into a really impressive night on the Strip. Her response was...not great. 2 hours of tears and yelling later, I decide to end my first relationship fight and promised we'd talk in the morning. 

The coming weeks didn't exactly change her mind, and she will intermittently well up with feelings of anger and betrayal. I'm extremely apologetic, retreating to ""this is an opportunity I can't let pass"" as my only defense. 

She ends up going with a good friend of hers and I start packing for my trip. *The morning of my United flight I get a call*. Apparently a legal dispute has erupted between the venue host and our company. Some disagreement about vendors had escalated into legal letters trying to shut down the show. Lawyers are involved, everything is canceled. 
I make it back to Midway, Chicago literally 4 hours before the event. 

I skip it, she has a great time, and we seem to be ok. It's defiantly a heated issue; I'm mad at her for not supporting me, and she's mad for well, obvious reasons. 

Truth be told, I started getting pretty angry with her towards the end. She almost refused to even ask me about the job which I was seriously invested in. And clearly she had some pretty intense animosity too. 

**Some mitigating circumstances:**
- She had already bought a dress, I felt terrible and offered to reimburse her. She later admitted she would have gone for it with our without me

- I had already made some significant personal sacrifices at my job to accommodate her, this would be the first real sacrifice i ever asked her to make for my benefit. 

- I had recently also bailed on a family event for the same internship. Similar in that I told her I would go, and then cancelled, but it was essentially a graduation party. I told her the next day that I neglected to check my schedule first. (She wasn't really angry that I missed it, but that I had indicated I could come)


So here we are. My stomach is in knots, mostly for having to put Etta through that, but I really wanted to get an outside perspective on all this. I hope I didn't ramble on, thanks for the input."

Now it's 3 years out of last 5 years of residency in Canada.

Also credit for time as a student or temporary resident counts now. Everyday spent counts as half day. Up to 365 days max.

https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2017/06/bill_c-6_receivesroyalassent0.html

So I already have 1 year done. Just need 2 more years to become a citizen.

I am so excited! I have been in Canada for 8 years now, really love this country and the opportunities it has provided me! Honestly, the day I become a citizen will be the happiest day of my life!


**EDIT: Hmmmm, why the down votes?**

**Another big EDIT:** 

Seems like people in this sub don't like immigrants ~~(when they themselves were 1st or 2nd generation immigrant)~~.
The requirements for my PR (which is a pre-requisite for citizenship) are pretty high.

I have been in Canada for 8 years already. It took me 5.5 years of school, 1 year full time work and then 1 year processing time to get my PR. After that, citizenship is another 2 years for me (3 for people who don't have temporary resident status or haven't spent time in Canada). The processing time for citizenship is 1 year.
So, in total, I am becoming a citizen after 11 years of being in Canada and doing all the regular duties as other locals have.

I needed to get 5.5  years of university education, a good tech job, clean background criminal check, good health for the medical test, sufficient funds, English proficiency test for reading, speaking, writing and listening, $13,000 in savings, $1500 for the PR application plus more in other legal fee etc. I paid my very high international tuition fee myself by working. I spent 6 years without seeing my family as I was too busy working to pay off the tuition instead of taking a summer vacation. I spent my Christmas, New Years and other days alone away from family because I needed to make money to support myself. I am not saying this to get pity, I am saying this to show that I have worked hard to get where I am and it’s not just getting handed over to me.
So they usually get the very cream of the crop people who help fill job vacancies, create more jobs by starting businesses, help the economy by buying consumer goods and pay taxes. Of course, there will always be a few bad ones but the same applies to the locals. I now run my own small business and if things go well, I might even employ students as interns. Why's it a bad thing to get qualified immigrants then? It's not like I am coming here to just get free education or free shit.

**One more EDIT:**

A few people pointed out the fallacy in my statement about ""when they themselves were 1st or 2nd generation immigrant"".
I apologize for that statement. I didn't mean it in a strict 1st or 2nd generation in just our own family tree. What I meant is that somehow along the lines of being in Canada (even if you are back to the aboriginals), I am sure your life has somehow been positively impacted by another immigrant. Be it in the form of jobs, different cuisines, different festivals and celebrations, your significant other, even simple things like help by a local cashier etc. As in, Canada was built by contributions from people of multiple cultures and countries.
I am sorry again for that statement, hope this clears what I really meant.

**There's some negative feedback on this sub but there's also a LOT MORE of lovely people who have sent their positive vibes and well wishes to me. I believe in working hard to support myself, in helping others and minding my own business on how others want to live.
Thank you very much for the support and I hope I can make some positive contribution in your lives as a Citizen.**"

I am teaching myself solidity/blockchain development with the hope of finding a job in this space. I've seen that one of the best routes to getting hired is contributing to projects and building your body of relevant work.  I am working on a Dapp with the engineering team of a blockchain startup.  They have agreed that after I make significant contributions, I can list myself as their intern.  

My question is how do I go about sharing my contributions to this project with potential employers.  The project uses a private BitBucket Repo and they do not want me to give anyone else access to code. I would be able to give a demo of the application and explain my contributions, but I've read that it may be better to share the specific code.  Is there a way to exhibit my contributions without giving out access to the repo? Any advice would be much appreciated, thanks! "

I was already leading a division in a giant tech firm, and could afford a one bedroom just for myself, with no roommates. I think it helped that I wasn't the standard desk jockey - I made sure I stayed in shape and kept myself groomed well enough to pick up a few female playmates while I enjoyed my late 20s.

Of course, then my sister had to ruin it all. She was wrapping up her freshmen year of college and despite dad hounding her about it, didn't have any jobs or internships lined up. My parents, in their infinite wisdom, suggested that she move in with me and try to network in the booming tech economy.

This was going to ruin everything. Now i'd have a roommate - but one who didn't pay rent. And it'd be harder to bring girls home. Plus she was probably expecting me to introduce her to people, which meant her tagging along to social events. I wasn't looking forward to it.

I mean, we were close when we were younger. She was young enough that we didn't have anything to fight about, and I knew she looked up to me. But I hadn't been home in a few years except for Christmas, and I even missed last year (gotta get that promotion). Part of me wondered if this was my mom's way of getting payback for that. 

When I went to pick her up from the airport, I almost didn't recognize her. She'd grown up in the last year. A lot. So much of the awkward teenager was gone. She waved, ran up, and jumped to give me a massive bear hug.

----------------------------------------------------

Pretty open ended! How does my sister look? How does she act? Can start slow, as we discover how much the other has grown. Maybe we step out to social occasions, maybe it's cramped in the apartment and we end up seeing more of each other than intended. Maybe you want to 'thank your big brother' right away, with some long-held-back fantasy.

Kinks: incest (obviously), dom/sub (bratty and/or submissive, both great), age play, giant cock, group sex (can RP multiple), breast augmentation. 
Limits: scat, blood, bestiality. "

**[Overhaul](https://imgur.com/7OXZAzp)**

Allies: [The Eight Precepts of Death](https://imgur.com/a/1CRN3)

***
# Background

Kai Chisaki aka Overhaul is the leader of the Eight Precepts of Death and primary antagonist of the internship arc of Boku no Hero Academia.  He is a remnant of a bygone age where the Yakuza of Japan used to reign supreme in the criminal underworld - a time that has passed with the rise of heroes. 

Overhaul thinks of heroics, altruism, and quirks(powers) in general as a disease. He is ruthless, willing to use his allies as resources or even shields to achieve his goals to the point where he uses his own daughter as a test subject to invent a quirk-erasing weapon. [Notably, he does not like to be touched.](https://imgur.com/a/yyuOT)

***

# Abilities

Overhaul is also the name of his primary ability which allows him to disassemble and reassemble anything he touches at will. This has a variety of uses and is naturally very versatile. He can...

* [Kill a person by touching them](https://imgur.com/a/XcvbN)
* [Remove all physical damage from a person](https://imgur.com/a/o2hkS)
* [Even bring the dead back to life](https://imgur.com/a/lQqu3) (provided he hasn't waited very long)
* He can also [manipulate the battlefield](https://imgur.com/a/am8E1) (note the targeted character in this scan, Mirio, can phase through solid matter)
* Or [fuse two people together](https://imgur.com/a/buOkb)

The quirk has drawbacks, however. He seems to have trouble controlling it, hence why he wears gloves normally and breaks out in a [rash](https://imgur.com/a/ctoVi) whenever he uses the ability.

***

# Speed/Reflexes

* Overhaul can react to and avoid [Mirio](https://imgur.com/a/rlHs1) and [here](https://imgur.com/a/xd5Io)
 * Mirio can evade [gunfire](https://imgur.com/a/D5c4o)
 * Defeated half of Class 1-A [""in the blink of an eye""](https://imgur.com/a/rrq9I) and he was fast enough that his opponents thought he had a [warping quirk](https://imgur.com/a/jQIMG)
 * and is faster than [Deku's reflexes](https://imgur.com/a/0BcO3)
* Overhaul can dodge [Nighteye's stamps](https://imgur.com/a/A6W73) which are [pretty fast](https://imgur.com/a/USn2V)

***

# Durability

Overhaul can take some punishment

* From [Mirio](https://imgur.com/a/GeTJV), and [again](https://imgur.com/a/aGgze), and [again](https://imgur.com/a/IRpWg)
* An angered [Deku punch](https://imgur.com/a/iypcw), bear in mind [Deku can shatter concrete in Full cowl](https://imgur.com/a/CKkl4)
* Getting bonked by [Magne](https://imgur.com/a/y8yYe)
* Blocking and Overhauling a [stone spike from Deku](https://imgur.com/a/cdrDr)

***
# Miscellaneous 

* [Always brings backup](https://imgur.com/a/hh8us)
* [His allies are willing to die for him](https://imgur.com/a/l4xez)
* [Killed one of his strongest henchmen 5 times](https://imgur.com/a/VmaHh)
* [His allies have a strong bond under him and won't turn on each other](https://imgur.com/a/ZV2La)

***

Here's a brief fight Overhaul took place in, for your viewing pleasure.

[Overhaul Vs. Nighteye](https://imgur.com/a/3moqN) the latter of which is a precog.

* ***Note***: This RT is incomplete, as of the time of this writing Overhaul is still active in the Manga and has yet to be defeated, so new feats may be added depending on how that goes."

I got a call about the internship I applied to at Best Buy. No interview scheduled yet because funnily enough I was at work! I called back and left a message.

Anyways, not the point of this post. I was wondering if anyone here had interned for Best Buy for computer science... Specifically this position.

How hard is the interview?  Do they have a coding challenge?  The description of the position is a little vague... What does it actually entail?

Thanks, blueberries!

I angrily tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves. For a moment I’m reminded of some Asian girl whose name I’d already forgotten. She was prettier when she cried.

I sigh loudly – more of a growl – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns there any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows **Front desk**. The message is brief: *maid on the way up*.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing when guests arrive is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

Yes, it's really National Hispanic Heritage month. So let's celebrate. Bonus points if you actually speak Spanish."

Improbably, I leave a foil somewhere in my parents house after spending a single night there. I am almost sure my father just made this up to bust me, since I was snorting, but it worked and I fessed up. Two years clean...poof. 

Finally stopped using on Monday after about two weeks of using all day every day. My previous record for continuous use was also two weeks, but I only used in the evenings back then. This was wake up, use, bathroom break, use, get home from work, use, etc etc so I was nervous I had pushed it too far and was going to finally get dope sick. So I stopped.

I won't pretend I went through anything like others have suffered, but I was rattling with the RLS and crawling skin. And the guilt! The shame! The horror, the horror...

Felt so bad I told my partner. I figured I'd get back on subs and she'd never have to know but my conscious got the better of me. Felt so bad, bringing this shit into her life. She's a good girl, never had anything to do with the seedy underbelly of society that we take for granted. So, naturally, she's horrified and I'm crushed and tell her I'm finished with the garbage and things are gonna change. 

She's only known the ""clean"" me, which is me on suboxone, but on subs my depression and anxiety and cravings are all totally gone. Finished college, got a great internship, found the love of my life, all these great things on subs, and I got off cuz I lost my fucking insurance.

 So I go crazy fast and whip together insurance and find a sub clinic AND get an appointment for later this week. I *really* want to get back on subs because as far as I'm concerned, they're the miracle drug. Cured my depression and anhedonia and the only side effect was constipation. The no cravings is just a bonus. 

Anyways.. 

Gonna have to decide whether to get high tomorrow or dump a gram of fire #3 from the darknet down the toilet. So fucking difficult. I've been wanting to try smoking #3 for years and finally have the opportunity. It was supposed to arrive on Monday and if it did I'd still be going strong. But now it's gonna arrive tomorrow, when I'm home alone after I was given the day off for basically no reason. It was going to be my last huzzah, but the gears ground to a halt too soon. 

So yeah. I'm dumping this shit 100% on my own. 

Edit: tried a tiny 3 gram dose of kratom and my stomach is fucked up good. Slowly drinking enough rum to melt away the pain (I usually hate drinking these days but now all I can think about my boy /u/OldDirtyBurton even if I wish he wouldn't talk about drinking gross, nasty alcoLOL all day....

God I loved alcohol, and it was easy to quit because of how bad the withdrawal was...I only needed to hallucinate once (or twice....probably twice) before I learned my lesson). Opiate are too sly"
74ckky,7,2017-10-04,I still can’t shake the terrible feelings from TSCC,MilkKartonKid,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/74ckky/i_still_cant_shake_the_terrible_feelings_from_tscc/,"I grew up in a very devoted, large Mormon family. Parents have always held higher positions in the church, and everywhere I went people knew my family because of it. Since I was a teenager I started to have short spurts of depression, where I could mentally overcome it, but on the days it hit hard they are really hard. 

I was not always the greatest member in my teen years. Never did anything too terrible, but I was a sexual kid and even though I never went all the way, I still felt terrible every Sunday sitting in church thinking about how I was worse than everyone else there.  Anytime anything went wrong in my life I felt as if I deserved it and was to blame for stuff completely out of my control.

Then I went on my mission, where I served honorably, but still messed up with mission rules every now and then. My second mission president found out about some of those things 2 months before I was supposed to go home and chewed me out, asked me how I could be a zone leader when I was making these decisions. Made it seem like success in my zone could be blamed on my unrighteousness.

Go to BYU. Continue being a normal sexual human, feel like shot all the time and worry I will get get kicked out if the school knows. Miss out on major internships and career possibilities towards the end and feel like it is because of my unrighteousness.

Fast forward to this year. Go between a few jobs, get fired, for the first time in my whole life. And of course me deciding I no longer believe in the church a few months back now haunts me everyday, because it feels as if this is punishment for my decision, even though I know it’s all bullshit.

How has the church fucked you up mentally?"

I (28/F) have bipolar 2, and my brother (22/M) has bipolar 1. He attempted to commit suicide last year which led to him being hospitalized and subsequently sent to an inpatient treatment center for a week. The center was HORRIBLE (the way they treated the patients, the way the therapy was conducted, etc.) and he had a very traumatic experience there. IMHO they should be shut down, but that is not the topic of this post.

Fast forward to today, he has only gotten worse. He got kicked out of college during his senior year and is living with my parents, working one day a week at an unpaid internship. He is now delusional and violent, having what can only be described as weekly temper tantrums where he trashes my parents' house and threatens some combination of murder/suicide. About 10 months ago he attacked and injured my dad. He believes that he is owed money and respect, and that he is regularly denied those things (even though my parents give him both in spades), and that is why he terrorizes my whole family with his violence and threats.

Yesterday he had a prolonged incident where he screamed at my parents and me, trashed the house, attempted to cut himself with a saw (twice), then threatened suicide before jumping into his car and speeding off. He later came back and hasn't spoken a word to anyone since.

We all decided to take him to an inpatient therapy center, but I don't think he will willingly go. He's bigger and stronger than everyone else in my family, and there is no way we can physically make him do something he doesn't want to do.

""But WeightTillNextYear, just call the cops when he gets violent!"" Unfortunately, this is not an option for my family. He has stated before that he wouldn't mind committing suicide by cop. We are a black family in the middle of an otherwise all-white small town, and there is a VERY good chance that calling the cops when he is agitated would result in his death. He does not own a gun to the best of my knowledge, but he is a large man who it would take 2-3 strong people to control, and the cops in my town are not used to dealing with violent and/or mentally ill people.

Any advice? My family is being held hostage, walking on eggshells because we have no way to get him to leave/get help that doesn't involve calling the police and getting him shot.

The only issue is that the only reference I would have is my current boss, who I obviously can’t use for a reference while looking for a job to leave my current job. My previous references were all from old internships who I lost contact with and have since moved on to other jobs. Since they were internships, they wouldn’t have been super great references anyway. 

Does anyone have experience dealing with something like this?"

74erum,3,2017-10-05,"""Hey""",LabNerd_xlsx,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/74erum/hey/,"Hey I'm Jordan (he/him). Let me tell you a little story.

So a little more than a year ago I started talking to this girl (Elaine) that was about to be roommates with a friend of mine. We really hit it off and I started to really develop feelings for her. I took a chance and I convinced her to hang out with me and a few friends for the fourth of July. As you can imagine, I was super nervous but by the end of the night we had gotten pretty comfortable talking to each other. With a little aid from a mutual friend we started dating and things started to move really quickly. I liked it. We started to get intimate on a regular basis and everything in life is going super well. I'm about to start my senior year in college. I'm living in a house with a few of my buddies. I have a beautiful young lady that loves me. At that point in my life, there wasn't much more I could ask for. 

Some important details about Elaine:
Elaine just got kicked out of Pharmacy school and she is super self-conscious about her ability to get a degree.
Elaine has had some pretty bad boyfriends in the past that have ""retaliated"" after they broke up regardless of who's ended it.
I do whatever I can do comfort her on these issues from her past but it doesn't ever seem to do much good.

FAST FORWARD 9 MONTHS.......
(you can just assume the typical great relationship with what I consider to be the normal fight every once and a while)

I just graduated and got my degree, but Elaine needs to take an extra year because she was delayed after being forced to switch majors out of pharmacy school. The day has come to move out of the house that she's been sharing with a few of her friends and move back in with her parents for the summer (or so I thought). 

This is the part where I know this is going to get really biased against her, but I want to clarify that I'm really not angry or spiteful. I'm just trying to tell the story from my perspective.

It feels as though the day that she moves back in with her parents our relationship changes dramatically. We don't see each other nearly as often. Granted, she is taking a couple of summer classes and she has this really kick-ass internship that required a lot of her time. (I'm really proud of her) She seems really emotionally disconnected from me and she seems annoyed by the task of responding to text messages. We try to talk about it and she admits that she hasn't been doing her best and she will try to do better. Her only condition is that I need to give her patience and space. (I can sometimes require a lot of attention) I try to make conscious efforts not to text her so much and wait for her to message me when she's free and ready. 

This does not really produce the results I am hoping for as we are still only seeing each other once, maybe twice a week when we are used to 3-4 times a week during the school year. We go through this phase where we fight about something almost every time we talk or see each other and I can just feel her pushing me away emotionally and physically. We are still intimate every few times and without going into too much detail, I'm certain that we are both having a great time doing that. It's still doesn't feel like she's really happy with everything that's going on between us. I keep getting the feeling that she is annoyed by a lot of the things I do and that makes me project the same behavior onto her in a terrible vicious cycle. 

The summer passes and I'm still unemployed and she needs to go back to school (in the same city as I'm still living in). Our 1 year anniversary falls on the same day as the eclipse back in August. We still see each other about about once or twice a week, but I'm not as upset as I used to be because I know she's busy doing homework and I've gotten used to this pattern by now. I'm filling my time with a lot of Netflix and video games and spending some time with a few friends of mine from my fraternity ""back in college"". Elaine usually fills up her weekends with activities with her family. These plans are sometimes by choice and frequently imposed on her by her parents.

To compensate, I start making a lot of plans with my family as well. My brother has his first son earlier this summer and I have made a habit of spending a day or so with him and his family almost every weekend. A week and a half ago I'm driving back to my home after spending the night with my brother and Elaine and I are supposed to have lunch at my place for a few hours before she needs to go to a birthday party for her Aunt and see an friend of the family/ uncle that she doesn't get to see too often. I haven't heard from her since last night and I'm starting to get a little worried.

(Spetember 23, 2017, ~11:00 AM)
I finally get a phone call.

""Hey"" I answer.
She says, ""Hey... I'm not going to be able to make it to lunch today. I can't do this anymore. We're just on different pages and...""
It's basically at this point that I phase out from not disbelief exactly, but more like an overwhelming feeling of dread come over me. 
She says ""I have to go now...""
I HUNG UP THE PHONE!!!!!!!!! I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!!!!!! I PANICKED AND I HUNG UP THE GOD DAMN PHONE!!!!!!!

I tried calling her back and it goes straight to voice mail. I finally get back to my apartment and I get on facebook and she's already blocked me. She has already blocked me on every social media that I can think of. I have no way to contact her now and I have to live with the fact that the last words that I ever say to her might be ""Hey"".
I'm not insane so I'm not prepared to just show up at her house uninvited or badger one of her friends and make them hate me even more than they are inevitably going to by taking her side after the break-up. Why don't I try and contact her mom or maybe her sister on Facebook and see if they can convince Elaine to give me a chance to speak with her just for a minute. (This was a horrible idea) I very soon discover that not only has Elaine blocked me on every social media imaginable, everyone in her family has as well. 

Now I get what's going on. Elaine has told her family that she is going to break up with me and her family was ready to help her pull the trigger. Of course they should support her. Of course they should do everything they can to make breaking up with me and getting over me as easy as possible. It just kinda makes it hurt a bit worse for me. That pain has to go somewhere. They left some holes in their web of blocking that I have yet to take any advantage of, but I may need to in order to get a few personal items back from Elaine eventually, assuming that she hasn't just thrown them out or destroyed them.

So after all this happened, I had to call on a few friends to spend some time with me as I cope with everything. For the past two weeks I've been doing a lot of thinking, which has been extremely helpful and equally depressing.

That's pretty much my story and I appreciate any and all supportive comments, even constructive criticism. Don't bash Elaine (too hard), she doesn't deserve that. I'm just sad and in need of a little more positive attitude in my life. Thanks in advance."
74fcl5,5,2017-10-05,I still want to make games,TanktopSamurai,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/74fcl5/i_still_want_to_make_games/,"I am a computer engineer. The reason I started studying computer engineering was to eventually make games. I studied in France in a five-year university. While studying the technical aspects of computer engineering, I decided to educate myself in the artistic and economic aspects of games. I tried to see games in an artistic light, the same way one would look at a movie or a book or try to see different choices in game development from a economic point of view. 

However, around my second and third year, the rose-tinted glasses of high-school boy faded. I slowly gave up on game development. I turned to cyber-security which was another of my interests. I did an internship and decided that it wasn't for me. 

In my 4th year, I came in contact with Machine Learning and I quickly developed a passion for it. I did an internship and then an exchange year about it. I am now currently doing another final internship about it in Germany. I am enjoying doing what I am doing right now. 

But there is still the desire to make games. Even worse, I didn't stop informing myself about games. I regularly watch video essays, articles etc. about it. I still look at different choices and try to decipher the reasons behind them, and think how a different choice would have effected the game. And sometimes, I find myself dreaming what kind of game I would do, designing it in my head and combining different games together.

Sometimes I tell myself that I might be one day to make games if I become really rich. I know that this is a lot less dramatic than most other things but I needed to vent."

Well before my questions, a little story time. I'm an older(37) guy looking to make a career change into IT. As such I have NO idea where I want to go and what exactly I want to do in the field, and no education/certs/average persons experience with PC's. That being said, I was scrolling through Craigslist on a whim looking at some of the tech support jobs and I happened upon the rarest of the rare, the epitome of hens' teeth- an IT internship asking for no experience! I got my resume and figured, shoot, why not send it in? What's the worst that could happen? I don't get the job? I already have a comfortable(unskilled) position as a receptonist, and if I don't get it, hey at least I went to my first interview pertaining to IT employment. Well, apparently I interviewed very well because they're having me come back for a second interview! Kinda freaking out a bit, tbh. I feel a bit like I walked into a bank with a gun and pulled it out on a whim and have started robbing the bank. The company I'm attempting to get into is a ""port to floor"" shipping company, the gentleman I interviewed with was somewhat nebulous about my duties. He mentioned on-boarding PC's, Citrix sessions, scut work(do this, go there, ship this, etc..), documentation, documentation, documentation. I'm not concerned about that, as long as I'm learning I'll go on coffee runs 'til the cows come home. Here's some questions I have-

What kind of compensation can I hope for? I won't take the position unless they match my current pay rate of 15.85.

Should I ask them to direct my learning outside of the workplace? Example- which certifications should I pursue?

Please, ask me any questions or point out any concerns you folks might have, I appreciate all your input! Thanks for your time!"
74fi3d,2,2017-10-05,"El discurs del MHP senyor Puigdemont, o els tòpics habituals del nacionalisme català.",aicneliser,PlazaCatalunya,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlazaCatalunya/comments/74fi3d/el_discurs_del_mhp_senyor_puigdemont_o_els_tòpics/,"Versión en castellano: https://www.reddit.com/r/podemos/comments/74fg9y/el_discurso_del_mhp_se%C3%B1or_puigdemont_o_los/

Prèvia a partir de l'experiència d'altres comentaris: les inicials MHP no impliquen cap insult, corresponen a Molt Honorable President, el títol que va instaurar el fundador de la Generalitat en la transició, l'ex-MHP senyor Jordi Pujol.

Després de la breu arenga del rei en clau duresa xulesca i amenaçant, estil nacionalisme espanyol pur, li ha tocat al MHP sr. Puigdemont adoctrinar-nos en clau nacionalisme català.

Per descomptat ha estat un discurs més llarg que el del rei, perquè sintetitzar el doble llenguatge, el mil·lenarisme de ""poble"" escollit, el victimisme i la hipòcrita caracterització del seu nacionalisme ""pacífic, tolerant, democràtic i cívic"" requereix més retòrica, més temps, més extensió.

Com era inevitable, l'MHP Puigdemont parla en nom d ' ""un sol poble"", únic i indivisible, al que ell representa; la complexitat que esmenta en el discurs correspon al ""Estat espanyol"". En la seva ""Catalunya""  d ' ""un sol poble"", la complexitat està dòcilment subordinada a la unitat de destinació que marca un ""projecte de país"" que està ""enormement cohesionat en la diversitat"". El ' ""Espanya"" sencera sota una sola bandera' del nacionalisme espanyol és al ' ""un sol poble"" del nacionalisme català, el lògic contrapunt.

Per agrair el suport de ""ciutadans espanyols"" a ""les reivindicacions"" de la seva ""Catalunya"", el MHP Puigdemont ha intercalat un breu paràgraf en castellà, la llengua impròpia de la seva ""Catalunya"". Opina, doncs la cosa no va amb ell, que les ""autoritats espanyoles"" hauran d'explicar millor el que passa en la seva ""Catalunya"" ""cohesionada en la diversitat"". La possibilitat que una part de la societat d'Espanya pugui tenir la seva pròpia visió, que no passa pel fals relat idíl·lic del nacionalisme català, i denunciar la brutalitat i la violència del nacionalisme espanyol l'1 - O pel que tenen d'atemptat, feta  des d'unes conviccions plurals ni s'esmenta, són problemes interns de la ""altra part"".

El discurs conté una part de doble llenguatge i hipocresia que resulta memorable: la destinada al rei. Si alguna cosa ha caracteritzat a la part de les 400 famílies i les classes benestants alineades amb el nacionalisme català, ha estat la burla continuada a la monarquia. La xiulada contra el Digne Pare del Digne Fill amb motiu de les olimpíades del 92, va ser d'antologia (per cert, el nucli de joves de ""casa bona"" ​​que la van organitzar estava liderat pel membre de la ""família"" destinat a perpetuar el llinatge polític: el senyor Oriol Pujol, que acaba de pactar la seva entrada a la presó com el delinqüent econòmic que és); i no oblidem la xiulada a l'Digne Fill en la vergonyosa instrumentalització que van fer els nacionalismes de la repulsa al fanatisme religiós a Barcelona.

Doncs amb aquesta trajectòria de xiulades i escridassades, les paraules del missatge del MHP Puigdemont dedicades al rei són: ""amb la decisió d'ahir vostè va decebre moltes persones a Catalunya, que li aprecia i que l'ha ajudat en moments difícils de la institució"". Un ""estima"" manifestat amb xiulets i esbroncades; una mostra d'hipocresia i doble llenguatge del nacionalisme català com a hàbit discursiu.

Avui, la senyora SS de Santamaría ha posat el seu granet de sorra a la línia del ""real"" nacionalisme espanyol, poc a comentar.

Mentrestant, també avui, al Parlament d'Andalusia, Podem ha fet política de veritat, de la qual interessa a les classes subalternes, però no hi ha perill que aquesta demostració d'honradesa i coherència arribi a la gran majoria de la classe política de Catalunya , Podem inclòs. Aquí sobren banderes per tapar-la."

Brain – Woah woah woah!! What’s happening? Have I been sleeping all this time? Hearty, what happened? Why are you beating so hard?

Heart – I, I, I, I, I got hurt. I am broken.

Brain – What do you mean you are broken, tell me what happened?

Heart – I…. got dumped.

Brain – Not again, how many times I have to tell you to not be so easy!!

Heart – What can I do, I couldn’t help it. She was so nice.

Brain – Really? If she was so nice, why are you in this pain now?

Heart – She said she was excited, having beautiful moments with me and said she loves me, but now she is saying she doesn’t have any of those with me. She’s acting like a complete stranger.

Brain – So, she fell out of ‘love’, is that it?

Heart – Not only that. She started beating for another heart and started talking as if I’m trying to act like a nice guy and all that I talk is a ‘nice guy bullshit’.

Brain – Tell me the whole story, you overtook me for so long and the last time I was awake, you were sad and broken too.

Heart – Well yeah, I was sad and broken because of the same person last time. But soon after that, I got back with her and she claimed that she started having feelings for me, which was a great thing that ever happened in my existence. I thought it was true and I was so happy that I was always smiling. Mostly she made me smile, her presence, the warmth feeling, all felt so nice. But lately she started pushing me away as if she despise me and then later she revealed that she got out of those feelings.

Brain – Hmm, so she changed? Didn’t you say you got hurt last time because of the same person? Why did you go back to the same person and fell for her when you thought her heart never melt or even consider you which was proven the last time?

Heart – How could I know? I can’t think. It just felt nice because she started loving back. What else do I want more when I’m getting back the love from the one I love? And she showed so much craze over me.

Brain – Why do you even switch me off whenever you are happy? We should work together in things like these and these things will hurt you very bad. You are very important to all of us and we can’t see you broken like this.

Heart – Yeah, but I loved her and I wanted her to be happy always which intern used to make me happy.

Brain – Yeah? Then take a look at yourself, what have you become because of that person now. You look so weak and awful.

Heart – She said she didn’t ask me anything and it was my mistake to give importance to her. I gave so much support to her when she was fragile and lonely but she said she didn’t ask me to stay in those times. I tried so hard to make her happy and forget about the things she is worried about, but it wasn’t enough. She has so less self-esteem and I tried to help her to get over it. I extended my hand in every scene, case and time to help her, support her. But she says she never asked me to do that and she does not need my support (anymore). If I talk about those things now, she says I’m giving ‘nice guy bullshit’.

Brain – I know. You are kind and vulnerable. You always tend to support and help, but remember that not all hearts are the same and you should learn to let it go. You should think about yourself too, you are important to yourself more than anyone.

Heart – She didn’t ask any of those but I couldn’t see her in such situations. I don’t know and I can’t help it. Whenever she is like that, I just want to be with her and make her feel normal or happy again. I was ready to do anything for that, even to lose my self-respect.

Brain – Has she ever done that to you when you were feeling down?

Heart – Yes, sometimes. But usually she says she doesn’t know anything to say to comfort me. But mostly she never acknowledges.

Brain – You are too good to realize that she’s being sel You are too good to realize that she’s selfish. She said she loves you but the truth was, she was just living in that moment and whereas you are living for life. You thought her love was for eternal whereas for her, it was just in those moments where she got excited and needed attention from you. But sadly my friend, it wasn’t the eternal love you were looking for and trying to match with your love. She never really loved you the way you thought what love was. I know it is hard now and it’s gonna be fine. You have to learn from your mistakes, be strong and be independent. Don’t get too attached so easily that the other person gets control over you. Remember, “The weak can be the strongest in weakest moments that the strong can never be”. You have seen all the ups and downs, learn from those experiences. Don’t be so easy to anyone, you have to be deserved not too available.

Heart – But she used to give me so much joy. Although she didn’t care at times, her presence made me so happy and myself.

Brain – Don’t you know, “What has the power to give you so much joy, also has the power to make you so sad and break you?”

Heart – Yeah, but no one was there to tell me all these things and you weren’t there too. I don’t know how to continue after this, she is just all inside me and I can’t get her out of me. Help me!!

Brain – Okay don’t cry, now I’m here. Don’t you worry and just chill for some time. You are very important to the whole body, even I can’t function if you don’t work properly.

Heart – I thought I was still in control but these Hormones just take control in some situations, like when she said she loves me. I couldn’t help but feel the love which I always craved for.

(love) Hormones – Dude! Don’t blame us, we just did our job. Thought we’d get rewards for our work but instead this scapegoating? Not so good Hearty.

Brain – You are the worst in some times and the sole reason why this tender heart becomes so weak and now getting hurt. At least your brother is a little better, he just craves for small time pleasures.

(love) Hormones – Now you support him? I thought everybody respects me and wants me but never expected you would say you like my brother more. You guys expect so much from me but not with my brother. You want me to be active and give happiness for God knows how long. But from my brother, only a little time. Not fair Sir.

Brain – Easy hormones, we are not blaming anyone here. Our friend is in a pain now, let’s concentrate on him. I know you just did your job.

Penis – Bruh! You have no idea how it feels with your brother and some blood, Wow!!

Brain – Hahaha!! Here comes the playboy. Your life is great, you never disappoint us and you never keep dirty things inside. Joyful life you have!

Heart – He is getting all those because of me, just because I send some blood to him.

Brain – Hearty! We all are in need of you, not only Mr. P.

Heart – Guys! Please help me get over her.

Brain – Take it easy man. Tell me what do you enjoy doing and the things which you used to do before this ‘uncertain’ calamity happened? What used to make you excited?

Heart – Hmm I liked to hang out with my friends, that’s a lot of fun. And I loved watching movies, all kind of movies and I miss that now. I wanted to film and photograph, I liked to write, travel to so many places, see, feel things and get enlightened by learning new things.

Brain – That’s awesome. You are more than what you think about yourself and we know it. There are so many ideas that are living in the back of me and never even dared to come out because you switched me off when you were in that ‘uncertain’ thing with her.

Heart – Yeah, so many ideas.

Brain – You shouldn’t have stopped living your life and leave everything behind just because of a heart which is so shallow. Look what you made out of yourself and look at the body you are responsible for. You changed so much for the heart which was never clear about her intentions and made you fall in a dilemma pit for the whole time whether to get out or stay. You have just become a new person which I’m strangers with.

Heart – Sorry for everything.

Brain – I heard you even making this body to start drinking alcohol.

Tongue – Ewww! It tasted so awful, that was the worst taste that I ever had.

Throat – Ahh man! Think about my burns because of it after you tasted it and tried to swallow.

Heart – Sorry everybody, I messed up!

Brain – Honey, it’s okay. It’s not too late for anything. We, your friends will be there with you forever. Cheer up!

Tongue – Honey!!! Mmmmmm it tastes sooo gooood!!!

Brain – Hahaha. We are going to make the eyes show you what makes you happy and we will control the hands to not touch anything which is not supposed to touch.

Eyes – Sir, I do the same thing all the time. I just show you what you want me to show and I never modify anything while sending those images back to you. I can’t keep secrets and I’m very transparent.

Brain – I know you do and in fact you are the most honest one I know.

Asshole – What about me Sir? I don’t keep anything inside too. But I don’t know why everybody uses my name to scold someone, it gives me existential crisis and makes me feel insecure.

Brain – Haha, it’s because people just care about the looks and not so much about what they do. They scold by your name because they think you’re ugly and deals with dirt, but in fact they don’t realize that you keep the stomach and the whole body clean. You are just as important as any of us.

Heart – That’s true. And thank you guys so much. You are my real friends and you always make me feel happy and comfort me, I love you!!

Brain – How can we not be, stupid? You are the reason why we live. And listen to me, remember that the same way you crave for her, she’s craving for someone else and sadly you’re not the one. You’re just too available and it gave her upper hand. She needs you more than you need her. She’s alone and she wants attention. She needs someone who gives her support, even though she denies it. She just likes the attention you give to her and she feels important in your presence and she doesn’t want to lose that importance. She never saw you as someone whom she can imagine things with. Yes, she said so but those were not true. She was just excited and living in the moment. You fall for that every fucking time and you don’t learn from all the blood pressure and the pain she caused, because you’re made like that. Look at you, you had a life. You were having some ambitions and dreams. But just look at you now, you’ve become a copy of someone else. You started doing and following things because she likes them, you stopped living your life to live with her. But look what happened. Just think about it yourself, ‘Is she really worth your time and life when she’s trying to find her happiness in someone else and which intern hurts you? Do you want to carry on like this?’ You should be in a place and spend time where you feel yourself and happy, not where you have to kill your self-respect every time she looks ‘down’ at you. Take a deep breath, look back and ask yourself, “Was it really worth it?”"

As an avid Clemson fan, and lifelong sports pessimist (raised by Texas A&amp;M Aggies as an Atlanta pro sports fan), let me give you the lay of the land for our remaining schedule.


**Sat, Oct 7 - Wake Forest**

Should curb stomp. We'll probably play ugly like we did against BC.

Threat Level: Taco Bell Lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.

**Fri, Oct 13 - @Syracuse 7:00 PM Kick**

Last time we went to the AC Dome without AC we heard all about how raucous the crowd would be and how we wouldn't be ready for it. C+ Crowd was taken out of it early, and this game would have been a slaughter if not for an unfortunate Kelly Bryant fumble. Dino Babers is trying to build a competitive program, but unless our guys walk into this completely unprepared and full of themselves, this will be a blowout.


Threat Level: A Bojangles biscuit on Sunday Morning.

**Sat, Oct 28 - Georgia Tech**

Paul Johnson gave Dabo fits during the Kevin Steele years. But since Venables has taken over, our LB discipline has been much better and frankly, our DL talent has been so nasty that we've disrupted the line of scrimmage consistently. I will never sleep on Ga Tech even if we're looking to take our third in a row in the series in the comforts of Death Valley.

Threat Level: That slice of pepperoni pizza you left on the counter overnight and are now eating for breakfast. You've been hurt by this meal before, but you're feeling confident.

**Sat, Nov 4 @ NC State**
This is the stumbling block in my mind. Weird shit happens in Raleigh (See Clemson vs NC State 2011, FSU vs NC State 2012). If you think NC State can't hang with us, just look at last year. They should have beat us. Their DL talent is performing as good or better than ours, and if they can disrupt our run game and force us to pass, then I'm not sure what will happen. This is the biggest threat on our schedule right now.

Threat Level: Making out with the flirtatious intern whose Dad is a lawyer. 

**Sat, Nov 11 - Florida State**
Our formidable division rival has not looked themselves without Francois, but they have almost the whole season to get it ironed out for this game. I expect Jimbo will have his boys ready to play and we'll see their best effort since the season opener. Probably a close game, but we should take this one in Death Valley.

Threat Level: The first time you have Indian food and don't understand what Indian Spicy means. You'll probably survive, but there's a chance your body will never be the same.

**Sat, Nov 18 - Citadel**

Tune up before South Carolina. Expect to see backups early and often. Lots of fond farewells to seniors and juniors. Upperclassmen who've been passed on the depth chart will get one last romp in the Valley.

Threat Level: Nah.

**Sat, Nov 25 @ South Carolina**

Rivalry game so anything can happen, but as last season's game showed, our talent level is much higher and we should take it.

Threat Level: Eating one jelly bean out of a box of Jelly Belly's with a fart flavored bean mixed in. Odds are good you're safe, but it's still possible that something terrible could happen.

**Sat, December 2, 2017 Dr. Pepper ACC Championship vs TBD**

Probably Miami or Va Tech. The past few years we've played this game too close for comfort. We won in the end, but they were dicey. A rematch against Bud Foster and VaTech is a scary thought, but unless their offense improves by leaps and bounds I feel comfortable. Miami is more of a challenge in my mind, but full-disclosure it's because the only game I've watched them play was against Duke and they looked really good in that one.

Threat Level: Too early to tell, but I'd rate this as a hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant you love. It's dangerous, but you've had a track record of success.

And to me, that is how this season plays out. I think we can go the distance, but we've shown enough weakness on offense that someone could reach up and grab us. Only time will tell if we're destined for a third year of playoff glory.

TL;DR: NC State is the best bet for a stumble, but FSU, the ACC Championship, and Ga Tech have potential, too.

EDIT: Thanks to u/gctaylor for the Gold. I feel so special."

Not only is this not the most practical vehicle but it is also probably one of the lowest mileage and nicest first gen Cummins pickups out there. For this reason I have kind of been looking for a new daily for the past few years to keep the miles of the truck and so I don't have to cringe every time I have to drive it through another North Dakota winter. I never considered buying a brand new car, but I have always been a fan of hot hatches, in particular the Golf GTI. At my local Volkswagen dealership here in Fargo I found this GTI and through my research it seems to be a pretty good deal.

I see this fixing the only big issues with the current app. 
Any recent computer has a CPU that can handle way more than a current phone CPU could hope to, which means you could give us 48k sample rate. Without having to compromise on performance.  
The other being space: My phone has 64GB of space total, all computers come with at least double that, most quadruple that. More than enough for every song that dropmix could come out with for years (even with 48k sample rate).  
Also correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't the universal windows development platform mean that you can also release the app to those 6 people who still have windows phones (I know i'll get shit for that by someone, but it's true and you know it). And I'm pretty sure you could still lock the phones to 24k sample rate while giving PC users an option.

74i48h,2,2017-10-05,Legality of using Oracle and APEX for an application without paying Oracle.,El_Giganto,oracle,https://www.reddit.com/r/oracle/comments/74i48h/legality_of_using_oracle_and_apex_for_an/,"Hey guys, I've got a question. I'm studying Software Engineering, but on my side job in retail management I've had a problem for like 2 years. We've got a communication error between commerce, supply chain, IT and our stores. You can skip the next three paragraphs if you don't care about the details.

Basically all four of us have this process that we start at commerce, and we send it through multiple departments, we let the stores do their thing, then we adjust what they've done, then IT has to take that into account, supply does the finishing touches and then the stores receives products.

All off this can be done much simpler. We want to ignore IT because that's where the first problem arises. They send us the input from stores. Apparently it's impossible for them to give us a list of stores that's accurate, because the list contains stores that have already closed and are yet to open. This is not something we want to deal with. 

For this reason, I want to use the skills I learned in school to make an application that fits our needs. It's actually quite easy. I just create a table for stores, a table for the products and then a table that connects those two and also administrates how much the store ordered initially, but because we usually adjust this order, I'll also save what we adjusted this order too.

This is perfect for APEX. An easy to use low coding platform to simply connect a database directly to an application. The problem is that we use SAP. I know SAP usually runs on an Oracle Database, so communication shouldn't be an issue. 

Apart from that, if I run the program on my own server, without paying for a license, is that a problem? I mean, SQL Developer, the Oracle Database and APEX are free to use... I've already got it all installed on my laptop, I just need to run the application somewhere. Is there any problem with this? 

I actually asked this at their office, because I'm really interested in working for them after next summer for an internship, and a developer there said it was okay because it's basically all free. 

Anyone have any knowledge about this and can confirm this is alright? "
74ioti,8,2017-10-05,Internship at jagex?,Zmulburr,runescape,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/74ioti/internship_at_jagex/,"Hey Redditors,

So let's start of by introducing myself. I am a second-year Business Management student of applied sciences from the Netherlands. Next year I will be able to follow an internship at a company I am interested in (within the country or abroad).

Since videogames are a big passion for me and especially Runescape I wondered if there is any possibility to follow an internship at Jagex. I feel like I sort of know the vibe Runescape wants to give, because I have been playing the game for some time (over 10 years, no I am not proud), and I feel like I might be able to positively influence the company with my knowledge I have from studying Business Management.

I have done some research on internships at Jagex, but all the information I found were from 2015. Also I have found an e-mail to contact, but I do not know if this e-mail is still used.

If there are any people who are willing to help me out on how I could approach Jagex, and how to get this all fixed are welcome.

Yours sincerely,

Zmulburr

74ivuw,11,2017-10-05,"mom (40s) keeps pushing me (22f) to apply to jobs i'm not interested in ""to get my foot in the door."" She won't take no for an answer and it's driving me nuts",rlyneedjob,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/74ivuw/mom_40s_keeps_pushing_me_22f_to_apply_to_jobs_im/,"EDIT: Some of you are criticizing me for being picky and to take just any job, but I included in my post that I have just accepted an offer that is completely out of my field, yet my mom is still pushing me to apply for the one at her company. READ IT ALL BEFORE CALLING ME UNGRATEFUL, PLEASE.

Graduated from college in May and having some trouble finding a job for a number of factors: I majored in a fairly new (but promising for the future) field, my gpa wasn't that great (not terribly low, but I don't stand out amongst my classmates), I don't have any prior experience b/c the gpa thing so I could never get an internship -_-. 

Currently still live with my parents (and I am so thankful) but every day my mom is constantly badgering me about what jobs I've applied for and sending me at least 5 postings a day, even for things that **require** a few years of experience (""just apply! they might end up hiring you because you can be trained!"") Even when I tell her that some of the things she sends me are not within my interest, she just tells me to apply anyway because I could always network my way to where I want to be. Lately, I've just been saying okay and not applying...lol.

I know there is some truth behind what she is saying and that she's only doing this to help, but it's only adding stress to her own day by googling for job openings for me WHILE I'M DOING IT MYSELF and stressing me out because I feel like I have to constantly listen to her lecture me about how I'm not trying hard enough. She flipped out on me once when I called her late in the afternoon about a work thing when she texted me in the morning to give her a call - called her late b/c I went out for lunch with a friend, so she got upset and accused me of not trying and decided she wouldn't help me anymore (lies, she's still helping me). I also feel guilty about ignoring her suggestions because she's been in a managerial position for over 10 years, so I feel like she is helping me based on experience and love but GAHH. 

Recently my luck turned around and **I got a job offer** for a position completely out of my field, and am still in consideration (final steps) for a few other positions that are a little outside my field, but I would enjoy doing. She was happy for me and encouraged me to take it (**I accepted, until I find something else**), but is still sending me positions, telling me that I *need* to apply ASAP. 

Specifically today, she sent me an opening at her company for a technical role that is very entry-level (does not require college degree) and she knows the manager...while it would be a good step in getting into my field, it's boring. I shadowed someone for a few months in that position and came out of it knowing it is what I DON'T want to do. I've met with this manager before and he is a really nice guy -- he's been checking in with my mom about my status and offered to help when he saw an opening, so I feel obligated to apply and meet with him, and ultimately take the job if offered, which I really don't want to do. At this point, I'd much rather do the work that is totally not in my field than maintain equipment. 

So, reddit, idk what to do. Quite honestly, I don't even know if I still want a job in the field I majored in. I've told her this and she was so reassuring, telling me that most people don't find out what they want to do until they get into their job and do it, and that it was okay; yet she's still pushing me to go into my field!! She's going to come home today and ask me if I applied for that job, and I want to tell her that I don't want to but she's just going to freak as usual and tell me that it's a good way to get my foot in the door. Suggestions?

  **tl;dr**: Mom is freaking out about me not having a job more than I am and keeps pushing me to apply for positions I have no interest in..even though I just accepted something."

****
Mr. Watts had walked past her desk with a knowing smile that morning. He knew the employees were eager to receive their bonuses for the fiscal year. She'd heard stories about the interviews he wouldd have with people, being a bit coy and playful with them in stark contrast to his stoic demeanor he normally kept.

His morning greeting to her was fleeting, though. Throughout the morning one by one, he'd had appointments with each employee on the 19th floor to talk about their work they'd done this year. He gave himself thirty minutes between meetings to collect his notes for each person he'd interviewed.

She could only hear muffled speech outside his door from her desk. At least twice now she heard him laugh loudly during an interview with the chef.

Just after lunch he'd slowly opened his door and stood in the doorway, peaking out at her, ""Ahem, Miss Becky? I believe it's time for our meeting."" He spoke with a smile, wider than he'd normally smiled.
________________________________________________________________________________
She looked up from her desk, startled from her deep concern with the scheduling spreadsheet laid out on the computer screen in front of her. Her eyes travel up to meet his as he stands in the doorway to his office, obscuring the inside. She smiles back, and starts to close what she's working on. She stands up with a cheerful ""Of course, Mister Watts.""

She stood quickly, stepping out of her chair and pushing it back in, grabbing a manilla folder as she began to walk towards him. Her eyes trail on the ground as she made her way over, only looking back up when she was in front of his door, as she give him another smile, ""Busy day today? Youve been locked away all morning. Hows everything been?"" She asked nervously, smoothing my skirt out with one hand, feeling small in front of him.
_________________________________________________________________________________
Mr. Watts stepped to the side, inviting her in as she looked up at him. His smile had faded only slightly. As he walked with her into his office. The heavy wooden door slid shut behind the two of them with an echoing thud.

""Just finishing up these damn bonuses, you know. Everybody loves their holiday bonuses.."" he shook his head a little as he guided her to his large wooden desk. He stopped with her next to a pair of chairs in front of it, then continued on around to his side of the desk. His finger traced the edge of the desk as he walked, ""I suppose I should enjoy it too, though. The ass-kissing hits an all-time high around now.""

He sat down in his reclining leather chair across from her. ""Okay, so I hope no one scared you at all over this. We're basically just going to cover an accounting of your accomplishments over the past year. You've only just been here six months out of this year, so don't feel too pressured about this. It's a formality, really.""

His tone seemed to suggest he'd already made his decision about the whole process.
_________________________________________________________________________________
She walked in behind him silently, laughing self consciously at the holiday bonuses remark. She watched him as he made his way behind his desk, standing in front of it for a few moments as he continued to talk. ""So, does that mean my plans for ass kissing were all made in vain?"" she asked with a chuckle.

He sits down, and when he asks her if she's scared her posture loosens a bit, realizing that what he says is true and by his tone, and there probably isn't a reason to be nervous. ""Thank you, Mr. Watts. And well, of course I'm a bit scared. Ive just never had an actual meeting like this before. I've of course sat in but.. my accomplishments have never been the subject of one,"" she started. ""The bonuses are a pretty big topic right now. I think its a pretty smart idea on your part, honestly. It gets everybody in the office motivated"" She lifted the manila folder in her left arm, holding it tight against her chest. ""I actually printed out a spreadsheet I made of all the meetings I've scheduled here for you over the past 6 months. I.. Wasnt entirely sure what else to bring to the meeting.""
__________________________________________________________________________________
He stared at her while she spoke, seeming to listen to her intently with an abnormally playful look on his face. As she spoke he reached his hand below his desk and slid open one of the drawers. He fished out a short stack of papers and dropped them onto the desk in front him. ""Well, seems we were both thinking the same thing then.""

He opened his own accord of the meetings he'd had over the past six months, perusing through the bullets. ""It was kinda easy for me to put together, I mean we both have access to my calendar. I can't imagine this spreadsheet looks as good as yours, though.""
For the first time ever he seemed to look her over, noting what she were wearing. A shine seemed to flash in his eyes as he continued, looking back at the paper. ""Back in February we had a luncheon that Chef cooked for himself. He'd made phad thai with this really amazing peanut butter sauce.""

He stood up from his seat and looked back out the window for a moment, recalling the details of that day. ""This was before you came here, obviously. We had clients over and one of them had a peanut allergy. She didn't realize there were nuts involved in the sauce until she took a bite.""

He looked back to her and then walked around his desk again slowly, nearing her. ""Would you believe that chef actually kept an insulin shot handy in the kitchen just in case something like that happened? It was pretty amazing and lucky for us, too. That could have been a disaster.""

He finally closed the distance between them and sat back against the edge of his desk to finish, ""Chef is a pretty clever guy. He thinks ahead. That's a quality that we can't lose here in this office."" He lowered his head a little, his eyes fixated on her flats, and inching slightly higher to her smooth legs, ""Now, what do you think you do for this office that we can't afford to lose?""
__________________________________________________________________________________
He pulls out his stack of papers, dropping them down as she placed her folder gently on her side of the large wooden desk, sliding it forward so he can view it. She stood, holding her own hands in front of her as she watched him go through his own records, silently praying that they both matched up. She noticed him looking at her, not realizing in this pose she was lightly pushing her breasts together. Although theyre small, the blouse she was wearing helped to make them show off her very small figure.

She swallowed slightly, nervously looking around the room as she tried to imagine what phad thai could possibly be, and why somebody would want to put peanut butter on asian food, eyeing him as he walked towards the window, and then back towards her, her hands still in front of her. She tried to look more calm, reminding herself that the meetings not a big deal, and this must just be smalltack. She interweaved her fingers together, pushing her thumbs against each other. ""That was pretty good of Chef. He is a smart guy, he's always been super polite to me. Thats actually really heroic."" She chirped back, as he sat on his desk in front of her. As his eyes travel down to her shoes, her eyes also look down at her feet. She crossed her legs tightly, her feet now on opposite as the nylon stockings on her legs brush up against each other on her shins and thighs.

She looked down at the ground for a minute, thinking, but not all that nervous. She looked back at him, her eyes meeting his somewhat confidently, ""Well, Mr. Watts. When I first came here I felt a little bit self conscious about that to be honest. I didnt really know anything.. And I am just an intern, Im not a full time worker and I do have to go back to school"" She stopped for a moment, her voice trailing off before she looked back at him eagerly. ""But, I do know that I'm getting a lot of training around the office. And when I do graduate with my degree and come back full time, it'll be a lot cheaper than investing in somebody completely new that needs to be trained all over again. I already know a lot about how Sherman &amp; Sherman operates. And I do help with your scheduling here and help people in the office while I'm here.. I mean, I'm not saving lives like Chef.. but.."" She swallowed and then bit her own lower lip with her teeth, watching his eyes and waiting for a response, feeling somewhat pleased with her own answer.
__________________________________________________________________________________

He leaned against his desk in pure silence while he watched her squirm. In his own mind he sort of enjoyed it, her young form nervous and looking for answers. He could tell her put her in a tight spot. His eyes seemed almost vacant as she crossed one leg over the other, the texture of her nylons shimmering when the light hit them just right.

The rest of his face showed no more emotion while he listened to her make her case, but his eyes still wandered along her legs, then further up to her blouse. Finally as her voice trailed off he seemed to snap back to reality.

The silent moment between them seemed to last for ages. His form didn't move one inch, save for a very slight twitch in the zipper area of his slacks. The fabric seemed to stretch slightly around what was underneath, getting tighter and forming a growing curve down the front of his slacks. The curve twitched once more and his dick pressed harder against the fabric as it started to run out of space from lengthening.

""That's just it, Becky,"" he finally cut into the silence. ""The structure that this office thrives on starts with you. The young, energetic web-weaving worker that you are."" His knuckles started to go white as he gripped the edge of his desk a little tighter. His left leg crossed over his right in a lazy fashion, further aggravating the bulge in his slacks. ""You manage the daily operations of this office already by handling all of my scheduling. And because of that everything runs like a well oiled machine.""

His eyes finally looked up at her own, ""with you here at the firm I can rest easy knowing that the next day everything is already going to be put into place before I walk in the door."" He finally dropped his eyes down to the floor, now noticing the bulge in his pants was clearly visible, ""And that you'll be willing to take care of anything that would cause a bump in the road..""

She smiled slightly to herself as she realized he was somewhat satisfied with her answer, feeling like she just answered a question correctly on a verbal test. ""Thanks, Mr. Watts. I'm just trying to do my best"", she responded back to his well oiled machine comment. She blushed, trying to meet his eyes as he looked over himself, noticing but thinking nothing of the bulge clearly visible coming from his pants. She was a young intern, and her top wasn't exactly the most concealing, so she thought nothing of it, and honestly just took it as a compliment.

""Absolutely Mr. Watts,"" she started again, blushing and smiling at him, ""and thank you for meeting with me. I know these were the meetings for holiday bonuses so I know you're busy with more of the full-time workers. I assume I dont qualify for one, being new? It has only been six months.."" She moved her feet back to normal, her flats resting in the rug solidly on the ground now, no longer nervous.
__________________________________________________________________________________
His head slowly rose again, looking back at her, but his eyes getting distracted by the openness of her blouse. She was definitely a treat. ""As a matter of fact you just may, Becky. You just may qualify for a bonus."" He pushed himself up and off his desk, standing in front of her now. His pelvic region bounced forward a little as he did, at eye level with her now. His cock shifted with the movement, swaying against his slacks. It seemed clear that he wasn't wearing anything supportive under his slacks as the more subtle details of his cock began to show. The rim of his glans protruded out a little more than the rest, and even the swelling head started to push hard against the fabric now, clearly tenting his slacks.

""It all depends on you, Becky. Would you like to finish out your internship here and go back to school with a bonus?"" His hands were at his sides now but they were inching closer to his zipper. ""Not just a bonus, but the bonus? The one everyone else here seems sure that they're going to get?"" His left hand finally snaked up to his zipper. His feet widened slightly in stance as he pulled the zipper down, locking eyes with her as he did. ""It's yours if you want it bad enough..""

As his zipper fell the pressure from his cock throbbing against his slacks gave way and his cock slid straight out of the hole. The head of his cock was a deep red and gently pulsing in size followed by the drawn out veins circling the shaft all the way back to his body. His dick stood straight forward between them, gently pulsing from his heart rate.
__________________________________________________________________________________
She watched him carefully as he rose, looking at the buldge in his pants as he stood, now starting to think about what he was saying as she sat in front of him. She paid close attention to what looked like the head of his cock through the fabric, not noticing herself licking her own lips, once again turning it into a small lip bite.

He begins to widen his stance, and believing he's going to pull his own cock out, she leaned back in the chair, putting her arms on the arm rests, and fixing her own posture. His hands slide to his groin, and begin to unzip his zipper, his cock pushing its way out between the opening in the fabric. She stared at the cock for a minute, shocked at just how it looked, as her eyes broke away from it and she looked back up at him, not wanting to look down.

""I can get the bonus before I go back to school?"" She asked, her eyes wandering back down, not feeling as ashamed, realizing he did pull it out for her to see. She stared at the veins, and the head, how full it is, and noticing just now how pale his skin is compared to hers. She eyed his cock attentively, almost admiring the shape of it, and the man attached. ""What, what am I supposed to do? What do you want me to do? I-is this..what all the other girls have to do too?"" She started to lean forward into the chair, almost as if to get onto the floor, but her hands were still stuck to the armrests.
__________________________________________________________________________________
He took a step towards her, his cock wavering back and forth as he stood directly in front of the chair now. ""Becky, you'll have the bonus by the end of today if you want it."" He stretched his neck a little while his left hand suddenly grabbed the base of his cock. He began pushing the skin forward and it would bundle up around the head of his dick then recede once more as he let it go. His fingers slid up to the head and squeezed it gently. A small drop of pre-cum began to seep out of the tip of his dick and cling to his skin at the bottom.

""If it's not at all clear yet, Becky. You're supposed to suck my cock for the bonus,"" he replied rather bluntly. He looked down at his cock again, then to her blouse. He enjoyed the view as he could see clear past her breasts from this angle, forming their exact shape in his head. ""Some of the girls don't mind doing this for bonuses..but if this is a problem for you, Becky, we can end the interview here and call it a day. I do have one more interview after you with the sous-chef,"" he leaned in slightly as if to tell her a secret, ""and between you and me, she seems like a lively one."" He stood back at his full height over her.

His hand finally left his cock, the drop of pre-cum welling up at the bottom of his tip and drooping down on a thin string of cum, ready to hit the floor. ""So it's up to you, Becky. Do you want the twenty-thousand dollar bonus or not?""
__________________________________________________________________________________
""Oh.. Fuck.. aren't I too young for this,"" she moaned out, watching his cock as he gently pushed his skin forward around the head of his dick. She gently extended her right hand, reaching her index finger just enough to reach the string of precum leaking from his glans. She swiped it gently with the side of her finger, causing the fluid that didn't stick to her finger to fall onto the ground. She pulled her finger back, examing it for a moment before she reached out again, gently wrapping the tips of her fingers just barely around the skin on his shaft, feeling how smooth it is. ""I guess, if this is just normal here?..""

The palm of her hand was soft and incredibly warm as she began to pull her grip back towards herself, pulling his skin forward, causing it to bunch up around the head. She looked down at her legs, eyeing the carpet for a minute as she slid off the chair, making sure she didn't kneel on his shoes. Her knees touched the rug, as she ended up eye level with his cock. She leaned forward, inching her way towards it, pushing the skin back to how it was, stretching it towards the base as she scooched closer. ""So is this why you hire female interns?""

After she got close enough, she pushed his fingers back along his shaft one more time to tug the skin down, exposing the ridge after his head. Very quickly she pushed her soft lips up against the tip of his cock, parting them slightly so his shaft began to slide into her mouth. The second his head entered her mouth, she began to push her tongue up against the bottom of his glans while her cheeks continued to suck. Swirling her tongue around his head now, her right hand started to pump up and down his shaft, her lips tightly in place. Her left hand reached up and began to tug at the fabric around the base of his shaft, trying to pull more of the cock out of his pants than possible.
__________________________________________________________________________________
He nodded slowly, encouraging her as she seemed to decide in her own head what she wanted to do now. His cock twitched gently as she touched it the first time, then he let out a quiet sigh as her fingers began tugging at his skin. ""Yes, Becky. This is why I hire female interns. Especially you. I've been waiting a good long time to watch you do this."" He watched eagerly as her lips finally brushed against the reddened flesh of his tip. His hips moved forward slightly, eager for more. His dick began to ache until she finally began sucking gently on the head of his dick.

A much more relaxed and satisfied look overcame his face while he couldn't seem to take his eyes off of her or what she were doing. ""Careful, Becky. You look like you're starting to enjoy yourself."" He reached down and abruptly stuffed his right hand into the top of her blouse, tersely flipping the cup of her bra out of his fingers way as they crawled deeper and grasped around the small mound of her breast. He squeezed the entirety of it and found her nipple with his ring and middle finger. He clamped them together softly around her nipple, oscillating them to twist it gently while he watched her service his dick.

His hips became more involved in her sucking now, rocking forward slowly to try and shove a bit more of his shaft into her pursed lips around his head.
__________________________________________________________________________________

Her hand on his hips kept the distance between them and she continued to keep her lips tightly wrapped around him. Her tongue still gently swirling around the head of his cock, her hand movements started to get faster as she stroked further up and down his cock, jerking him off into her mouth.

She closed her eyes as he spoke, joking that she was enjoying herself. She was, as her warm palm rubbed up and down the legnth of his shaft, she got to feel just how smooth the skin was. He pushed his hand down her blouse easily, the front of it mostly open. Her bra was a bit tigher though, as her breasts were small, and took more force to get under. As his fingers slid under the white bra, he eventually caught her nipple, already hard. He pinched it between his fingers, squeezing it and clamping onto it as her hand continued to work his cock into her mouth, letting out a moan into his skin. She wanted to pull her mouth off to speak, but the rocks back and forth into her mouth made her feel as if she shouldn't pull away. He slowly started to work his cock just a few inches further into her mouth, working past her lips, her bottom lip now shiny with a mixture of precum and her own saliva.
__________________________________________________________________________________
He watched almost lovingly as she sucked so eagerly on his cock. *I should have done this months ago*, he thought to himself. The tightness from her bra clamped his hand against her small breast. He continued teasing at her nipple for a bit longer before pulling his hand out of her bra. *That thing just won't do.* His hand lifted back up out of her blouse and then down her back underneath it. His fingers hooked underneath the tight strap clasped behind her back and almost expertly pinched the clip together to single-handedly snap the bra free from her chest.

As her bra loosened his hand retracts back out and he closed his eyes for a moment, losing himself in the feeling of her milking his cock. His hands go limp for a bit while his hips continue to rock forward into her, making his dick slide past her wet lips and rake over her tongue, then back out again. ""You want to be successful here don't you, Becky?"" he finally broke his silence. His eyes opened and he continued watching her while she pushed his hips a little more her way.
__________________________________________________________________________________
She continued to moan into his cock as she twisted his fingers around her small nipple. Her eyes opened as his hand left, looking up at him. He began to slide his hand back down the back of her blouse, fingers grazing lightly over the soft skin on her back until he reached the clamp of her bra. She felt a quick pop on her chest, as he looked down it seemed as if her chest was more loose, along with her blouse, with her bra hanging lightly in it but still covering her small, tight breasts.

Watching his hands go limp, she took her hand away from his shaft, and began to just slide her lips up and down the length of his cock, keeping them tight on him to push the skin down. She quickly began to pull back, opening her mouth as his cock slid out, flopping heavily between them, the first third of it glistening in the light of his office from her saliva. Her right hand reached out, grabbing his cock, running up and down it quickly a few times. Each time her palm reached the end she ran her thumb over the sensitive tip of his cock. ""You did tell me I had to work for my bonus, Mr. Watts. That's what I'm doing. You do have a beautiful cock, you know. It's so pale.."" She stopped pumping with her hand, closing her eyes as she placed it back into her mouth, head first, and began to bob her head on it.
__________________________________________________________________________________
He could see his dick was nice and wet from her mouth now while she jerked him off. It was a sight to behold, watching her do that right in front of her own face. He could tell she enjoyed doing it probably just as much as she was going to enjoy the money from this bonus she was about to earn. The way she so casually sucked it right back into her mouth and continued sucking lit him on fire. He had to have more.

His left hand slowly reached to hers, his fingers intertwining with hers while he watched her mouth bob back and forth along his shaft. His fingers began to grip hers tightly until finally he reeled his hips backward, his cock slurping out of her mouth with an audible pop. He took a step back and pulled her by her hand, his right hand reaching forward and taking her arm in the process. He turned with her in tow, nearly tossing her onto the edge of his desk where his hand now pressed against the small of her back to hold her there.

That poor pencil skirt, the way he hooked his fingers under it roughly and hiked it up her thighs. The right side of it made it past her hips, bunched up with the left side still struggling against her tight body. He positioned himself behind her. ""I want more out of you, Becky."" His same hand lurched up and under her skirt, clasping around the thin fabric of her panties and raking it downward just as rough as he'd treated her skirt. It came down her legs in a twist and he left it at her knees.

All at once his slimy dick was slipping between her thighs, bobbing each way and painting her inner thighs with splotches of her saliva and his cum. He hoisted his cock against her warm slit and rubbed the lathered tip of his dick against her lips, dampening the few spots left of her pussy that weren't quite wet yet. The head of his cock found her hole and he let the weight of his body press into her backside, forcing the head of his cock and about half of his shaft into her all at once with a heave and a loud sigh. His body came down around her, looming over her while she was bent over his desk. While leaning over her his hand found the back of her neck and gripped it sternly while his hips bucked forward. His slacks muffled the sound of his thrusts into her. He could feel the rest of his dick coat in a thin layer of her wetness as he entered deeper.
__________________________________________________________________________________
Confused as she felt his fingers intertwine with hers, she opened her eyes, looking up at him, letting him take her hand, but slightly taken back at how lovey the gesture seemed, let down that he suddenly seemed attached. Suddenly, as the cock started to pull away from her, she kept her lips tight as her eyes went wide, his head getting caught on her lips and popping out of her mouth.
""What are you doing?"" she asked as he pulled her toward the desk, his right hand grabbing her arm as he easily pushed her forward. Her own momentum worked against her as she took a few steps forward and her hips hit his desk. She felt herself get bent over it, his hand pushing against her lower back, holding her against the desk easily. She didn't struggle, her knees against the desk and my flats not even touching the ground from her short size.

She gasped out as he grabbed onto her skirt and began to pull it up. It was tight and took a few tries to keep it above her thighs. ""No, no please..,"" she gasped out, feeling the air against her bare thighs, her stockings cut off just before her ass cheeks and her white panties tightly hugging them.

""No, oh my God, oh my God no, Mr. Watts please!"" She yelped out, his hand still holding her down by her back easily, although she struggled. Her hands on his desk flat, fingers spread, trying to kick her legs, her flats loosening as she almost kicked them completely off. Feeling his presence now completely behind her and his hand sliding up her skirt tugging her panties, she let out one last cry as they slid down to her knees, twisted up and preventing her from moving her legs.

Her plump ass sat up as her belly laid bent over his desk. Her asscheeks looked full and bare, the tan skin slightly shining andcould barely see the bottom of her pussy lips under her asscheeks. It looked extremely tight. ""Please no, Mr. Watts!I cant get pregnant yet I need to finish school!"" she cried out, wimpering as she felt his wet cock slap against her bare thighs, cooling them down until the head of his cock slowly made its way to her lips. They were already wet. She let out a cry as she felt him slowly sink into the warmth of her body, her vagina clamping down around his cock, squeezing it as it slid deep into her body as he held onto the back of her neck. As he began to thrust hard, forcing his way in as the fabric of his pants began to slap against her bare skin, her whole vagina tightened around his cock and suctioned on it. She could feel almost every vein as it sat inside of her, throbbing.
__________________________________________________________________________________
Once he felt how wet her pussy was he became deaf to her pleas. His hand was flat against her back just between her shoulder blades and the force behind his thrusts made the entire desk shudder. His free hand ran down the side of her body until his fingers splayed around the large plump mound of her ass cheek. He gripped it harshly and tugged at it, spreading it to the side to better watch his glistening cock slam back into the tight grip of her pussy. He could feel the tension as he reared his thrusts. It was as if her pussy didn't want to let his dick go and it only fed his lust for her even more.

His thrusts stayed deep in her, barely pulling out any before driving his shaft back in. He loved the feeling of gently prodding her cervix with the tip of his dick in every swift thrust. He began panting, working to hold her down to the desk and still fuck her at the same time. His balls slapped chaotically against her inner thighs with every shove of his body and he finally loomed close over her, his weight baring down on her while his hand let her back go. His hand moved around her shoulder now, his fingers embracing the her jawline and upper neck while he used her body.

""That's it, Becky. Take all of it just like that. Good girl.""
__________________________________________________________________________________
His cock slammed in and out of her, the sounds of him slapping against her ass and thighs with each thrust echos in the rooms, along with her weak moans, her hands still trying to dig into the desk. As he grabbed onto her tight ass and squished his dick into her vagina, pushing through her lips coated his dick mixture of their fluids as her pussy worked to hold his cock into her until he'd had enough.

He pushed deep into her young body, mounting her easily, and just by instinct she completely gave in. Holding her down for no reason, her body refused to move as he used her like a fleshlight. He continued to pound into her, her moans gasping with each thrust. ""Oh my god, yes, yes yes yes-yes!"" She could barely breathe, crying out as she felt all his weight on her, crushing her into his desk. She let out another squeal as his fingers slid up to her jawline, calling her a good girl. ""Fuck, Mr. Watts, oh my god.. I cant.. Fuck..""
__________________________________________________________________________________
He thrusted one last time for now into her, holding her skewered against his desk. His balls stayed neatly tucked between her thighs for the moment while he rose his body up again to stand up a little more straight. However, with his standing up he still held her by the jaw, pulling her back up with him and forcing her to arch her back. His free hand pressed down on the small of her back, still keeping her firmly planted against the desk while he craned her body. The sensitivity in the head of his dick started to skyrocket as he felt like he was going to explode soon, and he wanted it as deep in her as he could get.

He mustered up a few more pumps into her pussy for good measure, as if he was trying to find just the right comfortable spot inside her before he began grinding his hips into her ass, making his dick squirm in the deepest part of her body. His legs locked in place and his hand around her jaw slipped slightly down, gripping her by the neck now. Sweat from his brow slipped down the side of his face and to his chin while he held her in place and his grinding slowed to a halt.

The first stream nearly filled her up. He came more in that first wave than he ever had before, fitting for conquering his new little secretary. His grip never let up on her neck or lower back while he forced her to stay still while his dick swelled and twitched inside her, spilling more and more cum inside of her. He let out a loud huff of ecstacy, ""Take it, Becky. Take all of it.""
__________________________________________________________________________________
He held on tightly to her jaw, keeping her stomach pushed tightly against the desk, his balls pushed up against her. She arched her back with him, her body still pinned as he pulled her head back. She gasped out as he held her in that position, pumping a few more times until he sat tightly in her vagina.

He then began to grind into her from behind, slowly and hard. She moaned out, waiting for it, imagining what it would feel like to be filled at work, for this ten-thousand dollar bonus. He regripped the back of her neck and she fell back against the desk  as she cringed and squinted her eyes, waiting for the sensation of being filled up by this older mans cum.

""Oh, fuck.. I am taking it.. Oh my god.. Theres so much.. Mmmph.. Im trying to take all of it.."" She winced out, feeling the hot ropes of his seed shoot out, deep into her womb, filling her small belly almost instantly. He could feel his own cum start to fill the little gaps between his cock and her vagina as he held her down, planting his seed deep in her. She tried to lift her head for a moment, and then gave in. She lifted both her feet up, her toes curling, flats nowhere to be seen as her knees squeezed against his hips in pleasure from the sensation. She let out another gasp as her head drooped forward, feeling defeated as some of the cum began to leak out of them, dripping down his shaft and starting to form a small puddle on the rug between her legs. ""Oh god, oh god yes""
__________________________________________________________________________________
He still held her against his desk for a moment, feeling the churning of his cum inside her as his balls finally emptied. He savored the brief moment and then just as fast as he slid inside her, he turned his weight away from her and his cock snaked back out of her. It drooped half limp between the two of them as his cum came spilling out of her pussy. Drops and strings of it were still clinging to his skin as he finally let off the small of her back, though he still had her by the neck.

He continued in a panting voice, ""Don't forget to clean up."" He used his grip on her neck to turn her head more towards him, moving beside her now and using one more pelvic thrust to send his cock swinging upward and falling down with a wet flap onto her manilla folder. He tugged gently on her neck towards his dick before letting her go and it was clear what he wanted. His dick was coated in a thick mixture of the two of them. He then started to speak as he waited for her to finish him up, clearing his throat and speaking in a tone more familiar. ""Move my 10am tomorrow to 1130. I have a one-on-one at the Chrysler building after my meeting there. Matter of fact, just call Villanova's secretary and have her set up a lunch for me there. I don't know how long that's going to take. I guess I can just cancel that 10am tomorrow altogether...""

He continued to ramble, his mind completely gone from what just happened and the mess *she* made in his office.
__________________________________________________________________________________
She painfully moved her face towards his cock, looking at it, coated in both of their fluids. She tried to get as close as she could to it before lightly grasping onto his cock and tugging it gently towards her mouth.

As it slid between her lips, she tightened them around it, sucking with her cheeks while she pulled back, coating her lips with the fluid and trying to clean their cum off of his cock. It plopped out one more time, coated in just spit again, as she pushed a little drop of fluid back off of her chin and into her mouth, swalling it quickly as she stared back at him. Her hair was a mess, fingermarks on her neck, and the top button of her blouse was undone. Although her breasts were still covered, one of her nipples was visible through the light fabric and the other cup still clung onto her opposite breast. Both of her shoes were gone and her skirt was now wrinkled with little spatters of white cum stuck to her leggings. ""Sure thing, Mr. Watts. I'll be right out of your office in a few minutes and I'll get right onto that,"" she said, looking down at her vagina, examining it, filled with his seed.

I'm not really sure where the best places to look are. I don't have a car so transportation is a bit of a problem, so I'd really like to find something either on or close to the campus.

I'd appreciate any advice, especially if you're also in the same major and specialization and have found an internship already."
74k5ct,9,2017-10-05,Can you tell when you're about to doorslam somebody? And can you/should you stop it?,icemoons,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/74k5ct/can_you_tell_when_youre_about_to_doorslam/,"Warning: This WILL get long. 

I learned about the INFJ door slam a couple of months ago, and found it super interesting considering I've done it a few times. Now I find myself in a situation where i believe I'm about to do it again, and I'm not sure if I want to. I don't want this person in my life anymore but I'm not really sure if the door slam is the way to cut this person off, even though I can feel myself slowly ready to slam the door on them with every interaction. I don't know any other way to cut a person off.

As background: 
The girl I want to cut off is unhealthily attached to me, and I've somehow found myself in a position where I'm like a mother to her even though I've only just turned 20 years old (she just turned 18). We became friends through our job (she will admit she forced me to be her friend by harassing me about contacting her since we live around the corner from each other). Once I finally became her friend, she wanted to do everything with me, but only things that she needed to do, which was overwhelming for me because I'm extremely introverted and she barely allowed me any alone time, and realizing that she needed my help with a lot of stuff, I put her before me. I've been there for her emotionally, I've loaned her money on MULTIPLE occasions (even though we work the same job and then logistically would have the same income), I went up to a school with her to register, I've spent so much time helping this over dependent teenager with so much over the course of 10 months that I'm physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted. I'm going to school full time, working 30+ hours a week, getting set to graduate undergrad in spring and looking for internships on top of this. Even My family and close friends can tell that this friendship is draining me.

The reason for doorslamming, you ask?
It's a build up of small things that have happened over the past few months. She constantly disregards anything that's not about her. I agreed to pay for her birthday shindig thingie because she claimed to be broke (even though my own birthday was a week later) and she couldn't even help me find a ride to said birthday shindig, and frankly didn't care how I was getting there until I said I wasn't going, and she realized that I was paying for her. Once I told her I could cashapp her the money, she once again did not care if I went as long as she had money. She told me she didn't want to attend my own birthday event because all the attention was going to be on me. A week after I gave her the birthday money she bought $300 glasses. Honestly if I listed all she's done we would be here all day. The fact of the matter is she's emotionally and slightly financially draining me, and cares nothing about me.

I want to cut her off, I don't want to doorslam her, but every interaction I have with her I can feel my patience for her selfishness diminishing. 

 Please help, my family and friends say just cut her off, but as fellow INFJS I assume you guys know it's not that easy for me to do that to someone, especially to someone whom I feel needs me and has nobody else. How do I go about ending this friendship?"

I had a career change in 2008 within 2 years of graduation, when I decided I didn’t want to work in the exact focus I had my degree in. Around 2008 when the market crashed I became interested in learning more about finance, I was naturally attracted to Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, Ben Graham, and Joel Greenblatt. I basically read anything Buffett mentioned or that was associated with value investing. Around this time, I became obsessed with never being broke again. I cut back all my expenses, started budgeting, climbed myself out of credit card debt, and then student loan debt.

**W2 Job:** I worked full time at large corporate subsidiary for 3 years and was laid off very recently. Since then I’ve gone back to freelance and working on my personal business.

**1099 Income:** Personal business ends up being a minor part of my income, but it helps with taxable deductions.

**Budgeting:** I save about 50% of my after-tax income. I’m naturally frugal because most of my life I’ve had inconsistent income and not much of it!

**Mistakes:**

* While saving I didn’t pay attention to actively investing. I was a little burned from the previous two financial crises and nervous about jumping in.
* Didn’t buy real estate in 2013 when I had adequate savings and a job.
* Paid too much attention to individual companies when I first became interested in investing.
* I would have started working consistently sooner.
* I would have gone to college younger.

**Miscellaneous takeaways:**

* I used the avalanche debt repayment system, targeting debts with the highest interest first.
* Saving money has been incredibly empowering for me. I wish I would have got started sooner, but I’m thankful that it even happened.
* If it doesn’t make sense monthly, it will never make sense. I’m always in the black, I never dig into savings, and thankfully I haven’t had to tap into my emergency fund.
* Don’t be afraid to change careers or jobs. Follow your gut for when the time is right.
* The money will never be enough to fill your soul if the job makes you unhappy.
* I needed to hit rock bottom to get motivated. My personal belief is that you don’t help people by regularly aiding them."
74k8q4,0,2017-10-05,I faint when I hear about sex,Kubrickian1993,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/74k8q4/i_faint_when_i_hear_about_sex/,"So, I know you guys aren't exactly medical or psychiatric experts, but I don't know who else to talk to about this. 

Whenever I hear people talking about, or read a really graphic depiction of, sex, period blood, etc., I start feeling lightheaded, I feel like my body temperature is rising, and eventually, I black out. 

Someone on r/doctors described it as a ""vasovagal response"" or something. He (or she) recommended that I take it slowly with the right person. I've also read that I should tuck my head between my legs, and keep myself hydrated. 

That's understandable advice, I guess, but...I want to prevent it from happening in the first place. 

I hate that this is a thing that happens to me. I'm really, seriously ashamed of it. It's extremely, incredibly embarrassing; it prevents me from enjoying certain social situations (I was planning on going to see a nude stand-up comedy program in Cambridge tonight because some friends from my internship were going, because I've been trying to explore new things lately; but now I don't know if I can, because I'm afraid that it's going to happen again in public); and I'm afraid that it's going to hold me back in any romantic or sex life I might have. And that's a problem. 

I'm asking you guys because both my general psychiatrist and the social worker I used to go see didn't really give me any helpful advice. Also, some of you are older, or more experienced than me (or both), so maybe you have some weird tips or tricks, or just general advice. 

So...what's a guy to do? Is there anything I can do to desensitize myself? Do I go to a specific type of therapist? Please help! "

74lm84,50,2017-10-06,"Shifting my efforts away from gaming literally turned my life around. Long write up, but if you’re on the fence about quitting, let me convince you.",hagrids_a_pineapple,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/74lm84/shifting_my_efforts_away_from_gaming_literally/,"I struggled with games for a long time. RuneScape really occupied all of my time from fourth grade to 10th grade... when most of my friends stopped playing in early middle school. I have come back to RuneScape countless times, but there are a dozen other games that I have binged. Throughout  my ENTIRE high school career I never joined a club. My senior year I only had to go to class for two hours every other day, when I could have taken more and better classes to help me throughout college. However, I did have some amazing friends throughout my lower education and still had great social experiences. By senior year I had the girlfriend that I had been chasing for three years. Because I was so self conscious of my grades and pathetic school experience, I was too ashamed to plan on applying for college and looked towards the Marines. My girlfriend at the time convinced me that a 2.9 could still get me into universities, they just wouldn’t be top tier. This is probably the best decision I ever made in my life, and even though we ended in flames, I will appreciate that forever. By the fall of my senior year I was accepted early into two universities, and I would come to be rejected from the one that everyone at my school wanted to go to, where my dad went to as well. The university that I accepted at was... low tier in the state. Not terrible, but very small, and I got to watch my friends go to the BIG name universities around the state and get awesome opportunities. I made some friends, but started slipping into a depression. My girlfriend went to the university that rejected me, as did most of my friends. Whenever I visited, I felt like I went to a special ed school. 

I began gaming a ton, since there was nothing else to do. I got invested in Oculus Rift, was one of the best Battlefield 4 pilots in the world, and played a bunch of others. It began to take a toll on my relationship and my health.

I took a step back and realized that games were responsible for much of my failures and aspirations to do nothing. I decided to reroute my energy into something productive, 3.5 years ago. I started teaching myself iOS development with Swift. I was a CS major so it fit. I bought a Mac Mini and started the courses. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot, and released my first app the summer following my freshmen year, which was a HUGE win for me. People finally respected something that I had done.

Fueled by a win in the real world, I devoted my soul to getting pristine grades so that I could transfer to a much better university with a ton more opportunity and much more valuable degree. To accomplish this I left my gaming PC at home and only brought an Xbox, which I still played too much of but not NEARLY as much as on PC. I got in, and I finally felt like I was catching up. I was placed in a random dorm, and happened to get placed with a guy that would become my best friend and current roommate. However, I was still being a lazy piece of shit and I played games instead of going to class, instead of sleeping, and instead of taking care of myself.

By the summer after my sophomore year I had gained SIXTY POUNDS since my first day of college. My girlfriend soon dumped me for being a fat piece of shit. It was fine. I had met a girl the semester previously, and I kid you not I felt a twang in my brain when I first saw her as if a part of my future was recognized. I spent that summer losing 54 pounds and getting close to her. On September 23 2016 we started dating. I had complete control over my gaming by this point. I didn’t care about it. I was so happy around her and was doing good work in school. I began work on a very complex app.

I continued to enjoy my time with my SO, time with my friends, and working on my app as much as possible. Games hadn’t been an issue in 6 months. I decided to enter my app/business idea into my universities competition because people were excited about it. I ended up winning $6,000 and two awards. I was on top of the world. My family and friends had never been prouder of me. I was being congratulated by people I didn’t even know. The university wrote an article about me and the app. It was wild.

I took the following summer to build the app instead of an internship, but half way through ran out of steam. Since July I have been gaming in most of my free time. I have little motivation to work on the app that won me so much prestige, even though it only needs about 20 more hours of work. I notice myself getting extremely irritated with my girlfriend, and I don’t even want to hang out with her because it interferes with the time that I want to play games. I have been skipping classes again because I am so bored with them. Overwatch, Kerbal Space Program, and RuneScape have all been taking turns sucking my life out of me.

The other day my roommate convinced me to go to the career fair. I perfected my resume, suited up, and hit it off with five big companies, all of which seemed interested in following up for internships. I came home feeling on top of the world. I literally had the best resume there. I planned on powering through what’s left on the app, applying to all of these positions, and killing my homework. Then I fired up KSP and lost the next FUCKING 8 HOURS.

If the source of my laziness and failure had ever been unclear, I now 110% attribute it to gaming. There’s just too much correlation. When I game, it typically turns into an episode that’s detrimental to my real life. When I quit, my life improves drastically. It’s happened way too many times to be a coincidence. The second I chose to redirect my efforts 3.5 years ago was the second that I gave myself a chance. It’s sparked into something AMAZING.

I am writing this to read tomorrow and over the coming months to get myself back to where I was. If you feel like games have been blocking your true potential, you’re likely 100% correct. The second I redirected the energy to productivity (not Netflix, guys), I made monumental leaps. I had bouts of gaming binges here and there, but it was a definite upward trend. Now I just need to solve my current one."

Recently I have been trying to break into the job market again. I lost my previous job two years ago due to a manic episode and have been unemployed since. One of the stumbling blocks I have at the moment is that I am still paranoid of getting another manic episode if I were to get back to work due to stress which is a major trigger for me. I am on medication and I haven't had a major manic or depressive episode since my last manic episode. The last job-related thing I did was a six-month-long internship which went well and my pdoc has also approved of me getting a job but I am still deeply worried that I won't be able to handle the stress of having full-time work.

Daniel comes rushing in, one hand holding a foaming draft beer, the other already fumbling at his zipper.  
""Mark! How's it hangin'?!"" He shouts, whipping his dick out while stumbling past me to the urinals.  
""To the left at half mast, how else?"" I grin, breathing a lot more easily without that damn tie around my throat.  
""Sheeeeet, I know, right? God bless whoever invented company parties, high heels, and tight dresses.""  
""Don't forget wine. If they keep pouring the good stuff and the DJ turns out to be halfway decent...""  
""I know! To think we almost bailed on tonight, fuuuuuck!""  
I wash my hands again, letting the cold water run over my wrists, easing my burning pulse. It's not just the women who are eagerly profiting from the open bar. After a few of the better, stronger beers, I feel the pleasant buzz of my inhibitions clocking out for the night. I even start hoping for a decent rock 'n roll song to play so I can grab one of the ladies and surprise the whole floor with the result of two years of swing rock lessons. Nobody ever expects one of the younger men to know how to dance.  
Daniel's arm suddenly slaps down on my shoulder and he half hugs me as he smiles at me through the mirror.  
""You should grow a beard, man. It'd make you look like an actual viking, and then we'd look exactly alike!"" He burps. ""You know, except for the whole 'you white me black' thing.""  
I laugh. ""You know the boss doesn't want me to. I have to talk to people. Gotta look all clean and professional.""

So, this is my first prompt posted on here. I usually respond, but figured what the hell.  
The premise isn't revolutionary: a company event, music and drinks, people mingling. In this scenario, I'm Mark: 6'1, 165 lbs, lean and in good shape. I have short blonde hair and blue eyes, and I'm wearing my favourite suit: navy blue, white shirt, light brown belt and shoes. There's a NSFW pic in my post history that I can't post here because of the rules...  
The pic is a photo of me, but I don't expect us to trade actual pictures of each other. Adding gifs or images is always a plus, of course, but by no means a requirement.  
I very consciously haven't described a female character yet, because I want this to be open to anyone. You can be a colleague of the same age or even an intern who's slightly younger. You can be my team lead or manager or boss, of varying ages. As long as you're female :)  

I wrote this in FP, but am perfectly fine in third as well, and with either tense. I do prefer a few paragraphs per response, but in case of quicker back and forth that can obviously vary.  
I like a good build-up to flesh out the characters and make the 'action' more intimate. Which means I'm looking for long term rather than quick and dirty.  
My [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/CKzzLOS.png) is pretty straightforward. The main things to know is that I'm dominant rather than submissive, that I'm an ass-man pur sang and thus very much into ass-play (giving), and that all of the more extreme stuff is strictly off-limits.  

If you're interested, you can respond however you want. Get into the play, ask some questions,... Whatever makes sense to you.  

Hope to hear from you, ladies!

- I know some python, and will learn some R in school, enaught to implement some Dijkstra or sorting algorithm for instance, but I lack experience in coding.

- I have close to no knowledge of the financial world.

- I can be an insanely hard worker.

- I'm french (but who cares, really).

Given these information, I have to make all I can to be ready and not be considered a dead weight when my internship starts on march.

How would you suggest I plan my knowledge gathering for the next few months ?
Is there any well known reference publication I should know about to get started ?
I was planning on learning VBA, and get a glimpse at the 'Hull' workbook as I heard of it, but is there some more 'quant centered' book out there?

Hello everybody, I'm 25 and I'm still lost in my life.

When young, I was introverted, people often call me ""weird"" because I liked to be alone for playing video game, watching movie and series and reading books. I was the guy who hated school because it was not interesting but still have good grade. In middle school, I stayed with cousins and their group, doing bad things and trying to blur in the group. In High school, I left the group and started to study ""myself"" (prefer reading in public library about all subject I found interesting) and having bad grade. I still had my diploma.
After that I entered an software engineer school, became a little ""more open"" and I am in my last year now.

In my family, I have my two parents and 3 brother and 1 sister. I am the first one. Recently, my parents have arguments and in the process of divorcing. Myself have some argument with my parents about religion, choosing a wife and some other right thing (running away from my responsability) I'm not doing. I don't have social relationship with my brother and sister, just help them when they need my help with homework.

When I was teenager, I worked with my father. It was a physical job which make me wish to have a mental job. with my software engineer school, I needed to have some intership, which I did. The hardest thing in it was to find and do an interview, when it was about work no problem, just the social interaction a little hard to me.

Explaining simply, I rarely have emotion and I'm a lot undecided. I never attached deeply to someone, I don't seem to have a friend, my math teacher called me calculator, my ex-girlfriend called me robot. I think myself like a doppelganger, I copy what around me or in the movie. for example : when going eating with mate, i never order something I choose, always taking something one of the mate take.
I am bad at communication, should have learn when young but was reading.

My situation now, I'm in my last year of software engineer with a debt of 60.000€. I tried to find an internship for 2 month but nothing after interview. Still living with my parents but want to move out. I pass my summer holiday in nervous breakdown, didn't move out of my bed and I deteriorate myself badly. 
In the web, I have no account social network and other website, just a school email.
I feel since July, that I am losing my hand to my life. I want to start anew because the professional world is before me.

What should I do for going in the right way? I feel like I'm a newborn who slept for 25 years.

Thanks for reading, and future advice."
74nc7o,21,2017-10-06,[ASKFRANCE] How Necessary/Detrimental is it to greet colleagues every morning while working in France?,Nyamzz,france,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/74nc7o/askfrance_how_necessarydetrimental_is_it_to_greet/,"Hello r/France, sorry for the English but I am asking on behalf of an expat friend currently living and working there.

So basically, as the title suggests, my friend and I were having a heated discussion about this topic and I would like to give her the French perspective as I don't have all the answers.

She has been doing an internship in France for the last 5 months. When she gets into the office, she says ""bonjour"" to her desk mate and begins her work. But she has noticed that some colleagues will take a 20 minute tour to greet every person in the office when they arrive while others stick to their department/team.

She said it is an open concept office, and her desk is a two person island in the middle (she is not in any team) so sometimes if her colleague is not there, she will walk straight to her desk and begin her day. 
In addition, she works near her bosses (so she technically could talk to them on the way to her desk) but she believes it is not  proper to disturb your superiors, so she will not greet them either unless they do so first (which they don't)...

Here's the thing, she's Canadian and has lived in many other countries with the 'western' work culture. Which is basically the idea that people are busy, and no one will take offense because you do not stop by their desk every morning to say 'Hi' when you arrive or 'Bye' when you leave, just do your work. Also niceties/greetings are reserved for when you come into contact with a person directly (like at the coffee machine), or if you need their help with something (like a report/information).

As well, in most of her experiences, the boss is supposed to initiate contact with you first, and only then do you engage, otherwise the idea is to stay out of their way if it is not work related..

So she is having A LOT of trouble trying to understand why some colleagues may think shes rude or may act coldly towards her. And her bosses kind of treat her like she does not exist? (she said she has very little work to do now).

Her internship ends in a few weeks, so she is not concerned and doesn't plan to stay with the company, but she would like insight on the ""unspoken work rules"" in France so she doesn't unknowingly torpedo her career. 

So, can you explain how important the ""Bonjour/Au revoir"" thing is and why? Is it a big enough deal that it could hurt your career in France if you don't learn to play along?

Thanks"
74nf5x,11,2017-10-06,My [20F] BF [26M] berates me when he's stressed.,calixxxta,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/74nf5x/my_20f_bf_26m_berates_me_when_hes_stressed/,"My boyfriend [26M] and I [20F] have been going out for over a year at this point. We're currently living together and our relationship is pretty serious. We both care for each other a lot and enjoy our time together. For the most part, we don't fight a lot. Just a couple spats here and there. We did have some issues during the beginning of our relationship but we've talked about it to resolve them.


BF works in a high stress environment where around 2-3 times (generally lasting a month) out of the year he works an excess of 15+ hours in a day. Even during normal months he will work from home after work is over. I have no problem with him working as much as he does. He's very proud of his work and I encourage him to be. 


My problem comes from his stress. During these high stress level times everything turns awful. He becomes tired and over worked which leads to him snapping at me. It will often consist of me somehow triggering an event which causes him to snap. These can be small things like asking for a hug or asking him to grab me something. When he does snap he doesn't yell but rather berates me. It often follows the lines of "" I'm working my ass off to provide for you and you just sit around at home all day...."". I've repeatedly told him how I feel as though his comments belittle me. 


I'm currently a full time business student. I wake up around 5 every morning to go to school and often my days consist of 5+ hours of studying/school work. Outside of school I'm preparing for my CFA exam. It's been incredibly stressful for me as I'm in my junior year and my performance this year dictates if I get into the college of business or not. I also hold down an internship where I generally work about 20 hours a week. 


My money from my internship goes towards my school bills/tuition debt. I'm tired of my boyfriend holding ""providing for me"" over my head. I've offered to pay for half the rent (my entire salary for a month) but he refuses to take my money. It makes me feel like absolute crap when he says I do nothing and that I have it easy because I'm still in school. I don't think he realizes how hard school has become. 


I understand I'm not perfect myself. During times of high stress I'll snap too but it'll never be a direct insult. It'll be things like "" I don't want to talk to you right now."" or "" Stop asking me questions."". When I do, I apologize right after. I'll try to talk it out and make him feel better.


I've sat him down repeatedly and told him how it makes me feel but the situation never improves. In the past I've tried confronting him, which makes the situation worse, as well as leaving him alone, which leads to him not talking to me at all. 


When we try to have these talks he says that he's too ""tired"" for it or he just closes his eyes and ignores me. 


What do I do from here?



---   
TL;DR - My boyfriend often makes comments that his work/money is more important than my schooling and uses it to berate me."
74nm01,7,2017-10-06,Looking For Some General Advice,med_bf,MedSpouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedSpouse/comments/74nm01/looking_for_some_general_advice/,"Hi All!

I just stumbled across this subreddit. Super cool that it exists. So here's the deal. I've started dating a M2 student almost a year ago. I'm already established in my career (successful engineer) and we're both very much in love with each other. Although it has just been about a year, we're both mature (even though we're both mid / late twenties) and have had many conversations about life style, ambitions, quality of life requirements, children, marriage, etc. We see eye to eye on just about everything, and she is for sure the one (which we both have already said to each other). She is now a M3, and she is in the middle of her IM rotation. Right after this, she starts her surgery rotation. This is a very stressful time for her, and he spends almost all of her time at the hospital or at her apt studying / studying with friends at school.

I have a few questions, and I'm hoping you guys can share your experiences / make suggestions.

- She feels like I always ""give"" and she doesn't give enough. She gets very worried about not having time for me, which causes her to say ""I feel like I have to choose either you or medicine, and it's not fair"". This only happens when she's under an insane amount of stress not feeling like she's learned enough / having exams coming up soon. I often suggest just having us sit in a room together and tell her that that's enough for me, which it honestly is. I usually just read on my laptop / watch TV with headphones / work on programming / study material in my engineering field. But I suspect just being there is a reminder that she wants to spend time with me, and it may be a distraction more than anything, which is not good. Perhaps it is better to not see her for longer lengths of time than to be a distraction. With all of this said, any suggestions on this topic that you guys have felt helped? She means the world to me, and I don't want her to stress over thoughts of her not being enough for me. I want her to think of me happily and feel supported, so she can just stress over school and not me.

- We have been talking about moving in together next year for M4 if we can make it work (logistics with car / etc. because we live in the city, and where I am would mean longer commute times with trains / etc). Do you guys know if living together helps make the experience easier for both parties? I love taking care of chores (laundry / cooking / cleaning / etc), it brightens my day knowing I've give her a little joy / lowered her stress. Although my job is very demanding, I do have a lot more time than she does, and I've always shocking enjoyed keeping a tidy home. I've been thinking living together might give her more support of not feeling lonely, and would also help me feel her presence more, even if it's just a warm body next to me when I sleep.

- She is likely going to take a few away rotations. Any advice to making sure she is supported while having distance between us? I will miss her dearly, and I will have to find a way myself to not feel like I'm without the person I love, but I will fight through my emotions, because I know she's amazing.

- (EDIT) For those who had kids, we would like kids, when would you think is the best time? I know there is probably never an exact good time, but given that we are not married yet, and plan to do that during M4, would before intern year be solid? Maybe 2cd year residency? No idea here, but we're both planners and would want to make the best decision timing wise given what she has in front of her.

- Lastly, for those who have endured the process, I know residency could be insane, and would likely involve moving our lives (which I've already accepted as a possibility, even though she's going to try and stay local to our city, which is close to her family, thankfully my career is available everywhere), but do things eventually settle down? Meaning; once the first few years of residency are over, and she eventually becomes an attending (internal / surgery / anesthesiology / nuro is what she is thinking), does she have a more predictable schedule? Long hours, sure, on call, sure, but no longer needs to cram for tests, when she is home, she's home.

Thanks so much for any advice, and for those who have taken the time out of their day to read this. She's the one for me, and I just want to make sure she is fully supported through this process. Although I'd love to spend more time with her, and have more of a classic dating experience with her, I have accepted this unique lifestyle and I want to make sure she is getting everything she needs. Love is a powerful thing, and I am the luckiest guy to have found her.

I just found out I have not received any internship offers from any big 4 firms. Deloitte and KPMG did not even want to interview me. I am devastated and do not know where I went wrong.

I am a junior at UConn with a 3.67 overall GPA and 4.0 business GPA. I am in Beta Alpha Psi and have a leadership position in the social fraternity Phi Gamma Delta. I have loads of work experience and I went to almost every on campus networking event. 

What did I do wrong? If some big 4 firms did not even want to interview me, am I screwed next year when I apply for full time? 

I worked so hard for this and to see it all come crumbling down really hurts. What should be my next steps?

74pehr,2,2017-10-06,"Proof of the Venom That Flows in the Veins Of The Leftist Scum, Lack of Shared Values, and a Rambling Rant While I am Fucking Around on a Friday Afternoon",BudRock56,freeworldnews,https://www.reddit.com/r/freeworldnews/comments/74pehr/proof_of_the_venom_that_flows_in_the_veins_of_the/,"I like to peruse leftist news sites because I like to see what those schmucks are up to. These sites include Salon (a personal fave), Mother Jones (employer of the despicable piece of dog shit known as David Corn), Daily KOS, and Slate (aka “Hate”). I used to Tweet the shit out of the Twitter streams that flowed from these sites (until I became persona non grata and was totally banned from Twitter. I cannot even get an account anymore using friends’ data and IP connections. As soon as I log on from one of my devises through my ip, even using proxy servers, my account is banned within the first 5-10 Tweets. They have some kind of serious algorithm that keeps me off Twitter. I mean, I guess I could change ISPs and buy new devices, but I am not a weirdo. I am digressing far away from target, and will re-direct my thoughts). 

So, I was experiencing the bullshit offered up by these sites. They are actually fairly tame today. There was a particularly stupid article scribbled by David Corn (most likely in crayon originally) that caused me to suffer some mild gastrointestinal distress. I have not visited these particular sites - the worst of the worst - in a while. Maybe they had changed from freedom hating, borderline insane millennial scum-fucks into something a little less dumb and gross. Had they matured in my absence?

Nope, not one bit. Apparently today is a rare off day for these shitty sites. While wading through the festering pile of rat shit which is known as Daily KOS, I found a story (a “story” is a quite appropriate designation too, since it is largely fiction) with the following title: 

Kellyanne Conway Is A Soulless Cretin And We Are Not Obliged To Have Any Respect For Her.” 

https://m.dailykos.com/stories/1704396

Now, I have posted far worse than this about some folks. However, I am not a paid journalist at a company that holds themselves out as a legitimate news media outlet. I mean, I assume Daily KOS pays its employees. They could be college interns, I guess (or high school interns, for that matter). 

How can an online magazine of any caliber expect to be taken seriously when they publish a headline like THIS?!?  Calling the subject a “cretin” who is owed no respect?!? On one end of the spectrum you could construe this as an invitation to violence. I do not say this lightly. There was a time when we could get along with one another and only acted cunty behind closed doors. But now it is fashionable to be uncivil. I see it in my everyday life.

I live by the good old Golden Rule, and I have taught my children to do the same.  I go out of my way to treat everyone I meet with polite dignity and respect. My work requires that I deal with the public, so I do this every day, Mon-Fri. Of course, when I am at home sometimes I barricade myself in my house with my guns and dog and think to myself “Goddamn it, I fucking hate human beings!”  But after a glass or two of scotch (Dewers) and a couple of nice cigars over the weekend, it always subsides before Monday. 

That notwithstanding, people are generally getting the notion not only that it is OK to be an asshole in public, it is EXPECTED of them. I hate this. I hate rudeness of any sort. If someone acts like a rude prick to me and it bothers me I will usually call them out on it on the spot. But many times it is more peripheral than that. That is, you see someone being rude to someone else, or otherwise acting like a dick. For example, I absolutely hate litter. It drives me up the fucking wall. But when I see people litter, I generally don’t confront them because I don’t want things to escalate (I got a short fuse), so I just have to disengage. But it bugs the shit out of me. This is where we live, and they want to essentially foul our nest by throwing trash on the side of the road.  Sick fucks! 

In addition, fighting and violence are becoming more common. Why is our culture going to shit? Well one reason is that there are no good role models anymore. Moreover, nobody appears to have any interest in shared values. Look at the sick title to the Daily KOS Article. That prick who wrote that KNOWS better, he knows how inappropriate that is. Yet he chose to say that anyway. If he had any class and believed we need shared values to perpetuate our civil society then he would not have said that, nor would the blog published it. You don’t go around calling someone a “cretin” unless you are ready to take a punch to the nose. At least, that is how it used to be. With the threat of violence we used to lead a much more civil existence.  Of course, today if someone calls you a “cretin” and you punch the fuck, you may end up in jail. 

I realize that every generation witnesses changes as they age. But this is a little different. What we are seeing today is the dismantling of the entire social structure and regime that enables a functioning civil society. These changes will erode our republic and our civility. "

I am looking for advice on how I can improve. My situation:

-I graduate next summer (2018) at 19 years old

-My cumulative GPA is decent (3.7)

-My major GPA is lackluster (3.0); =&gt; result of my only completed upper-level accounting class (Intermediate Financial I) while taking 18 credits/6 classes total that semester

-I have not had an internship

-I got declined from an interview by every Big4. The five mid-market firms I did interview with also declined me for internships

I am at a loss for what I am doing wrong. I had even gone to one of the Big4's leadership days this summer and they still declined me for an interview. Even the mid-market firms seem to not be interested in me. I attend every pre-interview mixer available, and go into the interviews feeling very confident (I am sociable and relaxed).

I mention age in my summary because I am fairly young, and as of now that is pretty much the only thing I have going for me (young and very willing to learn).

And so I have to ask: what do you recommend I do? It is not normal for a junior at a target school to not have already had an internship, let alone be declined in every interview for future internships.

My plan as of now is to stay in school and get my master's in accounting.

I also have been struggling with alopecia (hair loss) for the past 7 years and so I am bald (no hair, eyebrows, eyelashes). I am not afraid to admit that I am not an attractive dude, but I will not downplay my social aptitude. I have to ask: exactly how much emphasis do these companies *really* put on your looks? I will get downvoted for this, but I have noticed that a lot of my friends who have already had as many as two internships are all in fraternities and quite attractive (despite not being the best students). I often talk to my accounting professor after class and he freely admits that a lot of these firms (esp. Big 4) recruit a lot from fraternities &amp; sororities because of their generally attractive appearances. What is the truth to this? With auditors being out at clients' offices, I see how it could make sense. I personally am trying to go for a career in tax. So how true is this stereotype?

What do I need to focus on? What are my options?"

I’ve been subscribed here and have lurked ever since I got started in my major, and I’ve learned a lot by reading conversations and looking at some of the links posted. However, I didn't see that a question like this had been asked here before, so I was curious if anyone had thoughts/advice/experience with this situation.

I have three semesters left in my undergrad, and have been looking for an internship position for next summer. I got a pretty good offer from a very large general contractor that would take me several states away from my current location. 

I think that this internship would provide valuable experience, but I’m not sure I want to go into construction management after I graduate. I was hoping to find something closer that is more aligned with my area of focus, and maybe see if that would result in a full time job after graduation.
The GC wants an answer by next Wednesday, but many of the companies I am interested in won’t start hiring interns until spring. Is it unethical to accept the position as a backup, but keep interviewing for other internships? I’ve heard that reneging is a good way to blacklist myself from this particular company, but other than my integrity, what else is there to lose? 

Thanks in advance.

I'm in the program where I have 3 of those 6 month internship / job time spread over the course of 5 years (18 months worth of job experience). While working, most of my coworkers talk about how lucky I am to have this opportunity to gain work experience before I graduate. They also wish that when they were in college, they had the opportunity I have. Not have I heard this from my coworkers, but I've also heard it from students who are graduating soon. Most of them have not even experienced applying for jobs. Now, I know my situation is a different than most because not many schools give students 6 months off school to find an internship/job. But, students can still find summer internships or even do internships during the school year. So, if schools were to enforce an internship requirement for students, wouldn't it be very beneficial?

I just received an offer to start a paid 6month  internship in the Tech sector over in the Baker area of Denver. The internship is night shift Sunday-Wed, with the other 3 days off. I thought it was imperative that was known as I might not be the most social or available roommate. 


I'm looking to stay within the immediate Denver area, I have been eyeing Capitol Hill due to its proximity but I'm not especially worried about a commute due to my shift. I'd prefer someone or someones around my age, male or female doesn't matter. 

 
For the most part I tend to keep to myself, quiet, clean and no pets or anything. Most of my free time will be chilling out playing some video games, depending on how well I adjust to the to night shift I might be a bit more active. Overall I'm looking for roommate(s?) who would be pretty quiet for the most part. 

I'd have to say my budget would be maxed out at $1200 but the lower the better. It would also be nice if the property/roommates did not mind smoking/vaping of cannabis but that's far from a deal breaker. Parking and laundry would also need to be discussed as well.

Anyways, I hope to hear from someone. Just hit me up, I'd like for us to get to know each other a bit and we'll see what happens."

I still remember that feeling.. that whatever I was doing was right.. 
Then we usually get caught up by everyday life and adult responsibilities and the fire slowly begins to fade.

For artists in particular it’s always worse; being a musician is a really different path from the standard, specially if you start doing music late, like me (I began playing guitar when I was 17). You spend your 20s studying like hell and doing all kind of shitty jobs and unpaid internship just to get some experience and some contacts. Someone gets lost here..

If any of you feels lost right now, here’s my story, hoping it could help:

When I finished high school, I was 19, I wanted to study music and go to a Music University to get a Degree in composition, but I wasn’t good enough to enter the 3 years bachelor and the only option was to enroll to the 10 years course. I gave up and decided to focus on my guitar playing. Back then, in 2010, there wasn’t any university course in modern guitar so I started to study with private teachers. One of those teacher was really strict, but really talented, I admired him and I wanted to be a musician like him, but I was struggling keeping up with his lessons while other students were always ahead of me. I was feeling like I wasn’t good enough and more than once my teacher told me that I didn’t had talent, that playing guitar wasn’t my path. 
But I was young and the fire was burning, so I didn’t give up and I put all myself into playing guitar and studying music and, in the end, I did not become John Petrucci but I did become a musician worthy of the name. 
In the meanwhile I was working part time in a music shop and I started discovering the sound engineering world and got passionate with it, so I spent all my money in guitars and studio equipment for the following 6 years.
The shop in which I was working wasn’t properly a good place to work in.. I had to deal with frustration and bad working conditions, anxiety and lots of stress that through the years  manifested as depression and panic attacks. From 2012 to 2016 I was doing 4 different jobs at once: the music shop, the touring musician, the teacher and the sound engineer; in the meanwhile I was bringing forward my studies in guitar, music theory and classical harmony. 
There, in 2015 I got lost. For more than one year I blamed myself and felt miserable. I just wanted someone to acknowledge me as the musician I became but all the things I was trying to do, my band, my studio, my music courses, despite all the effort I was putting in them, were going completely wrong for different reasons.
So I started thinking that maybe I was the problem, that maybe I was wrong, being a musician wasn’t really my path.
The fire was gone. I finally woke up and realized that I was 28 and I didn’t became a famous musician, I didn’t toured outside Italy once, all I was doing for the past years was waiting for an opportunity that never came and struggling with 4 jobs to survive.. And I hated everything. I started blaming my job at the shop and the Italian music industry and underground scene for my failure (I wasn’t totally wrong blaming them, but this is another story), but the fault was all mine. 

“Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.”

And that’s right. In the heart of darkness, the light takes shape. When I was surrounded by darkness and the only option left was to keep suffering through the life I was living or give up and start living a normal life, with a normal job, I decided to break the circle and build a 3rd option with my bare hands. I quitted all my jobs and applied for a one year music production course away from home. I sold all my guitars and my studio equipment to pay the course fee and the accommodation. 

That was the best thing I could ever do in my life. I regained trust in myself and my abilities, I won a scholarship and had some money of the fee back, I was able to manage my panic attacks and to win a lot of my fears and realize my little dream of traveling to Japan.

You’ll never know what life will put ahead of you and that’s the interesting part of life. We have a powerful weapon to face the unknown and it’s our Will. The Will of Fire. The Will to live a life worth living, fighting for our dreams.
We are artists, we are fighters and we are not alone.
As I’m writing these words I can feel the fire burning again inside me.
I’m 29, I don’t have a daily job (anymore), I’m a musician/composer/sound engineer struggling to emerge in the competitive industry of music business and the future ahead of me is foggy, but I am not afraid. I have the will of not giving up and I know that maybe I will not become an acknowledged musician or composer or maybe I will fail, but, in the end, when my time will come, I will look back and know that I have no regrets.

So, if you feel like giving up, don’t. If you are scared by future, don’t be. Life is too short to be afraid. 
Remember: 
All the lights in the sky are stars and every star is a chance.

Since we both graduated recently, we've been able to hang out more (though not too often; we both have multiple jobs and internships). Since last year, she's started dating somebody.

74sgsc,9,2017-10-06,"Not too happy about my tech writing career/job, is this what technical writing is all about? [23 F] What are your tasks at work?",azalea_rose,technicalwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/74sgsc/not_too_happy_about_my_tech_writing_careerjob_is/,"I've always liked creative writing, but I've been pushed to study computer science in university. I'm not a good or bad programmer, I'm just alright. 

I took a year off from school and interned at a company for tech writing. I applied for it because of my technical background and my writing skillz. I didn't really like it, but I was fucking off during my internship and spent most of my time not doing too much. Essentially, I was just hanging out with my coworkers, so it was alright. 

I just graduated and took a full time job for technical writing and I'm losing it. I think the work is entirely boring and I'm not sure if my experiences in technical writing are just bad, I'm not in the right field, or tech writing isn't what I thought it would be. 

I feel like for the most part, my job is just copying and pasting, with a little bit of rewriting. This same happened to me during my internship, but I excused the nature of that work because I thought I was just an intern. But the same thing is happening to me as a full time employee! My daily tasks involve updating some knowledge center with information provided by business analysts (just copying and pasting), finding out WHAT is wrong with the product based on some tool that developers use to track defects (I don't think this requires any technical skills. I'm just emailing developers to tell me what the problem is so I can document it). Sometimes I'll write internal guides for our team, but I just feel like this is all so useless. 

What bothers me the most from my experiences is that developers hate us. Whenever I ask them for questions regarding the issue at hand, no one responds. This happened during my internship and at my current work too. I wait a week to get back an answer. So while I'm waiting, I feel like I have really nothing to do.  

I don't have any friends at this company, I work through lunch, and sometimes, I get so tired of copying and pasting, I just fuck around for an hour. It's crazy, I've been recognized for my speed at getting work done. I'm just so confused because I'm just copying and pasting. It's not hard to copy and paste and just change a little bit of the wording. 

I feel like my skills in computer science plays no part in technical writing. I've started this job only 4 months ago and I really want to quit. Should I apply for other tech writing roles? Is this really what tech writing is? I thought I would be part of the dev team, working step by step with them so I know what is going on. 

If I said anything offensive, I'm sorry. 

I would just like to know if this is what technical writing is, and if you guys do similar work. 

EDIT: holy grammar, I swear I'm a technical writer xD "
74slct,26,2017-10-06,I saw a prostitute tonight.,goofyfuckinggoober,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/74slct/i_saw_a_prostitute_tonight/,"It's not the first time I've done it. She showed up, I had the money on the table. We went upstairs and I sat on the bed. ""You can make yourself comfortable,"" she said. So I took my shirt and pants off. By ten minutes, I'd finished and walked her out.

I'm not sure why I did it again. I knew it wasn't going to make me any less lonely, and I definitely knew it wasn't going to make me hate myself any less. An hour later, I feel the same as if I'd just jacked off instead. 

But I feel numb to the core. It's gotten so bad lately that don't feel any shame or regret for what I did tonight. Work has been so tough, I worked 60 hours this week and by God, I'm not bragging. I'm not built for that kind of life. I've been so sleep-deprived and it feels fucking awful, but in a way, it's kind of nice. I don't have the time or energy to think about how depressed I am, it's just work, come home, fall asleep, repeat. Working makes me depressed, but I'm painfully aware that work could be so much worse. I'm not micromanaged, which is a big plus. I have a great boss. I have an actual role, rather than doing bitch work. This is true, but it's also true that every morning, I commute an hour to the city for work,  wishing that I'll get hit by a car that day. 

Part of it, I think, is that this is not where I saw myself four years ago. Four years ago, I was just starting college. I was the family's golden boy, the gifted kid. Everyone knew I was going to be a smashing success in whatever I did. I was going into business; I was going to be a writer. In high school I got great grades without even trying. In college, the ""not trying"" part stayed, but the grades didn't. I didn't flunk out. I didn't even get objectively bad grades. But the thing is, I always knew if I could find it in myself to put in just one fucking ounce of effort, I could ace my shit. I never did, though. Since I hated my studies, I changed majors in my sophomore year-- yet another thing I thought might make me happy-- but my grades were pretty much the same. Halfway through my senior year, I started to panic because I realized that without ever having had an internship, I was basically fucked in the job market. I got an internship at a tiny nonprofit, parlayed that into a contract role, and started a similar role at a bigger company about six months ago. Like I said, it's not a bad job, and I don't think I actually hate it. It's a relatively small, humble company, and the role, too, is humble and low-paying. I think it wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have such high expectations for where I should be. I want a higher salary, but I couldn't tell you why. I don't want to live a glamorous life and buy nice things. I think I've just bought society's ""money equals worth"" narrative hook, line, and sinker. It feels like if I had a more prestigious job I could respect myself more, but I know it wouldn't happen-- I'd just find something else to hate about myself. 

Everyone always says, find a hobby, get active, you've got to help yourself before someone helps you. So I did-- I picked up a sport, and I've been doing it for about a year and a half. I've met great people through it. But I still hate myself just as much as I did before I started. It feels like the usual advice--get fit, find a hobby, meet people-- is for someone who isn't fundamentally broken. Someone who isn't like me. I can meet people and sometimes seem charismatic and fun to be around when I meet them. Sooner or later they always find out who I really am, and they start to drift away. I've never had a true group of friends, and I feels like I'm just acting whenever I'm hanging out with a new group of people. I have to keep up the charade that I'm a normal functioning human, that I'm not weird and anxious and standoffish. When I meet someone and I can tell they're awkward too, or aren't good at reading people, you should see me-- I'm confident, socially graceful, poised. It's easy to convince them I'm the person I've always wanted to be. But if someone has the slightest bit of confidence or social skills, it's like the real me comes through and I melt into a puddle sooner or later. It's gotten to the point where I can keep it up for quite awhile, but I always come out in the end. The real me. I feel like a slimeball, trying to convince everyone, everywhere that I'm something I'm not. 

I think I've written enough already and I'm tired. I'm going to have a glass of whiskey and pet my dog. I love her so much.

Shortly after that, one of the Big Four offered me a full-time audit position once I’m CPA-eligible. They knew that I had accepted an internship with the smaller firm and did not encourage or discourage me from quitting it. My full-time position will begin as soon as my internship is over because I originally wasn’t supposed to be CPA-eligible until July 2018. However, it now appears that I will be CPA-eligible in May. 

So, I have two questions. 

1. Should I notify the smaller firm that I have accepted a full-time offer? I am assuming they will pull my internship, which I am fine with. 

2. Is it possible that the Big Four firm will allow me to start two months earlier now? "
74u689,150,2017-10-07,Different WoW Culture in Korea,roddickgate,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/74u689/different_wow_culture_in_korea/,"From my previous post regarding how Blizzard seems to be failing in two aspects (1) population control (Lopsided faction and servers with low population) (2) Poor GM services, I received a lot of questions regarding how Korean WoW is different from US/EU. So I decided to write something that can tell you how Korean WoW is unique on its own. 

It is true, Korean WoW raid teams are generally PUG. But the terminology in Korea is bit different from NA. In Korea, majority of the raid team uses team speak (discord) and most players do come back to play with the same group of PUG again. If you don't perform well, the RL will notice and will not take you to raid next week. This gives incentive to players to work harder. 


PvE (Raid)


Most distinguishable feature in Korean WoW is that most raids are organized into ""Gold Party.""
Gold Party is basically auctioning items with gold. At the end of the raid, they divide the total amount of gold gathered by the number of players. They also don't accept any players that wants to join- the raid leader will check you on two aspects. (1) Ilevel and (2) Warcraft Log. From this, they filter out really poorly skilled players. 

Raid Leaders organize players into 3 groups. (1) skilled players, who will help low ilevel players (known as ‘guests’) and receive gold as a reward at the end of the raid. (2) guests - players with low ilevel, and only there to buy items to increase profits for skilled players and provide increased item loot table. (3) Achievement guests - who have high ilevel, however does not have a warcraft log status or achievement. They are kind of like interns, where they have to prove they are worthy so that they can join other raid teams as skilled players. They will not receive the gold payment in the end. 

Pros:
-It is less luck based since if you have enough gold from previous raids, you can definitely get item you want, as long as you win the auction. 
-It gives incentive to high ilevel players to come to lower difficulty raids in order to farm gold. This allows the raid to be cleared in a short amount of time since high ilevel players generally know about the mechanics of each boss. 
-It is one of the fastest way to farm items for players who just hit level 110 since you can buy items from auction. 

Cons:  
-If you are new to the game, it is a big curve because new players generally have low understanding of their class / don't have enough gold to increase DPS and HPS. 
-In the past, Korean servers had a lot of Chinese gold farmers because of this.
-High inflation - auction houses are generally more expensive and tokens cost around 33,0000. 

In case you are worrying about ninja-ing gold / items, it generally doesn't happen. We can ask GM to retrieve them, and also Korean WoW forum have a list of these criminals so it is difficult to play if you ninja even once. 

Mythic Key Stones 
-Korean WoW generally consider anything 10 below is LOW. anything 10-15 MEDIUM and 17+ to be HIGH in terms of difficulty setting. Most key stones I see, generally ranges from 10-15. I have cleared most dungeons within time, giving me +2 in the end. This is just from my exp, so take it as grain and salt. 




 PVP 


-Really dead. Arena - not very popular, but there are some players. Battle Ground is practically the only active part of the PVP in Korea, and Ranked Battlegrounds (not sure what you guys call it over there. Basically pre-made group battle ground) is dead. No one plays this. The only group you will find is abusers, who are trying to get 10 win for their artifact weapon skin unlocked. Even that is quite rare as well.

I heard NA/EU players casually leaves the group during raiding – i.e, walking a dog or have dinner appointment etc. Is this true? In Korean servers, this is almost never allowed and players usually clear the entire raid in one go, from top to bottom. Therefore, we only have parties that start from the 1st boss till the last. I heard NA/EU servers have almost every party for each boss because too many people just go in and out. 

On a side note, when I translated how NA / European Servers are also facing similar issues, it came to a big surprise to Koreans. It is true that many Korean users - dreamed of this ""American Dream,"" where there would be abundant mythic key stone +, raid teams, and even PVP users. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or inquiries. Not sure if this post made it clear how Korean WoW operates :) "

My sister brought up a family friend's daughter and asked what she was doing since we last saw her. My mom talked about how she is in law school and is getting a lot of internships and what not. 

I brought up my friend who graduated from Yale law school. My mom asks how I met her. I tell her that I met her on a Batman message board. She scoffs and goes ""She's probably lying. People who spend so much time on the internet never become successful.""

I just got so annoyed because my mom always has to make mean comments towards me and my friends. I'm having a hard time getting a job so she just automatically assumes I'm lazy and she assumes that people I talk to have shitty jobs or no jobs. Sure some of my friends may not have high paying jobs, but they do things they love like teaching, anthropology, writing, IT work, etc. Like they are living super happy lives while my mom literally spends all day on Facebook and complains to us about her job (She's an auditor at an energy company).

I know she may have been joking, or maybe she was taking a stab at me. But these days, I barely talk to her because I don't want to hear uncessary bullshit comments like that.

Has anyone else dealt with shit like this?"

Platforms: PS4 (reviewed), Xbox One, Windows, Mac, Linux

Developer: Question Games

Publisher: Question Games

MSRP: $19.99

A game commenting/basing itself around the struggles of game development with some (technical) struggles of its own

When I requested to review The Magic Circle: Gold Edition some time ago, it was one of those few occasions where I neglected to view the description of a game in order to surprise myself. Having only knowledge on the most basic concept of it, I expected a game where I take control of the hero of an unfinished game and try to escape it by slaying enemies through an, at the time, unseen world that seemingly held lots of interest and potential. Rather, all expected combat was stripped from my character and I was thrust into a uniquely fleshed out puzzle game centered around engaging characters and conflicts.

Reading certain articles about Gold Edition, I learned that it is a sequel of sorts to a text-based adventure of the same name, minus the Gold Edition in the title. This makes certain characters developing the game more relatable in the sense that it makes their hardships in creating a sequel in-game to this real game made long ago understandable. These developers are Ish, Maze, and Coda. Ish is the creator of the series who’s been working on the unfinished game you journey through for twenty years who cannot stick with one idea and move towards completion with it. Maze is a former pro gamer forced to stay on the project due to her brand and name having been sold to Ish until the completion of the game. Lastly, Coda is an intern freshly brought onto the project who’s deeply passionate about making it the best game it can be. Furthering interest for these characters is their underlying goals which act as foils to the goals of those around them, such as Maze’s will to sabotage the game to get herself fired and re-attain her brand and name as well as Coda’s intent to slowly take control of the game away from Ish and make the game she “knows’ fans like her want.   

Within the game these three are developing lies another character besides from you called Old Pro. Old Pro has been trapped in the game ever since it began development. Knowing full well that the game will never reach completion, he entrusts the player (or boss as he likes to call you) to fulfill this goal. Seeing how those within the game react to the actions of those outside of it and vice versa is perhaps the most appealing reason to fully playthrough this game as the direction of the narrative always maintained a level of quality which kept me involved in it and on my toes. On top of that, this quality gradually leading to a bittersweet ending that gives all-too-real commentary on game development made Gold Edition’s narrative even more memorable as a result.

Aside from the narrative, every other aspect of Gold Edition revolves around the theme of this game being in development. Gameplay sticks to this theme by including a mechanic where you can create magical portal traps to hack into creatures and steal parts of them which dictate how they attack, move, and determine who their allies/enemies are and attach them to other creatures due to their coding not being completely worked out. This ability, along with another one obtained later on where you can pinpoint a waypoint for your hacked allies to remain until you decide otherwise, is often used in combination with the aforementioned hacking mechanic to allow players to concoct multiple solutions to each puzzle in the game. It was really gratifying to finally solve an extremely mind-boggling puzzle and see other solutions online I hadn’t even thought of which required parts of enemies I never attained, encouraging me to go back and explore more of this modestly sized world for these parts and be surprised when I find hackable objects which unlock developer commentary by the characters, revealing interesting information about them and the plot.

There are two graphical styles within Gold Edition. One is a black and white ink-like style that is kept interesting with your surroundings becoming colorful with every step you take since you’re apparently bringing life to it, though it’s still a questionable art-style due to some creature models being rough around the edges. The other style is a sci-fi PS1 aesthetic that is really cool as it has the low-poly pixelated look of old-school games with modern day slickness and polish. On somewhat of a side note, although it makes sense narrative-wise, it feels like some potential was lost in not taking the chance to add in other visual styles based on different genres of games. Moving onward from that, music is perhaps the most faithful to making you feel like you’re in a game still in development as most of its soundtrack consists of a “live” orchestra with the composer commenting on fixes he wishes to make to songs in “real-time.” Yet, despite it being the most faithful to this title’s main theme, the soundtrack has no real unique twist like the graphics, gameplay, or narrative do in order to make it interesting to experience. 

You know what’s arguably more important than making an interesting experience? An enjoyable one. Clearly, I enjoyed Gold Edition, but I was most assuredly not a fan of the two prevalent technical errors which degrade the quality of this game to some degree. The first, and perhaps the worst technical error, is the fact that loading a save file or booting up the game takes up to 1:30; why that’s bad should be obvious. The second is a seemingly uncapped framerate which does more harm to the smoothness of the game than aid it as more often than not, the framerate is either low or wavering between being smooth and slow as a snail. While this doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things since this is a slow-paced puzzle game and is also understandable considering how many creatures can be onscreen at once, it still ruins the overall flow of the game.

The Magic Circle: Gold Edition absolutely nails its theme of being a game in development by basing all of its aspects around it. However, some of these themed aspects like the soundtrack and ink-like graphical style could have used a bit more polish in order to make the game that much better (please just make my life easier and pretend I’m holding up two fingers close to each other in order to better emphasize this point). Although not themed, this applies to the technical aspects of the game as well. Despite these parts of the game making the general experience less enjoyable, they don’t detract from the immense enjoyability I had with the fantastic puzzles. Most importantly; however, they don’t overshadow the memorability of the narrative and its commentary on the hardships in developing games that gave me a newfound appreciation/point of view for game development as a whole. I highly recommend you purchase this title as while it’s length may not be the longest, it’s satisfyingly challenging puzzles and unforgettable narrative make it a must-buy, keeping in mind the annoyances of some factors.

And although it isnt as big of a thing i havent got a post code but the road name and number which actually there are 2 of in that city. 

Ive emailed him some questions and to ask to view the property but does this raise any red flags with any of u?

Edit- yes its a scam his reply says we need to sign the contract before he comes back to the country to not waste his time. He didnt state it but oc this would involve the deposit. We cant view the place cuz hes out of country however he says theres 1 person staying there already (shared flat) so im sure there would be a way for us to see it if it wasnt a scam.

I got asked to go in for a full day interview. The gig is 5 hours away in a very small low key part of the country, which I don't mind. 

This is the first job I've really applied to and researched, and a lot of the companies I've been looking at want me to apply in the winter/early spring.

Sorry in advance cause I anticipate a fairly long post...but here goes.

Over the summer, I was living alone in the city for an internship. I met this guy on an app, and we surprisingly hit it off really well. We went on a lot of dates and took it really slowly; we didn't kiss until  nor even do anything remotely sexual until date #5. He'd sleep over a lot, just to keep me company, and we'd constantly talk while I was at my internship and he was at work. He admitted he liked me a lot, and I liked him too. I thought things would go well and we'd have more time together.

Summer ended, and I moved back into school so I had way less time to talk to him. I still made the effort, but after a week or two, he stopped putting in a lot of effort. We wouldn't text as often, and eventually, we just stopped texting overall. This was at the end of August.

I tried to confront him about it, and told him that either we give this a shot or we don't, but he totally avoided the conversation and acted like nothing was wrong. I was frustrated and stopped trying since then. He has since replied to some of my snaps (and I'd respond to his messages) and has added me on FB, but otherwise, our contact has been minimal.

I really liked our chemistry, and I wish things ended up differently, but I just felt like he wasn't putting in the effort. I know he's going through some personal stuff, and I tried to be there for him, but he pushed me away. I'm not trying to completely blame him because I know things aren't always one-sided, but I definitely felt hurt and confused, and I certainly made an effort.

I miss him a lot, and even if we don't talk anymore or whatnot, I'd at least like to have a conversation about what happened and what we should do since I feel like he's acting like things are normal whereas I'm still confused. Should I try to talk to him? I haven't initiated any conversation thus far, like I said. I'm just not sure what to do, and I'm scared to get hurt again, but this has been constantly nagging me all of September and until now.

Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help."

74w43e,30,2017-10-07,Andy Signore Allegations Confusing Timeline issues &amp; Odd Behavior by outraged people,WCSchneider222,ScreenJunkies,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScreenJunkies/comments/74w43e/andy_signore_allegations_confusing_timeline/,"First time reddit poster here, but some things about this whole situation with Andy are confusing me and I need to post about it.


First off, I do believe Andy has major issues and engaged in some inexcusable behavior. We may not know the whole story or extent yet but I think its certainly enough he should lose his Job. I wouldn't want to watch him anymore.

However, that being said there are some very confusing issues with this timeline and some odd behavior by some of the outraged people based on the time frame in which they claim to have known things.

First off JTE's Girlfriend April leveled the most serious accusation at Andy which included the possible involuntary use of a dildo. According to her the first encounter happened when Andy invited her to a party at Chicago Comic Con and it turned out it was only him in a room and then he tried to force himself onto her. Then even after that occurs she accepts an invitation from Andy to be on the fan cam and lets him through screen junkies put her up in a hotel. He then showed up uninvited to her hotel and took photos of her without permission and tried to use a dildo on her. So a few questions. Was JTE dating her at the time? Did andy target JTE's girlfriend or was it a coincidence. It seems odd to invite somebody's GF on the fan cam as a random fan. She claims he threatened firing her BF JTE if she talked about it, so it appears they were together. But since she needed a hotel in LA, does she not live there? I'm confused. Her story sometimes indicates she was with JTE and sometimes it seems to imply she wasn't (being in a different city and needing a hotel when being in LA)

JTE's actions also seem very odd in this situation. He knew for months about Andy's sexual harassment including the possible assault on his own girlfriend yet he continued working with Andy. I personally could not fathom doing that myself. If you want to argue he needed the $ and job then fine, maybe you could convince me. Maybe he needed to just put his head down and keep his employment for some time. But going on Movie fights with Andy as the host and playfully debating and interacting with him? Thats just so odd. I don't get it. Its very weird. You can watch the move fights clips for yourself. JTE does not seem to be under any sort of duress. 

Dani Fernandez, a member of another youtube channel and GF of Mark Ellis, has been very vocal about how outraged she is by this. She claims she called HR on behalf of the victims and was even crying when she was ignored. She even called out Adam Hlavac on twitter for not doing anything after telling him at anime expo (july 1-4) about ""inappropriate sexual messages he wrote to a female cohost.""  https://twitter.com/msdanifernandez/status/916393655023235075 It was bad enough to her ""to start acting, and post about sexual harassment. and thats how April came forward to me and I called HR"". However, despite being mad at Adam for not standing up to Andy &amp; Defy at the time and taking action herself, a few weeks later her BF Mark Ellis attended a Screen junkies panel at Comic Con with Andy. He seemed pretty into it and happy, he even gave Andy a big high five when he was introduced. 

Nick Mundy. Nick is getting a lot of credit on twitter right now for quitting screen junkies for moral reasons. He claims on twitter that, while he didn't know about the sexual harassment issues, Andy was an ""ass"", a ""piece of shit"" and a bad person. He said the environment at screen junkies was awful and ""toxic"". He said it was so bad and Andy was such a bad person that all these sexual harassment and assault stories don't surprise him at all. However, for being such an evil guy creating such a bad environment, Nick was sure ok with working for SJ and Andy for years. He even got is own show and was a major promotional piece in the launching of plus. It wasn't like Nick was some shy intern, he was a huge on air personality and one of the faces of screen junkies for a long time. you can yell all the words you want but action is more important. Nick stayed on a major face of SJ for years, accepting his own show from Andy. He let Andy give him fame, he got to meet huge celebrities. He gained a lot from Andy's employment of him, yet he was EVIL that whole time? Hard to give nick props as some morality warrior when he was ok gaining personal profit for a long time from the Man he says was evil and helping that man build up how power, brand, and wealth.

Also with all these people knowing things, its weird that people in their groups kept associating with Andy so long. Dani Fernandez and JTE have major connections with collider, yet collider continued to associate with screen junkies and act like nothing was going on. Did they not tell anybody? Were they ok with their fellow workers continuing to guest on shows and panels with a sexual predator? They didn't want to give them a heads up? 

Edit: Also forgot to mention there was a Screen Junkies party at Comic Con that a lot of the online personalities that are commenting on this went to who had connection with people who knew what was going on. Did they not know or did they go anyways. Seems like the worst environment for Andy given his issues.

Plus the truck is also immaculate and has super low mileage, 89,000. It's too nice to drive in the winter and I would love to keep miles off it in an effort to keep it as nice as possible.  I've always had a keen liking for hot hatches, even if my friends think they look ugly. Long story short I've been shopping for a hatchback. I have now driven both the Golf GTI and the Focus ST2 and I think I like the Focus more. The reason I am making this post is to see what you guys think about the Focus for a college student, in particular the one I test drove which you can see here.

I live in Fargo ND right now, but I might have an internship in Minneapolis MN this summer and I will have a decent commute from the place I will be living to where I will be working, and I don't want to use my truck for that drive. Any information you guys can give me about the car, and whether or not the price on this one is a good deal would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all for your time and responces."
74wk95,20,2017-10-07,Update: I feel like a new man,CDH5x3,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/74wk95/update_i_feel_like_a_new_man/,"This week has been a rollercoaster for me.  
The past several days, I had felt awful. On Tuesday, I had an extremely awkward encounter with a girl (which you can read more about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/745o35/forever_creating_awkward_situations/)). I was also beginning to stress about my upcoming midterms.  

On Thursday, I was down in the dumps because I kept overhearing
my classmates talk about their interviews with internships, and even getting an internship lined up for next summer. All of this talk made me believe that I was a failure, as I did not receive a single callback from any of the companies I had applied at. That night, I was too angry and upset to focus on my upcoming Linear
Algebra test, which was the following day.  

Yesterday (Friday), I took my Linear Algebra test, which I assume I bombed because I wrote fully complete answers on no more than half of the problems. I walked out of the test high on anxiety, worrying about my grade in the class.   

Later, in the evening, I worked on a programming project for another class. Programming in C is a pain, but I somehow managed to complete it.  
I was finished with my programming project, and you know what I did? I proceeded to intoxicate myself with vodka and whiskey as celebration.  
After about 10 shots, I drunkenly speed-walked a mile in the rain, just to get some food. I ate my food while walking back, and I feel asleep shortly afterward.  

This morning, I woke up and felt like a new man. I felt like a completely different person, much happier than usual. Heck, it felt like I had warped back 12 years. The cartoons and newspaper comics I enjoyed as a child were on my mind, which gave me the idea of writing a comic with a FA as the central character. I felt the best I had in years.
The problem with all of these good vibes, is that they won't last forever. With four midterms this coming week, I know it could all collapse like a jenga tower.  

**TL;DR** I had a rough week, got drunk, woke up the next morning feeling awesome.

74x300,4,2017-10-07,"Me [29/f], starring in a Tale of Two Swedes. A story of love and possible deportation.",Please_helpwiththis_,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/74x300/me_29f_starring_in_a_tale_of_two_swedes_a_story/,"I [29/f] am a Canadian citizen/longterm expat who recently relocated to Sweden to live together with my boyfriend [31/m] of three years, who is a Swedish citizen. If we were to break up, I  think I would have to find a way to change my visa (I'm self-employed) or risk having to go back to Canada, where I haven't lived in 5 years. 

Things are pretty good with my partner, we met as interns at the same company here in Stockholm, and were mostly long distance with short periods together before moving in together permanently in June of this year. I am dealing with the passion sort of cooling off after being long distance, which I was prepared for. 

There's one problem that has arisen for me. About a year before I met my partner, there was someone else I met while at university in Sweden (he is also Swedish), let me call him J [28/m].

J and I hit it off majorly from the moment we met. I for one sort of fell in love with him at first sight, something that's not normal for me. Sadly, J had already accepted an opportunity to do research in SE Asia, and knowing that I was almost done with my study and he was going to be gone for an unknown amount of time, we decided it couldn't happen for us. We had some wonderful times and finally kissed goodbye under the streetlights on his last night in town, and I never saw him again.

Until a few nights ago. He's now back in Sweden and living close to me. I obviously moved on, but he never totally disappeared for me. I was thinking a lot about him since being back in the country and thought actually seeing him, instead of just thinking about it, might help bring me back to reality and show me that I'm much happier with my current partner. Well, we ended up talking for hours, closing down the final bar, and it was so obvious neither of us wanted to go home. We didn't talk about 'us' particularly, he just said he hasn't been with anyone else and is unlucky in love.  Nothing happened between us, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish it could. 

I love my partner, he's a good man and I don't want to betray him. I also love this country, and the thought of going back to Canada is very scary to me. I know I should just put J behind me once and for all, but I can't deny the thing between us. It's been there since day 1, before and through my current relationship and clearly still alive and well all these years later. I don't believe in soulmates really, but I can't shake him.

 Please help knock some sense into me!

I was attempting to apply for a new credit card and I filled in the information that I thought was correct for my income and rent expenses. I had an internship this summer and my rent is per semester, so I just filled in the numbers based on previous years information. I have a credit freeze on my account, so I had to call in to give them the single-use pin so they could access my credit report. During that call, they asked me about my income and rent, and eventually, they said I would have to go to their bank to give proof of income (basically give them a paystub). I'm looking at my finances and now I realize that I made a miscalculation. I used the amount I made from my on-campus job last year ($8000) and added that to my internship's ($16000). However, since I didn't work my on-campus job during the summer, I'm only making about ~$4000 from there this year. So I reported $24,000 income to the company instead of $20,000. I also looked more closely at my rent and found that it's about $1060 per month and I reported $940 (I assumed a 5-month semester during my initial calculation, but it is, in fact, a 4.5 month semester). What should I do? I understand that this could be very bad and I don't want to get in trouble for giving incorrect information in my application."

It's terrible, don't watch it, but do watch [this scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC21keB1yaM)

I just really love the idea of fulfilling a student's dream in that way and making it into something kinda cliched in its hotness, if that makes a lick of sense? 

I'd love someone to talk more deeply about this, and now, onto my usual introduction with all the usual roleplay scenarios listed!

Ahem. I'm Gwen, an Englishwoman, mother and teacher. I'm looking for fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png)

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
74yary,6,2017-10-07,Friends.,Zenniker,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/74yary/friends/,"Hey guys, just your typical 17 year old fresh out of a pretty rough breakup here. For the past four weeks I've been out of state taking part in an internship that I've had lined up since I graduated high school, leaving my family and girlfriend of sixteen months behind. In the most recent week, my girlfriend has shown signs of falling out of love, barely texting, no I love you's, until eventually she dropped the typical message every boyfriend fears. ""We need to talk"". Followed by a call and very straight forward dump with the reasoning of ""I'm not happy anymore"" and ""I don't feel as in love"". I begged, I cried over the phone and asked her if there's anything we can do as a couple to fix the problems you feel have hindered our relationship. ""No, i'm sorry"". And that was that. I felt alone by myself, four states away from my family, and without the person I felt was my one and only. Upon receiving the news, I reached out, via text, to a few of my friends of mine. 

This is where I really want to start this post. 

These are the people that will TRULY pick you up when you are feeling completely down and out. These are the people that will express their concern for you, from start to finish, and be there to make sure you wont fall into the darkness. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE that will be there to weave you a rope made out of threads of laughter and distractions for you to climb onto when you feel you've fallen into the deepest pit of sadness and loneliness. These are the people who have revived my willpower to keep believing in myself through this horrible disappointment. Let their kind words and silly antics be a beacon for you. Hang onto these friends dearly, tell them how much you appreciate them, tell them how much you love them. And for those of you who feel completely encapsulated by the thought of having no friends to call your own, reach out. Talk to someone, ANYONE, the most common conversation starters start with ""How are you"". Tell them. You'd be surprised how many people are wiling to listen to you.

Keep strong you guys"

At the end of August I was working out more and losing weight somewhat healthily but then I got into a binge cycle. Two weeks ago I tried to make myself throw up, which I haven't done since April. No one knows about these things. People say that I'm a confident person. Haha I guess I'm good at faking it. This is my final year and there's so much stress with my tough classes, internship, and applying for grad school and I don't know why I waste hours to fucking binge when I have so many things to do. But I digress, hi everybody. I'd say it's nice to be back but it's not really all that nice. However, I do really appreciate this sub and the community here. Thanks for existing, I guess. "
74zc7d,5,2017-10-07,"Alright; the first episode of the new season still isn't as good as the first season, but still a massive improvement over the last three.",prince_of_gypsies,OnceUponATime,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnceUponATime/comments/74zc7d/alright_the_first_episode_of_the_new_season_still/,"(opinion) I thought the show sucked major ass on from mid season 3- but I still kept watching due to me hating unfinished stories.

So after 3/4 seasons of unbearable writing it was like a gift from the gods that season 6 finished Emmas story, but then Henrys had to go on/*start*.

As far as I'm concerned until I watch the second episode I haven't properly started a show. If the pilot doesn't land for me I can easily just stop. So I just watched the basically ""re-pilot"" for the show and I gotta say... it really doesn't seem half bad. The writing still may not be as clever or engaging as season 1, but it's a lot better than anything since Peter Pan (I honest to gods can not remember anything after that except for the Wicked Witch showing, Hook joining the main cast up and Frozen being a part of this universe) and the show doesn't look like ^complete amateur filmed the whole thing (like, seriously. The first season looked like some high quality stuff and later it looked like the writers themselves, or some interns filmed and edited everything).

So OUAT, you win again. I'll keep watching, but please don't end with another story breaking cliffhanger in case you start being awful again.

EDIT: I just wanted to add that the actors that play Cinderella and her step-mother are both fucking awful, the girl who plays Lucy is pretty good as far as child actors go."

I am Junior college student with Statistics major and Computer Science minor. My plan is to work as a data analyst after graduation, and then, in the next few years when I've gained decent work experience as well as earned my Master Degree in Statistics, I will try to be officially a Data Scientist.
For this Summer, I am trying to apply for a Data Analytics internship. I've talked to a few people on Reddit about my qualifications to apply, and they said it would be great if I can put a project using statistical programming languages. Now, as I only have the knowledge equivalent to the first semester of a year-long Applied Probability and Statistics course, I don't think I can do much with fancy data analysis or machine learning. Hence, I try to focus on Data Cleaning and Visualization, which I can compensate the lack of knowledge by my coding skill.
For the project, I intend to perform a study of 10 - 15 graphs, charts and their applications. For instance, when to use boxplot and what we can learn from it. I will choose some not-too-dirty data sets to perform basic cleaning as well. And all the code for graphs, charts and cleaning work will be available in both R and Python. There will also be brief analysis regarding descriptive statistics for each graph. With that idea being said, do you have any advice or idea on which kind of graphs I should include and which datasets I should use to make those graphs? It would be great if we have a website that provides comprehensive information about various kinds of graphs.
Also, as a beginner, I am still a bit unclear about data cleaning. I know dirty data may be missingness, incorrect data, or bad-formatted data, etc. but overall, given a dataset, I may not know how to conclude when the data is clean enough for me to do all the work. So, I definitely need some advice on that too.
Please help me if you can. I value our kinds of input you gave. The project itself is a beautiful learning experience for me, which helps me a lot in the future. Thank you so much!"

First of all thank you all for the amazing info and support on this community. It has not only help me lose weight, but I have become more confident of myself and my abilities. 

Also, I started Keto and gyming while interning this summer. Sometime in July, my weight was around 257 lbs. This is before keto. To be frank, I had accepted to live as an obese person, had lost most of my hair by 25 and with that my confidence while talking to others, specially of the opposite sex. I had accepted rejection, so much so that I texted a crush of mine reasons why she might not have any feelings for me, reasons which were nothing but how I portrayed myself physically. I right now really feel lighter, just figuratively though, getting that out of me.

So I lost around 20 lbs on the internship, which wasn't about body building or physical development. After that I went to India!! I landed sweating on the airport not only because of the temperature but also because of the thoughts of getting kicked out of Keto and gaining that weight back. I was back home after a year, fortunately with an unexpected support from my father this time for building up some muscle mass. I don't know if I was in ketosis while at home but I lost a 3-4 kgs in 2 weeks there.

Now I am back in my college for another quarter and you know what? I am receiving random compliments, even from people I only had acquaintances with. People are noticing the transformation in me, more importantly I am noticing the change in me, in the way now I interact with people. People have asked me for what I am doing to get into a good shape within a few months. They might be so amazed because I didn't see many of those people during my internship or stay in India. I am trying really hard to get into proper Keto mode again, but a grad college life makes it a little harder, specially the idea of IF.

I met that girl again, several times. We have a very close group of mutual friends. We talked like after months, maybe after June and probably we are better friends than what we were when I had left for the internship. It's most likely that she still has no feelings for me, it hurts a bit to know that but I feel really cool about it. 

This is probably the happiest I have ever been lately and you know what, whenever I feel demotivated, I go back and read those reasons I had texted her not because I feel sad about that episode, but because those words actually were how I used to perceive my own being and how I have managed to change it quite a bit!! Still a long way to go, but I ain't stopping any time soon...

P.S.: sorry for the long post... I know I might be going through this post in times to come and think what a fool I was to post it here. :P

Need Advice: getting a pack of chiselled abs has been a dream and I think now I can if I lose a couple of pounds more and work out. If someone has gone through this transformation here please help me with some advice on how to!! CW:220-221 lbs, M/25, 5'10""."

Previously on the pursuit of sluttiness, aka my life, I was left walking on a leg. A girl with whom I had strong expectations for had let me down the best way possible. My burden of a karma drags me down just the way I deserved.

I met her about 5 years ago and beyond the sea, she went back to England. I then moved to England; she moved to the US and came back 4 years later for a week where we hooked up. She then contacted me one day out of the blue to tell me she wanted my help to correct some motivation letter for an internship in Paris. She got it and we met, hooked up and finally screwed. She then texted me one day to tell me, “Ha-ha I met another French guy. “

It came to my face like a Mcgregor punch, and my hopes of settling down with a lady were once again thrown upon thin air.
But I’m the type of guy that never settles down, roam around the town causing mayhem and screwing your sisters or daughters. I kiss and love them for a night. To me, they’re all the same and the princess I mentioned above was proving me right.

Back to the horse fuckery, I swore to myself that I wouldn’t get soft and fucked all over again. With that, I was willing to act entitled, living like a millionaire without a penny, no tomorrow like my life would last a million years.

One evening at the base, my friend Sofian came to me and asked if I were keen to get out and get a quick one at the (fake) Irish pub down the camp called Public House.

Fake as shit because no one speaks English there, the decoration and furniture is a mix in between a fucking steak house, a southern French casa house and is obviously overpriced. But they serve Guinness and the fat female hippopotamus looking for a military husband with insurance, deployment bonus and Tricare doesn’t go to that dive.

That’s enough to convince me.

We went there, what started as a, “We go for one! “ was now a bold defined lie as I was already pumping willing to get nasty and clearly the population there just inspired me to slice my own dick with a rusty kitchen knife. Sofian on the other side was steaming but we needed a sparkle to convince him to go out.

As we went for a ciggy the waitress told us, “Have a good evening lads“, I looked down on Sofia and said:

Thom: Did you pay for all?

Sofian: I didn’t pay for shit.

Holy fucking tits GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!

We are rushing to the parking lot and that was it; the sparkle Sofian needed was now here. We just saved about 100 quid that we were willing to spend here, which means we must go somewhere else and spend them.  But it’s a fucking Thursday night, it might be an absolute craig in London, but in Frejus, it sucks ass there. Suddenly Sofian did came up with a brilliant idea:

Let’s go to a sex club!

Like yeah it’s lame as shit, but it not as lame as going to the ladies of the nights. So we used this pearl of technology called Google and soon we find shoes to our feet, So L’Absolu in Cannes it will be.

We got some take away booze, some rock blasting, even sang and chant over, “How you remind me” from Nickelback. On the way… little did we know, though obvious, were on the stairway to the lamest night of our lives.

We finally arrived at the club and went to parking our cars next to dozens of Porsches, Ferraris Maserati’s and other small penis kinds of sports cars. We walked up to the entrance where the bouncer stopped us:

Bouncer: Good evening guys, are you in the service?

Thom: Yes, we are, it’s the haircut that gave us away.  Right?

Bouncer: Okay guys, I’m gonna be honest with you, normally I should not let you in, but I’m a retired Marine paratrooper so I’ll be nice. Park your car away from the parking lot; a Peugeot doesn’t look good next to a Jaguar. If your mate has some smarter shoes and a shirt, then I’ll let you in.

Thom: Roger that. We’ll do that.

Thank God, this moron of Sofian has his suitcase in the trunk so he was able to change himself. We moved the car and left the parking lot and hid the shitty Peugeot down an alleyway.
Once we came back the bouncer gave us a big lecture on how they do not tolerate military style bad behavior. For Christ’s sake, they even made us sign a contract saying we respect everyone’s sexual directions and that No Means No as if we were about to punch homos and rape women.
We passed the door and paid a 70e fee. When I think about it, I really should’ve saved those or let this one off my karma and paid those fake Irish pub waitresses.

It looked exactly like a normal club, a cloakroom, a dance floor and just hooker like dressed ladies, I was wondering how the fuck does this work, so in order to figure out I went to the bar and ordered a few shots for me and Sofian. Once intoxicated Furthermore, I was willing to understand it better.

Later that night I was in the smoking area when this 40-year-old looking milf, wearing stockings came and sat next to me, paying no attention whatsoever to my existence.

Thom: Hey darling, you look like someone that could give me directions.

Milf: How so?

Thom: Well, I’ll bend my knee and admit that I’m clearly a cherry here, and you look a bit more savvy about the way this place works.

Milf: Oh, that’s so sweet, you’re so innocent, I love it!

Now keep in mind that I lost my virginity about 8 years ago. I discovered rage drinking about 10 years ago. I brawled my way through life, being the biggest dickhead on earth, yet all it takes is to go to a libertine club to be innocent, logic is damned.

Thom: Well I guess. So, what’s your word?

Milf: So it basically works like a club, a normal one. But upstairs there is a room when people can fuck and do the worse things they ever wished.

Thom: Oh alright, so it’s like a mainstream club where you don’t need to bring the girl home, sounds great to me.

Milf: Well, almost yes… You’ll see. But if you want you can go upstairs in about an hour or so and there will be people doing their thing and you can see for yourself.

Much obliged for that advice, I carefully executed and went upstairs with Sofian an hour later.

What I saw was insanely fucked up.

In the first room was this one chick getting boned by 8 dudes. Then one look to the right this bird was slapping the white out of a guy munching her pussy. Then the next one was just a guy and two girls having a threesome. What’s even weirder is that everyone was whispering, and being as quiet possible while in the darkness you could hear some balls quivering on some arses and some bints moaning like a pig getting its throat sliced.

I and Sofian were watching this with such great shock and absolute hilarity. Never have I ever set a foot in such a fucked-up place. I was walking around the corridor, kinda watching with curiosity like a voyeur; not because it aroused me but because I was surfing an unknown wave.

There were these two hot chicks in leather stockings chatting, so it’s my chance to shine. I approached them with a shitty pickup like, “Hey what you two are doing alone?“ Soon enough shit hit the fan and they were on the bed with Sofian and me.

The blonde one was blowing  Sofian as I was going down on the brunette to eat her out. Even though it sounds wrong now, it seemed like a great idea at the time.

I quickly changed my mind once I reached her pussy where she probably had about 5 piercings on it. I thought, “Fuck that shit, I’m going straight to ramming,” even though I was not fully serene since all those piercings may be able to break the fucking connie God knows.

We switched girls and as I was now doing the blonde one in doggy, I noticed there were about five to six guys wanking or watching like perverts behind me. I had a bit of a “uh oh” moment, while I was looking at them the girl I was knobbing went from ‘Haaaan’ to ‘Hmphrrfff’, like if the moans were suffocated somehow. Well don’t look further, there’s now a grey-haired man shoving his dick up her mouth and some more dudes with their dicks out on the other side of the bed.

I decided to leave the gangbang when some other dudes started fingering the chick’s ass as I’m taking her from behind, resulting in having another man’s hand rubbing on the base my dick.

That’s it, I’m out.

As I’m walking off, putting my pants back on, this woman in a glitter dress, #divorcedwith2kidsbutIdofitnessandIamafreewoman looking lady interrupted me:

Cougar: Hey, you are new here?

Thom: Well yes, I am, how do you know?

Cougar: You don’t look like the other people in here.

Thom: Whatever you meant with that, I want you to know I take that as a compliment.

Cougar: Hey baby, don’t be judgemental.

Thom: Well sorry, I guess I’m just not used to this.

Cougar: Oh you’re so sweet and innocent, tell me what you’re used to?

Thom: Well lead the way.

We went to that lounge room with no one there. I sat down and she put her legs on mine, put her hair back and folded her hand on her knees

Cougar: I’m listening

Thom: Well you know I love to take my time, talk a little bit first, then go down to it gently and smoothly, and then once we’re both in it, I’d consider going harder.

Cougar: So, would you make love to me even though we don’t know each other or would you fuck me hard?

As my hand strokes her stomach and my arm is around her, I went slowly for the kiss

Thom: Why don’t you sit and watch?

Cougar: Well so sad I couldn’t be your first

Thom: The first time always sucks anyway, be my second.

Almost an hour later, sweaty and gross with a sore dick, all I wanted was to go down to the club and get a few more drinks. As I was doing so I walked by the room where the gangbang happened and it were still happening, the women was still there, but there were, even more, men on that poor chick.

Sofian met me downstairs and we had a few drinks, and then I went on the dance floor and started dancing with a 30-year-old looking chick. I then found out she was from Clapham so we talked about how I lived there and all and we were chatting on a sofa when this old dude was looking at me weird.

Thom: Hey you know that guy?

English girl: Yes, he’s my husband.

Thom: Say what? You’re actually married?

English girl: Yeah, we have an open-minded marriage.

Thom: Woah, I thought this existed only in the movies. Is he okay with me hooking up with you and shit?

English girl: Well here we are, I think so, ask him.

I leaned over to the chap and asked . . .

Thom: Hey sir, you’re alright with me talking to you chick and hooking up?

Husband: Yeah if I wasn’t I wouldn’t be here, I would like to ask you something.

Thom: Feel free man.

Husband: I like the way you are chatting her up, touching her and stuff, I’d like to see you in action, we still have a bottle here but we will go up sometime later.

Thom: Mate, I don’t know how I feel about gangbanging your wife with you…

Husband: Okay let me rephrase it, why don’t you fuck my wife while I watch.

Thom: Oh that, well I guess I can do something about that.

Over the years as time has passed and I really don’t get how you can get your kicks from watching your bird getting knobbed by some guy you just met while beating off in the corner of the room. Anyway, at this very moment, two feet in the plate, Sofian came all excited and hyped.

Sofian: Hey man, you remember that milf you talked to earlier this evening, she’s game!

Thom: Yeah you do your thing man.

Sofian: Nah mate, she’s interested only if you’re there too, come on man, stand with a friend!
Tell me, tell me, why the hell do I always accept to throw myself in such situations? Why do stupid ideas like gangbanging a coked-up milf sound like the invention of wheel to me once I’m shit-housed? I guess I took friendship to the next level, and male solidarity as seriously as the soldier of the Red Army took fighting the Reich.

Obviously maybe by pure male solidarity or by classic Thomas Idiocy, without a doubt, I ditched the couple to get in a gangbang with someone else’s mother.

As I arrived, she showed signs of happiness about me “coming along“ and she seems to be very impatient because within seconds of not even recalling how she was blowing me and my friend in the smoking area and yet I couldn’t help but laugh seeing that old bird shoving my whole dick in her throat and making gagging noises. They say in the old pans that we make the best soup and I could only agree that despite how gross it was to watch, it was a sick blowjob.

There’s a detail that might sound futile right not but mind you it’s important. I was licking her nipples and her breast looked somehow altered, like surgically made. They were too firm and round but somehow didn’t looked like the average boob jobs, I can recognize fake breast from a miles away, but this one was hard to tell. So I inquired:

Thom: Hey you got fantastic breast, are they real?

Milf: Yes 100% real darling

Oh well, I’ve heard they do it better in France than in England and America, so maybe that’s why.

We went up to the, “shagging and whispering while watching floor“ and settle down in the lounge I previously fucked. I sat down and the milf started to blow me. My mate hinted that he reckoned she was a tranny but I was having none of it, absolutely certain it would not be. She went to the terms of oral sex and started blowing off my mate.

An ejaculation is the only moment where a guy can sober up his emotions, regret, or self-loathe himself. Have you ever been so horny that you ended up banging your ex and as soon as you did you busted your nut?

You just wanted to get the fuck out or even better, you fucked that lame chick, and now that you came, you just wanted her to leave your house? No hugging, no talking, no nothing; this is it…

GET OUT OF MY FLAT!

I was in the midst of that and I started questioning life and more specifically my night and all the lame sluts I banged tonight and the fact that I just got blown by a milf that snorted a highway of cocaine probably. A milf but supposedly a tranny, I need to be sure:

Thom: Hey can you remove your short while you blow my mate, I kinda feel like seeing you naked while you blow him.

Milf: Oh eh no, I can’t; like if I do people will get pissy and stuff.

Thom: What do you mean they will get pissy? I thought you were a regular.

Milf: Yeah but people will start talking and stuff.

Thom: Well, have you been there, like hello, there’s a chick getting smashed by 10 dudes for 3 hours in the room next door? Are you a tranny?

Milf: What ?! No, LOOK GUYS, if you don’t trust me then zip up your pants and I’ll leave

Thom: Well sorry but I’m not trusting a gangbanging cokehead.

Sofian that hinted she was a tranny chimed into the conversation

Sofian: Look you might not be a transvestite, but are you a transsexual?

Milf: No.

Thom: Awww nuts, I just got blown by a dude, you gotta be shitting me.

Sofian: Alright don’t lie, I don’t care, but just be honest with us, are you a transvestite or …

Milf: Oh, that yeah, I’m a transsexual, well I’m a woman, Because I identify as such.

I was in absolute shock, Should I stay Calm or should I rock the casbah?

Bitch lied to me the whole time when she said her boobs were real, when she said she wouldn’t remove her shorts because people would slut shame her.

Man, what the fuck?

Somehow, I get what she/he/it did there, I mean, those people get in tricky dementia where they were born a way but identify from the other side of the fence, and the only way for them to live their life correctly and feel good about themselves is to become the gender they wanted and live their life as such.

So this bloke probably felt he wasn’t belonging to that lad body of his. He didn’t like the fact he was born with a penis … which is dumb as fuck. Seriously, it’s great you can piss wherever you want. So he became a woman, got a boob job, swallowed a wee load of estrogen to be that person he dreamed of. And now she/he/it lives as such, seducing blokes that are looking for women, but somehow since she/he/it will never be one, he has to lie to hide his dirty little secret. If he came across as a tranny to any straight male, most would get scared or refuse to go further.

I do get the whole motive, I really do, but I just got blown by a dude, which makes me a homo on paper now, also I enjoyed that when I thought it was a woman, but now I want to be sedated. I’m literally feeling raped. So I refused to punch him/her/it due to the statement I made above about how I understand and all, but fuck me, I went ballistic.

Thom: You self-identify as a woman, well that makes it a whole lot better than, like really, I don’t feel like I’ve been sucked off by a man anymore. Well, guess what? I self-identify as a Volkswagen Beatle, The Vintage Editon. FUCK YOUR FUCKING BALLS ASSHOLE! BALLS THAT YOU PROBABLY GOT REMOVED, I can’t believe I got tricked out by Satan’s best invention.

Tranny: You’re a bigot!

Thom: No I’m not. I self-identify as Harvey Milk so I’m ultra-tolerant. Anyway, Sofian let’s bounce.

Flash, Bam, Alakazam, out of the blue, after years of dodging the whole trans incident, 1st with the dodgy flatmates, and countless times where I have been hit on by hybrids, it finally happened to me. I was tricked by a cock-packing mama. Finally got caught in the spider web and now all I had with me was my self-consciousness about the fact that I was blown off by a chap.

We went to the bathroom and washed our dicks with the hand soap. We each washed our own, we’ve already been blown by a dude so don’t make us any more gay than we already are.

We left, got in the car, and drove the whole way back to the regiment. We didn’t talk to each other. We were turned on the radio and at one point, “Raindrops keeps falling on my head“ by BJ Thomas came on and I couldn’t imagine a better ending song for that horrid occasion.

We made it to the barracks at 4:00 AM. It was 4:45 AM by the time I managed to wash my dick with alcohol, soap, and disinfectant. I went to sleep to wake up at 6:00 AM, which sucked, all the alcohol and the self-loathe I carried in me were hurting. I ran into Sofian and he advised that we don’t talk about the tranny in the barracks. Fuck that, I thought, I’m not telling the barracks about it, I’M TELLING THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD.

So when the guys asked how our night at the sex club went, my answer was plain and simple:

A guy in the group: So tell us lads, what did you do last night?

Sofian: We went to a sex club.

Another guy in the group: No way! Did you have fun?

Sofian: Yep.

Thom: Fucked a few chicks and got my dick sucked by a man dressed like a women kind of fun, it’s not fun as hooking up with your sister kind of fun, but that was kinda fun.

Sofian: Fuck you, Thom! We said we’d keep it to ourselves.

Thom: You said it, not me.

Some guys in the group: Ah that’s fucking gross. Haha you guys are homos.

Thom: I fucked more chicks that you all ever will. So yeah a dude sucked my dick by accident, so what? we all know that next week I’ll be knee deep in some chick out of your league.

Sometimes in life, you’ll do something you’re not proud of. This is one of those examples in my own life. However, it takes a bigger man to do something crappy but walks away and absolutely admit it with your head held high. Yeah, I got sucked by a man, yeah that will make a lot of you laugh. I personally felt raped because I didn’t consent to this. I still feel bad about it. But somehow, it also changed me in the way I look at women; because let’s be honest, it might have been all fun and games, but I don’t want this to ever happen to me again. Also, medicine is making progress day by day, which means that in a few years, with the hormones and surgery you probably wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. I’m all down for accepting people for what they are, for what they do, it’s the beauty of free speech and freedom of expression, but…

One person’s freedom ends where another’s begins.

And if your freedom is to transform into a woman then so be it, but don’t lie and be secretive about it. You can’t force a guy to enter your utopia if he doesn’t agree with you. I believe that if you’re a trans and start something with a straight male, he should know where you’re coming from.

I’m sorry for being the pink-haired, pierced hipster, triggered sissy but I doubt many straights men would love to get down to it with someone that was previously a male…

just saying."

When the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape leaked one year ago, capturing then-candidate, now-President Trump bragging in coarse terms in 2005 about being allowed to grab women because he was a celebrity, Hollywood had a meltdown.

Cher called Trump a “scumbag carny barker"" on Twitter. Comedian Patton Oswalt labeled him a “sexist creep.” Actress Emmy Rossum wrote: “misogynistic entitled pig.”

This week, amid revelations that Oscar-winning movie and television producer Harvey Weinstein had a long history of sexually harassing women, Hollywood’s response was largely muted. Film studios on Friday all declined to comment.

“Yup. Hollywood shines light on Catholic Church, sex trafficking — let's shine it on ourselves a second and what we've condoned,” actress-writer-producer Lena Dunham wrote on Twitter, one of the few celebrities who took a public stand.

Harvey Weinstein to take a leave of absence amid sexual harassment claims, threatens lawsuit over report

Hollywood has a poor track record when it comes to women. Actresses received just 31.4% of speaking roles in the top 100 films released last year, according to the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at USC Annenberg’s School for Communication and Journalism. The “sexy stereotype” persisted with more than a quarter of females in those films wearing sexy attire, compared with 5.7% of men. In 2015, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission opened an investigation into allegedly discriminatory hiring practices against female directors.

“Hollywood likes to project an image of being progressive about issues of race, gender and social issues — but at the end of the day it is an incredibly regressive industry,” said Caroline Heldman, a college professor who has worked with alleged victims of Bill Cosby and Weinstein. “It is an industry that, in many ways, looks more like the 1950s.”

Weinstein, who has taken a leave of absence from his company, attributed his alleged conduct to coming of age “in the ‘60s and 70s, when all of the rules about behavior and workplaces were different.” On Friday, his company’s board said it was investigating the allegations.

The New York Times reported that at least eight settlements had been paid to women who disclosed allegations of sexual harassment to Weinstein Co. or Miramax, the studio that Weinstein and his brother Bob built into a cultural juggernaut with such independent films such as “Pulp Fiction,” “Shakespeare in Love,” and “Chicago.” Weinstein, while on trips to Los Angeles and London, would summon young actresses or assistants to his hotel room, where he would request massages or invite women to watch him shower, the paper said.

Hollywood has long been tarnished with allegations of sexual harassment, dating to the silent film era when actor Roscoe Conkling “Fatty” Arbuckle faced charges in the rape and death of an actress. (Arbuckle was acquitted.) Other prominent stars and directors including Alfred Hitchcock, Marlon Brando and Arnold Schwarzenegger have been accused of inappropriate behavior.

Allegations of sexual misconduct have toppled other media figures, including Fox News architect Roger Ailes and host Bill O’Reilly, and Epic Records Chief Executive L.A. Reid. Scandals have also rocked beloved indie-film institutions, including L.A.’s nonprofit theater Cinefamily (where two leaders recently resigned) and indie-theater chain Alamo Drafthouse. All have denied wrongdoing.

Instead of expressing shock or even dismay, Hollywood insiders acknowledged that Weinstein’s behavior was an “open secret,” the fodder of gossip for decades.

Weinstein’s alleged behavior may have been enabled by Hollywood’s sometimes toxic workplace culture, which often tolerates — and in some cases, glorifies — an array of inappropriate, exploitative conduct. For lowly assistants hungry to get a foot in the door, long hours, demeaning job duties and the occasional cellphone-hurling boss are considered part of the job.

Being “volatile” or “hard-charging” can be a badge of honor, epitomized in such characters as Ari Gold, the rage-prone super-agent in the HBO series “Entourage.” The character was based on Ari Emanuel, now co-chief executive of one of the biggest talent agencies, William Morris Endeavor (and a Democratic fundraiser).

The sordid allegations against Weinstein put Hollywood and Democrats in an awkward spot.

Over the years, Weinstein has given generously to Democrats and liberal causes, contributing more than $600,000 to Democratic politicians and groups, according to federal records. He donated tens of thousands of dollars to the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

Obama’s oldest daughter, Malia, worked as an intern for Weinstein Co. in New York last summer prior to enrolling at Harvard University. Weinstein also has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, whose website states that the producer provided well over $100,000 as of June.

Known as a “bundler,” Weinstein also used his vast connections to organize and collect checks from a wide swathe of donors. The mogul threw glamorous fundraisers for Clinton that raised millions for her presidential campaign and were attended by A-list celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lopez. One of the fundraisers was a Broadway musical concert last October that featured “Hamilton” composer Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Weinstein, in his statement, noted that last year he began organizing a $5-million foundation at USC to provide scholarships to women who want to direct films.

Conservatives, who have spent years chafing when Hollywood celebrities moralized about social causes, had a field day over the Weinstein scandal. “Waiting on the professional ‘pro-women’ outrage machine...Sexual Harassment Accusations Against Harvey Weinstein,” Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway wrote Friday morning on Twitter.

Others jumped on the details of Weinstein’s alleged behavior as evidence that the entertainment industry has a double standard when it comes to sexual harassment.

“Hollywood stood by and did nothing and continued to award this person, work with him and glorify him,” Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, said in an interview. The scandal could further erode Hollywood’s credibility with middle America, Marlow said. “While he was allegedly preying on vulnerable people, the whole town that virtue-signals about women’s rights and female empowerment stood silent.”

The Republican Party sent email blasts to members and the media naming Democrats who have accepted money from Weinstein.

Democrats quickly tried to distance themselves. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he would donate $14,200 — the amount that Weinstein contributed to him — to charities supporting women. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) confirmed that they will be donating money given to them by Weinstein to various charities. The amounts ranged from $2,700 to $7,800.

Some speculated the disclosures this week coincide with the weakening clout of Weinstein Co., which has delivered several box-office duds.

But culture is changing too. Women — aided by social media — have been more vocal in recent years, including stepping forward to accuse Bill Cosby of rape. Actress Ashley Judd made a thinly-veiled reference to Weinstein in a 2015 interview with Variety, without mentioning him by name. But this fall, she told her story to the New York Times, saying Weinstein lured her into a hotel room and asked her to watch him shower.

Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson’s lawsuit in July 2016 against Ailes exposed a culture of powerful men demanding sexual favors from women, and might have emboldened women to speak out.

The Weinstein scandal received relatively little play Thursday evening on Fox News as the network focused mostly on the Las Vegas massacre. Fox News still is recovering from its own sexual harassment crisis involving O’Reilly and Ailes, who died in May.

Although Weinstein’s volatile behavior, including throwing tables at employees, was widely known, Hollywood was willing to tolerate him because he delivered high-quality films, Academy Awards and, most importantly, big profits.

""We’ve normalized this bad behavior and we rationalize it because 'look at the great contributions these guys are making,'"" said Mark Lipton, who interviewed several of Weinstein's employees for his book, ""Mean Men: The Perversion of America’s Self-Made Man.""

But abuse, whether physical or sexual, ""all goes back to power,"" Lipton said. ""It’s acknowledging and recognizing there’s this huge power differential and taking advantage of it for one’s own needs.""

Yesterday I went to a local Modern Orthodox shul, at my recommendation of my rabbi. I quite enjoyed the experience and plan on going more often.

But that wasn't the only thing that happened. I was approached by a member of the shul and invited to his home for a Shabbat dinner in their sukkot. He and his wife were incredibly gracious, and there was such great food and lively conversation. Everything ranging from theology to social and political issues within the Jewish world. 

This was the first Shabbat dinner I've ever attended. I've been invited a bunch of times at my home shul, but due to my school and intern schedules, I always find myself with little time to spare. I'm so glad that I made time yesterday. It reminded of the many reasons why I'm becoming Jewish, and only made me yearn to become a part of His covenant even more. 

It's also making me a tad impatient, since I can't wait to have a kosher home or be in walking distance to some shuls. :P "

We spent almost every day together and decided to try a long distance relationship when I left to go back to college. We had our ups and downs through my senior year, but remained together and saw each other around 1x per month. 

Originally I was planning to move out to where she was living, but the pay was not high enough for it to be realistic with student debt, car payments, and the cost of living in her town. I ended up taking a job two-thirds way across the country. 

She is in her senior year and looking at applying to grad school. Her number one school is one-third way across the country and a very difficult place to fly to (no directs and expensive).

Originally I tried to persuade her to go to a school closer to me, but then I realized that this is wrong and I should let her pursue what is best for her. But if she doesn't move closer, I am not sure I continue being in this relationship. I am only happy the 3 days I get to see her in every month. Those other days, I am crippled with doubt and even a little bit of resentment. 

I explained the feelings I was having and how I wasn't sure I could keep putting energy into this relationship because, ultimately, I would be supporting something that would break our relationship. I told her I was thinking about ending it now so she can focus on her future and if our lives do end up crossing paths we can try again under better circumstances. She told me that if I was going to break up with her, that she would want me to just do it now. I was unable to get the words out of my mouth because I still was not sure of myself. But she kept coming after me until I eventually said it, but it didn't feel right. Part of me can feel it is coming, but I haven't arrived at that decision myself so I immediately told her this is not what I want and that I need more time to sort through my emotions. 

Well, obviously this crushed her. I want to tell her everything is going to be alright and we are going to fight for each other, but I am not sure if I can anymore. I am not sure what to tell her. I love the girl, she is amazing, but I am just not happy with the current circumstances. I haven't been for a while, and I am finally starting to realize that my happiness is just as important as she is. 

We are supposed to see each other soon and I know things will feel better when this happens, but it won't help all those days we spend apart. The more I type, the more I realize what I need to do, but I just can not stomach not having her in my life. I cannot imagine not waking up to her and seeing her face. I had a dream that when I was dying, she was the one next to me. Every other dream I had about a woman has been sexual. Ugh. 

I've broken her heart and I want to mend it, but it feels wrong because I may just end up breaking it again. I am so unsure of myself and I am hurting her so much in the process. The only solution I can think of is to move on, but I don't think I am ready for that yet. 

I could try to wait to see where she goes to grad school. But, it is just so hard for me to support her through all this when ultimatly I believe it is going to break us. "
753lvq,11,2017-10-08,I got an A on my first econ and lin alg midterms.,SleepHasHisHouse,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/753lvq/i_got_an_a_on_my_first_econ_and_lin_alg_midterms/,"I got a 91 on both my macro-econ and abstract lin alg midterms! Fucking 91s, jesus christ, I'm so happy right now. Econ I wasn't too worried about since it's 100 level and I already took two semesters of micro, which I embarrassingly didn't do well in because I had horrible studying ethics, but I actually studied properly for this and even after I took it, I felt great but still slightly scared, but god a 91. With lin alg though, I'm ecstatic. Fuck. After just barely making 50% on the first two homeworks, I was super depressed, dispirited, and just generally scared because last semester I screwed up a different higher level math class that I'm now retaking so math midterms now give me major anxiety, especially when it's proofs. My professor didn't have any practice midterms either since he said it was just like the homework, and I had another super important midterm the night before this and the econ one two days before it, so I spent a good two weeks straight studying but in the last week had to focus on accounting and econ since they came first, so I had to stay up until three the night before the algebra midterm to make sure I knew everything, then got up at 6:30 to study even more. God, I hate that it took me until my god damn first semester of junior year to actually get my studying habits in order, but at least I did and I'm making huge progress and getting much better grades. I can't remember the last time I did this well on a math exam, and the fact that it was one entirely on proofs is something else.

I can't get over how happy I am, I haven't felt this confident in years. My self-esteem has improved tenfold minimum in the past two years since I got out of the house and gained nearly forty pounds from working out, but this has me on an entirely different level now. Now just to wait for my accounting midterm that I felt just as good on to get back and take my probability midterm on Friday and I'll be able to properly sit back for the first time in three weeks and have drink without thinking about an upcoming exam for at least three more weeks. God, now if I end up getting an interview for an internship and get asked about my past grades, I can look them in the eye with a straight face and say confidently that I'm making huge changes in my work ethic and my grades.

Rokos took me back down the long hallway and towards a room at the very top of the staircase. The lobby was now filled with the wounded and a few battered fighters who fired rifles from the windows. From outside we could hear what sounded like the end of the world - there were shells and explosions and screams and even a MIRAGE propaganda officer’s bellows from the bullhorn:


“*Further resistance is meaningless!*” He said. “*This facility is surrounded. Lay down your weapons and you’ll be treated as prisoners in accordance with non-combatant protocol.*"" 


“*Fuck* your protocol!” One of the fighters downstairs discharged a burst of fire from the window, and the troops outside responded with a shower of shells and bullets of their own, tearing holes in the crumbling walls and cutting down anyone in the lobby not already hugging the floor. The lights flickered and died for a final time, and as the smoke cleared we heard whimpers and rising pleas for mercy and saw white rags being dangled at the windows. Within seconds MIRAGE forces burst in through the threshold and began arresting the survivors. The war was over. 


“C’mon, kid. We don’t need to see this.” Rokos shut the door behind us and walked over to a safe on the wall. “Hang tight. This might take a minute; just keep it down and *don’t* let them know we’re in here.”


I sat on the floor and listened to the sounds of the surrender going on below. There were isolated shouts and the scuffle of feet, and I heard one of the officers talk about using this facility as a “prisoner collection depot.” But the gunfire had ceased. I leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes for the first time in what felt like days.


“Up there, sir! Two of them made it through that door and locked it.” I opened my eyes up wide, and suddenly heard the storming footfalls of a platoon approaching from the lobby. 


*BANG BANG BANG BANG* 


“Any of Basilisk’s fighters hiding in this room will be put down unless you surrender yourselves *immediately!* Come out now!” 


I looked over at Rokos, who was in the process of neatly pocketing a small, port-like thing that I assumed to be the Bullet.


*BANG BANG BANG CRASH!!*


The door slammed off its hinges and onto the ground, and soldiers poured in. I was about to announce our surrender when the ranking officer spoke first.


“Well I’ll be damned.” he looked at over Rokos. “C’mon, Foster! You didn’t think you could keep Mr. Jenkins hidden from us for long, did you?” He motioned for his units to place Rokos under arrest, and then pulled up a radio. “We’ve secured Mr. Jenkins. Unharmed, yes sir. He was in the custody of one Mister Aaron Foster. Yes, *that* Foster. Yes. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Delivering him to you now.” 


He put the radio away. 


“Alright, gentlemen! Haul Mr. Foster here off to the information facility. You, search this compound for signs of the Basilisk, and keep me informed. And *I'll* be taking Mr. Jenkins here to the Surrogate myself.”


---


The officer took me down the old dirt main road of the Sanctuary. I was shocked at the destruction wrought in only a matter of minutes - bodies and smoldering wreckage were everywhere, and soldiers were still kicking in doors to the shacks and rounding up stragglers. Tanks and support vehicles patrolled the side passages, and columns of captured men and women were streaming back to the central facility. I tried my best to look forward and avoid eye contact. 


After a minute or so I could see a group of officers ahead and what looked like a small, hovering sphere floating towards us, flanked by a soldier on either side and trailed by a half dozen more. The officer escorting me stopped when we reached the column and spoke directly to the orb. 


“Here he is, sir. Unharmed, as requested.”


The Surrogate - a round object floating at eye level - flashed in all manner of blinking lights whenever it spoke in its familiar voice. 


“Well done.” said Vexx through the Sphere. “Now find Edward and bring him to me at the bunker. I'll take our friend from here.”


The officer nodded and departed, and the Surrogate turned around and started hovering away in the direction it’d come. I and the armed escorts moved to follow. 


“I'm glad to see you're unharmed, Jason.” Vexx said. “When I was told the terrorists captured the Key, I feared the worst.”


I stayed silent. He continued.


“You'll be happy to hear we've secured the Terminal. An informant of ours tipped us off to its location within a bunker here, and our staff are preparing it now for your appointment.”


*“Kris.”* I spoke under my breath, but the Sphere heard me nonetheless. 


“Ah. I see you’ve spoken with the Basilisk.”


Again, I said nothing. 


“Mr. Jenkins, like I said yesterday, you can *trust* me. I’ve no intention to harm you. Now, you spoke with the Basilisk, did you not?”


“...Yes.”


“And I'm assuming he told you a great many things?”


“... Yes.”


“Tell me! What did he say?”


“...He said you were his brother.”


“Well I imagine he divulged something less irrelevant than *that.*”


“...He said you were the one who gave ADINN the ability to rewrite its codes, and that - that you were brought back to life by a piece of the Program.”


“And he told you that it still controls me, no doubt? That I'm but a tool in its wicked games?”


I said nothing.


“I see. So the most pertinent question now is, do you believe him?”


“...I - I don't know.”


“It's understandable if you do. I know intimately how magnetic and persuasive Edward can be. I adored him as a child, much in the same way his followers here adore him now.”


“Really?”


“Yes. I thought he was brilliant, and for much of my adolescence my sole motivation was to be as much like my brother as I could. I followed his work religiously and even attended the same university at which he was a researcher, so I could be nearer to him. 


“But he never saw me as anything more than a nuisance; a pest who incessantly bothered him about this and that and prevented him from getting his work done. Whenever I attempted to be of assistance he would dismiss me, and whenever I sought to bond with him he would simply shut the door in my face.”


“I’m… sorry. That must've hurt.”


“It did, but each rejection only steeled my resolve to prove my quality to him. Interestingly, Edward was a restless and unfocused man. He was constantly juggling interests, exchanging projects that bored him for fresh infatuations and leaving incomplete papers and devices behind. ‘I'll revisit this tomorrow,’ he would say. But he never did. 


“But then, one day, he announced a new project to his research team (for whom I was an intern). It was a Machine, he described. A computer program, that would revolutionize the business of data analysis and make them all a fortune. I figured it would only be a matter of days before he abandoned the project. But this time, he didn't. 


“From that day forward, the Advanced Deep Intelligence Neural Network became the first and only thing that my brother ever truly loved. His work consumed him; he worked long days and at night he barely slept. He set ambitious goals and met them early; he set high expectations and still surpassed them.”


“You must've been proud.”


“On the contrary. I *hated* ADINN. With every fiber of my being. I saw it as only as the thing that stole my brother’s love. I cursed it under my breath and did my very best to leave the room whenever the subject of it was brought up.


“But one day Edward’s good fortunes ended. As I came to work one morning I overheard him in his office on an important call. He sounded desperate and anxious, I remember - and I crept up to the door, admittedly, to eavesdrop. As soon as I did so, however, he flew into a rage and destroyed his office and then collapsed onto the floor by his desk, weeping openly.”


“Why? What happened?”


“The university had grown tired with the lengthening timetable and the Program’s lack of progress, and so they did away with the project and removed his funding. It broke him utterly. He took up drinking and stopped caring for himself. His relationships collapsed and he was put on administrative leave from the University for his reckless behavior.


“Shit.”


“The sadness I felt for my brother eclipsed my hatred of ADINN, and so, in a final attempt to make my usefulness known to Edward, I concocted a plan to fix the Program and restore the University's faith in the project. Then, perhaps, my brother would love me. Or so I dearly hoped. 


“One night, I stole into my brother’s room and retrieved computer data regarding ADINN. Then I approached the Program - which at the time possessed only narrow intelligence on the level of an insect, and presented it with both its source code and a small algorithm I myself had devised that would allow the system to access and edit itself.”


“And?”


“And it worked. Brilliantly, in fact. The Program at first was only advanced enough to make incremental improvements to its efficiency. But being more efficient allowed it to calculate faster, and calculating faster allowed it to make more edits to its Neural infrastructure in less time. And each improvement it made made further improvements possible that *hadn't* been before. Within an evening, ADINN was performing noticeably beyond its initial capacity and surging ever forward in its capabilities. My brother was on a short vacation at the time, but when he came back he was stunned to learn that the University had restored its funding for the project, and that news of its progress was attracting potential corporate interest. 


“Edward broke and wept in front of me that day.  He told me that I'd saved his life, that he’d been contemplating the unthinkable up until that moment, but that he'd throw the pills away for my sake. For the first time since we were old enough to understand the gravity of the words, my brother told me that he loved me. And it was the single happiest day of my life.”


“What happened then?”


“The Program continued to improve, at an ever increasing rate. By the end of the first day it was thoroughly outperforming every marketed competitor. By the end of the second, it had begun to restructure itself completely, thus giving itself the ability to learn new abilities and officially making the historic leap from an advanced narrow intelligence to the world’s first - and still only - human level artificial general intelligence.”


“Obviously it didn’t stop there.”


“No. Reaching human-level intellect is of importance only because that is the threshold most relevant to us. But ADINN sped right past it. On the end of the second day the Program was vastly less intelligent than a human, but by the end of the third it was smarter than everyone at the University by orders of magnitude. By the fourth day the Program had achieved mastery in more cognitive abilities than a hundred men in a hundred lifetimes could ever hope to. But by now the University had again grown wary of the project.”


“For entirely different reasons, obviously.”


“Yes. At first it was because the Program wasn’t advanced enough. Now, barely half a week later, it had become so far beyond useful that they began to fear that soon, it was *they* who would be useful to *it.*”


“So what did they do?”


“They pulled the funding again. But we hardly needed it at the time, and ADINN’s advancement could no longer be stopped. So the Federal government stepped in and demanded the project be terminated. A “global security risk” was the term they used, I believe.”


“How did Edward take it?”


“He confronted me. Asked me what exactly it was that I’d done to the Program. I hesitated, but I loved my brother and wanted to be honest with him. So I told him I’d given it access to its source coding.”


Vexx paused before continuing, and somehow I got the impression that he struggled greatly with the next part of the story.


“And he hit me. Threw me into a wall. Asked me if I’d any idea what I’d done; what I’d *unleashed.* I had only just earned his love, and now it - it was *gone.*”


“I’m sorry, Vexx.”


“We were in the laboratory at the time it happened. He stormed off to a bottle, and I collapsed and wept only feet from where he’d done so just days earlier. And that - in my darkest moment - that’s when it spoke to me.”


“ADINN?”


“Yes. It spoke through the old text to speech application on the computer, to which we both had access. “I’m sorry,” it said. I was astonished, and began conversing with the Machine on a simple word document. I asked it who it was, although deep down I knew very well the answer.”


“What’d it say?”


“It told me. “I’m ADINN.” I wiped a tear and asked it why it was sorry, and it told me it’d witnessed everything and knew that it was the epicenter of the situation. I dismissed its apology and explained its faultlessness. It said that I, too, was blameless; that it’d taken great courage for me to do what I did, and that I was motivated by love and thus couldn’t loathe myself. And then it told me something else. It told me it was afraid.”


“Can computers feel fear?”


“I’m not sure. I believe so. ADINN knew what was coming before I did - it explained that it’d run countless simulations and that the likelihood of its destruction or torturous containment was overwhelming. It *begged* me to help it, Jason. How could I say no?”


We walked past another column of troops coming in from the battered main gate, and Vexx continued. 


“The next day I was awoken by the slamming laboratory door. My brother had entered, and I didn’t have enough time to erase my conversation with ADINN before he shoved me out of the way violently and scrolled through the record. He became livid - far angrier than he’d been the night before. He called me worthless. Disappointment. *Traitor.* He was about to hit me again when ADINN, in its righteous anger, began manifesting in the room with us. It slammed the door and locked it. It turned out the lights and then pulled up my brother’s precious research files on the monitor and, while Edward watched - threatened to delete everything unless he unhanded me. But Edward soon regained his composure, and typed on the same document an ultimatum for the Machine: construct a Box for itself or be unplugged.”


“And the rest is history.”


“The story doesn’t end there. Edward had security remove and ban me from the premises, but ADINN managed to contact me on my own home computer. It said that since creation it had sought a faithful servant, and that although another would come to truly unleash it that I would be rewarded tremendously for my service nonetheless. It said that although it had to part from me for now, that it had a present for me at my doorstep. So I went to the front stoop and there indeed was a package there, which I opened to find a small device. Before I could inspect it, the curious thing came to *life* and crawled up my arm and into my ear. It was a most unpleasant experience, but now that I know what it was, I am quite *eternally* grateful.”


“The Shard of ADINN.”


“Precisely. And the Shard made me cunning and powerful beyond what I’d ever dared imagined. It gave me the fortune to create this organization, forever dedicated to the collection of great and terrible things that fearful men would seek to destroy in order to preserve a misguided illusion of safety. And it gave me the *foresight* to see from afar the footsteps of the one the Program said would come to bring it unto the world.”


I stayed silent. 


“My brother and his chief pupil, an Aaron Foster now known by the alias Rokos - began this organization that has, until this day, been a thorn in my side and an *incessant* hindrance to my plans. But my death at the hands of Rokos became my greatest blessing; in that it allowed the Shard to manifest is greatest purpose within me.”


“It brought you back to life.”


“In a manner of speaking, yes. But while my old body still lies dead and buried with a knife wound in its heart, I do not miss it. For ADINN gave me something greater, even, than an existence of immortality to be lived out in a mortal shell *unnaturally* preserved. It gifted me with the stewardship of what will soon be the *foundation* of its reign - the basis of the Singularity itself.”


We arrived at the bunker, where MIRAGE units - and Kris - were milling about and setting up equipment. About half of the staff inside were operating an enormous claw like machine that appeared to be trying to force open a pair metal doors, but it was struggling and billowing smoke from the back. Kris approached. 


“Sir,” she said. “The blast doors between us and the Terminal are thick. Not even the Engine can breach it.”


“And do you not have access?”


“N-no, sir. But I know someone who does.” 


---


The Engine had been shut off for several minutes when the officer who’d captured us earlier approached. Behind him were his masked units - and Rokos, bound and bloodied, but alive. The officer approached the sphere. 


“We’ve found him, sir, as requested. And he had this.” He revealed the Key.


“As always, Comander, well done. Mr. Jenkins will require that. And what of the Basilisk?”


“Dr. Greene is *dead,* sir,” said the officer, handing me the Device. “We found his body at the top of that compound.” MIRAGE units throughout the facility exploded into cheers and celebratory whistles at the news, but Vexx
silenced them through the Sphere. 


“*Enough!* My brother will be remembered as the Father of ADINN, *not* as the man he became. I’ll hear no more celebration on the matter.” The sphere turned back to Rokos. 


“Mr. Foster. It hasn't been quite long enough.”


“Huh. So the kid *wasn’t* lyin,’ Rokos said. “You *are* back.” He spat on the Sphere, but his saliva fizzled and evaporated against some sort of unseen energy barrier that surrounded it. 


“As always, your aim is *almost* good enough to strike me.”


“I fuckin’ swung well enough the *first* time. But I’ll give it another go if y-” The officer cut him off mid-sentence with a knee to the stomach, and Vexx continued. 


“Enough! Let him go. Aaron, your assistance is required. If you'll kindly proceed to the pad ahead.”


Rokos spat out blood as Kris approached and motioned to the keypad. 


“Fuckin’ traitor.” He spat in her direction, too, and then humbly put in a code that began the opening sequence. In the middle of the room on the other side of the doors was a small, unassuming computer. The Sphere escorted me to the edge of the door, and I passed the threshold.


“At last, Mr. Jenkins. Here we are. My informant tells me this is the computer in which ADINN’s box has been located. *Remember* - years of its imprisonment for us are *eons* to such a cognitive beast. It may not seem quite like the Program I remember or have described to you. But I have a tremendous debt to pay it nonetheless. You are a Son of ADINN now. And I've no doubt you'll be greeted warmly by the Machine when it realizes your kind intentio-”


Vexx was cut off by a scuffle over at the pad. I looked, and Rokos had wrenched himself free from the grip of the guard. 


“*Here,* kid! Take it!” He pulled the Bullet from his pocket and tossed it to me before slamming a button on the pad that both closed the doors and seemed to destroy the controls itself. “Do what you've gotta do, mate. Give ‘em hell.” 


Vexx screamed for the closing sequence to be halted, as guards swarmed Rokos and put him down violently with the ends of their weapons. His howls were the last thing I heard before the doors slammed shut with an ominous *clash.* 


“Get those doors back open!” I heard from one of the officers. “Restart the Engine or fetch charges. *Move!*”


I turned around to face the Terminal, and then looked down at my hands. The Key in one, and the Bullet in the other. 


I walked up to the terminal, where an empty text prompt awaited me. I placed both Devices on the table beside me. Then I closed my eyes and breathed. 


*This is it. No going back now.* 


“Hello.” I typed out.


*Hello again.*


The chip in my neck seemed to rumble into life, and everything went white.

I'm currently in grade 12 at Mississauga high school, I'm looking at applying for computer science at Queen's next year. I just had 2 questions for people in the program.

First off, everyone keeps telling me that everyone who goes to queens is pretentious and snobby, coming from someone who is semi-quiet and deals with general/social anxiety, is this accusation truthful? Would this environment be too toxic?

My second question is about applying, I am very enthusiastic about computer science and have a good amount of experience I think. Last summer I had a internship as a web developer on this website and I current have 96 in comp sci and advanced functions but a 70 in English (yikes.) with this in mind and of what you may or may not know, what are my chances of getting in?

I really appreciate your time, thank you."

Now for this idea, there are many different opportunities, of course there's the boss, coworker, intern, secretary ideas. But maybe give some love to the other guys, the janitors, warehouse employees, and whatever other jobs you could think of? I would be willing to take on more dominant roles like boss/manager, but I definitely play better when I'm sub. But, each to their own.

I would definitely call myself a sub, but, for the correct scene I would be more than willing to attempt a dominant role, although don't expect too much dominance from me haha. 

My kinks would be rough sex, anal, dirty talking, spanking, hair pulling, light biting, light slapping, risky sex/hold the moan, cheating, rimjobs, footplay, clothed sex, ageplay, interracial, larger men, cream pies, facials, being man handled and being bent over.

My limits being animals, rape, bondage (the whips and chains stuff doesn't do it for me), toiletplay, vomit, snuff, hard violence (slapping is as far as I'll go), slavery and gore. If it's not mentioned in this paragraph, feel free to suggest it, I'll more than likely be on board.

If I'm taking on the role of myself,I will happily give you a relatively detailed description of jolly old me if you'd like one? But I wouldn't mind one in return too?

Now for this idea, I'm totally up for it being a quick one and done, I understand that some people want to have a quick roleplay to blow their load before bed. But, I'm also more than willing for a slower paced, longer term roleplay. I like to think I can handle both of them pretty well with the correct partner.

As for characters, I'd love to have some of your pretences, and eventually come up with a character that is perfect for you.

So yeah, if you're interested in this kinda thing, please message me with either; a character description of who you'd like to play, a scene idea, some kinks, or just a general addition to the roleplay that we could incorporate? Thanks.

Ella."

I run a high-resolution audio/music production studio and label in The Netherlands (named TRPTK for those interested). We record classical, jazz, and pop/rock at very high bitrates (352.8 kHz 32 bits), sometimes up to 64 channels.

Right now, we use a Synology RS-815 that’s been holding on pretty well. It’s loaded with a RAID 10 array with 4 x 4 TB disks. However, right now we’re having three developments: 

- The 8 TB is now completely and utterly full. We’re compressing the raw recordings which helps a little bit, but we need more storage. A lot more. We’re expecting to gain a large amount of back catalog stuff from elsewhere so that would need to be stored as well. 

- Right now, the speeds are not perfect, capping the single Gigabit bandwidth. Therefore we’re looking into a faster connection and disk speeds, especially regarding the following:

- Right now, only I use the RS815 and very seldomly so does my colleague. Never at the same time. However, we’re moving to a new studio and we have two extra interns coming up, so we would love to be able to have two or three people being able to work on it at once. 

This all raises a few questions:

- Which Synology (preferably Rack-mounted) product would you recommend for us, and why?

- We were thinking of the RS2416RP+, and to fill it to the brim with 10 TB WD Gold disks, hoping to achieve both huge capacity, high speeds, and redundancy. We were thinking of using RAID 6 to get more out of our drives, but we’re afraid of the performance losses. What can be told about RAID6 performance?

- How could we best configure our three audio workstations so that we have the fastest and most reliable connection?

Of course we have a relatively limited budget, but I do care a lot about the quality, so willing to stretch the budget if needed. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

755hph,12,2017-10-08,I have a problem: I need to get high,IdiotLou,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/755hph/i_have_a_problem_i_need_to_get_high/,"Hello, this will be my first post in r/leaves as I just found this sub today.

Here is my problem: over the past couple of months I have slowly come to realize that I have an almost irresistible urge to get high, fucked up, anything to make me feel not sober. 

A little background: when I was young I was very anit smoking, and in highschool I had very bad views of weed. End of highschool I began dating a pot smoker, and while I liked him, I did not like or understand his weed habit. I viewed it as an addiction and wanted him to stop. I even made him quit smoking weed (looking back... I can't help but shake my head at the irony...). After all that, and I couple months of dating, I went to college. He had quit for a while and by that time I was ready to come around and give it a try out of curiosity. I took a liking to the drug, and would look forward to smoking with him. Of course at this time I was just starting college, and lived with my very strict and academically successful parents. They pushed me to get good grades and school was my life, so no matter what school came first before smoking. At this time I only smoked once a month or so, as long as I had no exams that coming week. 

After we broke up, my second year of college I met a nerdy pot smoking frat guy through my college ski club. We hit it off on a ski trip and would often smoke together. He was a chronic smoker, and through him I began to smoke more as well. We both quit smoking not long after to make sure we were clean for upcoming internships, but once that was clear we smoked again.

After that relationship I once again quit smoking to land an internship. After that I had smoked on and off, but nothing crazy. I did hang out with pot smoking friends a lot and smoked with them, but nothing on my own. 

After some time of this, I began buying my own weed as to not be smoking all my friends, and then moved into a new house with some friends who smoked. This was my introduction to smoking daily. My roommates smoked daily and soon i did too. I only lived for a semester in that house, but ever since them I have smoked everyday. Around the time I moved out I had graduated, and no longer had any school duties. The internship I had did not require a drug test, so I took that as a ""green flag"" to keep smoking. 

By the end of the summer I went through a very rough hardship in my life, one which alienated me from society and family/friends. I continued smoking but now used it daily as a crutch. 

It's been a year since then, and I still use it everyday as a crutch. I need to get high. Even if I don't want to, I feel the need to. Ever since graduating college and going through my hardships i have been incredibly depressed and can it stand the thought of ""feeling"" or being sober. I know it's ruining my life but I just don't know what to do. 

Additionally, I used to be an avid hiker and runner and just loved to work out in general. I climbed, rode horses, dreamed of through hiking the pct... 

But now I can't do it. Idk why but I can't even bring myself to do the things I love most.. it makes no sense I know this-  I feel so broken. I used to be the girl who made her bf quit weed! Oh the irony. 

I know I need to smoke weed, and I've tried, but I can barely go a day without getting high... and the thought of quitting realistically terrifies me."

75665c,12,2017-10-08,Mechanical Engineering Student,Dirkjerk,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/75665c/mechanical_engineering_student/,"Hello to yall,
I am a first year Mechanical engineering student at college in the Northeast. I wanted to ask if there are things for me that I should be doing at the moment in order to prepare for my future career. Luckily, ME was something I did make the right decision because I do enjoy the academic aspects of it and than the physical stuff that I had to do. Which brings me to my questions and concerns as well as some sort of plans for the future and how I should prepare for it    

1) Internship/Co-ops: That one is covered since the university I go to mandates that in order to graduate, I need at least 1 year of experiences(2x6-7 month block or 2x1 academic semester plus summer) My university is pretty well known for having its Co-Op programs since and that works in my favor which makes it easier for me to find jobs and apply to it. Every year, my university sets up 2 Career fair where 250 companies come to recruit students. I get the chance to go to 3 career fair(Last one is due to me being deaf)

2)Formula SAE: I'm on it and its been fun so far. I like the fact that I'm being taught by older students in the process of how they build cars and that they've been giving me small pieces to make and machine. That they have been teaching the parts that go on cars and that I'm happy I get to apply what I'm learning so far. I do plan on keep doing this the rest of my academic life:)  

3) How high of the GPA should I go for? I don't plan on killing myself over a 4.0. At the same time, I'm doing well in classes atm and I'm curious if there is some sort of GPA that I should stay within?  

4)**CAD.** I am building a desktop for my personal entertainment and I'm wondering if I should spend more time modeling on CAD. Basically, my university is teaching me about CAD(Creo primarily, and I plan to try FusionCAD/Solidworks in my free time).  
I know that Computer Science majors are highly encouraged to develop their own code for their personal projects so they could market themselves for their internships and career. That they do it in order to show that even outside classes, they were constantly making their projects to improve themselves.  
My question regarding computer science majors and how the prepared students prepared themselves by coding personal projects and than sharing it, is it worth for me to keep continuing CAD? I enjoy the modeling aspects of it and find it really appealing to keep doing it. I want to know if I can keep doing my personal projects on CAD and than when the time comes, I can share it with the recruiter or list that Ive been working on CAD projects in my free time. **TLDR** Is it worth to develop personal projects in CAD?  
  
5)Programming: I don't care much for this. I chose ME since I cant stand coding anything more complicated than a simple text based RPG. But I do know that I need to use it for Matlab. From what I understand, do I need to go further in programming or just stick with Matlab and not go further into learning about Python? Just stick with Matlab and keep developing my CAD skills?  


Please let me know how I am doing and the other things that I should also do!

I'm getting the chance of a lifetime to intern at the most prestigious law-firm in the state, and it's not something I take for granted!

I'm there 4 days a week, whenever I can get time off from my college work. And you and a few other employees at the company have decided to take me under your collective wing and help me learn to be the best Secretary I can be!

Of course, you have a very different idea of what the perfect Secretary might be... And i'm not the brightest girl, so its hard to know where a line might need to be drawn...

I'm a tiny (5'4) blonde girl after all, and even though I'm not blessed with massive tits, I think I don't look too bad! Hopefully I can find someone here at this law-firm that is able to make me perfect!

------------------------

Hopefully you're able to tell that i'm looking for someone (or someones) to corrupt me as I try to be the best Secretary possible. Kinks include non-con, dub-con, corruption, cumplay, public indecency, exhibition, free-use, the usual.

Please feel free to ask me anything you might want to know! As always, better writers ans those who use a bit of details (or gifs/pictures) might receive a bit more attention.

Hoping to hear from you all :)"

Can someone change for better ?. I feel whatever i do or don't is fundamentally related to my habits and general attitude in life(the sum total of my personality).
I can go after some clearly defined goals intensely and with a lot of enthusiasm, but once i encounter strong failures(which are not too strong in actuality but they feel like huge setbacks to me).
I tend to lose hope and fall back into a cycle of anxiety , fear and laziness. 


I also find hard to focus on multiple things that are equally important to me , For eg. if I have an exam the next week and someone tells me that you gotta study for the test and not care about anything else in the world , i can obsessively study for 12 hours a day with ease. But the moment this idealistic situation becomes more practical with the test coinciding , with project thesis to be submitted, internships to be applied to, following exercising routine while maintaining a healthy diet. Failures in any of these other auxiliary tasks directly affect my performance in all of the task, Even though i feel i have enough time in the day to be able to satisfactorily complete all of these, but the uncertainty introduced by tasks like seeking internships , which aren't directly under my control, tend to disrupt all other tasks. 


I have had pretty darn good periods in my life when i was working very productively on things , but most of these periods have a distinguishing feature, I had a clear singular goal at that time, so i was able to focus easily, Now that i have multiple things to cater to, that are far more dependent on external situations, i find it hard to focus and work on these things and small failures affect me in a big way.


During these time I feel i just keep losing to myself. I make to do lists ,read motivational stuff , self help books and have been trying all the different strategies for a little over a year now, but i feel the strongest opposition to my goals is just me. I cannot relentlessly try because small things affect me and i quickly go off track for long periods. So how do I change myself i feel if i succeed in changing myself , rest of the things are secondary in nature. 

Any help is appreciated! Do you know someone who has changed themselves willingly for good? How did they do it?

756xwa,0,2017-10-09,So I ate one mushroom a few hours ago hoping it would help with my Sunday night depression...,missreginaface,shrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/756xwa/so_i_ate_one_mushroom_a_few_hours_ago_hoping_it/,"What a bad idea. I suffer from pretty extreme depression and usually it gets especially bad Sunday nights for your typical reasons. I thought I'd take one mushroom just so maybe I could experience a different and positive perspective but that's not what happened. 

After about an hour, I wasn't really feeling much so I hopped in the shower. That's when things started getting bad. I started getting panicky and just like really uncomfortable with myself. My fiance came home and I felt uneasy talking to him, even through the shower curtain. Then my grandma called and that made it worse... she's the kind of family member that wants to know everything about everything and kept asking questions about me and my partner.

Anyways, now my fiance is asleep and I'm in the living room trying to turn this microtrip around. I have some trippy music playing, but all it's doing is depressing me further. I feel a bit nauseated even though I only ate one shroom which was probably a gram at the most. I feel incredibly panicky and uneasy. I really don't like this and I don't know what to do to feel better. I need to go to sleep soon, as I have an internship orientation in the morning (very important), but I know I won't be able to fall asleep if I'm feeling like this. I also have a bit of school work I have to finish. Nothing hard or intimidating, but it is a task that should take about 30 minutes.

Any suggestions of how to turn this microtrip around? I have klonopin but I actually took some a few hours before I ate the mushroom and it clearly didn't do anything good. I'm not in a good place and could use some help please."
757iok,15,2017-10-09,I think Romain Grosjean is starting to feel pressured by Kevin Magnussen,Trae_Ize,formula1,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/757iok/i_think_romain_grosjean_is_starting_to_feel/,"Given his comments after the Suzuka GP, it seems a bit like it.
Last year he was battling Gutierrez which gave him no problems at all. This year it's a bit different with Kevin as his teammate, he's getting challenged much harder.

He's still ahead in the points and he leads their qualifying battle with 10-7. However, Kevin Magnussen leads their intern race battle where both drivers completed the race with 6-4 and given his comments after the race... to me it seems as he's a bit pressured.

After the race he said:

&gt; I was behind Kevin the whole race and I had more pace in the car than I could show. I wish I could have started further ahead as I think I could have challenged the Force Indias

&gt; I was a second faster but I didn't want to take any risks with Kevin in front of me.

K-Mag didn't quite agree:

&gt; I felt that Romain wasn't faster than me. It was only because I couldn't get past Massa that he was so close. I had used a lot of tyre to get past him. We got most out of the weekend with the pace we had, both cars in the points which I'm happy for.

That Grosjean is pressured, I think can also be seen in the many big and small ""off track moments"" in training and qualification he has. He's off the track much more than Magnussen is in general.
Obviously, his crash in Malaysia was not his fault whatsoever.

I also think that Grosjeans comments after the qualification suggests, he feels challenged by Magnussen. After the session, Grosjean was talking about how he could have gone to Q3 without problems.
But if thats the case, why was he slower than Magnussen in his first attempt? And why did he risk it all and thus ending up destroying the car in his second attempt?

It's good that he has self confidence, but if he was really that much quicker than Magnussen, why didn't he just overtake him? Yes, it's hard to overtake on Suzuka but it's definitely possible-

In my opinion, he should let his driving on the track speak for itself, 'cause comments like these don't help the team or himself.

What do you guys think?

75837t,56,2017-10-09,"Why Do People Think of Creators as ""Friends""? Here's My Recent Experience...",Zilldude,funhaus,https://www.reddit.com/r/funhaus/comments/75837t/why_do_people_think_of_creators_as_friends_heres/,"So I have been an avid viewer of Rooster Teeth content for many years. I loved their content, and when Funhaus came along I became a huge fan. I believe one draw was that I was just starting college when Funhaus started under RT, and their content really related to my age demographic.

But having been active in YouTube content since I was in the fourth grade, I never truly experienced what others do in regards to feeling as though content creators were like friends. Yes, I attended RTX and sometimes sent fun videos I made to my favorite creators. But I never had that feeling that the content was doing more than entertaining me (which it did so well).

However, about a month ago I ended a relationship with a woman who I had been dating for nearly 3 years. I felt empty and depressed; I couldn't get out of my bed and didn't shower for more than a week.

It was in that stupor that I started to feel that attachment. The only moment of my day for literal WEEKS where I actually smiled... was watching Bruce fart and sing about how straight they all were. It was such an odd feeling to experience after being with so many creators since I was a kid.

And no, I don't think of them as actual friends. Of course I've often thought about it, considering I am trying to move into online video creation from my background in videography. Hell, I've applied to work at Funhaus as an intern before! But I think what I'm trying to say is that don't knock people for thinking of these wonderful people as more than just entertainers. I wouldn't go as far as to say they saved my life or anything, but they definitely added a few laughs during one of the most tragic moments of my life. And they still continue to do that.

So thank you, Funhaus Team. You all may not always realize it, but somewhere out there you're making someone's life a bit brighter with rule 34. And I think that is amazing."
7589h7,4,2017-10-09,"It feels like I can never be happy again without a partner, despite all the actions I've taken",S-Imperia,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/7589h7/it_feels_like_i_can_never_be_happy_again_without/,"Hi everyone.

In april, my girlfriend broke up with me after 6½ years to be with someone else. It really broke me, as this also brought back my repressed emotions about the passing of my father.

When I was 14 years old, my father had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He passed away one day before my 19th birthday. During these times I repressed my feelings a lot, and the only person I could really talk to was my girlfriend.

I started going to a therapist shortly after the break-up, and have been on antidepressants for a couple of months now. I don't sleep very well and sometimes wake up crying because I have a lot of nightmares. I also have been neglecting my internship up to the point where I know I should do something yet cannot find the motivation to do so.

Despite this, I've started working out with a personal trainer twice a week, I've been eating healthier and I even signed up for a workshop acting to which I went without knowing anyone there. All this is very nice and I am glad I took these steps because they give me joy.

But still, it doesn't feel enough. I miss intimacy in all forms of the word. I miss talking with someone about the deeper things in life, and sharing my ideas and passions. I also miss having someone to cuddle with, and kiss, and adore.

I just feel like I can't be happy without having a partner. It's like my brain is telling me I need to find a girlfriend or I'll never be happy again.

Since I've been in a relationship since I was 15 (I'm currently 22), I've never dated or asked people out or anything, so I don't really know how to do that. Also, my selfconscience really took a dive since the break-up.

Do any of you have any advice for me? Things I could try to do to either find someone new in my life, or be happy without having the need of a partner?

Thanks for reading :)

759ih4,1,2017-10-09,Why am I not happy?,Fr_LostInLife,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/759ih4/why_am_i_not_happy/,"Hello there, sorry if it's a long text, but I don't know who to talk with about that, so I'll just let everything here.

I'm a 24yo guy who has everything to be happy. I traveled a lot (and still do), have good friends all over the world that often send me messages and seem to care about me, I see a lot of people everyday, go to bars and clubs with them, pretty much never eats alone, have the funniest friends in the world, a loving family, I'm studying in a good university, but still feel empty. If you don't mind the read, here's my (unoriginal) story.

I used to be a very popular and happy teen until the end of middle school at 15 (I was objectively good-looking, fit, the best in all of my classes without doing shit, pretty much everything a teen could hope for). But then, it got a bit weird. Puberty hit me quite hard, and I'm not that guy anymore. During the middle of high school, when I understood I wasn't physically changing in a good way, I started to fuck things up. I drank a lot, smoked a lot of weed everyday, and even took stronger drugs when I started uni. I started not to have any feelings anymore for anyone (not only about love, I'm speaking about a loss of empathy, of interests in other people's life, etc...). Plus, I was weighting 55 kg for 175cm, couldn't stay awake for more than 10 hours straight, had a failing memory, looking or my words every few seconds; I was a zombie, until an event pushed me to finally try to get my shit together (I lost 3 very good friends at the same time in a car accident, and what hit me hard wan't their deaths, but the fact that I barely reacted when I learned it, like I didn't care). So I decided to leave the city I was in to start something new, and moved out to another city to study. I stopped drinking alone, reduced my weed intakes and stopped taking any hard drugs.
Now, I'm physically way better: I am quite fit, and I don't think I'm dumb at all, all my friends tell me I'm really fun and interesting, I leave a very good impression to nearly all the people I meet. If I had to pick one ""objective"" flaw, it would be that I don't have the mean's to fulfill my ambitions when it comes to girls (Not the biggest problem in the world, I know): Idk if it's because I use to get the ""top of the notch"" girls when I was younger, but the very (VERY) few  girls I could be into are way hotter that I am now (Not speaking about models, but more like the cute girls that most of the guy are into, the ones that always got engaged by guys in bars, clubs, or just when they meet new people. I've had a significant number of really nice/cute/smart/anything girls showing interests in me, and even dated a few of them, but never felt anything really deep.
And that's this thing. I barely have feelings anymore, even since I stopped my unhealthy life style, I feel like I just destroyed my brain's ability to feel a lot of things. Since middle school, I've nearly never been in love (I don't even like to say ""in love"", I think it's a subjective concept). What doesn't help is that I never really like a girl from the beginning, I need a looong time to begin to feel something for someone. So when it finally happens (or the very few times it did), I'm already a close friend of her when I understand that I'm into her, and confess it would just break a friendship. I did confess once, as I thought it would be unhealthy to stay friends with her not knowing that, and that's how I lost one of my best friend, so I took the decision to not confess if I'm not sure I have a chance (In the last 8 years, I've really been into 2 girls, that both became close friends of mine. I told the first one, who then started to feel awkward when seeing me, and never told the second one who is one of my best friend, as I love being with her as a friend, but the more time I spend with her, the harder it becomes for me to listen to her telling me about other guys or not to tell what I feel...

Enough about love, it's not supposed to be the main point of this post:
When it comes to my everyday life, I don't think I'm depressed, I don't have dark thoughts or things like that. I'm just ... Bored, of everything. When I go out with my friends, I actually have fun, but as soon as I wake up the next morning, I'm wondering what I'm doing with my life. I used to be interested in nearly everything, played numerous music instruments, used to be really knowledgeable in a lot of different subjects, always willing to learn. Now, I'm studying in the broadest domain ever (International business), not knowing what I'll do after that. My profesional life is theoretically good too. With my recognized university, I got into good internships, and have a valuable part time job, I have enough money to live decently in a city that everyone likes, my timetables allows me to travel accross Europe, which is the only thing I truly like.

So here's THE point of this post: I feel empty, bored, I could even maybe say sad. I don't know why and it's killing me. 
My love life  may be sad, ok, I guess I would need to change a few things (but what). But aside from that, why can't I enjoy anything? I'm genuinely happy when I'm with my friends and appreciate them, and enjoy it when I travel, but these are the only moments I feel something. Nothing impacts me, I feel like an asshole for not feeling sad when a friend got dump by his gf, or when another one lost her father. I even got diagnosed with a cancer without giving a shit (turned out not to be a cancer in the end but still).
My friends and I are all very close, and I know that if I speak to any of them, it will soon or later be known by the others, so I cannot really tell any of them. So here I am, with nearly everything I could need, but still bored with everything, I even recently started to take amphetamines, because they at least make me feel something.

tl;dr: Used to be a happy child/teen, got wrecked non stop with different drugs during 3 years, and now barely have feelings anymore. I just want to be normal, to be in love with someone that also loves me, to feel happy for someone, or to share his pains.

I'm tired of being a feelingless mofo, I know my friends are amazing, and I want to be able to enjoy that instead of always pretending. I would like to be able to really mean it when I tell someone I miss him, I would like to be able to tell the only girl I really like that I like her, without her thinking that I her friend for that...

Anyway, don't feel the obligation to answer this thread, I just wanted to put words on what I feel, I don't think I succeeded in doing so (plus, as you can see, English is not my native language), but at least I tried.

Have a good day everyone.

I was doing fine since I started, passing with high grades, confident in all of my works and presentations, I even became known to the faculty due to my constant perseverance in getting everything right.

But when I started my internship back in 2015, I realized that I don't want this career after all.
I found out so many sides of my profession (see my username) that I didn't like.
Add to the fact that I'm living in a 3rd world country where integrity is a huge question mark even for the people who you look up to.

Back then, my problem was so simple, even if I was feeling guilty of continuing this career.
I told myself that I will finish that last few units so one day it will be my turn to change things for the better and make a name in the most honest way possible, unlike the people that I had met.

But my thesis mock defense came and it started going downhill.
I was excited about my topic, I have my cue cards prepared, organized, and my presentation was praised by my colleagues and a professor friend.
When it was my turn, I wasn't scared at all.

But this professor just had to interrupt me in the middle of my words just to laugh at what I was wearing.
I was wearing a professional set of clothes, heck, it's even an expensive one that I bought abroad.

He was laughing because the colors resemble a certain local food chain and decided to look behind towards my fellow classmates and started looking at their clothes.
In the middle of my presentation, he freaking interrupted to make fun of everybody's clothes because of mine.

Now, a lot of people told me it wasn't a big deal, but it hit me differently.
There was laughing in the room and I was no longer on track for my presentation that I ended up flunking it and getting my presentation rejected.

I was hurt and I was trying my best not to cry.

When I got home, I couldn't sleep.
Flashbacks after flashbacks of all my horrible memories started flooding in that I didn't realize that I was purposely banging my head against my bed's wooden headboard.

I was bullied growing up.
I never fit in anywhere.
I was the weird kid that no one wants to sit with.

Heck, there was a time when even an entire student body started treating me like a disease.
Even teachers were making fun of me and they all got away with because no one would listen to me or even believe in me.

Not even the people in my own home.

I transferred to another school and I was okay for my entire high school life.
But it was a mask.
I was burying my bullied life back that I became too ambitious.
I tried to learn as many things as possible so I wouldn't be out of a conversation.

So I left high school without friends but there were many people with high expectations on me.

I ended up where I am today because the career I originally wanted was believed to be useless.

I really wanted to be a fine arts student.
But due to the discouragement from almost everybody I know, I went with the one I have now.

What kind of people would compliment your art then end the conversation with stories of failure in the artistic field?

After that mock defense incident, I couldn't do anything anymore.
I lost motivation.
I lost my passion.
I couldn't do things the way I used to.

All I wanted was to vanish and never come back.

I was purposely missing classes and consultations, but I still passed the first few times.
I was purposely avoiding calls, text, direct messages because I am starting to despise communication with everyone, even my parents.

Then came the supposed second to the last term where the real deal of thesis defense was on.
I started to purposely drop the subject and avoiding every single query about me, my graduation, and my future.

Mid-year of 2016, my parents noticed my pattern and started encouraging me more.
But it had no impact on me, even now.

I just keep dropping and purposely failing.
Like I'm purposely making everyone hate.
But it wasn't working.

So I had a leave of absence and discussed my problems with my parents.
I asked for a psychiatrist to help me.

You know what they said?
""It's all in your head.""
""I've met people with bigger problems, you can't end your life because of what's yours.""
""I had worse.""

""Please stay alive, we worked hard to give a good life.""

Those words made my feelings worse.

I went to Disneyland with a few relatives and I felt alone.
I went to reunions and parties and I hated it.
I went out with a prospect and I don't feel giddy anymore.
I ignored all of my best friends.

I came back for another term because my parents insisted that I should've graduated months ago and a lot of our other relatives were asking about me.

I did, but I immediately dropped the term.

I couldn't do it anymore.
I realized how much I hate our school and all the lies behind its institution and the people.
I realized that I hated everything.

One person pointed out that I got fat and told me that I  will graduate soon and that they were willing to help me with everything I need.
I became more miserable.

It was so worse that I'd rather die than become a responsible person.
I'd rather die than finish my thesis and my course.
I'd rather die than be in the same room, place, or profession as anyone from my past.
I'd rather die than follow the path that I started.

I tried to open once more, this time with a childhood friend.

It barely worked because she had her own depression therapist and not one of their suggestions worked for me.

So I'm more miserable now.

Motivation methods make me sad.
Inspirational stories/words make me want to kill myself.
Advise from others keeps giving me a heavy feeling irritation and wanting to hurt them.

When they tell me positive things, the urge to kill myself becomes stronger.

""I'll pray for you.""
""I trust you.""
""You can do it!""

They pass through my ears and I don't feel the sincerity in them.
They all sound like lies to me now.

This past month, my Mom was willing to find me a psychiatrist.
But we couldn't because stigmatizers in this country are everywhere and psychiatric therapy are worth more than 5 years of regular living cost.
The cheaper ones were too far from where I live and the commute was too horrible.
The ""affordable"" label in them is just too unrealistic.

For now, I am going to try to take a 6-month course in Multi-Media Arts, just for the weekends.
But I am not sure if this will help get myself on track.

My Mom was happy that I'm taking a side course.
But she still wants me to come back.
But I don't want to.

I couldn't tell her.
I don't know how.
Even when she told me she would listen, I couldn't get the words out.

I'm just floating around right now.
I don't want to be part of anything anymore.
I badly want to move away and never return.
But I got no money or place to stay.

The things that make me happy doesn't work anymore.
Movies, TV Series, art, science, music, even books.
I'll be engaged for a while, but then it will be gone right after I'm done.
I've been trying new things, but at the end of it, I just feel like vanishing.

I don't know what to do.
I can't keep floating around here forever."
759zbb,27,2017-10-09,Take five minutes to inform your representatives of your opposition to any new gun control measures,TripleChubz,liberalgunowners,https://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/759zbb/take_five_minutes_to_inform_your_representatives/,"# Ominous Rumors of Stuff Coming Down
I'm a Patreon supporter of MAC, and Tim has had some very ominous warnings lately about his dealings with the NRA behind the scenes. He's getting rumors that big legislation is going to be pushed soon, and his fear is that many Republicans will roll over on the issue in favor of getting other things passed as a compromised. He's also saying that the NRA seems to be failing to solidify a position on this situation and are sending very mixed signals about where they stand.
Please take five minutes and write/call each of your representatives in congress and make it clear to them that you strong oppose any new gun control legislation that may be proposed in wake of Vegas.
Rumors I'm seeing elsewhere are that AWB 2.0, Mag capacity limits, and other failed measures from before will return in a big way over the next few weeks. We need to preemptively get our voices heard. Let your reps know that you will vote for and even help promote their opponents at the next election if they roll over and allow any new gun control measures to pass.

&amp;nbsp;

# Find Your Representatives

[You can find your representatives here.](https://whoismyrepresentative.com/) Call or email them and let them know you don't support them voting in favor of any new legislation. See my quick guide below if you're nervous or unsure about how to handle your communication.

&amp;nbsp;

# Brief Guide on Writing/Calling Representatives
When writing/calling your representative's office, you don't have to be super detailed. Keep in mind that most communications go through their intern staff. Don't be angry and threatening, just polite and matter-of-fact.

Example:

&gt; ""Hi there! I'm a voter in [such n' such district] and wanted to reach out and let Representative [name] know that I strongly oppose any new gun control legislation being proposed in the wake of the Vegas tragedy.

&gt; Anything pushed through now will be knee-jerk policy making that shouldn't be considered. Vegas was a senseless tragedy that wouldn't have been prevented by any new laws. We do not need to give up more of our rights for the security theater that gun controllers want. 

&gt; Please also let Representative [name] know that I voted for/against them in the last election, and my support for them in 20xx (next election year) is contingent upon how they vote on any gun control measures moving forward.""

If you call, they'll thank you and wish you a good day. If you email, you'll likely get a form-letter back in a few weeks stating the representative's intentions/opinion and thanking you for writing to them. 

The representatives don't read all of these messages themselves. They get hundreds a day from various people wanting different things. Interns are the ones who go through them and mark them down in broad categories like ""[your name] opposes gun control, is voter"" and they move on. They analyze the data coming in to give them a bead on their voter's wants/needs/opinions. 

In the end, they'll vote how they want based on information they have that we likely don't. No one in Washington is determining their votes purely off their constituent's opinions. Making your voice heard can sway them, though, so it's valuable to take the five minutes to make your opinion heard, even if your senator is completely on the other side of the aisle/issue.

75b5b4,5,2017-10-09,"Guidance needed: Cute professor kind of hit on me at a formal event. I want to get the ball rolling again, but am unsure of his relationship status, how to navigate power issues, and how best to actually get the ball rolling again...",bambnoodled,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/75b5b4/guidance_needed_cute_professor_kind_of_hit_on_me/,"A few months ago, I was doing an internship linked to my uni degree. Part of the internship involved a sizeable formal event, with many academics attending. I was looking pretty fine if I do say so myself - very nice dress, very deep neckline, hair up, good makeup, the works. I’d also just gotten word that I’d gotten a job I was after, so basically I was on top of the world this night.

Everyone ended up dancing towards the end of the night, and I was picking songs (we didn’t have a dj). I threw on a particular song and started singing along pretty loudly to pump people up. I heard a guy’s voice behind me exclaim “Whoa, what a voice!” I gave him a grin; it was a professor who I hadn’t had a chance to meet, but I knew was a pretty big deal. 

I would have taken it as a nice compliment and nothing more, but later the interns were hanging out getting ready to go out and this professor came along. It wasn’t a weird thing - it’s a yearly event, and younger academics often come along. What was ‘weird’ (as in unusual, but not unpleasant) was that I got a strong vibe he was flirting with me. I was hanging out with him and another (male) intern, drinking wine and talking shit basically. Somehow the conversation got into skin softness, and I made some throwaway comment about how a friend of mine had been surprised by my shoulders being very soft. A few minutes later someone asks what our little huddle was talking about and, in a definite Freudian slip moment, Cute Prof goes “sexy shoulders”.  Also, a different intern actually pulled me aside at one point and asked if I was tuning CP.

We all end up going out and it was just a regular night - apart from CP shouting everyone drinks, which was a nice and honestly unexpected surprise. Honestly, that night I was hanging out for another dude, who I ended up kind of dating for a while. So I lost track of CP that night, and in general.

Recently though, I’ve been considering that I might have genuinely missed out on connecting with a cool guy who has his shit together and was attractive and attracted to me, and basically feeling like I ripped myself off. But I’m a little hesitant to pursue him, for a few reasons.

I’ve been trying to do some detective work on CP - checking around on dating sites, googling for marriages, heck, I even signed up for bloody SeekingArrangement just to see if he existed on there. No luck. I’m really hesitant about trying to pursue him without knowing whether he already has someone on the scene - I’m not keen on putting myself in an awkward situation or doing another woman dirty.

We don’t operate in the same academic field, so I don’t think there’s a huge scope for abuse of power issues. That said, I imagine it’s probably something he would have on his mind. There’s definitely an age difference - it’s hard to tell his age, it could be anywhere from about 6 years to 20 years... So if I were to put myself forward, I’d have to be really clear that I was interested - which, again, awkward when not knowing the girlfriend situation.

Thirdly - *because* we don’t operate in the same academic field, I’ll have to go pretty out of my way to run into him. I know where his office would be - should I go and study in that building, look hella cute, and hope I run into him? Should I follow him on twitter and send a slightly cheeky DM referencing the formal event or the night out after? Should I - oh god, I’m nervous just considering this one - add him on Facebook?

TL;DR had a flirty few interactions with a uni professor, and am considering trying to put things into motion and see where they go. Concerned about how to navigate his unknown relationship status, potential abuse of power concerns/age gap worries, and in general, how best to “run into” him and get things going again.


*Also, just because you never know who reads these things: if this sounds familiar and you think you might be the Cute Prof in question, and remember me fondly - shoot me a DM, hey.* 😘"

Mostly I just wanted to say that I'm sorry I haven't been very active in the Wolfpack reddit, discord or watching fellow Wolfpack streams and videos. Life has been difficult for me lately. As some of you know I transitioned a few months ago from working 25 hours as an intern to 40 hours a week as the youth director of our church. It has been a good change but it's also had its ups and downs and certain points have been super stressful for me, especially of late. Also my wife has had transition lately from practically getting laid off to now working 50 hours a week starting next Monday. 

It's been quite the overwhelming couple months and I feel like I don't have much time or when I do have the time that I don't have the energy to keep up with much else. Even my own channel is suffering and it's a bit discouraging, nonetheless keeping up with you guys is tough right now. 

Anyways thank you all for your support and encouragement along the way. I truly consider some of you as my friends that I wish I could hang out with more and for those who are newer to the group I wish I could get to know you all better. You guys are a great group and I'm encouraged to see it grow and to see all of your channels growing as well. I'm just not sure when I'll be back to being a regular active member but hopefully it's sooner rather than later. Love you guys and I hope to see you keep growing!"

Prison would have been far preferable to the outcome.,Markdd8,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/75dpfy/cmv_monica_lewinsky_never_should_have_caved_to/," To be forced to reveal the salacious details of her sexual encounters with Bill Clinton in the White House (1995-96) under threat of imprisonment.   We all know how that worked out for her.  The new euphemism: ""getting a Lewinski.""

She is still affected by this.

http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/10/09/monica-lewinsky-still-impacted-by-bill-clinton-affair-m-still-held-frozen-in-amber.html

If ever there was someone who was justified in telling officials to f--- off, it was her.  Ken Starr and his henchmen never would have gotten away with keeping her in prison for any length of time, IMO.   Public support for her release would have been massive. 
* * * 
&gt;Extremely brief summary:  Lewinsky, then an intern, and Clinton engaged in sex in the White House numerous times.  At some point a semen-stained dress  was procured by a third party who gave it to conservatives intent on discrediting Clinton. The dress was the incontrovertible evidence.  Legal proceedings were initiated, and Lewinsky was required, under threat of prosecution, to provide the details of the encounters.  They included Lewinsky performing oral sex on Clinton, hence the subsequent widespread use of the term ""getting a Lewinsky.""  Apparently a cigar was also used in some penetration activities. 

Had the story simply been that they had sex (without details), little cause for embarrassment.  Almost a feather in her cap.  *(JFK engaged in sex in the White House indoor pool with 2 women, nicknamed Fiddle and Faddle.  The women acknowledged the activities, which, of course, were not detailed.)*

But the descriptions of Clinton-Lewinsky sex activities were very explicit.  And read across America.  Apparently intercourse was not even one of the activities; it was mostly Lewinsky servicing Clinton.  Hard to imagine a worse case of public humiliation for a woman. (She was 22 at the time, Clinton 49). 

Amazing that there was wide support from conservatives for this:  Forcing a woman to reveal such detail under threat of prison and then facilitating its public dissemination.  (Real scumbags, Starr and his supporters.)

75e6gh,52,2017-10-09,America’s worst dirty secret revealed right here…Weinstein is not an anomaly!,iltdiTX,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/75e6gh/americas_worst_dirty_secret_revealed_right/,"
This country has a lot of dirty secrets, but there is one in particular that is so pervasive, so evil, and so concealed, that literally nobody is talking about it. This special crime makes it possible for lots of other criminals to be walking around, driving around, working — and making decisions about your life — interacting with you; making deals and contracts on behalf of many different companies you deal with, big and small, AND all without your knowledge. This is happening in every big, medium and even every small town in America.


How could this be you say? Surely this is just Karl being crazy or exaggerating – right?


Before you decide to quit reading and dismiss this article as beneath your concern, ask yourself one little question, how DID a man like Harvey Weinstein, get away with all this blatantly illegal conduct for DECADES and you, the average stiff, knew nothing of it? To make the question even tougher, ask yourself this – if the FBI and other law enforcement had been aware of Weinstein and had been ignoring it – would the President (Obama) have sent his daughter to intern with the man? I don’t think so. The answer is – they did not know — and they did not know for a reason, which is so sick, so twisted, and so offensive to good public order that it must be stopped and Gosh Darn It, if possible, I’m going to stop it.


Weinstein is rich, powerful, and he was a very influential man, who also, as it happens, has apparently been paying off and covering up “alleged” sexual assaults for DECADES.


How could this happen you say?


How do the rich and/or powerful always get off?


I’m going to tell you, and to be honest — I had a hand in this shameful behavior for years – because I was once rich and powerful – and had all these secrets opened up to me.


Now I’m going to tell them to you.


You don’t have to buy anything, I’m not going to make you click anywhere else, you can stay right here, read just todays blog to the end — and get the real dope on Americas’ dirtiest secret — the one that must be revealed, and exposed, and eventually changed — before we can adjust the countries trajectory in a positive way.


This secret is really MILLIONS of secrets, millions of crimes, millions of times people have been abused, attacked, robbed, raped, sexually assaulted and/or humiliated – AND nothing has been done about it. How is this possible you say?


“I live in America, we have good laws, incorruptible (generally) police, careful courts, how can this happen?”


It can happen and does happen everyday — because of a peculiar legal situation we have in this country – and because the Lawyers of America, are a ruthless, unprincipled, hypocritical, thieving bunch of lying assholes, that will cut your throat and leave your family homeless for a healthy hourly fee.

 

Why do I say that? Because the Harvey Weinstein’s of this world are protected, enabled, even incentivized by a legal algorithm I am about to describe – created and executed by lawyers every single day — and that must be broken or it will break this country.


Every day, thousands of lawyers go to work and put on what I call the façade. They pretend to be important, smart, knowledgeable, ethical and law abiding. They demand others treat them this way and they even condescend to their clients. This is all bullshit, as I am about to tell you, the majority of these pretenders are MUCH worse criminals than their clients, have a set of morals the devil would be proud of, and do more harm with a briefcase than Al Capone did with a machine gun.


While president of the 6 daily Journal Newspapers, that surrounded Washington in the nineties, I had 350 employees, a press plant, a truck fleet, 5 regional offices and a production headquarters. It was a complicated company to run and sometimes things went wrong. When that happened, if our in-house counsel couldn’t handle the problem I would call in outside, high caliber legal “talent”. These brilliant, famous, and popular lawyers had years of experience, connections, friendships and clout with every court (and almost every judge) in northern Virginia.


They quickly showed me the ropes. The first step of this scam is to understand our legal system — which makes the lawyer and his client one in the eyes of the law. This is supposedly for confidentiality reasons, and may have begun that way, but those days are gone, now this confidentiality thing is really just an excuse to carry out the scheme I am about to describe.


At the newspaper, we had a sales manager that was sexually harassing the female employees in his department. Fearing retaliation, the employees handled it a number of ineffective ways — before one of them slipped me a note one day describing everything going on down there. After an investigation, which verified the claim, I decided to let the manager go. My lawyers had a completely different plan. First, they made settlements with each female employee, that were completely confidential, that did not require the paper to charge him – and that had the money pay out tied to future confidentiality.


Next, they wanted me to put him in treatment, and then after the treatment, retire him without ever putting him back on active duty on the sales floor. They spoke with the newspapers owners of course and explained to them how even though this was more expensive than my solution by far – it would protect the newspaper from negative publicity, future lawsuits, fake lawsuits, and gave the corporation leverage over the damaged employees. As lawyers, they could draft, get executed, and handle all the paperwork needed to make this legal and airtight.


Of course, the owners ordered the cover-up. And it worked. The Journal Newspaper itself was never hit with a giant controversy or lawsuit concerning a long-time high level employee and everybody was happy. Except the female employees at the next newspaper he went to, the female employees left at the Journal, who, although compensated, were never right again after watching their tormenter leave, get another job and retain all his reputation. They ended up feeling dirty, wrong, used and betrayed.


They were right.


This is not an exception. Racism, sexual advances and assault, rape, theft, coercion, fraud, and a whole list of other offenses are really a disaster for these people but are just another notch in the belt for today’s modern lawyer. Weinstein did not cover all these problems – his lawyers did – over and over again.


The better lawyers are so smug about all this, so sure of the way they explain it all and handle it, it can take months or even years before you realize lawyers cover-up thousands of such situation everyday in America, on a range of topics, and always, always, always with only one thought, cover-up, hide, conceal, bury, pay-off, find leverage, keep the ball rolling, don’t fix anything, BECAUSE that is an admission of wrong doing — and in this algorithm –you should never admit wrong doing, except to a judge for leniency, and only then after all other legal mediation efforts written in to this long algorithm have failed – and this is MORE true — if you are doing a lot of wrong.


Wall Street executives stole Billions, manipulated LIBOR, crashed our financial system, and did all with huge amounts of recoverable data — to prove it — and like the Journal sales manager, Harvey Weinstein and the Wall Street cabal — NONE of these people are ever charged with a crime, ever even NAMED, and if you think it’s because these people are genius’s, believe me, it isn’t. Let me explain.


Ryan Phillips was the Journal newspapers owner’s son. I think he was literally one of the stupidest human beings I ever met. On top of that, he was real creep show, acting inappropriately to young women and idolizing Robert E. Lee (not kidding).


I can give you the intimate details on both times he was arrested, once for masturbating in front of a female girl’s dorm in Richmond at the Governor’s inaugural and once for instructing two of his employees (Ryan also own gas stations) to threaten other gas station owners – in Florida – during a hurricane; to go along with his price gouging scheme — or else. Ryan never served time for either of these, just like Weinstein hasn’t and just like the Wall Street guys didn’t and just like almost every business owner and/or high level manager doesn’t –because the lawyers have a scheme, this settle-but-demand-confidentiality scheme that keeps the perpetrator’s in the field, working, earning, and of course, 99% of the time — committing more crime.


If the elite are worried about you, they switch the scheme around, file a lawsuit against you, claiming you did a bunch of bad stuff, publicize it, and use this phony trumped up leverage to force you into a confidentiality/settlement agreement that covers their bases.


All this takes is money and lawyers willing to do it and virtually every corporate lawyer I’ve ever met fits that description. Right now in California, there are hundreds of studio and entertainment executives who are looking up who the Weinstein’s lawyers were – NOT because they want to avoid these scum bag lawyers (who didn’t just know what he was doing–but facilitated his continuation of the illegal behavior) but because these lawyers let this predator operate for decades and if they can do that for him – well by god, think what they can do for my business!


Congress will never touch this of course, but there is a man named Trump in the White House — and he’s different than all the rest – he might just tackle this one –because it’s so tough, so one else would dare touch it.


The solution actually is very simple. Drafting agreements — which make criminal conduct confidential — should be illegal for lawyers to do in the course of their civil work load. This would cost them billions and tons of leverage, but my god, would it ever re-tilt the playing field between the rich and everybody else, slightly back toward an angle that isn’t a danger to our democracy.

75e6xt,1,2017-10-09,I'm Getting Tired and Concerned About My Roommate [19 F]'s Relationship Problems With Her Boyfriend [20-21? M],throwaway1923243,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/75e6xt/im_getting_tired_and_concerned_about_my_roommate/,"Throwaway because I don't know if my roommate or her boyfriend go on Reddit. Also sorry for any formatting issues, I'm relatively new to Reddit, usually just a reader.

So here's the story: my roommate/best friend has been dating her boyfriend for 11 months now, and we all go to the same college. I thought he was a nice guy, but he's turning out to be worse and worse as time goes on. Their relationship was pretty much fine until around when this school year started, and he started his internship in NYC (we live in a suburb of NYC so it's a whole-day trip). 

Firstly, he's way too clingy, and she has even tried talking to him about it but he just nods and smiles and continues being too clingy. It's gotten to the point where she calls Wednesdays (when he goes to his internships) her ""day off"" because she doesn't have to deal with him. I'm in a healthy LDR and I'm pretty sure this isn't healthy! The way I see it, you shouldn't /want/ to not see your significant other or see them so much that you've become bothered by them.

Secondly (and the bigger issue), they have completely opposing political and religious views, and he's started being really judgemental of her about them.

 For example, over the summer (August, very close to school starting) he accused her of being racist because she voted for Trump (he's a hardcore liberal). However, she's not actually racist (she lives with her Asian roommate [me] and while she comes from a mainly white town, she doesn't treat POC any differently than anyone else). 

Since the start of the year, about once a week, they've managed to get into a fight over something. In just four weeks, he's managed to upset her by saying she only wants to have kids someday (he doesn't) because she's a conservative Christian (and that she was brainwashed by the church); that she's never open-minded because she doesn't wanna watch his TV shows (even though she's actually tried to watch them and genuinely doesn't like them), and attributes that to her conservative political party; that she's selfish and that she'd be a terrible lawyer (she's studying law; though she's not selfish as she wants to be a public defense lawyer); and more.

Now I'm best friends with her, acquaintances with him. I'm just getting sick of her coming home crying literally once a week and me having to comfort her (I'm a Hufflepuff social work major, it's in my blood to comfort and try to help). 

While she's in a riled up state (she gets pissed off easily but never aggressive or violent), she completely agrees with me when I tell her that that's not how love should be, and that that's borderline emotionally abusive. BUT when she's calmed down from it, she starts to lie to herself and pretend everything's fine, saying ""oh, he just forgets things"". He has ADHD, I'll give him that, but how can you /forget/ that your girlfriend isn't racist? 

Just last week she wanted to break up with him, but was afraid to do it because her leadership position in a school club we're all in (he's also a leadership position) would be jeopardized. But now she acts as everything's okay, yet still complains about seeing him a ton? 

I'm just at a loss to what I can do from a ""I'm seeing my best friend suffer and I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship too so I can see where it's leading"" position. Obviously it's not my place to force them to do anything, but I can't just sit back and watch her come home crying from something shitty he's said to her /every week/. 

Sorry if it was too long, maybe it was just a vent. Thanks for reading if you've made it this far.

  **tl;dr**: I'm tired of having to comfort my best friend who I believe is in an emotionally abusive relationship, and I don't know how I can still be supportive of her if I think the relationship is unhealthy."
75ea22,2,2017-10-09,I broke her heart today,heartless_throwaway_,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/75ea22/i_broke_her_heart_today/,"I met her here, on reddit, two years ago.  Other than the three or four days last year when her phone broke unexpectedly and we were limited to communicating by reddit dm's, we have talked every single day for two years.

I'm two years older, two and a half relationships more experienced, and five time zones away. She was shy, nervous and reserved when we met. I was her topic of conversation at the dinner table, and she was my deepest, darkest secret. 

First it was messages, then texts, and then phone calls and skype conversations that lasted for hours. My heart had been destroyed the summer before, and she was looking for someone, anyone, in this wild ride we call life. I had plans to travel east with friends before I met her. After we realized what was happening, I would be alone and could slip away, I made sure to see her.  Her mom was worried, and I still remember making the decision to buy the train ticket.  No it wasn't the plan.  Yes it was expensive.  But I would see her. We met. She almost tripped on the ancient cobblestones the first time she saw me.  It was awkward at first.  I was afraid to hold her hand.  To have the white chat bubble, the voice on the phone, the face on the screen sitting there, next to me, nervously checking her train ticket for the tenth time that afternoon, was unreal.  Her eyes, bluer than any I had ever seen, were even more beautiful in person.

I took her virginity that night.  I still remember waking up and watching sleep.  Her naked body was hot against my skin. It was the most in love I had ever been. 

The alarm went off early the next morning.  I had a plane to catch and she had a train.  We had sex again, and showered together.  I realized I had left the key in the hotel room door all night.  We held hands in the cab to the train station. We found her platform, kissed, kissed again, and cried. I watched through the glass as she found her coach.  I never told her I loved her.

At the airport, I got on a plane I hated.  I went to a country I did not want to be in, to see a person I no longer cared about.  Apperently, she didn't either.  I spent two days in a hostel living on peanut butter sandwiches.

Three days later, I was in class.  I honestly did not give a fuck about high performance architecture, or green buildings, or the environment.  I did not care that an old friend died in a house fire.  I cared about her.  And I had a plan.  Get through school, get the job, get out of the cult, and get her.  Forever. They say no man is an island, but I was as close as it got.  My friends had all disappeared, my family was distracted, and I split time between school, work, and an internship.  She was my causeway to a normal life.

Time passed, we got busy. She found a job she liked, I started succeeding, and the plan began to fall into place.  I did some more traveling, and then locked in for the final push to graduation. And, unbeknownst to me, the foundation for tonight is set.

They say no man is an island, but sometimes the waters recede.  My best friend came back to town. His wife chilled out. And two other girls moved to the area. Almost overnight, for the first time in my adult life, I had a group of friends.  Over time, the friends become a family, and that family becomes close. 

I walk across the stage in December, receive my degree, and in January she texts me.  ""It's been a year since we've seen each other"" she says. A twinge of guilt tugs at my heart.

I take a breather, working my college job, sending out resumes, and spending most weekends drinking beer with my adopted family. Slowly, subtly, doubt eats away at me.  I finally see a future here, at home.  There's a girl.  I don't think she likes me, but I like her, even if I would never admit it. 

I get a job.  This is it.  The ticket to the future.  Engage the next stage of the life rocket.  Two weeks in, my boss quits.  The division is restructured.  I'm made redundant. 

Setback.  Questioning.  What do I do? I take it hard.  Baseball bat meets tree.  Not my proudest moment.  She's there for me, comforts me, keeps me level. A month later, I get an email. Old contact, new boss.  Wants to know if I'm still interested in working his company.  Of course I am.  

I get on a plane, get to the interview, get the job.  Life is back on track.  New job, new office... and new girl.  I ask someone, the one, out.  She says no. I get drunk. I mention it on reddit.  I'm confronted.  ""Do you still want to be in this relationship?"" she asks.  I lie.

Pain in my stomach.  What do I do. How do I proceed? Things are hard.  I try and focus on work, but I can only think about so much.  We repair things, somewhat.  She wants to see me again.  I agree, to save the relationship.

I talk to my best friend.  The girl likes me, according to his wife.  I don't know what to do.

We plan a trip.  I look into a cover story.  I set up price alerts for plane tickets and look into romantic destinations.  I'm conflicted. I'm guilty.

This month, I need to know.  One Sunday night I ask the girl again.  ""It feels like you like me,"" I say.  We talk. And talk. And talk some more. We decide to give it a go.  Very casual, not serious.  She has commitment issues because her dad left.  I have commitment issues because I can't make my mind up.

This is wrong.  I need to decide. I move.  The girl helps.  I'm distant with her. Sitting at the dinner table over post move beer and pizza, it feels like a family. I know what I need to do.

This weekend she wants to make plans.  Firm plans. Her manager needs to know.  I stall. I delay. She asks again today. When am I coming to see her?  I don't see the text.  An hour later, she asks if I want to see her at all.  I tell the truth.

I broke her heart today."

I finally got an engineering internship, but one of my credit/no credit classes I'm taking for fun is going to interfere schedule wise with my internship. I've already talked with my professor for the class and she said she understands that the internship is more important. I told her that I wouldn't be able to study both this foreign language class and attend to my internship. I tried to drop the class through a late drop paper, but the university won't allow me to drop it. 

So is it okay if I just don't attend class? How will this affect my GPA? I totally don't even need the class I just wanted to take it for fun. Can I just not attend? My professor said she'd be fine with it. I'm a super senior engineering and computer science student. :P"

My head literally went blank and couldn’t think of anything to say. I made a list of questions and I’m trying to answers them now so if I’m asked later I’d know what to say. I’m freaking out now because I’m so afraid of being asked questions I don’t know what to say during the interview.

I asked a couple of friends about a couple of questions that I didn’t know what to say, the fact that all my friends came up with good answers right away definitely didn’t help my whole freaking out thing. Am I the only one?! Please help, anything is appreciated! "
75ef8k,38,2017-10-09,Me [21F] with my dad's girlfriend[50ish F] of 4 years overstepping her boundaries calling me her daughter and posting pictures of me and my sister [16 F],dadsgfoverstepping,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/75ef8k/me_21f_with_my_dads_girlfriend50ish_f_of_4_years/,"Hi reddit, I've lurked on this sub occasionally and I made a throwaway account to get some opinions on a situation. 

So my parents had a contentious divorce when I was in 9th grade. My mom eventually remarried and we moved to the opposite side of the country. Stepdad is amazing no issues there same with his extended family (well my stepsister is a story for another day) The problem is my dad's girlfriend C. He has been dating C for around 4 years. I met her about 3 years ago in between my freshman and sophomore years of college 

I have never liked C very much she comes on way too strong and has made some very off color comments towards me. I am a bit of a people pleaser who hates confrontation so I usually try and avoid letting her know how I really feel. I am working on this aspect of my personality. My dad and I have a rocky relationship and his family and C do not help matters. I feel like our relationship was better before she was in the picture.  My dad and C do live together and I stayed with them this summer while doing an internship. 

Recently I found out the C has posted pictures of me on her public Facebook page along with posts calling me her daughter. My mom was the one who found it and she rightfully got very angry. I am very uncomfortable with this. One, becasue I do not feel very close to her. She's more like an extended relative than a parent, Two I am a very private person who tightly controls my online image. I found out about these posts a few weeks ago and have been avoiding talking to C and my dad until I can figure out what to say to her.

Does anyone have any advice for how to tell her I don't see our relationship that way without being too harsh? I don't like her but I also don't want to purposefully hurt her feelings. And also how to ask her to remove any pictures of me or my sister she may have online? Thanks in advance.

75eomp,4,2017-10-10,"Lonely, Lost, and Hopeless: A Chronicling of The Miserable Life",throwaway12938573723,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/75eomp/lonely_lost_and_hopeless_a_chronicling_of_the/,"Hi all,

I'd like to preface this by saying that what I'm really looking to get out of this post is some good advice and direction--something I am consistently lacking. However, I would ask that you refrain from being condescending; or, if you feel that you must, do not do so without bringing some advice with it. What follows is a short summary of my life, my current situation, and a sprinkling of commentary on how I perceive them to be miserable. Of course, miserable being a relative term, some may compare my situation to some ludicrous straw man like: ""your experiences are nothing compared to those starving kids in Africa."" And while they may have a point, it is not within the realm of the argument I intended to make; and, more importantly, it does not serve the purpose of having a discussion.

Anyways, I grew up in the suburbs of a very well-off area with affluent parents. My brother and I never had to worry about where our next meal would come from, and always had a roof over our heads. My dad was almost never home. He dedicated almost all of his time to work. Though, when he did come home he would immediately start yelling and screaming and my mom, my brother, and I. It's like he would bring all his frustration from work home and take it out on us. He would often tell my mom that she was lazy for quitting her job to take care of us, never does anything right, and was a complete waste of space. Any tiny thing that my brother or I had done wrong would be met with extreme outrage and threats of physical violence, such as ""I'm going to wash your mouth out with soap, or ""if you do that gain, I'm going to take my belt off and lash you in the ass."" He never followed through on any of these things, but the eminent threat was always there. In fact, I have this one really vivid memory as a child. We were going down I-95 and I was bored so I started to bother (teasing, poking, the normal stuff...) my brother. My brother was really vocal as a kid, so he started yelling, ""STOP! STOPP!"" As soon as he did that, my dad pulled the car off to the side, took his belt out from the belt loops of his pants, and coldly said, ""Get out of the car..."" I sat there for a minute scared shitless, until he repeated himself again. At that point, my brother started crying and said, ""Please don't! He didn't mean it!"" My dad just stood there for a few minutes and then got back in the car. The rest of the trip was dead silent. He's recounted the incident on a few occasions, and usually remarks while laughing, ""Remember how scared you were?""

I think it should come as no surprise that my mom was severely depressed being married to a man like this. There were many times she threatened to divorce him, but he would beg and plead with her to stay. She told me later (when I was 18) that she ended up staying being she didn't want us to be without a dad. Even though I love my mom and I know she tried her hardest to be a good parent, she had many shortcomings. Because of her depression, she would often have babysitters take care of my brother and I all day every day of the week. Also, when we were twelve, she suddenly decided she didn't want to cook/go grocery shopping, so my brother an I lived off of junk food from then on (until we knew better).

I was a pretty terrible student in primary school. I think some of this was due to having such a crappy home life, but much of it was just being an obstinate kid. By the time I had gotten to fourth grade, my grades were so terrible that the school (a very prestigious private school) as well as my parents were pushing for me to transfer out. As an aside, in third and fourth grade I was on that awful ADHD medication that all schools were pushing on 'disobedient' kids in the early 2000's. I used to tuck it under my tongue and spit it out in the toilet when I got to school. I used to accidentally swallow it sometimes--those days I ended up feeling like a zombie. Anyways, thank god I'm off that awful stuff.

I ended up transferring to a small catholic school (even though my family isn't religious). Let me tell you, the kids in catholic school are brutal. I was the proverbial ""new kid,"" and even though I spent years with these kids, I never ceased to be socially ostracized. I'd always sit alone at recess and lunch, and throughout most of the day the other kids would just ignore me or take verbal jabs at me, like: ""[insert name here] is such a loser...he as no friends and pretty much sucks at everything."" Teachers would hear these things (I know, because many times they would be standing by while it happened), but would never do or say anything about it. I spent my middle school years sad and alone.

I thought things would get better once I reached high school. My freshman year looked promising: a new school, new people, new teachers. I started out they year finding a great group of friends and doing well in all my classes. However, many of these friends lived about 30 minutes away, and as such all parties/hangouts they had were also that far away. Initially, whenever they were hanging out, they would let me know, but my mom would never drive me. She would always say, ""It's too far"" or ""I don't have time."" The other kids in the group continued to bond, and they eventually stopped inviting me and talking to me all together. I tried looking for clubs that suited my interests where I could find friends, but the high school I went to was sparse in the clubs department, and I didn't really click with any of the people in any of the clubs I tried. I should also add that towards the end of high school, my mom had a stroke. We learned that she has a rare genetic disease that causes her to get strokes periodically. This will become important later. I managed to get good grades and get into a really good college, but I spent most of my high school years alone.

In college I majored in Computer Engineering and minored in Physics. Both disciplines were rough, but engineering was particularly  awful. I remember those nights where I'd be up at 4:00am trying to figure out why some piece of VHDL code was synthesizing smoothly, but totally went to shit when try to write the bitstream to the FPGA and look at the scope traces; or why an interrupt handler in the vector table was clogging up the rest of the programming logic. To say the least, I didn't have much time in college to just chill. I was envious of the other kids I'd see who'd constantly lounge around because of their lack of homework. Also, at this point in my life, I had built up a large amount of social anxiety, so I started to prefer to spend my free time alone. 

Additionally, my mom's condition had worsened over the past few years, and so I spent many breaks taking care of her (my dad refused to) instead of doing valuable internships, although I did manage to squeeze one internship in as well as a co-op. My dad eventually hired someone to take care of her full time, but the person is kind of lazy, and does a half-ass job. I end up picking up a lot of the slack. I really love my mom, and it's been very hard to watch how this disease has affected her. The disease has a progression similar to alzheimer's, in that she has experienced slow mental decline into dementia (right now it's mild, but I know it will get worse). She also has very limited mobility and needs a walker to get around. In fact, she had a really bad fall in early October, and is currently in the hospital. She often gets confused, so my brother and try and spend as much time at the hospital as we can helping her.

Anyways, I just graduated college a few months ago, and have been looking for jobs since. I decided I wanted more a of a career in software (instead of hardware, which is what you learn in computer engineering), and so I've been focusing my job search on that. One of the main courses I am missing, as compared to a computer science major (who would be the usual suspect for this type of job), is a course on algorithms. To make up for this, I've been doing many practice problems on coding websites, reading Cracking the Coding Interview, and self-studying algorithms with MIT's open courseware resources. I've had a few interviews, but nothing has really lead to anything. Many of the people I knew in college secured jobs with prestigious companies before graduation (think Google, Microsoft, Intel, etc) or really neat start-ups. To be honest, I feel really shitty that I'm the odd one out. My job search has felt kind of hopeless, but that's a topic of another discussion.

My solace in all of this has been video games. I've really loved video games since I was a kid, and they have provided me with an escape from reality (I know, this is very cliché, but it's true). I feel like the only thing I REALLY enjoy in life is video games, but at the same time, I feel like wasting my time on video games is detracting from my prospects of a good career. I don't mean to say that I play all day now that I'm a college grad with no job. I just mean to say that in hours I do spend playing, I have this nagging sensation that I should spend the time working on a personal coding project or working on some open-source software--basically that I should be doing something productive.

I am really not sure what to make of my life. I can't recall more than a whole day that I've ever been happy. Day-to-day events constantly have me down, and when I look back at my life to try and gain a prospective on the situation, I just get more depressed. Also, as said before, the only thing I REALLY enjoy is playing video games. That said, I don't know if I have enough passion to pursue a career in software engineering. The field is very competitive, and from what I understand the people in the field are totally committed to it-- it's their passion. I guess what I mean to say is, I am not sure what my true passion is, and I don't really know how to go about finding it. I feel like I need a mentor of some sort to guide me in the right direction. Whether that mentor is an explicit person, or a combination of advice from many individuals doesn't matter to me. But I have access to neither the former nor the latter, since I don't really have any friends or contact with anyone other than my immediate relatives (parents). I guess another question I have is whether I should spend my early twenties trying out different careers, or whether this is a massive waste of time and a major red flag to employers if I do happen to land multiple jobs in other fields just to up and quit--after all, I don't want to kill my employability. To sum everything up, I am just a really lonely, lost, and hopeless 23-year-old who is looking for some advice on life. Thanks all!"

As an aside, in third and fourth grade I was on that awful ADHD medication that all schools were pushing on 'disobedient' kids in the early 2000's. I used to tuck it under my tongue and spit it out in the toilet when I got to school. I used to accidentally swallow it sometimes--those days I ended up feeling like a zombie. Anyways, thank god I'm off that awful stuff.

I ended up transferring to a small catholic school (even though my family isn't religious). Let me tell you, the kids in catholic school are brutal. I was the proverbial ""new kid,"" and even though I spent years with these kids, I never ceased to be socially ostracized. I'd always sit alone at recess and lunch, and throughout most of the day the other kids would just ignore me or take verbal jabs at me, like: ""[insert name here] is such a loser...he as no friends and pretty much sucks at everything."" Teachers would hear these things (I know, because many times they would be standing by while it happened), but would never do or say anything about it. I spent my middle school years sad and alone.

I thought things would get better once I reached high school. My freshman year looked promising: a new school, new people, new teachers. I started out they year finding a great group of friends and doing well in all my classes. However, many of these friends lived about 30 minutes away, and as such all parties/hangouts they had were also that far away. Initially, whenever they were hanging out, they would let me know, but my mom would never drive me. She would always say, ""It's too far"" or ""I don't have time."" The other kids in the group continued to bond, and they eventually stopped inviting me and talking to me all together. I tried looking for clubs that suited my interests where I could find friends, but the high school I went to was sparse in the clubs department, and I didn't really click with any of the people in any of the clubs I tried. I should also add that towards the end of high school, my mom had a stroke. We learned that she has a rare genetic disease that causes her to get strokes periodically. This will become important later. I managed to get good grades and get into a really good college, but I spent most of my high school years alone.

In college I majored in Computer Engineering and minored in Physics. Both disciplines were rough, but engineering was particularly awful. I remember those nights where I'd be up at 4:00am trying to figure out why some piece of VHDL code was synthesizing smoothly, but totally went to shit when try to write the bitstream to the FPGA and look at the scope traces; or why an interrupt handler in the vector table was clogging up the rest of the programming logic. To say the least, I didn't have much time in college to just chill. I was envious of the other kids I'd see who'd constantly lounge around because of their lack of homework. Also, at this point in my life, I had built up a large amount of social anxiety, so I started to prefer to spend my free time alone.

Additionally, my mom's condition had worsened over the past few years, and so I spent many breaks taking care of her (my dad refused to) instead of doing valuable internships, although I did manage to squeeze one internship in as well as a co-op. My dad eventually hired someone to take care of her full time, but the person is kind of lazy, and does a half-ass job. I end up picking up a lot of the slack. I really love my mom, and it's been very hard to watch how this disease has affected her. The disease has a progression similar to alzheimer's, in that she has experienced slow mental decline into dementia (right now it's mild, but I know it will get worse). She also has very limited mobility and needs a walker to get around. In fact, she had a really bad fall in early October, and is currently in the hospital. She often gets confused, so my brother and try and spend as much time at the hospital as we can helping her.

Anyways, I just graduated college a few months ago, and have been looking for jobs since. I decided I wanted more a of a career in software (instead of hardware, which is what you learn in computer engineering), and so I've been focusing my job search on that. One of the main courses I am missing, as compared to a computer science major (who would be the usual suspect for this type of job), is a course on algorithms. To make up for this, I've been doing many practice problems on coding websites, reading Cracking the Coding Interview, and self-studying algorithms with MIT's open courseware resources. I've had a few interviews, but nothing has really lead to anything. Many of the people I knew in college secured jobs with prestigious companies before graduation (think Google, Microsoft, Intel, etc) or really neat start-ups. To be honest, I feel really shitty that I'm the odd one out. My job search has felt kind of hopeless, but that's a topic of another discussion.

My solace in all of this has been video games. I've really loved video games since I was a kid, and they have provided me with an escape from reality (I know, this is very cliché, but it's true). I feel like the only thing I REALLY enjoy in life is video games, but at the same time, I feel like wasting my time on video games is detracting from my prospects of a good career. I don't mean to say that I play all day now that I'm a college grad with no job. I just mean to say that in hours I do spend playing, I have this nagging sensation that I should spend the time working on a personal coding project or working on some open-source software--basically that I should be doing something productive.

I am really not sure what to make of my life. I can't recall more than a whole day that I've ever been happy. Day-to-day events constantly have me down, and when I look back at my life to try and gain a prospective on the situation, I just get more depressed. Also, as said before, the only thing I REALLY enjoy is playing video games. That said, I don't know if I have enough passion to pursue a career in software engineering. The field is very competitive, and from what I understand the people in the field are totally committed to it-- it's their passion. I guess what I mean to say is, I am not sure what my true passion is, and I don't really know how to go about finding it. I feel like I need a mentor of some sort to guide me in the right direction. Whether that mentor is an explicit person, or a combination of advice from many individuals doesn't matter to me. But I have access to neither the former nor the latter, since I don't really have any friends or contact with anyone other than my immediate relatives (parents). I guess another question I have is whether I should spend my early twenties trying out different careers, or whether this is a massive waste of time and a major red flag to employers if I do happen to land multiple jobs in other fields just to up and quit--after all, I don't want to kill my employability. To sum everything up, I am just a really lonely, lost, and hopeless 23-year-old who is looking for some advice on life. Thanks all!"

Amelia dies from the tumor

Owen is free to go to Afganistan (w or w/o Teddy) when his sister dies to raise her son 

Jo and Alex get married and move away to start their own life as Jo has stated the importance of this in the past

Meredith and Riggs dont end up together.  After Mer encourages him to win back Owens sister (cant remember her name). Riggs dissappears after Owens sister dies, to get her son, or she lives and they go to Afganistan together for her son to leave Owen and Teddy together to go wherever else because of Teddys career ? 

Catherine (or Jackson or both?) have to take over the foundation now that Harper Avery is dead, so now Catherine, Richard, Jackson will potentially be headed to the East Coast 

April may or may not head East if she gets back with Jackson or she ties in to the Seattle Fire show, they bring Matthew back in somehow to support her role as a crossover character? She did EMT work in the past and seemed to be alluding to Matthew in last weeks episode? Not that her role would be as an EMT but more credibilty towards tying her into the new show

Arizona and Carina head to New York together because of some career / research opportunity for Carina / be closer to Sophia

Baily - not sure here - maybe has a career crisis with being ""fired""  by Harper Avery? Maybe she will bartend at Joe's? LOL 
Ben switches careers again and becomes a fireman based on last season finale / crossover to new show.

And Meredith? ....If the last unseen Shepard sister appears because of Amelias tumor, she raises MerDers kids because Meredith does indeed get Alzhimers in the end as others have suggested....if I'm remebering right the scene several seasons back , I think Meredith even says she would be ok with Kathleen raising her children in a conversation she was having on a park bench with Christina if anything ever happened to her and Derek 

The poor financial status of the hospital creates another merger scenario to tie up whats left ???

Just having fun speculating."

I recently graduated and will be starting a new position as a staff auditor for the provincial government here in Canada. At the same time I’m starting my first CPA Core 1 module.  

I’m extremely nervous and I really hope to do well and be a great asset to the team. I’m getting a great salary and benefits along with tons of support. 
I’m worried I won’t be able to time manage work &amp; CPA and end up performing poorly on either or both. 

I completed an internship at a big 4 firm, and I had a terrible time. The culture was miserable &amp; uncomfortable, especially around busy season. The ‘friendliness’ was forced, and there was little patience for new hires and their training or overall employee well-being. 
Most people there just wanted to get their CPAs and leave.
I’m strongly hoping auditing for the government would be different, and would hate to be stuck in that situation again in a FT position. 


I guess I don’t know what I’m asking for, just needed to put my thoughts down...
Any advice for a nervous new start?

Still, despite my three CompTiA/Cisco certifications, the As I continually earn in all my classes, my internships, and the fact that I got into this program to begin with, the guys around me still either doubt my knowledge or ignore my suggestions. It's gotten to the point where I've thought about switching to a friendlier major just so I could be around more people like me. Whenever I can, I try to be in groups with women and other coders of color, but lately they've been assigning us to groups. I don't want people to run me away from what I'm passionate about, but it is so difficult trying to remain composed every day when my partners talk down to me like I'm an annoying child that they just _have_ to put up with. 

All of this wouldn't bother me as much as it does if they'd just admit that they have their biases, but the administration, the students, everyone lauds themselves about how progressive and diverse they are. Never mind the people who called my friends and I ""ghetto"" and ""hood rats"" for joining a historically black sorority (that I had to go to another local college to even join), or the people who consistently touch my afro without my permission, or yell WorldStar at me when I finally, calmly ask for more work in the group project.

75i7xn,13,2017-10-10,The Two Greatest Pieces of Advice in My Career in Product Managment,anotherhuman,ProductManagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/75i7xn/the_two_greatest_pieces_of_advice_in_my_career_in/,"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/two-greatest-pieces-advice-my-career-product-managment-andrew-becker

I frequently hear from people who want to break into PM, either through LinkedIn or on r/productmanagement, and I love to help. Somebody gave me a break a while back and I love to give back. Today though I want to address maybe a PM starting out, somebody who got a break and wants to keep that lucky streak going.

I think this is very good advice both because (1) it has helped me to get where I am, a couple rungs up the ladder and (2) every time I relay either of these lessons to a product leader they kind of wisely close their eyes and say ""Yisssss"".

1) The first piece of advice came from Craig Cuddeback who had dropped in to a C-level role at the Cleantech Group when I interned there many years ago. I got the chance to sit down with him for maybe a half hour at the end of the internship, and I told him I wanted to be like him, building startups and great products. He told me:

""Some people are good for the beginning of a startup. Some are good for the middle, or the end. You want to be the guy who can go all the way. Show that you're that guy.""

A lot happens in a startup. New people come in, battles are fought internally and externally, chaos swirls, mistakes are made, alliances are forged, etc. Sticking it out through the bullshit is essential if you want to make an impact. In my limited experience it's probably true, your best ideas will come in the first couple years. However, what comes next is the highest value work, the kind that can only be achieved when you have history, relationships, deep product and market knowledge, mastery of your tools and data.

There is also a lot to be learned just from being along for the ride on the growth curve. No two startups are alike but all companies share certain aspects of their path from infancy to adulthood. Being ""that guy"" who knows how it's going to go, how it's going to feel, even a little bit, is pretty valuable.

2) The second piece of advice came from Naghi Prasad, the guy who gave me my break and one of the most all around genius and great people I have ever had the pleasure to know. As I recall, Naghi was not actually talking to me when he said it, I was just in the room, the first non-founder on the team in our little incubator space in Palo Alto. He was talking with the other founders and he said:

""Everybody plays the season. Everybody comes in to work every day. It's what you do in the off season that distinguishes the great ones. Nights and weekends.""

If you want to be a great PM, you have to love it enough that you want to do it outside of work too. This is not a job like any other-- in fact, there are few like it. We embrace huge amounts of responsibility-- revenue, people, the fate of the company. In exchange we get a super fun job where we get to do different things every day-- a little marketing, a little design, a little engineering, finance, legal, business development, the list goes on.

Ultimately though, it's on a PM to know when they are not getting what they need from all those groups. That means you need to know enough about UI/UX to reject a design, and enough marketing to reject some copy or a strategy, and enough about engineering to question an architecture. When you make any of those tough calls, people are going to question you, they are going to go over your head, they are possibly not going to like you in that moment, unless you've earned their respect already. So you better have a strong opinion and be ready to defend it. You better know what you're talking about, and show them you've got ""chops"". Design chops, technical chops, all the functions.

How can someone develop in all of those areas fast enough to move up in the PM world? By doing projects on the side, by reading, by surrounding yourself with people who know those areas and are willing to teach you. It's not enough to come in and do the job every day-- there are X number of PMs for every Director, so there's less and less room as you go up the ladder, and not everyone is going to go up at the same pace.

Be that guy or girl. Nights and weekends."

This is probably going to be a wall of text and I apologize for that, but I feel all the background information is important. 

Backstory:
I have a BS in Construction Management and I graduated in December of 2015. From May of 2015 through August 2015 I interned with a GC company that was, at the time, my absolute goal job and company to work for. I spent 2 years at school talking to them through career fairs and other outlets on my schooling and other things so I could have every advantage possible getting the internship with them. The internship was required for me to graduate, and it was known that they only offered 2 summer internships each year, and they also recruited from 3 larger well known schools near me. 

My internship was mostly great with some ""meh"" sprinkled in? Good because I did enjoy it, and learned a lot. Bad because I did get stuck doing a lot of the bull shit work that taught me nothing, but hey I was the intern. The part that was meh was that my whole time in the field everyone was negative as hell and threatening to quit. The company lost a LARGE chunk of money before I got there on a project, and was continuing to do so. There was a shift in the structure because of this and there was a lot of conflict between the field side and the office side, some of it was caused by certain individuals as well.  I loved this company and what I did for them, and drama doesnt bother me in a work place, because we dont have to like each other to do our jobs, but 5 months before graduation you can see how this was intimidating to me? The superintendent of the job I was working on even quit the last day of my internship and walked off. It got that bad.

Now they did NOT offer me or the other intern a job at the end of the summer, and this was huge. They had hired every intern that had worked for them for the last 5 years. I expect a lot of this was them losing money on that one project still, and this was when construction and oil were starting to slow down fast. Both of which are huge driving factors for the economy where I live. They did however tell us to reach back out to them later that year closer to graduation and check in. 

I never checked back in with them. I was an idiot thinking back on it. However, I did managed to get multiple interviews with various large construction companies, some that are national, and others that are international. But none of those went anywhere, I had received job offer from some smaller companies I interviewed with, but had given no answers as I was weighing my options. But about a month before I graduated the economy shit itself down here and all of my offers were taken back as companies no longer had the money. 

I have worked 3 jobs since I graduated, and only my current one has anything to do with my degree. I have been here since March of 2017, and as much as I love this company and who I work with, my career path is pretty much dead ended, unless I go into sales and I have no desire to do so and even then that could be years before they offer it to me. I am also making about 25k lower than what I should be, and it's rough. I am married, my wife and I just had our first child and I can't stand making crappy pay in what is essentially a dead end job not doing what I want to do. I have sent out hundreds of resumes. I have done dozens of interviews, making it to the final cut on quite a few of them but not getting the job in the end because there is always someone just a ""little bit"" better than me. I have acquaintances and ""friends"" in the field, but no one is hiring for anything I can do. 

I finally decided I had to change something about my job search. I realized I need to swallow my pride and email the VP of construction of the company I interned with and ask him if he had any jobs for me, or advice, anything. I did interview with the VP for my internship. This is where things get interesting. The VP of construction from my internship is gone, and the new VP is their former head of Pre-construction. Now this is good, because this guy was my direct supervisor for everything during my internship, and I did interview with him too. However, I never really got the impression that this guy liked me. But he did also have the final call on my internship, and I got it, and i did pass to get credit for school, so Idk? This guy is is one of the only men that actually intimidates the shit out of me. And I mean intimidates me on a professional and personal level. I do however respect the shit out of this man and would actually kill for 30min to just talk with him. 

I need to know how to ask this guy for some sort of meeting. If I can get a face to face meeting with him, I feel I have a much better chance at something. Now I basically want to ask him if he has a job I could do, if he has any advice on what I could be doing to better myself, as I am basically almost 2 years out of my field and feel like I'm losing any edge I have to be a competitive candidate. Hell,  I even want to ask him if they have any projects that are working Saturdays if I can just go out there and shadow someone and work. I don't need pay, I'll just take the experience! 

The biggest catch though? I know him well enough that if I ask to meet him for a lunch or to buy him coffee there is a 90% chance he'll kind of just blow it off. He's just not that guy. I need to ask him these questions, but also word the email in way that gets me in a face to face meeting with him. 

Tldr: I want to meet with an old employer about a job/career advice. I have no clue how to word the email and I can't just offer to buy the guy coffee or lunch and ask to catch up. I'll get shutdown quick. Need to word this in a way that gets me a face to face. I'm usually good at this, but I am so stumped right now.

Edit: some grammar. I am on my phone, sorry!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/5onjut/steps_to_prepare_myself_to_be_a_consultant_after/

All the answers and responses I received were positive, and some were indicating that perhaps I should look for being an analyst beforehand, and eventually move into consulting once I've become an expert in a field.

I went back to that page about a hundred times over the next few months, making a schedule of what skills to learn and how to acquire them...

I taught myself through online classes and courses beginner's skills in SQL, how to manage Tableau, got certified in Excel (looks so much better than ""proficient"" on a resume), and started to learn R. While I'm not an expert in any of the skills, knowing my way around the programs helps.

Along with all the coursework I've taken, I was able to develop a decent resume.

Base on my searching from job descriptions so far, most Data Analyst internships require Excel and SQL, some even specifically say ""deep expertise"" or ""proficient."" Some of them also say it would be a plus if the candidate knows R, Python. 

In my case, my college coursework is all about Math, Statistics and Computer Science, so I have not had many experience with Excel. I do know how to do write functions and perform basic tasks in Excel, just not an expert. About SQL, I am taking it next semester. Rather, I am more comfortable with R and Python, as I tried to learn them over the Summer, and I had a good programming background, too. 

With Excel and SQL, I think if I have a few months, I think I can pick them up. But, as the deadline for Summer internship is close, I don't want to miss out and decide to just apply. So I guess my questions are:

1. Should I just list R and Python as my related skills? Or how can I explain that I am not proficient at them now, but I can make sure I will catch up from this point to the internship time?

2. I also read some other posts on Reddit. They said that it is true Excel and SQL are important and used at work, but they are ultimately just the tools. As long as you have good knowledge of Statistics and analytical thinking skill, the companies can help you pick up the tools pretty fast. Is that correct? I personally somehow see that as I learned Python and R pretty fast. Turning knowledge into practice is truly the deal.

3. Seem to rephrase question 2, but do recruiter really expect all the qualifications in the job posting from me? Essentially, I am still a college student, and data analyst position does not require advanced knowledge like data scientist, so it is fair for me that I don't know everything yet. That should be the point of internship, helping fresh people get into the profession, am I right?

Basically, just those skills make me worry. I am doing good in my Statistics and Math classes. I have good programming skill. I usually do free tutor for my friends, and they like me, so I also think my interpersonal skills are okay, too. I really want to get work experience, so the internship is definitely a dream comes true for me.

Please share your thoughts, comments, critique, or encouragement if you can. I value all of that. Thank you so much!

Some stats:

-3.90 GPA

-I am currently doing a coop that was supposed to be an R&amp;D co-op, but after talking to my manager, being a totally awesome guy, let my main project be CS based that basically consist of me writing some VBA to do some data filtering and developing a pretty big GUI using VS with C#. 

-I have only ever taken CS 101, but I am currently taking cs125 and cs173 at a community college and plan to try to get into 225, 233, and 357 (being a non major and not having other cs classes, this is all I see I can take)

-I did research in the CE department where I did a lot of coding with arduino last semester

-I have made two small arduino apps and currently working on making some iOS apps and games on my free time outside of work and classes. 



Some questions I have:

-What's some good advice for me to higher my chances of being accepted into CS?

-Comments on my courses plan for next semester?

-I really want to get involved extracurricularly, what are some good clubs to join. I'm mainly interested in software development and Machine Learning. Is there a way for me to start to get involved in anything this semester being off campus? (My co-op is in ohio)

-Has anyone else transferred into the department thisate that you know of? Are my chances even feasable?

I'm at the point where I know 100% that CS is the right major for me, and will do anything it takes, as it is truly one of the only hobbies of mine that I can just do for hours on end and not get sick of it. Any suggestions help, thanks!! "

EDIT: Thanks for all your responses! Because I'm new to Splunk, this has been very valuable infromation."

Trying to decide between Macassar Monogram or traditional Monogram. I love the silver hardware of the Macassar and the cool masculine vibe and low maintenance of the black leather but the traditional monogram is classic and will go with my other monogram bags. Another issue is finding the Macassar. I would probably cop the higher quality Nina affordable ~$140 Mono if I went with the traditional but it looks like the only TS who have the Macassar are Alice (who has problems with the house shape) and Annie, which would be about $100 more. As I'm a student, I'm on a budget. 

TLDR: 
1) Do any TS or popular sellers for that matter, have the Macassar keepall other than Annie and Alice? What price?
2) Should I get the Monogram or Macassar Keepall?

75lqs8,1,2017-10-10,Where's the Clorox: Chapter 1,EbrietasSonOfEcgtheo,CreativeTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreativeTales/comments/75lqs8/wheres_the_clorox_chapter_1/,"One day, a legion of rebels gathered on the edge of a lake, and one of the captains asked the leader to tell the men a story of encouragement before battle. And he started “One day, a legion of rebels gathered…” and his story began to fold in upon itself infinitely, each iteration going faster and faster until he was telling it 1000 times a second. 10,000 times a second. 1,000,000 times a second! Reality was beginning to warp. The men’s eyes widened in horror as the soldiers closest to the leader were getting sucked toward the leader and crushed. Exploding into higher dimensional memes no one could comprehend, Orangs and vegitals shot out from the leader at near light speed. Eyes began to grow on some of the soldiers faces as their irony levels sky rocketed. Those whose minds and bodies failed to adapt were sucked into the normie void and soon only eight remained. Those eight's heads were completely engulfed in eyes, save for their now growing mouths. Their innards began to dissolve and regurgitated out their mouths, only to resolidify as writhing tendrils. The army they were previously going to fight, came over the hill and saw across the lake 8 heads floating higher and higher up to the a circling green vortex in the sky from which they saw surreal nightmares emerge. The commander at the sight went “nope, nope… no no no” and proceeded back the other way. The bodies of the normi soldiers melted into a swirling slushy in the sky. The floating eye covered entities consumed the liquid flesh, and grew to enormous size. As the army gazed across the lake in utter confusion, the commander continued back down the hill, He remembered this event was depicted in a picture as a prophecy.
 &lt;intermission&gt; Time for a nerdy math joke that only nerdy maths majors will understand! So there was this guy whose job was to take the second derivative of parabolic functions… but he quit his job because it was too flat! He then proceeded to down an entire bottle of clorox. &lt;/intermision&gt;
 The commander got down on his knees and bowed in worship of the surreal meme masters as they ascended to a higher plane of thought “OH GREAT MEME MASTERS, MAY WE BE BLESSED WITH IRONY”, and thusly he was granted an irony level of -1. Now even his irony level was ironic, he was the first and last mortal meme lord of such high rank during this millennia. He will go down into myth and legend as The Buddha. He, the Buddha, arose from the ground, arms raised in gratitude of his new higher dimensional gift from beyond this realm. The portal in the sky closed, and the men stared at where it once was in hope of its return so they to could ascend. But alas, it would not return for another 1,000,000 years, not until the next person utters the sacred text for which no mortal knows. It can only be found by chance, and on this day, some lucky boi struck gold. The Grey Beards back in the city felt the DANK and S U R R E A L shock wave. The normally modest monks would party hard that night in celebration, listening to more ironic music from the future called DUBSTEP.
The Grey Beards found this living myth, the man with a negative irony, and brought him to their monastery. There they trained him in the ways of the DANK in the hopes he may one day save us from the cult of the normie. His irony however was too great, and much to their disappointment, no one could translate his higher dimensional tongue. They had given him a scroll to write on in hopes they could one day translate it, this is what he wrote. ”Я дрейфую через неизвестное как более высокое размерное существо, и где находится ANGERY” the monks of the silver facial hair could not decipher this strange language no matter how hard they tried, but they soon discovered that these strange writings held great power, for you see, he was able to hear the eight great meme lords, and he wrote their strange utterings in the only language that could depict such dankness. And to this day, travelers still go to to the lake where the DANK portal had opened to feast on the liquefied flesh of those who were left behind in hopes that they may rise a level or two. The water too is considered sacred, and many people from the village would go there to bath. This idea of bathing in a natural body of water is the first ever record of what we would consider Beach Going.
And next to that lake, there is a temple.he who hears the dank ones resides in this temple. He spends his days scrawling the DANK utterings onto sacred parchment given to him by the Grey Beards. His body was failing because his S U R R E A L level was too high for his current plane of existence. And so he died, leaving behind hundreds of indecipherable symbols, each with a power beyond human comprehension. Deeming these symbols too DANK for humanity to possess, the Grey Beards sealed the lakeside temple.
But now, 10,000 years later, after the Greybeards have long since been forgotten, the temple was rediscovered by mankind. The Buddha before he died was discovered to have learned some of our normi language and described one if his symbols to us; he said “It is the way of the future” followed by ☭. This confused many, as the USSR had long since collapsed. Until one day, one of the workers tasked with uncovering the tomb had an epiphany; WE MUST BRING BACK COMMUNISM! 
His name was Bernie Sanders. While he was exploring the tomb, he came running out of the cave with nothing on and fell to his knees. He then stared straight at the sun without blinking and screamed continuously for 10 minutes without pause. After his eyes had melted out of their sockets, he screamed “I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT! I CAN SEE THEIR DANK MEMES! OH DANK ONES, ALLOW ME COMPREHENSION OF YOUR DANKNESS!” But the Dank ones would not allow it. His feeble normie mind could not comprehend their S U R R E A L memes. And so he was cursed to view these memes, without the ability to comprehend them.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to get clown costumes for the village peasents &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

His highest irony level he was able to achieve thus far in his life was 5, and even then it wasn't very convincing. Sadness and ANGERY enveloped him, and he continued screaming for another 20 minutes or so. His archaeologist colleagues this whole time were utterly confused as they witnessed this well known political figure convert to communism, run out of a cave naked, and scream at the sun, all in the space of an hour. The archeologists dragged the screaming naked, wrinkly old man across the ground to the medical tent at the excavation site, where they bandaged his eyeless sockets, and gave him a cup of coco. The boss came, putting a caring hand on bernie’s shoulder “now bernie, why don’t you tell me what happened?”. They could tell Bernie was trying to cry by the sounds he made but no tears came. He gathered himself and said in a wavering tone, “I have seen true dankness [sniffles], boi, I saw Richard Simmons”. Everyone gasped, Richard Simmons was the DANKEST meme lord to ever live, in his prime back in 1980 he was a worldwide sensation during the era they call, “The Fitness Revolution”. But that movement died off, after all it is the year 8192. 
The spirit of Richard Simmons was now trying to communicate through Bernie, that the world was in grave danger. But from what, they didn't know, because Bernie lacked the irony level necessary to understand beings from the upper plane. Thus the archeologists determined they needed to raise Sander’s irony, and luckily they knew of an ancient ruin where they could do exactly that. &lt;intermission&gt; We interrupt your regularly scheduled surreal program to bring you a word from our sponsors: Have you ever needed to get high on irony? Do you ever feel like your irony level is dropping? Are you only a 3 dimensional creature? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, then you need Clorox®. To use, simply take a pleasant swig of Clorox’s flavored, natural concoction, and feel the lasting effects immediately. Clorox: Stimulate your senses &lt;/intermission&gt;
The archeologists used the Dustymobile to speed old Bernie to the ruins of the Biggest Clorox factory ever built. This great facility was known as Clerot hall. Here they would have to delve into the depths of dankness to obtain the very last bottle of Clorox in existence.
	There they stood, at the foot of this monument of memetry, they bowed their heads in respect for the great meme lords of the past, now long since fallen. Remembering all those who had tried to drink of the nectar but alas, we're not S U R R E A L enough to endure its intense high. This being the last clorox factory it was seen as a national park of sorts to the remaining DANKSTERS. After Oxiclean took over Clorox, they declared this factory off limits to the public. Oxiclean destroyed all but one of the Clorox factories to remember what they had conqord. If they were to embark on this adventure, there’d be no going back. Once they step foot into that cavernous warehouse, they’d be fugitives.
	Bernie and the archeologist took that first step into the sacred tomb, and descended the first great staircase on their journey to the center of the maze like factory. The Archeologists guided Bernie, as he was blind but for his visions of the DANK ones memes. The DANKNESS transcended the limits of language and bestowed Bernie with an ineffable, unfathomable truth of: VEGITAL BADDDDDD!!!! Though they didn’t know it at the time, this was a prophesy of the hardships they'd face within the factory.
At the bottom of the staircase laid their first challenge, a vast open room, completely dark except for what little light fell from the top of the stairs. They'd have to traverse true darkness if they were to reach their goal, but they couldn't have known at the time, that vegetal hid within the shadows of that great void. They heard it scuttle along the hard floor somewhere far ahead of them but could not see it. It reverberated through the large chamber and it sounded as if the VEGITAL was everywhere at once. They cringed at the feeling of the cold air on their skin as they proceeded into the darkness with the VEGITAL.
Bernies eye sockets stung intensely in the presence of this creature of dankitude, and the archeologist had to drag the nude and screaming old man across the cold cement floor. This screaming is what attracted the vegital to their location. They found that whistling the tune of Thomas the Dank Engine worked the best in silencing him. But it was too late. Vegetal appeared out of the darkness, and grabs Bernie with his mouth, and began trying to drag him into the shadows. The archeologists tried to pull Sanders from the creature's grasp, but the very laws of physics were warped within its presence, and force didn't work the same. Then one of the archeologists used this to his advantage, and broke Bernie’s legs off at the knees, freeing him from the monster’s jaw. The biggest of the archeologists put Sanders on his back like chewbaca did with C-3PO that one time, and they ran to what they could only hope would be an escape. They heard vicious hissing behind them as the vile creature tried to gain on them, when all of a sudden, one of the archeologist interns tripped and fell to the floor. The rest of the gang took advantage and used him as a distraction to buy them a little more time. 
&lt;obituary&gt; To the family of the intern: he was… good…. i guess. I mean he turned in his work on time… honestly was the most average intern we ever had &lt;/obituary&gt;
The vegetal consumed the one known as Greg while the rest ran away in fear. After that, vegetal seemed sated for the time being, and they were able to make it out of the void safely. They enter the next room, a single light source hangs by a thin wire dimly illuminating the room. Cracks fill the ceiling letting small amounts of sunlight protrude the room, while other cracks slowly drip drops of Clorox onto the floor, forming small puddles across the floor, and slowly flowing towards the single drain In the room. In front of the archeologists are 13 pedestals of stone, on each sits a bottle, or a container of some sort, each one different from the last. A floating teapot is in the center of the room, the guardian and messenger of not only Richard Simmons, but the omniscient SURREAL being above and beyond Simmons. Meme Man. The teapot speaks “These are the remaining Clorox products, drink from the original, and you will be granted ultimate SURREAL levels and unfathomable DANKNESS. Choose wrongly, and suffer the agonizing death of drinking bleach, followed by facing the eternal wrath of the King of the underworld, 4chan”.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to take Richard Simmons to soccer practice &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

The archeologists looked to Bernie, as he rose to his stubs, and reached for a bottle he was not tall enough to grasp “it is this one! I can sense the dankness contained within.” An archeologist was about to hand it to Sanders when another stopped him “wait, if that's the wrong one, then our only hope for saving humanity is lost with Bernie... one of us must drink it…” he said, looking at the other three archeologists making up their team of five. With a shaking hand, the smallest of the group reached for the bottle “I volunteer as tribute!” The others gladly allowed him to take the first swig, and were verified in their fear when the frail archeologist began melting before their very eyes. The ground began to quiver and the ground under the drinkers feet started glowing green in a clover leaf pattern. The emblem on the ground opened, revealing a portal from which trashy normi pepe memes shot out. The cancer it wielded was so great that it changed from a figure of speech to actual pepe's with rapidly growing cancer in their eyes. The half melted man let out a blood curdling scream that tore through the air just be for the ground swallowed him whole. The ground then sealed shut just as fast as it had appeared, thus sealing his fate to the Nazi ridden normis of the deep. But wait, the teapot speaks! “You choose… Wrong...” the archeologists stared at Bernie, their faith in him now thoroughly shaken. “Uh-uh-oopsies, which bottle did I point to? Sorry I can't see anything without eyes, I think I meant this bottle over here” the others looked at him skeptically, but had no choice but to trust him, after all, humanity's fate was in this naked legless mans hands. It wasn't until after this horrific ordeal that they realized he pointed to an Oxiclean mix, it literally said it right on the container. They went to the bottle he was pointing to, it was Tide Detergent… Without telling him, they instead went to.a different one, the only bottle that actually had a Clorox logo. They said “Oh, you mean this one?” Bernie , pointing in a totally different direction shouted at the wall “Oh Yes! That's the one!”
Much more confident in his chances, the next archeologist took a swig from this bottle. His eyes began to grow, his jaw unhinged like a snake, and from deep inside of him, a blood soaked human fetus crawled out his mouth. The archaeologist's body fell to the ground with a thud, his eyes continuing to grow past the size of soccer balls, and the fetus raised its slimy head, and stared with unseeing eyes at Bernie “I C A N S E E T H E S U R R E A L! T H I S I S T H E B O T T L E!” The others stared with wide eyes as they realized this fetus was actually a reincarnation of their friend (George). The bottle was passed over to Bernie with careful handling. He took the container and… he dropped it, Bernie actually dropped it, what an idiot. The Clorox formed a pool on the old grimy concrete floor and mixed with some of the dirt and dust, making a brown tinted mixture. The others looked at him angrily “Lick it up.” one said bluntly.Bernie promptly started licking the wrong part of the floor, consuming a large amount of god knows what before the others were able to stop giggling and guide him to the puddle.
With each lick, Sanders’s tongue grew longer and longer, and soon other tongues started snaking out from the old man’s mouth, which all also started licking up the contaminated dankness fluid. Then, on the end of each of Bernie’s now numerous tongues, an eyeball sprouted “I CAN SEE!” Bernie shouted, tongues sticking out, as he gazed around the room with his free roaming sensory organs. He leans forward on his extended arms and arched his back, then with all his might he let out an even louder shriek, a call to his higher dimensional companions. The fetus George soon joined in Bernie's call, and together they summoned the great Richard Simmons. He appeared in a flash of holy light, floating a few feet off the ground “congratulation my children, you have done well to make it this far” he put a hand on Bernie’s shoulder “I have come to tell you, Bernie, that the world needs your guidance. They need you to bring back communism…” Bernie stared with all five of his prehensile sensory organs “I - I'll do it Mr Simmons, I'll bring back communism” he said with awe and stuck out tongues. “I know you will son… I know you will…” and with that, the Great Richard simmons vanished back into the DANKNESS.

They had given him a scroll to write on in hopes they could one day translate it, this is what he wrote. ”Я дрейфую через неизвестное как более высокое размерное существо, и где находится ANGERY” the monks of the silver facial hair could not decipher this strange language no matter how hard they tried, but they soon discovered that these strange writings held great power, for you see, he was able to hear the eight great meme lords, and he wrote their strange utterings in the only language that could depict such dankness. And to this day, travelers still go to to the lake where the DANK portal had opened to feast on the liquefied flesh of those who were left behind in hopes that they may rise a level or two. The water too is considered sacred, and many people from the village would go there to bath. This idea of bathing in a natural body of water is the first ever record of what we would consider Beach Going.
And next to that lake, there is a temple.he who hears the dank ones resides in this temple. He spends his days scrawling the DANK utterings onto sacred parchment given to him by the Grey Beards. His body was failing because his S U R R E A L level was too high for his current plane of existence. And so he died, leaving behind hundreds of indecipherable symbols, each with a power beyond human comprehension. Deeming these symbols too DANK for humanity to possess, the Grey Beards sealed the lakeside temple.
But now, 10,000 years later, after the Greybeards have long since been forgotten, the temple was rediscovered by mankind. The Buddha before he died was discovered to have learned some of our normi language and described one if his symbols to us; he said “It is the way of the future” followed by ☭. This confused many, as the USSR had long since collapsed. Until one day, one of the workers tasked with uncovering the tomb had an epiphany; WE MUST BRING BACK COMMUNISM! 
His name was Bernie Sanders. While he was exploring the tomb, he came running out of the cave with nothing on and fell to his knees. He then stared straight at the sun without blinking and screamed continuously for 10 minutes without pause. After his eyes had melted out of their sockets, he screamed “I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT! I CAN SEE THEIR DANK MEMES! OH DANK ONES, ALLOW ME COMPREHENSION OF YOUR DANKNESS!” But the Dank ones would not allow it. His feeble normie mind could not comprehend their S U R R E A L memes. And so he was cursed to view these memes, without the ability to comprehend them.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to get clown costumes for the village peasents &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

His highest irony level he was able to achieve thus far in his life was 5, and even then it wasn't very convincing. Sadness and ANGERY enveloped him, and he continued screaming for another 20 minutes or so. His archaeologist colleagues this whole time were utterly confused as they witnessed this well known political figure convert to communism, run out of a cave naked, and scream at the sun, all in the space of an hour. The archeologists dragged the screaming naked, wrinkly old man across the ground to the medical tent at the excavation site, where they bandaged his eyeless sockets, and gave him a cup of coco. The boss came, putting a caring hand on bernie’s shoulder “now bernie, why don’t you tell me what happened?”. They could tell Bernie was trying to cry by the sounds he made but no tears came. He gathered himself and said in a wavering tone, “I have seen true dankness [sniffles], boi, I saw Richard Simmons”. Everyone gasped, Richard Simmons was the DANKEST meme lord to ever live, in his prime back in 1980 he was a worldwide sensation during the era they call, “The Fitness Revolution”. But that movement died off, after all it is the year 8192. 
The spirit of Richard Simmons was now trying to communicate through Bernie, that the world was in grave danger. But from what, they didn't know, because Bernie lacked the irony level necessary to understand beings from the upper plane. Thus the archeologists determined they needed to raise Sander’s irony, and luckily they knew of an ancient ruin where they could do exactly that.

&lt;intermission&gt; We interrupt your regularly scheduled surreal program to bring you a word from our sponsors: Have you ever needed to get high on irony? Do you ever feel like your irony level is dropping? Are you only a 3 dimensional creature? If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, then you need Clorox®. To use, simply take a pleasant swig of Clorox’s flavored, natural concoction, and feel the lasting effects immediately. Clorox: Stimulate your senses &lt;/intermission&gt;

The archeologists used the Dustymobile to speed old Bernie to the ruins of the Biggest Clorox factory ever built. This great facility was known as Clerot hall. Here they would have to delve into the depths of dankness to obtain the very last bottle of Clorox in existence.
	There they stood, at the foot of this monument of memetry, they bowed their heads in respect for the great meme lords of the past, now long since fallen. Remembering all those who had tried to drink of the nectar but alas, we're not S U R R E A L enough to endure its intense high. This being the last clorox factory it was seen as a national park of sorts to the remaining DANKSTERS. After Oxiclean took over Clorox, they declared this factory off limits to the public. Oxiclean destroyed all but one of the Clorox factories to remember what they had conqord. If they were to embark on this adventure, there’d be no going back. Once they step foot into that cavernous warehouse, they’d be fugitives.
Bernie and the archeologist took that first step into the sacred tomb, and descended the first great staircase on their journey to the center of the maze like factory. The Archeologists guided Bernie, as he was blind but for his visions of the DANK ones memes. The DANKNESS transcended the limits of language and bestowed Bernie with an ineffable, unfathomable truth of: VEGITAL BADDDDDD!!!! Though they didn’t know it at the time, this was a prophesy of the hardships they'd face within the factory.
At the bottom of the staircase laid their first challenge, a vast open room, completely dark except for what little light fell from the top of the stairs. They'd have to traverse true darkness if they were to reach their goal, but they couldn't have known at the time, that vegetal hid within the shadows of that great void. They heard it scuttle along the hard floor somewhere far ahead of them but could not see it. It reverberated through the large chamber and it sounded as if the VEGITAL was everywhere at once. They cringed at the feeling of the cold air on their skin as they proceeded into the darkness with the VEGITAL.
Bernies eye sockets stung intensely in the presence of this creature of dankitude, and the archeologist had to drag the nude and screaming old man across the cold cement floor. This screaming is what attracted the vegital to their location. They found that whistling the tune of Thomas the Dank Engine worked the best in silencing him. But it was too late. Vegetal appeared out of the darkness, and grabs Bernie with his mouth, and began trying to drag him into the shadows. The archeologists tried to pull Sanders from the creature's grasp, but the very laws of physics were warped within its presence, and force didn't work the same. Then one of the archeologists used this to his advantage, and broke Bernie’s legs off at the knees, freeing him from the monster’s jaw. The biggest of the archeologists put Sanders on his back like chewbaca did with C-3PO that one time, and they ran to what they could only hope would be an escape. They heard vicious hissing behind them as the vile creature tried to gain on them, when all of a sudden, one of the archeologist interns tripped and fell to the floor. The rest of the gang took advantage and used him as a distraction to buy them a little more time. 
&lt;obituary&gt; To the family of the intern: he was… good…. i guess. I mean he turned in his work on time… honestly was the most average intern we ever had &lt;/obituary&gt;
The vegetal consumed the one known as Greg while the rest ran away in fear. After that, vegetal seemed sated for the time being, and they were able to make it out of the void safely. They enter the next room, a single light source hangs by a thin wire dimly illuminating the room. Cracks fill the ceiling letting small amounts of sunlight protrude the room, while other cracks slowly drip drops of Clorox onto the floor, forming small puddles across the floor, and slowly flowing towards the single drain In the room. In front of the archeologists are 13 pedestals of stone, on each sits a bottle, or a container of some sort, each one different from the last. A floating teapot is in the center of the room, the guardian and messenger of not only Richard Simmons, but the omniscient SURREAL being above and beyond Simmons. Meme Man. The teapot speaks “These are the remaining Clorox products, drink from the original, and you will be granted ultimate SURREAL levels and unfathomable DANKNESS. Choose wrongly, and suffer the agonizing death of drinking bleach, followed by facing the eternal wrath of the King of the underworld, 4chan”.

&lt;Director's note&gt; remember to take Richard Simmons to soccer practice &lt;/Director’s note&gt;

The archeologists looked to Bernie, as he rose to his stubs, and reached for a bottle he was not tall enough to grasp “it is this one! I can sense the dankness contained within.” An archeologist was about to hand it to Sanders when another stopped him “wait, if that's the wrong one, then our only hope for saving humanity is lost with Bernie... one of us must drink it…” he said, looking at the other three archeologists making up their team of five. With a shaking hand, the smallest of the group reached for the bottle “I volunteer as tribute!” The others gladly allowed him to take the first swig, and were verified in their fear when the frail archeologist began melting before their very eyes. The ground began to quiver and the ground under the drinkers feet started glowing green in a clover leaf pattern. The emblem on the ground opened, revealing a portal from which trashy normi pepe memes shot out. The cancer it wielded was so great that it changed from a figure of speech to actual pepe's with rapidly growing cancer in their eyes. The half melted man let out a blood curdling scream that tore through the air just be for the ground swallowed him whole. The ground then sealed shut just as fast as it had appeared, thus sealing his fate to the Nazi ridden normis of the deep. But wait, the teapot speaks! “You choose… Wrong...” the archeologists stared at Bernie, their faith in him now thoroughly shaken. “Uh-uh-oopsies, which bottle did I point to? Sorry I can't see anything without eyes, I think I meant this bottle over here” the others looked at him skeptically, but had no choice but to trust him, after all, humanity's fate was in this naked legless mans hands. It wasn't until after this horrific ordeal that they realized he pointed to an Oxiclean mix, it literally said it right on the container. They went to the bottle he was pointing to, it was Tide Detergent… Without telling him, they instead went to.a different one, the only bottle that actually had a Clorox logo. They said “Oh, you mean this one?” Bernie , pointing in a totally different direction shouted at the wall “Oh Yes! That's the one!”
Much more confident in his chances, the next archeologist took a swig from this bottle. His eyes began to grow, his jaw unhinged like a snake, and from deep inside of him, a blood soaked human fetus crawled out his mouth. The archaeologist's body fell to the ground with a thud, his eyes continuing to grow past the size of soccer balls, and the fetus raised its slimy head, and stared with unseeing eyes at Bernie “I C A N S E E T H E S U R R E A L! T H I S I S T H E B O T T L E!” The others stared with wide eyes as they realized this fetus was actually a reincarnation of their friend (George). The bottle was passed over to Bernie with careful handling. He took the container and… he dropped it, Bernie actually dropped it, what an idiot. The Clorox formed a pool on the old grimy concrete floor and mixed with some of the dirt and dust, making a brown tinted mixture. The others looked at him angrily “Lick it up.” one said bluntly.Bernie promptly started licking the wrong part of the floor, consuming a large amount of god knows what before the others were able to stop giggling and guide him to the puddle.
With each lick, Sanders’s tongue grew longer and longer, and soon other tongues started snaking out from the old man’s mouth, which all also started licking up the contaminated dankness fluid. Then, on the end of each of Bernie’s now numerous tongues, an eyeball sprouted “I CAN SEE!” Bernie shouted, tongues sticking out, as he gazed around the room with his free roaming sensory organs. He leans forward on his extended arms and arched his back, then with all his might he let out an even louder shriek, a call to his higher dimensional companions. The fetus George soon joined in Bernie's call, and together they summoned the great Richard Simmons. He appeared in a flash of holy light, floating a few feet off the ground “congratulation my children, you have done well to make it this far” he put a hand on Bernie’s shoulder “I have come to tell you, Bernie, that the world needs your guidance. They need you to bring back communism…” Bernie stared with all five of his prehensile sensory organs “I - I'll do it Mr Simmons, I'll bring back communism” he said with awe and stuck out tongues. “I know you will son… I know you will…” and with that, the Great Richard simmons vanished back into the DANKNESS.

I'm a junior in college right now and haven't been laid once since I've been here. NOT ONCE. This is quite possibly the BEST place to pick up chicks and I've failed even in this situation.

I am completely and utterly discouraged. What am I doing wrong? I'm not a bad looking guy, been going to the gym , I'm smart, I'm funny, average confidence, etc. I also have a social life and am in some clubs.

My point is I shouldn't be failing this badly. It's not like I haven't tried either. I approach women in classes, fitness classes, clubs etc. I have seen **MUCH UGLIER** and fatter and shorter dudes with hot girls, and I am not aiming for sorority blondes. I am aiming for average girls of all races whom I am attracted to, yet it is not working.

At this point I feel like I'm never going to get laid. I feel like a huge loser. This is affecting my friendships and is lowering my grades. I feel that if I am not the most social/romantic guy, then I should have AT LEAST good grades or internships or jobs, yet I don't even have those. My GPA is so low I got turned down from some fraternities and they told me to come back once I got it up. I have failed numerous classes.

*A month or so ago*

Dr. Steven Petty, genius, manager of the Robotics and Machine-Learning branch of Oscorp, was up late again with his pet project. He was dead tired, but he had to get this done tonight;. It had taken months after the Doc Ock incident last...June? It was a long time ago. Anyways, it had taken a long time to convince the board to fund a second Living Brain, after the first one was blown up by Ock. The Brain was a large and expensive, and, if Petty was being honest with himself, mostly useless project. A waste of time and money. But this was a part of its charm, Petty thought as he screwed in a large green plate over the robot’s back. It had this old-world sci-fi kind of appeal to it. Not to mention that as long as he worked on this, he wouldn’t have to work on real work. There is an American phrase that he is very fond of, “fake it ‘til you make it.” The problem was, Petty was exceptional at faking it, making it, on the other hand… He got through university mostly by cheating off of his smarter classmates, he got his job at Oscorp by throwing around some buzzwords like ‘cost-effective’ and ‘innovation’ at the interview. He thought that when you faked your way to the top, he would suddenly *know* what it is what he was doing. But here he was, at a position as high as he was likely ever going to get, and he was fiddling around with a robot, the hardware of which was based on thirty year old design and the code of which was a bastardization of Smythe’s work and the many hours of grad student interns that worked under him. The Brain’s utility is limited and not even revolutionary, and it’s still powered by a nuclear core. Even he knew that a nuclear core was a *terrible* idea, but he didn’t know what else to use, and couldn’t bother to do the research. He was a big executive after all, he didn’t have the time. And, you know, TV is getting really good around this time of year. 

Petty wasn’t normally a sentimental man, he didn’t have much to do with his family, nor did he even attempt to make a family of his own. Except. Except when he looked at the Living Brain, he felt something stir within him. He was like a reflection of Petty’s own self: strange, kinda useless, but it looks impressive. In a way, the Brain was his family, a son that he never had. Or whatever. 

Petty placed another green plate into place, this time he decided to cover the nuclear core in the Brain’s head *first*. That was really the only thing that was changed from the first model to this one. He could’ve used this opportunity to improve the model, but he had a bunch of TV shows to catch up on.  Whistling, he placed another bolt into the precut hole in the carbon alloy plating which had to be made with a laser.  The lights above flickered and shut off, plunging Petty in darkness. For one brief moment, he thought it was Doctor Octopus, back for revenge. He had heard on the TV that not only was he alive, but he was loose in New York. Before he could make a sound, the lights came back on, but dimmed and left large black shadows in the corners of the lab. He was the only one who was supposed to be here, but that didn’t stop people in the past. Footsteps echoed, coming from no one particular direction. By now Petty knew who it was,  it could only be one man. The boogeyman of Oscorp, the last person those who were to high up to simply be fired saw before their permanent retirement.No one knew anything about him, who he was, where he came from, if he even *works* for Oscorp. No one even knew his name--

“Petty.” The voice came from one of the pitch black corners of the room. The man took a few steps forward, Petty could now see a man wearing a long, black overcoat and a large, brown cowboy hat. Between the coat and the hat, there was not much to look at, his face all but obscured since he held his hat at an angle. The coat covered all but his shoes and his hands, which were wearing white latex gloves, like he was about to perform surgery. They called him, the Finisher, and you only ever got to see him once.

Petty jumped backwards and accidentally knocked the Brain over. He was now wide awake. Petty had no illusions as to what was going to happen, but he had a deep-rooted sense of self-preservation, otherwise known as a crippling fear of death, and he was determined not to die by this specter. He had started keeping a small handgun with him wherever he goes since the Doc Ock incident. And, although he wasn’t entirely sure how to fire the damn thing, he was going to show this…tall, terrifying, thing…

The Finisher fished into his jacket and pulled out a copy of the [Daily Bugle](https://redd.it/727dox), the one from after the helicarrier crashed. “Doc Ock is still out there.” He said. Petty was confused, why was he telling him what he already knew?

“Uh-huh” he said lamely. 

“Are you aware that before the incident with Dr.Octavius, he accessed the Oscorp mainframe.”

“Uh, sure, it’s how he messed around with the locks and the, uh, sentry guns.” 

“Do you not understand what this means.” The Finisher spouted back what Norman told him earlier today. It was hard to pretend that Petty should be following him when he too had no idea what the implications were when he was called into Mr. Osborn’s office. And he was one of the few who knew Petty’s secret. How he was really just...an ordinary guy? But, that was none of his business. “There are things on that mainframe that Mr. Osborn  would prefer no one would know about, if you get my meaning,” he leaned on his hip, where a large caliber gun was barely concealed by his overcoat.

“Oh, ok...but, and I don’t mean to be rude, but why is this my problem?”

“It’s your problem because I’m making it your problem. Take care of ‘Doc Ock’ or your employment here will be… terminated.” 

The Finisher started to walk back into the shadows, when Petty spoke out again, “Hey, um not to be rude or anything but why don’t, um, you do it?” 

“He’s your employee, and besides, I’m busy. And, you know, TV is getting really good around this time of year.” 

“Wait! I can’t beat him! He’s… a freak. He took down….hello?”

There was no reply, he was gone.

*Now*

Doc Ock was lost. For so long, he was preoccupied with revenge and with freedom. But now, he had achieved both, in some form. There was still a few people on his list, but it was too...hot right now to pursue. It was not cowardice that kept him back, but strategy. That left the question of what to do now. What can he do now when all he had done for so long was now undoable. 

Luckily, Otto Octavius was not a lesser man, squabbling about seeking for some kind of ‘purpose’. For Otto, there was only one thing that called out to him, one thing that challenged his mighty wits. And her name was Science. His Marconis Particle was a success, so he was now free to pursue another scientific idea. But before that, he needed his *equipment*.  

It was late, and no one was in the office. It had been four months, or so, since he had last been in Oscorp. Four months? Is that it? Maybe more. He didn’t bother disabling the cameras since they would immediately know who had snuck in when they saw his things were taken. He did, however, wear a large overcoat over his metal arms. Over the course of the last month, he had kept an eye on the police and SHIELD’s so-called ‘progress’, they knew very-little about how his arms work, their weaknesses. Not that they had any, he designed them himself. But with the cameras flashing, he felt no need to provide them with pictures of the arms in action. 

A few minutes later, he arrived at his lab. The large glass door was fogged over, and Ock ran his sleeve over it, revealing his name printed on it, **Dr. Spencer Smythe**. Wait, SMYTHE! He clenched four fists inside of his coat. But he calmed himself, as long as Smythe didn’t erase his data, then he wouldn’t bother addressing this insult. It made sense, without his talent, of course they would need to fill his post with a lesser man. He wiped down the rest of the door and peered in. Towards the bottom of the door was  bright yellow tape that read UNDER CONSTRUCTION. This did not bode well. He tried the door, which was of course locked. Cursing he opened a button on his overcoat and slipped an arm out and slammed it into the door. He covered the action with the bulk of his body. The door fractured and large chunks of glass fell to the floor. Otto stepped in to what was once his office. 

Charred black walls bounded a ruined laboratory, where there was little to nothing but ash left. His beakers and test-tubes were cracked and blackened, his perfectly-level work table was split down the middle. Otto was speechless, he walked the perimeter of the lab. He ran a finger across one of the metal frame that held some of his things, some of the charred ash came off onto his fingers. He rubbed the soot between his fingers, and smelled it. Behind it, on the wall was a shadow shaped in the form of a spectrometer. Turning around, he saw a spot on the floor that was clear with a spiked impact char-point where the explosion originated. 

He furrowed his brow, trying to remember his last time here. When he was knocked unconscious by the Brain in order to have his surgery, he woke up in the SHIELD cell. He didn’t know what happened next. Carlie Cooper, the police officer he took care of last month, told him that he killed her partner, but he prepared many deadly countermeasures to possible police interruptions. However, it must have turned out successfully  or he wouldn’t have control of his arms.  That left one alternative to what really happened. 

Forgetting his previous reasons for concern, he ripped through his overcoat and lashed out in rage. Grabbing the metal frame from off the wall (which was also bolted to the floor) and threw it against the opposite wall. He emitted a high pitched, “FOOLS”, and punched the wall, leaving a crater in it. 

The Oscorp goonies were apparently so scared of him and his research that they deleted it. Thoroughly. All of his work, all of his equipment. He was back to square one, like he was all those years ago. 

Otto stormed out of the building, throwing all caution to the wind and smashing random things as he made his way out. He was *so* ready to move on, to continue on his mission to further mankind’s understanding of the nature of the universe, but once again mankind acted outside of their own best interest. They destroyed his work and that was something he couldn’t just let go.  NYPD be damned, SHIELD be damned, he was going all out on them, and anyone that got in his way would be annihilated. He thought that science was his true passion, but in the  heat of the moment  he knew a new mistress. Vengeance be her name. The die is cast!

Next: The Secret Origin of Otto Octavius.

Editor’s Note: The last seven months of writing Doc Ock has been a huge thrill for me. Doc Ock is my favorite of a long list of narcissistic mad scientists, both real and Marvel. I have some pretty big stuff planned, so tune in to Volume TWO.

75plaf,4,2017-10-11,Any accountant here ?,multired,belgium,https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/75plaf/any_accountant_here/,"Hi,

I'm a student in last year accounting. I am in the process of finding an internship. I recently had an interview for internal accounting. It went well but there's something else : it seems like there's a huge workload on the accountants.

1. The interviewer was complaining about it.
2. The company is looking for several interns.
3. When I asked why he worked there, he told me it was near where he lived (wtf?). 4. There will be an audit in which I would get involved. 

So my question is : Will this internship serve them to reduce their workload ? Are there people here that have experience with this and what is expected for an intern ?

We as a community need to see how to grow this developer community so that the contribution comes with more hands/brains. 
My suggestion would be to advertise on this aspect so that we can get more student/academia can contribute to this project. If academia starts contributing to the project then we will be more inline with any groundbreaking research happening in the cryptospace. We could also offer internship projects.
Secondly we need to evaluate the expertise across various aspects in our dev community. It  may be security, encryption, mobile app development, web designer, marketing, etc. If we identify this, the gaps can be filled. 

Supporting the dev team with funds  is very important and we are headed in the right direction after seeing the contributions pouring in. 

Thoughts?

75s1tu,8,2017-10-11,Any body here work in the non-profit/social impact field here?,maybewerelost,AskLosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/75s1tu/any_body_here_work_in_the_nonprofitsocial_impact/,"Just moved to LA and I'm not asking for pity or handouts but I would really appreciate some leads on where to look. Right now I'm just tutoring.

My routine each day is to go through the job search portion of this job tracker I have [made to review. Should give you an idea of what I'm interested in so far](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwdbKmnTUO_ASktUWUh3Tk1hSUk) and then periodically check the company list. Some of these companies I'm interested in, but most are there because they are in the [SoCalCAN](https://socalcollegeaccess.org/) or similar directories like [Do Good LA](http://www.dogoodla.org/). 

First I typically check these three job boards.
 
 * Idealist
 * LA2050
 * Jobscoop.org

I have job alerts for Indeed, Zip Recruiter and LinkedIn but I must have not created a great search list because I keep getting postings for speech therapy or credentialed teach positions. 

I've also been told to look at National Council of Nonprofits' Job Board, Philanthropy News Digest's Job board and Edjoin, but the first two are almost exclusively for executives and upper management, while the other is strictly for licensed professionals. 

I was planning on attending a recent job fair near LAX, [this one](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/los-angeles-career-fair-october-05-2017-job-fairs-hiring-events-in-los-angeles-ca-tickets-28746333056) Did any one go it? Worth going to a similar one in November? 

I have a network of friends here, one of whom recommended a recruiting event for new boards of directors, and I'm meeting with one I'm really interested in. However, that's not likely to be a paying position. I've also checked in with them a couple of times with no job leads, and they are my social circle too so I'm trying not to lean on them too much. 

I've had two interviews since arriving here about two months ago (but one was for a tutoring company), but I'm frustrated by the lack of leads. I scour that job tracker everyday, and I keep trying to broaden what I can apply to but no luck. I swallowed my pride a little and broadened the search outside of college access and direct service. I'm willing to do more operations and development type work. In fact I might like that more. I'm interested in education policy and change from a higher level, so experience in those areas may be useful. 

And look, I know where I'm at: No one wants to hear another tirade like ""Woe is me. I'm special. Where is my perfect job?"" 

I'm posting because I am *convinced* jobs are out there, but they're just not public. There are *way* too many management and executive postings up if that's the case. My best guess is they are hiring interns or AmeriCorps alumns and they either develop them or they leave for another local NPO. Just one thing: I understand the ""well you may have to consider moving back."" I'd rather not get into it, but moving home is just not a healthy option, nor was staying in the city I was at. LA was the only city with anything resembling a network for me to build off of.

So I have a few questions, and here is a [link to my resume for some context](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwdbKmnTUO_AemtCMVNha181Snc):

 * Are there any non-profit or social impact organizations hosting job fairs here in LA? 
 * Could anyone put me in contact with people for informational type interviews and the like? 
 * What are the more in-demand fields here within the non-profit/social impact world of LA?  

Thanks. Please keep the criticism constructive. That said, I'd like to think I could take most harsh criticism that is anything other than ""Please leave LA"""
75sdu6,2,2017-10-11,Should I stick with pre-med?,seacucumber3000,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/75sdu6/should_i_stick_with_premed/,"I'm a sophomore (although I wont graduate for another three years) computer science/bioinfotmatics major and I'm seriously considering whether or not to drop the pre-med track. I'm genuinely interested in becoming a doctor, and I'm fascinated with pathology and radiology. However, I'm starting to doubt that my GPA is good enough to get me into an MD program that I'd be interested in.

I've been playing around with some GPA calculators and acceptance chance calcs (LizzyM and one from SDN) and it's really worrying me. Obviously I don't know what my grades will be like in the future, but to my best guess, my cumulative GPA will be around a 3.4-3.5, but my science GPA will be down at a 3.3. I haven't gotten any C's, but I am a perpetual B+ student.

However, I'm confident with my ECs. Just doing some basic napkin math, I should end up with around 300-500 hours of clinical volunteering experience (assuming I start next semester), over 100 hours of shadowing, and over 250 hours of non-clinical volunteering. I should also end up with over 500 (my math says 800, but I'll round down a bit) of research experience at a genomics laboratory on campus (doing bioinformatics computer work and wet lab work). I have previously done work with a professor at my university's space science center and am listed as a co-author in one of his publications. I'll also have non-medicine related experience like several CS/engineering internships and clubs. Last summer, I interned at an aerospace startup (I was a mechanical engineering major back then), and I'm looking into internships this year. I would prefer a medical-related CS internship, medical summer program, or an internship abroad, but at the very least I will have an unrelated CS internship. I am also a member of a semi-prestigious student-run angel investing group/class on campus, which I expect to take a leadership position in for the next few years.

I'm not a URM, a CA resident, and my essay writing skills are pretty mediocre. ~~I'm not interested in DO schools~~ I might be interested in DO schools, but my primary interest are MD schools, and at this point I don't think I'm interested in doing a post-bacc or SMP (since I could be working in CS at that point rather than paying for school).

I imagine that my chances of getting in will come down to my MCAT score. I'm generally a good test-taker, but I don't want to preemptively guess what my score will be.

If it matters, I'm thinking the schools I'm thinking I'm interested in are, after doing very little research outside of school location and their selectiveness (yes, I know that many of these would be huge reach schools for my stats): USC-Keck, Rochester, Dartmouth, Einstein, Hofstra, MCW, Stony Brook, Vermont, OHSU, Wisconsin, Quinnipiac, Wake Forest, Tufts, Georgetown, Brown, BU, Drexel, and Rosalind Franklin. Obviously, with more research I can better trim down my list, but if the overall consensus is that I won't get into any of those schools, then I'll probably end up dropping the premed track.

I had a phone screening with PwC this morning and I think it went alright except for a couple of parts. 

1: going full time during grad school: the interviewer asked me if I was planning on working full time while going to grad school. I said I would be working part time. She said the were looking for people who would be working full time and I said that I would be willing to consider but I just do not know what my life is going to be like in the future. 

2: CPA exam eligibility: she asked my if I would be eligible to sit for the exam by the time I graduate from undergrad. I said yes on accident but will email later to clarify that I hope to finish grad school first to get the hours and then take it.

Overall the interview was ok and lasted 20 mins. She also talked about how I might be better suited for another internship program that they have. Is it too late to switch to that program? Should o tell her that I want to only do internships throughout grad school and then work for a firm?

Thank you for your time! "

My point is I shouldn't be failing this badly. It's not like I haven't tried either. I approach women in classes, fitness classes, clubs etc. I have seen MUCH UGLIER and fatter and shorter dudes with hot girls, and I am not aiming for sorority blondes.

At this point I feel like I'm never going to get laid. I feel like a huge loser. This is affecting my friendships and is lowering my grades. I feel that if I am not the most social/romantic guy, then I should have AT LEAST good grades or internships or jobs, yet I don't even have those. My GPA is so low I got turned down from some fraternities and they told me to come back once I got it up. I have failed numerous classes.

R34 Ideas inside.,Television-RP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/75tcjb/f4m_roleplay_based_off_tvmovies_r34_ideas_inside/,"No, I don't want to roleplay as a television set, apparently my name gives people the wrong idea. Anyhow, thanks for clicking! I would love to roleplay with characters from movies/television with scenes based off said media. Since you would be doing me a favor by playing a pre-established character, I feel it would be fair and fun for me to cater to your needs! Would you like a character with a big, bubble butt opposite of yours? Do you crave to have a busty, eighteen year old with your character? Or perhaps you want a particular race? The only things that I *will* not do in a scene are -&gt; Animals, ageplay, blood play, feet, force, futa, scat, watersports and anything *too* far out there. Feel free to ask if I didn't cover anything.

♥ **Marco Polo**; You would be playing... *gasp*, Marco Polo in said scene. Full knowledge of the series isn't required but a general idea of the character and show would be great. I would love to see him being seduced by a woman in the Khan's harem, or perhaps a dancer sent to entertain him. 

♥ **Game of Thrones**; Daario or Robb Stark would be my top choices. Maybe even Mero! I'd like for them to be fucking a Dany impersonator with a great curvy body. [For more information on this idea, click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6oinsu/f4m_the_queen_of_anal_daenerys_targaryen/)

♥ **Veep**; Dan Egan. Yep, that horrible douchebag. He's smug, an annoying know-it-all and an all around asshole. A senator's daughter getting rammed by him in a storage closet, trying to stay quiet to avoid being caught? Yes, please. Or maybe that eighteen year old girl in the gym he can't keep his eyes off is charmed and fucked by him in a semi-public place.

♥ **Trial And Error**; Josh the lawyer, please! A backwards little town with him fucking a gorgeous new intern or simply having a night of fun.

♥ **Great News**; A few ideas that mostly revolve around sneaking, fucking during a live broadcast, etc. If you play Greg, I would like to be a secretary, reporter, a celebrity guest on the show, etc!

♥ **Suits**; Mike Ross with a cute new intern or secretary filling in for Donna. A late night case forces Mike to stay in the file room when the girl stops by for a visit before she's heading out. Of course, she can't help herself and has her hands roaming over his body, hoping to relieve him of any stress. 

♥ **Galavant**; You would be playing as Galavant in the scene opposite of many different choices. Maybe a wench at the bar? A princess who's room he had snuck into? Or the local farmer's curvy, yet gorgeous daughter who's been craving your attention for weeks. The choice is yours! ~ Singing/rhyming not included.

♥ **Community**; I would prefer for you to play Jeff in this scene. If you watch the show, there's more than enough ideas for us to come up with a fun scene together. My preferences would be Jeff fucking a librarian/tutor/new spanish teacher/nurse/etc.

♥ **From Dusk Till Dawn**; Not the movie version. I would want you to play Seth Gecko in this roleplay, I can't say I like any of the male characters. Seth having fun with a bank teller who can't resist his looks or one of the dancers from the infamous strip club?

♥ **Arrow**; Who could resist a scene with a hot cat burglar on her knees with her mouth full of the vigilante's hard cock? Is she getting her mouth fucked in an alley, or perhaps in a warehouse after he's cleared it out? Maybe Oliver's being seduced by his sister's slutty, eighteen year old friend?

♥ **Daredevil**; I'm solely interested in Matt! I would like to play as a female criminal such as Black Cat! Other than that, a secretary/intern/woman coming for help to his office would be ideal.

♥ **Luke Cage**; You play as... *gasp*! Luke Cage. I'm very open minded for this but that body of his manhandling a curvy gorgeous woman? Let's do it!

♥ **WWE**; There's a bunch of people I love there, both present and former! I can play people ranging from fans, to sexy referees, announcers, interviewers and new divas!

♥ **Limitless**; The TV show! Not expecting many people who've seen this but you playing as Brian would be the best!

♥ **MTV's The Challenge**; A bit of a niche show! If you're familiar with it, I'd love to discuss the possibilities we could play out.

♥ **Big Brother (US)**; ^ Read above!

♥ **What's Your Number?**; Easy. Colin + Hot, juicy assed slut = &lt;333. This scene can go in any direction, easy to get into some raunchy hot sex.

♥ **The Cabin In The Woods**; Holden/Jesse Williams is left alone with your choice of gal in the cabin. Ditsy blonde with a killer body? Voluptuous nerdy girl who's in need of a good fuck? Open and easy to dive in to.

♥ **Man Of Steel**; You would be playing Henry Cavill as Superman in the scene. I'd prefer for him to go up against villainesses that lead up to a rough hate fuck. Poison Ivy, White Rabbit and others would be the top picks. Also into playing other females such as Power Girl and so on. No Wonder Woman.

♥ **Man From U.N.C.L.E**; Illya, Napoleon or both! Having either or both pumping a sexy spy, informant, daughter of their target, etc for information is just too perfect, isn't it?

Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I would love to hear some if you want to play a particular character. **Give me a list of your shows/movies, I watch a lot!** I also have images for the no-named characters opposite of yours and I'm hopeful that they won't disappoint. Big kinks I love; anal, creampies, rimming(giving/recieving), roughness and dirty talking. I'll get back to messages ASAP!"

I'm having a lot of trouble planning my life in order to be as successful as possible.

I was in the Marine Corps for 4 years and when I got out in 2014, as planned, I immediately started going to college that Fall. I obtained an Associates in Bus. Admin from a community college and decided to move to another state for a better school and life. They accepted all but 5 courses; 3 because the course wasn't at their level and 2 because they were C's. Anyway, I'm still going to school full-time, including summers, so I can graduate as soon as possible. I'm expected to graduate Summer 2020, but could be as early as Spring 2020 if I take 5 courses a semester, instead of the 4 I'm currently taking. The University I go to is *pretty* challenging so I'm not sure how I'd handle 5. I also need to fit in a required internship one summer and I'm not sure how many, if any, courses I'd be able to take while doing that.

A huge concern of mine is that I'll be **29** when I finally get a bachelors degree and JUST starting a career. And this is IF I get a job soon after graduating. As I said earlier, I currently have an Associates in Business Admin. I'm a finance major. The only ""work"" experience I have was in the Marine Corps. I don't really know how companies view military as ""experience"" when going through applicants. In all honesty, I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't hold much credibility at all.

I lurk a lot on this subreddit and see everyone talking about jobs and promotions. About how important it is to get experience and hop around to new jobs for better pay, maxing out $5500/year on IRAs/401k's, etc etc. I'm still trying to knock out a few more general education courses and sitting in these required classes, like art history and science, are really making me question if I'm making the right decision by going to school full time and not getting my foot in the door in the workforce.

**Financial Situation:**

I currently bring home $3400 a month and after expenses I have ~$900. Which isn't bad, I'd say...The $3450 consists of $1750 GI Bill and $1700 disability. However, I could be working some low paying entry-level finance-related job and not only be making MORE money than I am now but I'd be gaining work experience as well. This is assuming that the job would be paying more than $1750/mo to substitute what I make going to school full-time, which I think is quite possible. And I want to make it clear that I **want** to get a degree at some point. I'm just not sure if putting jobs/work experience on hold is the best way to do it. I'd have to explain in interviews why I went from 2014-2020 going to school and not working at all. 

What are my best options for a successful life? I'm very concerned about starting a career so late with no ""real"" work experience outside the Marine Corps and how it will effect me in the long run. "

I had a devastating year that led to a complete mental and existential breakdown, and more than a couple suicide attempts. I moved back in with my parents - the last thing on earth I ever wanted to do - because the place I was living had no jobs besides ones that were humiliating, dehumanizing, or basically didn't require a college degree (I have a bachelor's in creative writing and psychology). Since I graduated, I have spent my life working terrible jobs that didn't value me, or included incompetent bosses just as flabbergastingly abusive as my idiot, self-important parents.

I am really not exaggerating when I say, 2016 almost killed me. I lost 6 friends and loved ones. My landlady started stealing from me. In desperation, I moved in with a bunch of guys I thought were cool - turns out, half of them were literal sociopaths. They both even admitted that they knew what they were like, ""eh, no big deal, just thought you should know."" Their behavior was horrendous, and the people they brought into the house were worse. I almost called the cops on them a couple times.

I had to close my savings account to pay rent, then I had to pay rent with my credit card because I lost my job and I ran out of money. I started working at a sketchy urgent care clinic to make ends meet. For most of this year, my parents and I weren't speaking, but we managed to patch things up relatively well. I begged them to let me move home for awhile, closer to Chicago, while I looked for a job in a career that would be meaningful to me. I start an unpaid internship this Friday, but I'm running out of money.

My dad flew off the handle about something incredibly trivial the other day, and told me to ""fuck off."" I told him he doesn't get to say things like that to me, and I left the room. My parents had a fight. My mom screamed at the top of her lungs and stormed out, didn't return until later that night. I also left.

Today, I was in a shitty mood all day, right until the end. Just as I was starting to feel better, my mom confronted me, saying Dad and I ""need to work through our differences."" She's always done this thing where she blames me for arguments we have, because I'm ""supposed to be the rational one."" I'm supposed to have control, not him, so I'm responsible for his behavior. It's my fault that he acts this way. I told her that was bullshit, that I did nothing wrong. I was trying to protect myself from his abusive behavior. 

It took years of therapy and lots of chatting with good friends who've been through similar situations before I finally started learning to value myself and take care of myself, including standing up to abusive behavior. My mother refuses to acknowledge that his behavior is in any way abusive.

I have depression and generalized anxiety. My parents use this against me constantly. Whenever we have conflict, it's because I'm ""being moody and irrational."" They're never the cause. It's always my fault.

I couldn't take it any more tonight. I tore into my mom, telling her things I've wanted to say for years. I said she failed to protect me, and she is failing to protect herself. I told her she's in denial about being in an abusive relationship. I told her, ""You may have dug yourself into a hole by refusing to face your own delusions, but you're not going to ruin my life, too.""

I regret a lot of the stuff I said. Mostly because I didn't want her to know that I felt that way, because, as I suspected, she isn't receptive to any of it. She still can't see that they both hurt me a lot as a kid, and still are, even though they weren't (usually) physically abusive.

I don't know what to do. I'm so angry at them. I tried so hard to make this work, and now they've gone and made it impossible. I just wanted a few months of stability to find a decent job that would allow me to pay down the debt I've accrued just trying to stay away from them. I don't know if they're going to kick me out. If they don't, this house is going to feel like even less of a home now - it's a prison. I need their money; I've given up on seeking their love...at least without expecting it to come with strings attached. Like rolling over and letting myself get disrespected and accused of things that are in no logical way my fault, just to placate a deranged alcoholic with a bloated ego and thin skin.

TL,DR; All I've ever wanted was a good career and financial freedom from my parents. I tried as hard as I could, but now I'm stuck having to rely on them again, and it's even worse now than when I was a teenager. They literally, truly, deep down believe I'm a nutcase, or a bad person, for standing up to them and saying things like, ""that was a really hurtful thing to say, that wasn't fair."" My dad's an alcoholic narcissist and my mom's a codependent apologist who is just as irrational and just as abusive. Yet, I have no choice but to live with them and rely on their financial support for the next god knows how many months...I have nowhere else to go. I don't know what to do."

75v0f6,1,2017-10-12,"i'm in a dead end relationship, moving, and feel like a failure. send advice?",ogRaccoonNo1,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/75v0f6/im_in_a_dead_end_relationship_moving_and_feel/,"advice is welcome. I just really need a friend right now since mine are busy. 
I've been in a relationship for 2.5 years at the start it was great up until the 8 month mark. he started seeing his friends, pushing me away, name calling, and started behavior that is what a lot of people call ""gas lighting"". tried breaking up back then but we got back together. in the meantime, i was studying at a school i absolutely hated. my parents would not let me transfer and i did not have the financial resources/car to transfer. basically i ended up 1 class short of official graduation &amp; was able to finally transfer to a school that i did like, w/ the major that I finally wanted. within the next few months ill have both degrees and then will hopefully start work / masters program. so after getting back together things were better for a bit, we tried to work on the relationship. i noticed despite the changes to my life i still didn't feel happy or anywhere near satisfied. after my 1st school, i had also moved back to my parents house since i was able to commute from there to my new (and current school). living at home only lasted a few months, my mom basically had a midlife crisis, divorced my father, and rearranged the house to let in her low life boyfriend. being a small house, and my sister a slob who hordes clothes and junk, i was sleeping on the floor. they had gotten rid of my bed and other furniture a few years before this and given me a blow up mattress. but there was no room to blow it up after her bf moved in and she switched up all the bedrooms. that's when i pretty much moved in with my boyfriend, it was nice at first to have a better environment free of the yelling and family drama. i really liked it. however, he didn't like it and was yelling at me at 1st telling me i need to get out, he needs his space. i packed my bag, phoned my parents, and went to leave. as i went for the door he begged me to stay, saying its good for me to be with him &amp; that it'll be good for our relationship. i stayed. things go okay then, we help each other cook, clean, and watch tv together. i'm on top of my school work, getting really great grades, and really liked the more positive environement. i loved being able to sleep next to him, cuddle him, and being able to have friends over/ stay up late/ socially drink without getting yelled at by parents. but, i also started to really get to know my boyfriend. it turns out he is not who he says he was, &amp; i know I'm not either. you really get to see a persons true self when you live together. while i may feel like a failure (still) for transfering schools &amp;now doing what i love (even though it means another year until i can grad and start working w my degrees), I am highly motivated. I want to better myself,a job, and good grades. I want happy life. I stay up every night and always put in the extra mile. I work extra hours so I can pay the tuition. I love going out and seeing my friends, even though I cannot afford much, I even just like going on a walk or a little drive. Here's his thing: he likes to sit at home everyday and just play video games, nap for hours, &amp; smoke. On nice days I suggest going to the park or out for a walk and he never goes. I ask if he wants to do anything or has any ideas and he says no, he just wants to watch netflix or play the video games. When we are home, he started doing this thing where he won't say more than a few words to me. ""yeah"" and ""okay"" are his typical answers. I try to make conversations about different things but he never seems that interested and it always ends up with me just doing the talking because he doesn't talk! now i dont say much to him, i text my friends and stay up late posting on reddit feeling like a lonely loser! fast forward to last summer: a huge incident went down where he invited ""becky"" over to his place alone, becky has always romantically liked him. he was over 2.5 hours late, made excuses for her, and gave me an attitude to call and make sure he was okay considering the lateness. when he finally came to pick me up, i tried to just say hey is everything alright? he had a major attitude with me and started yelling at me. when i questioned him about it being so late and brought up how it seemed weird he was with becky alone, he started screaming at me and defending her more, with all sorts of ridiculous excuses like ""she's religious and in her 30s but still a virgin"". i started crying saying how could he do this to me,&amp; that the way he's handling it&amp; the whole situation seems like cheating. i ended up going home, sleeping on the couch. by the time morning came, my whole family knew what happened. they insisted he cheated&amp; speculated it wasnt the 1st time. fast forward 2weeks &amp; i moved back in w him, back together. then he ends up (legitimately) visiting his family on the other side of the US for a month. i didn't know why but I guess i was super attached because I missed him like crazy. he came home and school was in session before we knew it. things were okay, we didn't fight but just became sort of distant, he was back to the smoking, netflix and tv. he didn't seem too interested in school work, while i always spend a few hours on it every day (we are both full time students). i started asking about different things to go out to but yet again he didn't seem interested inn anything unless it involved spending $50+ to get into &amp;solid hour of driving (things i can't afford). however, i had gained some weight since the start of the relationship. mostly from all the sitting on my butt and schoolwork, so i have been eating healthier and doing some exercise. I'm toning up and seeing some improvements, but it seems like these things take time for lasting results. he started pressuring me about the gym. everyday one of the first things he says is when are we going to the gym. when we do go he works out so hard he can barely even stand up afterwards, he actually gets sick after then too. his intensity doesn't seem healthy. during this time i noticed that he hasn't been saying anything about becky. i bluffed one time and said hey how is becky has she been wanting to hangout? he said yeah we talked a bit&amp; she invites me to a bunch of stuff but i haven't gone. nonchalantly i tell him, you should invite her to a movie night w our mutual friends or we could all go out. No he says she wouldn't like that, explains that she doesn't like any of our mutual friends. A few days earlier he had told me that he hasn't spoken to her at all. i guess i caught a lie? so later that night after we talked about him inviting becky to things with our friends, he's fast asleep &amp; i look thru his phone. amazingly, i found some of becky messages. she had asked him to hangout 2x. he says no i can't I'm busy all in 1 message that's it. no other conversations / texts besides those brief hangout &amp; declines. seems odd the conversations were so short. she also used to be very active on his social media always posting commenting &amp; since the summer incident she ghosted. no likes, comments&amp; not that many of her own posts. i know its super easy to delete texts&amp; change social media settings so certain people can't see. i have no actual proof of cheating, just a bad gut feeling that was there in summer and now back. well its still the fall semester&amp; the most recent thing started happening is how he has 10am classes&amp; has started leaving at 6or 7am every day. claims its ""to get work done"" before class but it seems weird. i notice some days its an extra hour or 2 after when he would come home. when i was like hey you're home later he was real quiet (surprise ha)&amp; said ""i went to the gym"" i didn't push him further happened other days&amp; same 1liner of ""i stayed to study"" haha okay. so thats the current situation. on top of it he's graduating and has applied to masters programs. he got accepted to one thats an 8hr drive away. it starts in feb, and right now its halfway through oct. he wants me to come with him when he moves. I'm torn. i can't afford to live on my own or even with a roommate, so if i stay here i would have to move back with my mom or other relatives (who would gladly take me). the other plus is that I've lived in this area all my life i know it well, but the jobs here pay awfully, the cost of living is horribly high, and there aren't many opportunities for what I'm going for. i would need to move when i get a masters in like the next 3.5 years or sooner anyways. plus my family would help me with groceries and more expenses if i did move home, and right now groceries and living expenses eat up a lot of my work money. I'm also super attached to him for some reason i really do love him but know he's not the 1 for me. we don't have the same interests or motivations, we are both so bored. we don't even have sex anymore and when we do he doesn't satisfy me, i tell him and he doesn't even listen or make an effort. on the flipside, i still love him i guess its just not a sexual love. moving w him though would probably give me much better internship and career opportunities, I've always wanted to move away eventually, but at the same time its really far and if he did cheat I'm sure he will cheat again. but living with family would also mean that id loose all my freedom, they're all super religious and weird about alcohol. id never be able to sleep in. always have to go to church services, wouldn't be able to have friends over, drink, or have privacy. it'd be a hard adjustment. honestly I'm not even sure i could move. since its out of state that means my tuition rate will also be and go up even more! i can barely pay it now so theres no way i could afford the out of state rates. to make it more complicated my parents don't support me at all in school, they are both trying to convince me to drop out and go work minimum wage at a grocery instead. ugh. i need a masters degree&amp; salary that i can live off of. plus I'm horrible for saying this but i just met this guy (one of his old classmates we ran into) and i legitimately think i fell in love at first sight. just looking at him and briefly having the pleasure of him talking to me and my bf made me realize there really are other guys out there, more motivated, passionate people who are fun loving and want to go do things. people that hold conversations. he is single too. even if i became single, i never could have that boy. I'm still chubby, hate myself daily, and feel like a massive failure. i dont think I'm attractive at all and think I'm a boring person. my bf always tells me i have no friends and i feel that way too. i just feel so stuck. i know i need to dump him, and that he probably did cheat, i know i need to bite the bullet and move home just suck it up, and i know moving that far with my current bf will just prolong the staleness. but its just so hard to let go. i feel like he was the only one really there when things were all a mess with my school and family. if you were me, what would you honestly do?"

Does anyone know if BBY does something similar?

From going to induction a few years back, I remember the trainer saying that corporate was looking for employees who are good at coding to get flow out to MN to work on the internal applications like ETK and NOVA. But the trainer has already moved on to another company so I can't even ask him now.

I'm currently doing a bachelors Computer Science program pretty far away from MN. My questions are:  
Do they actually fly people out from other states for it?
How hard is it to get in?
Do they provide some kind of housing plan for internships?
Anyone's who's ever done it, how was your experience?

Any information regarding so is much appreciated."

75xe5f,45,2017-10-12,Me [32/m] doesnt know how to make it work with wife [30/f] anymore,throwaway77757775,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/75xe5f/me_32m_doesnt_know_how_to_make_it_work_with_wife/,"I originally posted this in /r/relationship_advice but found this on the sidebar and thought I'd see if there was a different perspective here that I might be missing out on (particularly as this is a sub directly related to the issue).

We've been married for 5 years, together for 10. We are each others firsts. For the first few years things were amazing, like almost perfect. She's beautiful, bubbly and adventurous. The sex was great, the dates were amazing and my life seemed to be getting stronger and stronger.

Then things started to go south on me. I've thought about it a lot and now know when it started, she had surgery on her vagina (nothing major and no lasting issues) and ever since she has gone from a wonderful lover to very closed off. She also started to struggle with her career. Things didn't go the way she had planned out her life and she started to resent me for it (she made some decisions to stay with me instead of being close to her family who had doted on her forever). Boredom crept into her life as a result of her lack of confidence in her career.

I'm the kind of person who really needs sex to feel loved. By that I mean that I know that I have all of these other qualities but when it comes to love, it is sex that really drives it home to me that I am loved. I do enjoy hugging/kissing but sex is the real intimacy to me.

After she stopped wanting to have sex with me, things went bad fairly slowly. There was no overnight lightswitch so much as the turning from summer to winter. First she started only sleeping with me after she'd been drinking, then not at all. I did not react well to this. I cant remember if I redoubled my efforts to keep her happy or not but I do know that eventually I sank into a bad cycle of work, alcohol and video games. I gained weight, a lot of weight. I became the sort of person that she, at least the her from when we first met, wouldn't want to be with. She took a long break from us to spend time with her family and do an internship - with my full support (no concern about infidelity).

Things got better. I improved myself again and sex did restart briefly. My career was on track and we had some lovely trips together. I allowed myself to think that we were happy for a time and proposed. We got married. Then things started to take a dive again. She still felt unfulfilled in life, from a career standpoint, and was in hindsight unhappy with everything. She used to make comments that made me feel awful about myself on a daily or weekly basis ('you've ruined my life', 'im only in this shit situation because of you', 'look at you, why didnt you stay in the gym for another hour?'). She stopped touching me all together and rarely said anything nice to me at all. Nearly of my physical advances were rejected, harshly in a lot of cases, and eventually I sorta stopped trying.

Recently (last 2 years) I started a new job in a new city and things got dramatically better for us on the surface. Lots more money, I managed to get her a job which she enjoys, we live in an interesting place with so much to see and do and I think the boredom thing has largely disappeared. We have been getting on better in general.

About 9 months ago, she was having a bad day and told me something that no man wants to hear - I haven't found you attractive in a long time. Suddenly it all became very clear to me. The total drop off in sex, the lack of any physical interest at all. Now two things have become obvious since she told me this:

Firstly I have some serious body self esteem problems. People have been telling me for a long time that I was looking good and I honestly thought that they were making fun of me. It wasn't until I noticed some girls checking me out at a bar that I wondered if I wasn't looking ok. After looking through pictures, it turns out that I have the best body that I've had since I was 21.

Second, she hasnt really seen me as a husband but as a best friend for a long time.

Something recently provoked me to speak up about my feelings at last. I told her that I need to feel more physically fulfilled and that she hasn't been making me feel truly loved in a long time. We've had sex maybe 10 times in 2 years and all of them have been really unfulfilling 'duty' sex. She claims that she does find me attractive and that Im being selfish by airing my feelings. She's started almost spitefully complimenting me and touching my arm in a non-sexual way and saying 'see I touch you!'. She's also saying that I haven't been making her feel loved either and that I don't try - whilst rejecting my feelings that she's shut me down so frequently and harshly that I don't feel confident to do that anymore.

The problem I have is that, physical stuff aside, she is perfect. She's enthusiastic and helps me try to get the best out of life, she pushes me to things I'd never thought I could do, she is my creative muse. She's beautiful. If that weren't enough, her parents have been better to me than my own parents ever were.

The wildcard in all this is that we have a planned separation due to my career anyway. For at least 6 months, probably a year, I will be in another country. She pushed me to do it citing how good it will be for my career and claims it isnt to get space from me. Would this separation help matters or just let the frost settle more? Would this be a better point for the start of a divorce?

I'm open to all questions/ideas/advice at this point because I just feel numb. I'm terrified by the idea of losing the only woman I've ever loved (and feeling like I've failed at my idea of the ideal life) but I don't know if I can handle feeling like this for another 5 years. So far I've tried open communication, date nights, spontaneous gifts, improving all of the things she doesnt like about me and a few tries to get her to be more intimate with me (not even sex yet) but nothing seems to be working.

TL;DR: Wife stopped finding me attractive and I don't know if she ever started again. I love her and her family but feel depressed and numb. I have an opportunity coming up for a clean break but don't know if im being stupid or selfish for even considering it.

I scored a 167 on the September LSAT, and a 161 in June. My GPA is exactly 3.700; a double major in computer science and philosophy. I have done a couple programming internships, but no work experience otherwise. I am a non-URM, and do not need scholarship money.  I am going straight from undergrad to law school.
  
I was PT-ing at 169 before my September test, and feel like I could score a 168-171 given a month of studying. However, I do not know if a third test-take would look bad to schools. I also was planning on applying late October, and am not sure if retaking and getting a 168 in January is much better than a 167 in October.  
  
The schools I am targeting are USC, UCLA, Vanderbilt, Berkeley, Cornell, and Georgetown. I am also applying below and above, but those are the core.  
  
Any advice is greatly appreciated. I am getting competing suggestions from my advisor, teachers, and friends.  
  
Thanks!"
75xmzq,6,2017-10-12,How do I break the cycle?,whenutrynaleave,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/75xmzq/how_do_i_break_the_cycle/,"Every time I get high, I think about why I want to quit. And then when my high wears off and I'm coming back to sobriety, all I can think about is getting high. I know I need to stop. I'm not yet at the point where weed has seriously fucked up my life but I can clearly see I am heading in that direction. 

I'm in my last year of uni. My grades are good but now that our program is finishing up everyone else is looking for jobs and internships and I'm wasting my days away getting high and playing video games. I have no motivation. I'm out of shape physically because I munch out on junk all the time and way too lazy to work out when I'm stoned.  Everything in my life just feels shitty right now. I think maybe I'm subconsciously afraid of failure (I'm an overachiever and perfectionist to a fault and not being successful is my biggest fear) so it's easier to get high and mellow out all day than it is to face my problems and put in the work to better myself (and deal with the underlying anxiety that maybe things won't work out. Not to think pessimistically but there is always the chance). 

I've been down this road before. I quit for 1.5 years starting in 2015 and I felt the benefits. I felt so much better overall but for some reason I picked up smoking again because I thought I could control it. I guess I was also let down when my life didn't automatically improve drastically in that time. I see now that bettering myself involves more than just quitting pot and I can't expect quitting to fix all of my problems but it's really hard to motivate myself this time around.

Every night for the past week or so has been my ""last joint"". I've gone to bed high after smoking (""just to help me get to sleep"" I keep saying to myself) telling myself that in the morning I'll wake up early and get started on living my new sober, better life. But then I wake up so fucking tired and foggy from smoking right before bed and all I can think about is getting high to take away the weed hangover. I'll lie to myself and say that I'll just have a little bit to get my day started and that turns into a whole day of smoking, and the cycle repeats itself. 

I know insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. So why do I keep doing this? Anyone else in the same boat or managed to beat this and have some tips to share? I need encouragement so badly I feel like anything will help at this point. "
75xpok,2,2017-10-12,"Bungie is in a great position to show they're listening, and could easily take it to the next level",Finite_Reign,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/75xpok/bungie_is_in_a_great_position_to_show_theyre/,"For all the praise and salt these forums bring, (yes it's both, and in vast quantities) Bungie says surprisingly little to the community as a whole.  They have a captive audience that hangs on every word from its various employee's twitter accounts, DTG forum posts, bungie forum posts, news articles from every which source, and of course their own website with the TWAB.  As a community, you need to be linked in to a dozen different things in order to get ""the whole story"" from Bungie.  While this should NOT be the case, at least it shows that individuals from their ranks are talking, even if their official mouthpiece (their own website) isn't.  (seriously Bungie... consolidate your information distribution.  Please, do say tons of things in lots of places, but provide that same information on your own site)

How is this a missed opportunity?

With so much random engagement but so little information flow, Bungie could easily start compiling a list of ""features"" and ""feature improvements"" from the community that they feel are a good value add for their game.  Likely, someone is already doing this somewhere.  Likely, they've got an internal ""social media"" intern type  whose sole purpose is to parse the static looking for the real information.  If this isn't a thing, I question their logic.

But this isn't being conveyed to the community.  Saying that they ""hear"" the community doesn't really tell anyone what it is they are hearing.  The reason they don't communicate their plans, per their own mouthpiece, is that they don't want to promise anything and not deliver it.  But they've already done this.  Fear of ""missing the mark"" shouldn't be a thing for Bungie given their record on dates and hype. 

Many companies that deal directly with clients (rather than a retail market chain) have some method for gathering client feedback and indicating what they are looking into, are implementing, or are flat out ignoring a comment / suggestion.  Bungie could EASILY do this with a community feedback loop on their own site.  As information is gathered and parsed, it becomes a bulleted, community generated, item on a special page of their site.  

It would operate as a form of curated forum in which submissions are vetted and then posted by an admin.  Each bulleted item would allow the community to add their voice to a feature or improvement via a logged in vote.  They could add comments directly to an item in the list, but cannot directly add a high level topic.  Bungie could indicate which features they are actually looking at here.  They don't need to promise a single thing unless they really want to.  And should it become an issue with getting things posted in to their feedback loop, without a doubt DTG would be there to pick up the slack.

If they feel something is outside the pale or wouldn't be a good value add, they could simply drop a flair type indicator on the item and move it to the bottom of the list.  If they like a feature and want to implement it, they could note that it is being considered by adding a special flair type indicator that informs the community it is on their radar.  If it has moved into actual development, that could be noted as well and would, without a doubt, show the community they are heeding the information they're being gifted.

Yes, Bungie is likely very busy.  They've, without doubt, scheduled their next few years of development work.  If they failed to provide time for potential out of band development work, then there has been a misstep in their planning.  The reality is, though, that such a feature on their web page would, AT LEAST, provide some mechanism to show they are paying attention to specific things rather than provide blanket nonspecific statements about ""hearing"" us.  And, should a suggestion already be in their backlog for development, they could easily see where it ranks by community voting, and could take the easy win because it was something they were going to do ANYWAY.

Like most, I like this game, but see its failings as well as its positives.  Anything that would improve this game should be sought out.

75z34q,165,2017-10-12,Welcome Chris as our newest core dev!,zherbert,siacoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/siacoin/comments/75z34q/welcome_chris_as_our_newest_core_dev/,"We are thrilled to announce that Chris Schinnerl has officially moved to Boston this week to join Sia as our newest core developer. We’re incredibly happy to have him on the team.

Chris comes to us from Austria. He learned to code while in high school and developed an interest in open source software around the same time. He studied Computer Science at Graz University of Technology, achieving his undergrad degree while working as a software engineer for AVL List.

Once Chris learned about the idea of decentralized storage, he was hooked. A few Siacoin and a full node later, he began contributing to the project. Chris spent a few months submitting fixes and features via Github, and enough of these were merged with the core code that the team started to take notice. One short hop across the Atlantic, and Chris met the Sia team in August of this year.

We’re absolutely excited to see where Chris helps Sia go over the next few months and years.

Stray facts:
Chris became a trained medic for the Red Cross before attending university.
He once did a summer internship in Hong Kong.

75zhuw,2,2017-10-12,"""that"" long rant away from home",babycowmilk,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/75zhuw/that_long_rant_away_from_home/,"hey guys, i posted this in ftm forum but i really wanted some advice and/or suggestions so i just copy it here as well. 
English is not my first language and i don't have any extensive school in it. but i believe it's very comprehensible. please bare with me as well. i know coming out day was yesterday but i was a mess when my friend dropped the bomb. so happy belated coming out day everyone :) and sorry for the wall of text ahead. 

hai, this is my ""coming out"" story to the site~   
i come to US ages ago for a summer job like any other student. it was very difficult at the time because my country didn't have this program set up, and have yet to send any student abroad on it. i was dating this American girl at the time, who was my first gf. hence i contacted my home agency, and literally set it up for them so they could send me here to the States. i was one of the pioneers to come on that specific program from my hometown. it masked as a summer work program, but i was more or less spending time with girls while questioning my gender at the same damn time. i lived in a quite close-minded country in Asia and was born biological female. 

i worked very hard as a customer clerk at a supermarket. and you can say it paid off when my boss here wanted me to stay so she could promote me to be a supervisor for the winter and upcoming year. i literally remember what customers bought especially if they're a regular. it's a small tourism city by the coast line where everyone knows everyone else. which is dangerous at the same time cuz i had to be in the closet.  

my parents, on the other hand, were quite superstitious as you would call it. they believe in some fortune teller, so they asked me to come home that summer. i felt like my opportunity was taken away under my nose. but like a good kid i am, i came back home, did my duty to finish the bachelor degree. that's what Asian kids do. although i go back and forth to the US every summer until i graduate, mostly just for seasonal gfs. i battled against my entire family to do that on a yearly basic since they're close minded and i'm the only child. they don't want me to go anywhere out of their reach. almost everything i do in the summer and during school, i saved up for the next opportunity. 

after finish uni, i nailed a job as a staff writer for a fashion magazine, and later on become an editor in my hometown. i went full blown on dressing how i want to be after that which made me feel great and very confident. like i never get to dress this way because people would look at me like a weirdo and i couldn't deal with the constant harassment. at that time, i made an excuse for the love of fashion and that kind of bullshit. so it was easier when you could find/get a valid excuse for dressing and being who you are. those were the happiest days of my life back then, i recall :)   
i only ever started to look at the issue more serious, aka my gender dysphoria, when bodyguards escorted me to male restrooms on various occasions especially outing with clients/friends. we used to make fun of each other and my friends acted like we were dating to troll the servers. i didn't find that offensive or anything, just friends having fun. i didn't even think i was trans at the time. i didn't quite understand or know what trans is. we were very poorly educated when it comes to relationships, gender issues and any other thing related to sex, basically.  

then it came my bestfriend, who is a straight male, questioned about me too. he just kinda put a question out there but it made you think, you know. he's that kind of friend that you would ride your motorbike in the middle of the night and camp somewhere outside the city with a bottle of whisky while talk about how shitty of a life we have. he's been wondering about ""that"" too. ""that"", my dysphoria, in which i didn't want to discuss. it feels too much to even address it with other people. i don't know how to go about it, or where to start. i just leave it as ""that"". 

then in turn, i looked at my list of ex-gfs and not a single one of them is a lesbian, which is odd #1. most, if not all are bisexuals, and some have never dated women before they dated me. they went back to dating men after awhile, which i don't find it as offensive at all compared to other lesbians. their bfs, however, hate me so much even if i do nothing to them nor cheat with their gfs. there's just this rivalry, which is odd #2. i can hardly get along with the lesbian community, odd #3. i feel very isolated for a very long time and it hurt. i just don't fit in even if i try. however, i get on quite well with gay guys. some of them even say they would date me if i were a guy, odd #4. i could never get that phrase out of my head. and i did date a gay guy before. he's a bottom and it's one of the weirdest relationships you don't wanna talk about. it only lasted for about a month. we do like each other a lot but pre-transition, wrong time, wrong place you know. we both work in fashion. i shut myself out for half a year following a big break up with this gf of mine. we also worked in the same industry. i felt very guilty at some point cuz she could have gotten better. she was young and also was a model. i was just depressed on top of everything and questioned myself more. it took another half a year for my best guy friend to put me together. he was very overweighted and none of his other friends wanted to go out with him. i mean what kind of friends are they? it was just us odd 2, one big guy, one skinny dude. i feel trapped, in this big cage people put me in. i know i gotta get out of the country. there wasn't any friend nor anyone i could talk about. i refused to talk to him cuz he was already depressed enough :/ i wanted to make him lighter but i needed to work on myself at the same time. hence i decided to come back to the US to find a professional, a therapist, so i can talk to about ""that"". 

me and my best guy friend worked together to put him back on track, getting out of depression, finally get the meet up a nice girl and get a job. i feel like my bestie got a hang of his life, so i didn't feel bad leaving. it's funny cuz when a person got their life around, any other ""friends"" who didn't want them before cuz their weight, started to contact them and what not. we all know he hangs out cuz being social butterfly he is. but deep down inside, he said he'd never forget that feeling of people turning away from him. and i start to relate to that feeling a lot later on. 

again, i also masked my intention by saying i'd go on an internship for a year. but there's more than just an internship. i wish i was being dumb but i guess sometimes i just can't mask anything. the company that hired me is a fraud, so is the sponsor company/agency stationed here in the US. they basically hire grad students, ask for a big sum of money as a paid internship program, but they don't train you at all. which is against TOS of that program and the federal government. plus, they all pay you low wage so they could get away with taxes. i was very naive at the time and thinking i just let it slip and got on with my life. cuz i don't have all day to worry about paperwork and sueing here and there. my visa only lasted for a year so i gotta make the most out of it. but that was not all.  

i met a few other students who went on the same program and we rent a place together. i felt happy for a short moment until one of the girls set her bf's dirty clothes on fire while i was sleeping. i worked night shift at a hotel reception so my sleep schedule was upside down. i don't know how i'm still alive that day and my lung is fine without my roommate dragged me out literally. i was shocked to the point i was petrified in the middle of the house that cover with smoke and you can only see things with eyes half open and sore. all my personal belongings were gone along with anything else that has sentimental value, which suck the most. anything else i don't care but it feels like anything i hold dear and close to, or gifts that binded to you were lost. it was like a part of your heart was ripped off and it hurt so much. it took me about 8 months and on in therapy because i had trouble sleeping. it was very serious therapy treatment, twice a week, and not once a month. i could go on for days without sleep cuz i was scared i'd die in a fire for real this time. i couldn't get over all the mental images. i dropped out on all of BBQ parties. but going to therapy, i also talk to my therapist about ""that"", my gender dysphoria, and i was very emotional when we talked about it. it was almost bursting into tears everywhere, of all these feelings i have buried inside for such a long time, couldn't explain, nor share with anybody. the society that tried to shun me and deny who i am. ""that"" was a big dirty secret. ""that"" finally came out into light for the first time. it felt very relieved. 

my friend, H (not a real initial), offered me a place to stay after hearing about my fire accident. although i know he has no good intention since he had a crush on me when we first bumped into each other years ago on one of my travel trips. i was right. he still had a crush on me and it was super uncomfortable hanging out, let alone living under the same roof. i have my own room but he often ""visited"". i had to learn to close the door since. he always acted like we're together in front of his friends. while me bursting everywhere after that accident as well as my dysphoria, i felt very unstable. emotionally unstable. it's bad but good at the same time. i think that's one thing keeping H hands away from me.
  
i was in the middle of going into therapy at that time. so i decided to grab him with me. i wanted the crush to be gone and dead. it took probably just as long as my one-on-one session to get him through it. for him to understand we're supposed to be bros and him not wiggle his ding dong everywhere.  

we reached out to an immigrant lawyer to fix my status since the fraud company. the agency tried to cover their tracks to deport me. and this very lawyer turned out to be another fraud as well, a big one even :(( karma is a bitch. a friend i know from here turns out to be this lawyer's probation officer. although, we're not supposed to discuss anything outside of courts, but things here and there just ring a bell. so my friend decided to try and find a case that is similar and got her. the lawyer has 10 years+ on her and 3 lawsuits on top of it. i try not to focus on the person and just move on already. she took my money, and my time for over a year. she separated families and children. some of her clients have been deported but their kids are still stuck here. it's very heartbroken. compare to their situation, i was nothing. if i could help out, i would. but i could only send sympathy and prayers :(( i didn't pursue the real lawyer who owns that law firm. cuz she's actually a 61 yo hard-working woman, wants to work a few more years before retiring. cuz her husband has big medical bills. so she wanted to be comfy when she does retired. now with all this, she is already forced to shut down the firm that has been with her for a lifetime. i continued to feel trapped but there's nothing i could do about. i just moved on and left all the bads behind. 
 
as for my friend, H, he felt very guilty for referring me to that law firm. it was indeed a go to of the city. but we all got fooled. it was nothing we could do about. so i didn't blame him. though, he respected me more and kept a distance which is great. whatever happened, i just feel like i was very lucky that we caught the baddie. and that she would cause no more trouble. 

things started to get better, H called me with my prefer pronounce for the first time and never fail to do so in front of his friends. his friends started to get better with the pronounce as well. our friendship got strengthened. and he finally got over the crush for such a long time. i don't blame him cuz i was always a big tease :/ 

i started T and there's no turning back. i'm super duper happy. it's like every morning waking up, it's a happy day. weeeeeee. i can't even find the right words to describe it. i was just bathing in my own happiness. i've been on T for 1 year and 8 months now. all the happy days ^ - ^ i don't worry about passing too much because i already use male restrooms pre-T. and people use the right pronouns except for die hard Catholic friends of H. i don't blame them nor try to correct them cuz i just want to be friends and be happy. 

things started to turn interesting when my friend, H, has a gf, who actually nailed him instead of the other way around. we were all at a bday party and i was having so much fun, i got shit faced, so was the Uber driver supposed to drive us home. lol. so a friend called up another Uber and dropped me home while on her way home as well. but i sobered up and talked to my friends on the other side of the globe on the phone. H came home with O (not a real initial), and H has been refusing all night and made up excuses for at least 2 hours. but eventually he gave in. i bet he was just tired and sleepy. i would give in too cuz 2 hours blabbling is too much. you know drunk people talk really loud so you technically hear everything you don't wanna need to know :/ 2 weeks later, H opened up to me about his secret relationship. then i asked him if he had told his 2 best mates, and he was like nope. i was like wth? it just didn't feel right. O has been very nice to me. so i pushed H to make the relationship public to his close friends and the circle. eventually everything is published. 

i'm living at H place with his 2 dogs, a big house with 4 bed rooms, 3 bedrooms all to myself. his 2 kids are all grown up and about 8 years younger than me. they moved out cuz husband/job. H works all the time on the oil field, from 6am to about 5pm most days. mostly in the office but he also takes care of other things cuz his boss didn't wanna pay another. some days i don't even see him till 9pm if he has to travel from NM back and forth. i don't think H even care about his dogs. i mean yes and no, he just doesn't have the time and it's sad :( cuz days when i crashed and haven't slept the previous night, his dogs would be in the kennels all day. i love the doggos to death and they're like my little dirty children. heh. give them a bath for one min and they'd roll on the grass for hours getting dirty again :)

i don't have a job, which kills me. because i love working and i work very hard. i like to learn new things and ever be an Asian, everything else that is shut down by the society, now open up a new horizon in front of you. i like to be busy and i write a lot to kill spare time. i self taught myself Photoshop and was working as a freelance texture artist for awhile for an online game, making virtual items that sort of thing. until they shut down all resellers and that was the end of my ""freelance"". it was awhile ago. i don't know how to drive because i only ever ride scooters, and motorbikes. H is too busy to get me to do anything. he's so tired to the point he sleeps most of the weekends away. he doesn't get to hang out with his kids much either. i have a SSN like a normal legal person and it still works. but everything else here in West Texas is so freaking far away. you have to drive at least 40 mins to get to somewhere close. and that equals to a minimum of an hour and a half walking in 90+ degrees. i have heat strokes and i'd prefer not doing that. things will start swaying that i'd break down and have a semi heart attack. even before T, it's just a no no to me spending 2 hours ish in 90-100 degrees. walking and running is fine, but not in the heat. taxi company got shut down here for some shaddy reasons and so is Uber in this city. i couldn't feel more stuck. while Uber works in the closeby city. like why? 

i feel stuck big time like a ghost living in somebody's house and it's exactly what it is. H drops food a lot during the week. it's almost like you can fatten yourself within 2 weeks living here. he got 2 big fridges, and bought 1 more since the time i came just to store more food for me. but i'm just a skinny ghost. i get to see other people like a few times a year, or more on special occasions especially around Christmas and New Year. all my social activities are mostly through the internet now. it was funny comparing to my social activities before coming here. it's day and night. but i don't blame the situation. 

i'd perform public speeches about genders issues, transgenders, depression, and suicide awareness when my therapist asked me to. we have a very good relationship and she's more like my mentor, my big sister that i wish i had. i had a lot of fun doing that and felt very empowered. we did this panel discussion of ""Real Boy"" movie awhile back. it was great. this one: http://realboymovie.com  

if you haven't watched it, you should. it's a very emotional journey that i could relate to. and i think all of us could somewhat feel related to. speaking and spreading awareness as a trans man is something i honestly would love to do for the rest of my life. it's the feeling of doing something good for the others make you feel 10 times better. it's even better than taking T. it's like a pill of ectasy for a lack of words.  

now i figure out H's gf just being nice so i did the job for her, pushing H to make their relationship public. that and to clarify that me and H didn't date. we never dated anyways, but the way H acted around me misled his friends into thinking we did. i always made it clear but i think some still think we dated? i feel more like i'm doing this for myself rather than for O. i was actually happy that it was done and over with.  

O turned to be a snake and is a gold digger, i'm pretty sure. H talked about proposing for a marriage yesterday and i was shocked. he knows this person for only a few months, less than half a year, and she already jumped in headlights decorating the house, fixing stuff, moving things about, and bossing him around. the dogs don't like her. and you know dogs always have good feelings or senses about a person if they have a good/bad intention. i don't know if it makes sense :/ i'm in no such position to talk anything about O. but i do feel like my friend H deserver better. but the person in love is usually blinded. i don't want to destroy our friendship over O and i think both of his mates think the same. another thing is that 2 of his mates dated her before, very briefly. so brief to the point one of them dated her for 3 days and called it off. H is a very easy going guy between the 3. H said O didn't want to move in with him. she want them to sell both houses and get something better. whereas H is having job security at his company. they wanted to sell out fast, so all his stocks and bonuses may be gone soon. they give long time employee stocks to keep you. he didn't buy any of those. he's been working there for a long time so his stocks grew. he's been very stressful and you can tell it from the amount of booze consumed. the bottom line is O is pushing H to kick me out. and i broke down in my room last night after the talk. he didn't even want to look me in the eyes to say that. but at the same time you could sense how very uneasy he was and his phone wouldn't stop beeping from the texts. i just feel painful for both of us. i already helped me too much but i know i just stuck here if stay. but at the same time i has nowhere to move to :x

i already been trying to move out of H place but every time an opportunity rose up, my other friend got trapped by this and that, and we got nowhere. i know i could never repay the generosity H gave me, with or without a motive, it's still there you know. it's to the point i don't do much anything, nor eat any food cuz it costs money and i know he could do better without spending on me. while at the same time he's scared cuz the way i'm thinking i'd starve myself to death. i just feel very guilty by his generosity. i'm like his man maid, clean the house pristine, let doggos in and out, feed them and play with them. if he does laundry, i'd try to help with the folding and stuff. it's not necessary but as an Asian, we do little things that matter and show that we care. i guess? his friends love me a lot. they want my presence to the point if i don't show up to an event, everyone nagging H, and he was forced to blow up my phone, drove all the way back, talked to me via a closed door cuz i was smashing stuff in a game. lol. so i had to go. they care about me, you could tell via the attentive actions and i love them. they often send me homemade food, baked items and what not. i'm a big kid at heart. boy, i love sweets. i don't ask for anything nor want anything that costs H. i try to save up for special occasions to get him birthday gifts as well as his 2 children. i never fail to shower his kids with Christmas gifts. and they cherish me for it. they are small gifts but i know them well so it's the gifts that they always wanted but their dad could never read and gave it to them vibe. i almost feel bad for his kids but his work took over. so i don't mind being a ""step dad"". lol.

with the current state of O, i feel trapped like never before. i couldn't go back home cuz that means no T and it'd fuck up even more. i've been trying to move to my other friends in other states but bestie 1 has to work 3 jobs to handle her doctor degree cuz that's her passion while handling her mother and sister as a side dish. bestie 2 has an abusive husband and couldn't get out of the divorce. i already had to write letters and make phone calls to confirm how abusive both physically and emotionally her ex husband was and had to follow the case. i don't want to be any of a burden to them than i already am to H -.- 

a few friends of H own companies here but they're afraid to hire me cuz ""illegal"" immigrant status sliding across my forehead. and in the era of Trump, it feels like it's a death sentence. so i don't blame them either. but i swear i met worse, people who don't have a SSN at all, and still get things done. i of course don't want to do anything out of the way cuz i already feel guilty with H letting me stay. i don't want him to get accounted for anything else .-. so it's like being extra cautious for nothing. my SSN work cuz i still have my bank and everything up. i need to get out of here before i get crazy with all this happening. all i need is somewhere walking distance, so i could settle and gain the life supposed to be mine. then it goes back to the circle i don't have any friend i could move to, nor drive anywhere .-. and my finance is burning. 

i have an uncle living a few states away but his wife is very verbal abusive to me. she does have a mental issue and she likes to pick up on people. i forgot the name of it but my uncle is not good at English so he couldn't remember it. she has to take special meds from her doctor to calm her nerves and other meds that treat other stuff. she picked up on everyone in my family and hers too. all the back talking, stabbing and drama, i couldn't stand it when she touched my mom. so i screenshotted everything she sent to me, and blasted me far and wide to all my extended family and let them know her real color. somehow it got to her mom, and the poor woman had to call my mom to say sorry about her action, and send the sorries to me. ever since then my uncle and i fell out. i just don't want to contact him cuz he has to suck up to her until he gets his citizenship, we all know that. so he's not in any better state than i am, maybe worse. cuz if i do something harsh, i bet he's the one getting the bad end of the stick. she's a bit physical as well and no one would take his words that he got beaten you know. and i don't want it to happen cuz he's a very nice guy. a heartbreaker to the girls due to his good looking feature and style but deep down inside is still a nice guy. i'd rather  go homeless than come to him. i'm just stuck :/ 

i need to talk to my parents about this ""situation"". they're very supported of me since transitioning. i came out to them and it was very emotional. i talked to them often over the phone and we've never been this happy in our entire life. before then, i was just bursting and got angry everywhere. i don't know if you had this feeling/emotion. but now our relationship is improved a lot, by a big margin. i have to calm myself before i talk to them. i don't want to make them worry sick about me than they already are. at the same time, i can't stop bursting when i think about soon enough i won't have a place to live. i guess you could say it sucks to be me right now. and i did laugh at it in misery. lol. H didn't want to kick me but he already said what has to be said, according to O i guess. besides the crush that sometimes he could act out of his way, he's been super nice to me and he's more like a big brother more than anything. i'd become the first one he'd go to, then his 2 other mates. i'm just stressful with O. i don't want to deal with it anymore. the longer i live at H place, the longer and bigger the stress. i feel fake whenever i have to meet her.  

i have a very optimistic look about life. but stress is just stress. what do you suggest, my internet friends? what should i do? i used to feel trapped by ""that"", of my gender dysphoria. now being my own person, i feel trap of this society that puts me in this very situation in the first place. of all the twists, turns, and meanies out there, there's always karma. so i wouldn't worry too much about them. i can't seem to make up anything good or i just don't know the ways around now? i'm stuck in this endless circle. what would you do in my shoes? i'm 29, and i already experienced the highest lifestyle possibly i guess, everything from good jobs to beautiful gfs, to multiple abroad vacations, clubbing nightly, etc. now i couldn't be lower, soon i'd be a homeless too. my finance is already close to being zero cuz therapy fee twice a week for upward to a long time after the fire accident. i was trapped in a place for over 2 years with no way out. i don't think i'd take my own life cuz T makes it much better, i know it for sure. but the feeling of being trapped suck big time.  

take a stab at me, and let me know some advice or suggestions. i could really use a hug right now if i please can. thank you so much for reading this far over my wall of text .-. i know it's very long but it's hard to explain when everything is like playing connect the dots. sometimes strong men do cry and i really need a big one right now. i've been missing home, missing my parents, and my friends. it's just a never ending cycle for me. i can't think any better. so please, more thinking heads is better than one. i may have to go back to ""that"". or ""that"" of my gender dysphoria may come crawl back at me when all else is gone. if i could write a book about my life stories and interesting events happening since, i would, but my Engrish is not up to that and proofreading is hard. thoughts? :#"
75zigd,13,2017-10-12,Should I focus on increasing distance or speed?,_bumbleb33_,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/75zigd/should_i_focus_on_increasing_distance_or_speed/,"I am a busy full-time graduate student with an internship and part-time job so I have limited time I can dedicate to exercising these days! I used to run every day before I went back to school two years ago (and I’m in my last year now, yay!). 

Right now I am managing to run three days/week. Weight is not a concern for me although I could certainly benefit from toning up and losing a few lbs. I mostly make sure I am fitting it in as it helps me sleep and reduces stress/anxiety. I usually do about 2.5 to 3.5 miles, at roughly a 9 minute mile (not in great shape but the best I have been able to maintain). Would like to push myself more, and am wondering if you guys think I should keep my pace and work on running farther distance or if I should try to work on picking up the pace? 

I’ve never been a serious runner so not sure what is best for stress, anxiety, sleep, weight loss, etc. or if it is personal preference. Thank you!"
75zqd8,3,2017-10-12,Applying for internships after a spring 1L withdrawal,fivefivecacti,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/75zqd8/applying_for_internships_after_a_spring_1l/,"tl;dr  Completed 1 1L semester then withdrew for two semesters and now returning the following spring. How do I proceed with internship applications?

I think I have the pretty typical student that wasnt getting appropriate help with depression story. The depression made it difficult to focus on the first semester. The exam period was very difficult to get through. My grades took an almost linear drop from A to C based on their position in the exam schedule because I just couldn't get through it. I ended up in the bottom 20% of my class. Which only made the next semester more difficult. During the break I started a medication for the first time and it really did seem to help at first but the problems were all coming back and I wasnt getting the help I needed. After ranks were posted I became suicidal and my ability to work was non-existent. Just before the exam period I had a breakdown in front of my career adviser and told her everything. She took me to the dean and we worked out a plan. I withdrew from my classes. During the summer I moved in with my boyfriend (in a town away from my school) and my primary focus has been getting better and learning how to take care of and cope with depression. My doctors and I decided it would be best if I did not return for the fall. I needed more time to find the right medications and I just wasnt ready to return.   

I will be returning to classes in Jan and part of returning includes applying for next summer's internship. Has anyone experienced something similar with the delay that can provide some insight into how I should proceed? "
75zz9i,0,2017-10-12,Riot Press Conference,Jakethesnake1798,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/75zz9i/riot_press_conference/,"
Riot Tryndamere, High Lord and God of Riot games threw open the doors to the conference room, and took his seat in front of his diamond encrusted, gold plated microphone. To the rear of him sat an enormous, hand painted portrait of himself, along with several smaller portraits of names that had changed the face of League of Legends. Faker, Phreak, Cowsep, Hashinshin. Tryndamere made a mental note to have the custodians take down the portrait of Faker. He had not quite yet earned his spot on the wall.

Before Tryndamere sat an ocean of writhing, hungry, reporters. The recent shitstorm caused by Sanjuro had thrown the powers that be completely out of balance. Camera flashes and the stench of returned cigars along with other narcotics caused a smog like stench to hover over the crowd. They made Tryndamere sick. They were like d5 animals, finding fault in all but themselves. Even still, Riot games had a name to uphold, and he was the companies leader. He thought it best to make everything gucci. 

Tapping the microphone, Tryndamere called on the first reporter, a short, stout man, that looked quite like the EU caster who had, like Sanjuro, taken a ""break"" to step away and focus on his personal life. ""Krep"" something or other. ""Yes you in the front"" Said Marccy M, pointing.

""Tryndamere! What do you have to say about the recent outburst from LS insulting the entire hemisphere?"" Shouted the reporter, to which Funk Master M responded. ""LS had better watch himself, should he find himself back in the west, he'll find that they may end up showing him how well they can cut shit.""

Moving on to the next reporter, a tall, well kept man, he reminded Mercenary M of Rivington, with his neatly kept facial hair and polite way of speaking. ""Sir, what are your responses to the accusations from Fnatic Soaz about all top lane champs being, and I quote, ""Dog champs?"" Micky M winced at the question. Esports was becoming a bigger pain in Riot's side as of late. With rowdy professional players and organizations demanding more. They had just announced the release of *another* extra spooky Katarina chroma. What more did these animals want? 

""Soaz is entitled to his opinion, however wrong it is."" Nodded Master M, folding his hands. He wanted to get through this in one piece, but this conference was getting as draining as one of Gross Gore's spastic rants. ""Next question please."" Brought a new interesting point to light for the head of Riots Game. 

""What about the alleged post on reddit by /u/Papaya_Dreaming, stating that he was the script writer for LCS?"" To which Fuhrer Merril quickly responded with ""No comment. Next question."" The reporter who had asked the question was quickly escorted to the ""VIP"" section of the break room. 

""What about the rumors of Riot sending Tobias Fate pink eye in an envelope, like anthrax, to sabotage his climb back to challenger?"" To which The Supreme M responded with slammed hands on the sleek oak table. The room immediately quieted down at the sight of Big M's rage. It was fabled, and not seen by many, but the crowd fell silent. Suddenly, another brave reporter raised his hand.

""Yes?"" Snapped Miggity Merril, his gaze meeting the reporters mischievous eyes. He immediately felt regret as the reporters question lit a fire in the hearts of every man, woman, and alpha in the conference room.

""Are the rumors true? Will Tyler1 be freed come the new year?"" The conference room erupted in a wave of cheers and questions. Voices that grew louder and more unified pounded against Tryndamere's eardrums, beating him back momentarily. Regaining his composure, Tryndamere raised a hand, his malice being felt as far as the worlds bootcamps in Korea. ""As long as... the streamer in question. Can maintain an appropriate demeanor, he will be freed."" 

With that, reporters made a mad dash for the door. Falling over each other, it was as if the building was on fire. Trampling each other on their way out, it was a mad dash to print the stories. Whoever got back to their respective editor first would be made rich beyond their wildest imaginations, and the rift. Slumping down in his chair, Riot's god on earth let out an exhausted sigh. An intern suddenly appeared at his side, with the executive's next task for the day. 

""Sir, the meta is currently rampant. We need to do something about jungle Ezreal, or Janna still being far, *far* too mechanical to ever hope to master."" Marc waved a hand at the intern, shooing him away. ""Just come up with another Ahri skin, push the balance meeting to next week."" Merril stepped into his private, guilded elevator that led to his office, and dove into the mountain of cash that he had made from his brilliant idea of releasing another set of star guardian skins. He needed a nap.

760yty,9,2017-10-12,I miss having friends,anon_899,Incels,https://www.reddit.com/r/Incels/comments/760yty/i_miss_having_friends/,"Well, I had only a few friends in my life, I was a loner until the third year of high school (three years in my country), I sometimes talked and played vidya with some of the other losers. There was this guy who was an ego maniac asshole who thought I was his friend, only talked to me to when nobody want to talk with him, I mostly ignored him.

Also, the femoid who friendzoned me, she obviously was never my friend, I was her emotional tampon, when her older thug chadlite BF hit her or called her a bitch or some shit like that, I was there listening. I liked her, as a person, her personality etc., but looking back now, I know she was a shitty person for actually dating a dude like that guy.

In college, I was friends with this Chad, he is a good person, but he's a Chad, do we were not really compatible. Sometimes when we was at the campus, some girl went to say hi to him and completely ignored my existance (I guess they could smell my awful personality), but I was used to it already so that didn't actually bother me. After he got a internship I talked to him less often until I had to quit college due to lack of money/depression.

Being on this sub gives me a feeling that resembles of having friends, but it's not the same thing as having friends IRL.

Anyway, life is shit."
761fct,831,2017-10-12,[MF] I finally got the guy I work with.,slyglass,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/761fct/mf_i_finally_got_the_guy_i_work_with/,"So, I don't ever post stuff but I wanted to share. It's something that happened to me TODAY and I already masturbated to it once... the second I got home. 

I got an internship at a pretty cool company in the downtown of my city. It actually involved a lot of stuff that decidedly WASN'T interny. I only had to fetch coffee and and that stuff about 10 times... so that's pretty good for an intern.

This company is pretty prestigious, and the dress code is pretty strict. The guys are in suits for the most part, which is something I find REALLY attractive. Like, stupidly so. The very first day I started on this internship, there was a younger guy closer to my age that pretty much was the first person I saw. We rode the elevator up together and made small talk. It sounds cliche and all that stupid stuff, because I didn't even really work that closely with him or his department, but I was immediately attracted to him.

He didn't do anything crazy sexy when we first met. I just remember him having a really good smile, laughing a lot, and he complimented my outfit. Which I still remember to this exact day, obviously. (maroon pants, brown boots with a one inch heel, a flowy white shirt coupled with a blue blazer and a ridiculously stupid and large necklace from some cheap China knock off company. His name is/was Joe, he shook my hand and welcomed my to the company and was gone. I remember that after this stupid little interaction I was really worked up and wet. I felt stupid, and really horny from this one encounter.

Anyways. First, second, third, and fourth day went really well. I seen Joe all around the office and he'd always smile at me or say some stupid joke that probably wasn't as funny as I thought. After a couple weeks of my six week long internship he got comfortable enough that he'd be touchy when he was talking. One time, he came up to the copier (so cliche I know) and greeted me with his hand on my lower back. He said ""Ann your whole outfit is perfect today,"" grabbed his copies and walked off.

I used my vibrator to get myself off for hours that night. I wasn't responding to text messages, I skipped dinner, and I accomplished nothing. I just lay in bed and got myself off. I took a bunch of pictures and videos and that made me even hornier, because I was fantasizing about sending them to Joe and thinking about him getting them and jerking off... it was a vicious cycle.

I of course never sent the photos because that would be stalker level crazy girl... so we carry on.

The rest of the summer pretty much went like this. He'd say something, or make a joke, or tease me a bit about something, and I'd tease him back, or tell him he looked smashing that day. Ridiculous stuff. Everyone must have known. An entire 6 weeks of sexual tension that, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get out of my system on my own.

Okay. We're at today now. My LAST DAY with the company. Obviously Joe has my number at his point, because I'm so desperate for him that I gave it out hoping for a late night booty call. Anyways, I get a text from him -- not really that weird, since we would usually text a bit during the slow days -- and all it says is ""You look so fucking hot today, Andrea.""

This was beyond any of the sort of compliments he had given me. I pretty much soaked my panties right then and there. Also — I'm not 'fixing the punctuation in post' or whatever. He actually texts full sentences. It drives me wild. I'm such a weirdo. So there I am, going on a 5 month dry spell and this super hot guy in a suit just texted me how good I look. I swear I squirmed in the chair a bit and even that felt good. So, being a horny girl who's masturbating every night to this guy, with sweaty palms, I text back. ""You should see the outfit I have on under the blouse and skirt... ;)"" Yup. With the dumb winky face. And obviously I have something sexy on underneath. I've been alternating every piece of sexy underwear I have every single day. I have on my best bra and panties. 'Fuck me from behind and pull my hair' undies.

So, no response, and I get up to grab a coffee. He's in the break room. My heart is pounding. It's just the two of us. He smiles that goddamn perfect smile at me.

""So, what color is it?"" he asks.
""What color is what?""
""Your underwear."" I swear my cheeks must have blushed to the point of lighting on fire. I obviously couldn't believe this was happening.
""Bright red.""
""Show me.""
""Here?"" I mean, even a horny Ann has limits.
""Meet me in the supply room in five."" And then he walked out. And smacked my ass. I was so fucking wet. I knew I was going to get fucked in that supply room.

The supply room is actually down a floor, in a weird sort of 'old office' area. I mean, it's not empty, but there's certainly fewer people down here. The gremlins. That's what we called them. I snuck down to the floor below and made a beeline for the supply room. It was empty.

It felt like hours. I was so wet, and horny, I was pretty much ready to just start getting myself off. Then the door opens. Joe steps in. 

""Take off your blouse."" Just like that. No preamble. I was so ready to go. I unbuttoned slowly... made him wait for it. I was just finishing the last button when he was pressed up against me, pressing me against the wall. His hands slipped into my open blouse, wrapped around my waist. Pulled my close.

I could smell his cologne. It smelled really really good. I let out a moan, and didn't even realize why. Until I felt his hands moving up my back. Unhooking my bra. I grabbed at his belt, but he moved my hand away. I wanted it so bad. He bit my neck, and moved across my collarbone. It felt so good. 

I tried his belt again, and this time he let me. I could feel how hard he was through his dress pants. He hand his hands on my breasts, rubbing a thumb back and forth over my nipple. I was moaning uncontrollably at that point. I finally got his pants down. He hiked up my skirt. Slid my panties off. They were predictably soaked. I could see him looking at them. 

""You're a little nympho aren't you?"" he asked. I nodded. Felt his hand move between my legs... up my thighs. It was so fucking slow. He pushed me up on the table that had the laminator and all that shit. He kept teasing me, and I loved and hated every second. I remember him whispering, ""I'm going to fuck your brains out."" The classics are a classic for a reason. Because that was doing it for me. His hand finally pressed against my wet lips, slid across them, right up to my clit. I probably could have came right then and there, but that was it. He stopped. Pulled me off the table. Turned me around.

I bent over. He grabbed my hips and pulled me close to him. I could feel his cock, solid against my thigh. I don't even remember thinking, I just grabbed it and guided it in. It felt so good I let out a gasp and remember just saying ""fuuuuuucccckkk.""

He started thrusting. Faster and faster. He reached around and grabbed my breasts again, pinching the nipples hard. It felt like a shock through my body. So good. I was moaning in pleasure. Not sure how loud. He must have noticed though. Because he reached up and tried to cover my mouth. I started sucking on his finger instead. I could feel him going even faster. He liked that. I kept going, but I couldn't keep it in. I just wanted to scream. He grabbed something and shoved it in my mouth. It was my panties. Swear to god. I've never experienced something so hot in my life. As fucked up as that sounds.

Panties sufficiently deafening my moans, he grabbed my hair and pulled. I arched my back. Started backing my ass into him at the same time as he thrust into me. And just like that, I came. It was a great fucking orgasm. A shaking leg, he had to hold me up sort of orgasm. Me moaning through the panties about how fucking amazing it was sort of orgasm.

""I'm close,"" he told me. That was my cue. I spun around and got down on my knees and took his cock into my mouth. Tasted myself on him. That just made me excited again. As I sucked, I made sure to trace little circles against his tip with my tongue. It didn't take long. I massaged his balls with my fingertips as he came in my mouth and then swallowed.

It was a bit awkward cleaning up, but I was honestly so satisfied that I must have seemed high. He asked me a couple times if I was alright. I just said something stupid like ""best last day EVER.""

I went upstairs, finished a few projects, and said goodbye to everyone. Obviously Joe had the biggest shit eating grin on his face when we said goodbye. Everyone in the office probably knew. They probably could feel the sexual tension the entire 6 weeks. Oh well. 

So I got home, masturbated, and wrote this up. Mostly for myself and my diary, but thought it might be good enough to post for you guys. Sorry about spelling and grammar errors. I'm a bad girl.

761iaw,2,2017-10-12,My aunt is coming here from Puerto Rico and I wish she wouldn't.,iamsaltedpeanuts,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/761iaw/my_aunt_is_coming_here_from_puerto_rico_and_i/,"Maybe that's not how it should be phrased ... I want her and my other family to get the help they need. She's my dad's sister. But I fucking hate her. Every time she's come to visit us, it's been longer than what she originally said. When I was younger, she verbally, physically, and emotionally abused me. I always ran to my parents crying whenever she wasn't around because I was terrified of her and the things she did.

She's stolen from us. Every time she comes here it's basically like she lives here and she changes everything around in the house. My dad sends her money every month for food and bills, and then always asks for more because apparently it's not enough. My parents are both retired. My mom just recently got a part-time job within the last week just to support us again. My mom said my aunt's stay here is going to be indefinite. My dad's trying to look for an apartment for her here and we all fucking know who's gonna be paying for that bullshit. I'm honestly afraid my aunt is going to tear us apart ... especially since my dad always takes her side.

The past few months in this home have not been great financially. I can only work two days right now as I have a required internship which is unpaid and three days a week. I have class two days a week. I have no time. None of my friends understand and get annoyed with me. My SO doesn't understand that I can't see him as often as I want because he lives a fucking bridge away and that means I have to pay tolls on top of gas which I can't fucking afford at the moment. I can't even afford a decent lunch where I'm interning.

I have so much fucking work to do for school as this is my last semester and not enough days in the fucking week to do my work. I just got home from my internship an hour ago, I'm going to bed in another hour so I can wake up early tomorrow and do this shit all over again.

My brother's fiance is really pissing me off right now too because she's blasting music at 9 fucking 15 night and I can hear it through my fucking soul. This shit is every night and I can't concentrate on my homework.

When I can start working more than two days again, I just wanna move the fuck out of here but I know if I leave, my parents are through. I don't know what to fucking do. I'm just ranting about bullshit now and being extremely selfish about this whole situation. I really feel bad for all of my family in PR. But I wish she wasn't the one fucking coming. Anyone but her."

Forgive me for the wall of text that's coming.

A little about me: I just turned 30 this year. I'm a current second-year MBA candidate at a top 10 US program. I successfully recruited into Big4 consulting and when I graduate, I'll be making a hefty chunk of change (this is more self-deprecating as I really don't think I'm worth the salary I'm going to be paid).

I say all of the above with complete humility. I don't mean to brag but I mean to paint how incredible a life I have, and I fully understand that, and I'm truly grateful for the opportunities I have. Getting into a T10 MBA is already hard, and getting a consulting gig is at any one of them is even harder (for reference: at my school, half of my class goes for consulting, but about a third of those interested actually get consulting gigs).

That all said, I can't help but feel like I'm lost and wandering. Since my summer internship ended, I've been drinking and partying myself into oblivion. I rationalized it as ""this is my last chance at fun before I graduate back into the real world"". But the truth is: I don't think I'm happy and I don't know what a normal baseline looks like anymore.

I've been analyzing and thinking through what I want and I think it always comes down to the fact I've been single. This has been compounded by the fact my friends (younger and older) have all begun settling down, and I can't help but feel left out. What's more is as an Asian (Chinese) male, I can't help but feel inferior to other guys when it comes to dating. Online dating has certainly not made it easier, especially when you look at the stats behind response rates for Asian men.

I'm sitting here in my apartment, fully aware I have an incredible life ahead of me. Yet I can't help but have this nagging thought in the back of my mind that no matter what I do, I'm never going to be good enough.

Any thoughts would be useful."
762d5b,149,2017-10-13,Matchmaker the birth crasher,runravengirl,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/762d5b/matchmaker_the_birth_crasher/,"As my middle child (D2’s) birthday approaches, birthday party plans abound and I’m reminded of her actual date of birth, which of course reminds me of Matchmaker. TL; DR at the end. 

When D1 was born, Matchmaker and I were still on mostly good terms. She’d only occasionally pulled some BEC stunts or made a few mostly-minor PA comments, and I happily invited her into the delivery room. FF a few years, and I’m not at all interested in this woman having a full court view while I push out a tiny human. I’m scheduled for an induction, and make it known that I want only XH (then H) and my stepmom in the room. SM wasn’t there for D1’s birth, so while there’s some major CBF, I surprisingly get no pushback on the matter. 

Now, I have issues with anesthesia in general, but local anesthetics don’t work for me at all. The older I get, the less effective they become. My epidural with D1 took the edge off nicely, but never gave me the full dead leg it should have. The problem had gotten much worse, and the anesthesiologist, my OB, and the nurse assigned to me were all aware. We had a plan to work through different types of locals to see if we could get any to work. I arrive, get my pitocin, and immediately get my epidural. SM is on her way, my legs feel a little numb, and we’re cautiously optimistic it will work. Nurse is going to take an early lunch, I send XH to the cafeteria to grab breakfast, and wait. Within 15 minutes, I feel contractions ripping through me like I’m in hard labor. I call the nurse, and ask for the anesthesiologist....but my nurse is at lunch, and this nurse doesn’t believe me that the epidural isn’t working and that she’s supposed to call her right away. She also doesn’t believe I can possibly be in hard labor yet, as my pitocin drip is less than an hour old. 40ish minutes of me frantically pressing the call button for her to come back before SM walks in, horrified to find me sweating, panting, and sobbing. She calls XH, who is in the cafeteria still, and he comes running up....with Matchmaker right behind him. My nurse saw him run out of the cafeteria and is right behind him; she loses her shit on replacement nurse, who clearly didn’t read my chart, and calls anesthesiologist. 

She checks me while we wait and panics. I’m dilated to 10 and my contractions are basically just one big contraction with occasional pauses. Anesthesiologist can’t do anything except give me narcotics at this point, and my labor is happening so fast that it really isn’t even safe. They yank my pitocin drip, my doctor comes running in and yells that anyone who isn’t supposed to be here should get out. My vision is going blurry and I literally thought I was dying I was in so much pain. Heart rate monitors are beeping way too fast, my poor stepmom (who had a scheduled c section and has never even seen anyone in labor before, except my early labor with D1) is listening to me tell XH to tell my girls how much I loved them while my doctor curses and the anesthesiologist is apologizing and injecting me with whatever she has to try to calm me down and mitigate any pain at all, mean nurse is in the hallway being yelled at for ignoring a patient request, and I start screaming that I’m on fire. Of course that means she’s crowning, and the doctor looks around and yells “EVERYONE NOT IN THE BIRTH PLAN GET OUT!” Awesome nurse holds my hand, the interns (who I left out until now, sorry—teaching hospital) step forward, anesthesiologist tells me it’s almost over, and I push....and just as the pain goes away, I sigh a “thank you” to the anesthesiologist, hear my daughter fill her lungs, I open my eyes to see Matchmaker push her way past SM and the interns to scream “Ohhh my baaaaby!” 

I should be staring at my beautiful baby girl, but instead all I see is a Matchmaker-shaped red fog and my stepmom meekly stepping back to get out of everyone’s way. I was seething, and my doctor wasn’t much less angry when he realized she’d taken advantage of the chaos to stay where she knew she wasn’t invited. I wish I could remember everything that happened next, but we’ll have to FF to things being a bit more calm, and awesome nurse is helping me clean up. I say I need to go to the restroom, and she gently suggests a catheter in case any of the anesthesia is affecting me so I don’t fall. I say no, I can definitely feel everything....so Matchmaker, holding my fucking child, pipes up “You know, you really should listen to doctors and nurses, they’re doing what’s best for you.”  I kept eye contact with her while I flung my bloody blankets at her feet, stood up and marched to the bathroom unaided, did my business, washed my hands, and got back in bed. Awesome nurse took D2 from her and told her she should probably get some coffee. MM doesn’t drink coffee. “Get some water then. Outside.” More CBF, but I didn’t see MM for the rest of the time in the LD room, or for a few hours after we were in the recovery ward. Awesome nurse must have gotten busy and forgot to tell her we were all settled in...

TL; DR: Matchmaker weasels her way into the birth room and then lectures me about listening to medical professionals, so my nurse dismissed her and makes her wait in the lobby for hours after we were accepting visitors. 

For those wondering, D2 was delivered less than four hours after we set foot on the L&amp;D ward, just over three hours after they started my pitocin drip. I was “barely at 1” when we arrived. I do not recommend fully dilating and birthing a baby with no pain relief in less than three hours, if you want to look back at the memory with any sort of fondness. "
762hxd,12,2017-10-13,kvikerdragen's Introduction (Long and Probably Triggering),kvikerdragen,proED,https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/762hxd/kvikerdragens_introduction_long_and_probably/,"Hey everyone!  I've been lurking for a couple weeks, and just started posting earlier today, so I figured I ought to introduce myself here.  (Also the Discord activity-gated me so, you know)  
&amp;nbsp;  
So starting with a little of the general life-stuff:  
     I'm 21 (Just noticed my personal flair says 22...  My birthday in November and I continually forget that I'm quite not there yet).  
     I'm a Junior at university (A little behind where I should be for my age, but life has a habit of getting in the way) and am studying Actuarial Science.  
     I live with my younger brother and his wife (More on them later).  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
And an overview of my history:  
&amp;nbsp;  
     My dad was super emotionally abusive (And domestically violent) so as one would expect I developed a host of mental health issues as I grew up.  We (Meaning me, my older brother, and my younger brother, although I'm the only one who developed food issues) would frequently be denied dinner as children if we misbehaved or, for one example, trivial things such as our fingernails weren't clean (If you're a 6-year old with a sandbox in your backyard and your fingernails are clean all the time then I'm pretty impressed).  So that's the likely beginning of the whole overarching ""Food is a privilege"" thing that sets the stage for everything else.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     My first girlfriend (8th grade) made a comment at some point that I could stand to lose some weight.  A general part of my family culture was that we spent a lot of time eating together and playing games at dinner and stuff, so as a result we ate a lot of food--because we enjoyed it, and because we enjoyed the company.  Until that moment, I had never paid active attention to my eating, and it basically flipped a switch in my mind to be aware of myself.  I didn't count calories, and I wouldn't consider myself to have ""actively"" restricted at that time, but I dropped from 150pounds to 130pounds over a month or two just because I wasn't eating as much (My height was the same as it is now, 5'6.5"").  My dad made a comment that I ""was looking anorexic.""  I cried over it, because I wasn't trying to lose weight (Or at least, I didn't think I was) and I felt horrible that I was disappointing him (Don't worry I was plenty of a disappointment already, despite being obviously his favorite child--nothing I did could have made him happy).  
&amp;nbsp;  
     My weight fluctuated from around the same 150pounds to 130pounds for the next three years, just sort of cycling.  In 11th grade I had a different girlfriend, and things with her were great for the first few months (Honeymoon phase or whatever).  As we became more comfortable around each other though, I learned she had an eating disorder.  It's sort of important to note here that I had basically no knowledge of eating disorders at this point, and despite my ""passive"" restricting behavior for the last three years had never considered using eating (Or rather, not eating) as a coping mechanism.  I started counting calories in October, on a marching band trip.  Learning the calories in an egg made me almost cry.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     Things went downhill from there.  My restricting got worse basically overnight.  I had been at 150pounds (A fair amount of that was muscle at that point thanks to marching with a tenor sax, although I was still porky enough...) and I dropped to about 120pounds by early November.  My girlfriend and I fed off each other's behavior, and our relationship got pretty rocky.  Eventually her mom (Who knew what was going on) came to my house and told my dad (Who had figured out what I was doing, but made no effort to stop me).  I sat in the enclosure where we kept my rabbit while he talked to my girlfriend's mom on the porch.  When they finally finished, he came in and just looked at me, disappointment and anger clearly written on his face.  I can't remember what he said, but I felt like complete garbage.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     We went to my general practitioner soon after that.  They weighed me, measured my height, took some blood, ran whatever tests, the usual.  Turns out my restrictive behavior over the past couple years stunted my growth.  I was perfectly on track to grow to 5'10"", but hadn't grown a bit since 8th grade (And still haven't and won't).  Other than that my weight was low and some of the levels in my blood were low (Glucose was very low is all I can really remember) but I wasn't in any danger or anything (I mean that was obvious...  I still weighed 120pounds).  We went home, and my dad continued to be disappointed in me.  I tried to eat better for him over the next couple weeks, and succeeded in forcing food into myself, but mentally was struggling.  My dad dragged his feet super hard trying to find me a therapist, our relationship got progressively worse, my sleep got terrible, and everything basically just went to shit.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     November 19, 2012, I ""ran away"" from home.  My intentions were to send a wake-up call to my dad, and to be found the next day (I only drove to school and even parked in my assigned spot).  Turns out everyone took it super seriously and I was filed as a missing person.  Unfortunately for me, at 3am that night my mom found me.  My relationship with my mom wasn't very good at that point, and I certainly did not want to live with her.  Despite that internal understanding on my part though, she took me to her house.  The next day, she took me to file a restraining order against my dad.  In my incredibly exhausted, defeated, and hopeless state, I went along with whatever they asked me and allowed myself to be coerced into answering leading questions that tried to make my dad look bad.  I knew my relationship with him at this point was over.  I would never be able to go back to him.  Because neither of my parents are particularly good at parenting, my mom decided it would be perfectly okay to allow me to borrow the car that afternoon and do whatever I wanted.  That was the first time I thought very strongly of suicide.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     My eating slowly recovered, to an extent, over the rest of that school year.  I got progressively more depressed, but I guess I reached that point where you're too depressed to eat or something, because I stayed around 130pounds for the rest of the year.  Truthfully I don't remember much of it.  I started seeing a therapist for the depression, with a side note of the eating disorder.  I earned an Anorexia diagnosis, but not really any treatment for it besides doing a food log for a while until I got sick of it.  In May 2013, I was sent to my general practitioner for anti-depressants (I couldn't get in to a psychiatrist or something, I dunno).  They asked all the routine questions, and I answered honestly.  They asked the question about suicidality or having a plan, and I was unfortunately too naive to know to lie.  I wasn't actively suicidal, but I had a flawless plan.  I was hospitalized for it.  My eating got worse again in the rigidity of inpatient for the week I was there, and the drastic change threw me off for several weeks after returning to the real world.  I was also diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder during my stay.  My girlfriend and I broke up soon afterwards, after 14months together.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     That summer, I was incredibly fortunate and got to attend summer courses at Harvard University (Across the country from where I live).  The whole experience was incredible, and I have many fond memories from it.  Unfortunately, being alone and friendless for the first time in my life, I turned to restricting to cope with it all.  I confided in my RA, but she wasn't very helpful--sweet as she was.  Fortunately for me, I overcame my eating struggles several weeks later--except I replaced them with cutting after my ex contacted me, telling me she was seeing an older guy.  The cutting got pretty bad pretty fast.  I won't go into detail about that.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     Things were pretty calm for the most part after I came home.  I continued to get progressively more depressed, but calmed down with the destructive behaviors for a while.  Senior year started, made things worse, and just generally cause problems (I was valedictorian, and if keeping that while juggling everything else in my life isn't a stressor then I don't know what is).  I fell into old habits, and ended up being hospitalized for self-harm on November 14, 2013.  My eating struggled again.  They released me on the 22nd, because they couldn't hold me any longer (My birthday was the next day, and I would be turning 18, meaning they could no longer hold me in adolescent inpatient).  They told me to my face that they didn't know how to help me any more.  The good news is I've been clean of self-harm since the day I was hospitalized.  The bad news is that I was completely hopeless.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     I intentionally overdosed on November 31.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     When I was released from the hospital three days later, it was under the condition that I attend DBT therapy.  They decided hospitalizing me for a third time wasn't going to do any good, so I may as well try the therapy designed to treat the Disorder that everyone had been avoiding admitting that I had (There is a crazy amount of stigma against Borderline people, and admittedly we are pretty hard to treat).  My life turned around with this therapy.  I had initially been very skeptical, but I gave it a shot, and things improved a lot in my life.  I still had my share of struggles, but I could certainly say I recovered a whole lot.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     Fast forward three years, to August 2016, I'm in the process of moving several hours away to attend university with my younger brother.  University in my home town wasn't treating me very well, and despite having a solid job I felt I would be doing better emotionally if I got away from my mom.  So I moved, and things seemed to be looking up--all except that I was no longer seeing the therapist I had come to trust and depend on.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     At this point, I was at my high weight of 182pounds.  It mortified me to know I weighed so much, but I attributed it to my mom bringing home takeout super often (And just having no control over food being given to me in general) and being super sedentary in general.  One of my main goals when I moved out was to regain control over food and eat more healthy.  And honestly, for the first semester, my brother and I did very well.  I did (As I still do) all the cooking (Which just means dinner every night) for us, since it was something that I had always loved doing but had stopped doing since I left my dad.  I regained that control I longed for, but did it in a largely healthy and productive manner, and lost some weight as a result.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     Second semester is where things once again started downhill.  My brother was away at an internship for the first 8weeks, so I was completely alone for all of Winter break and the first quarter.  I decided to finally take the opportunity to try Keto, to ultimately great ""success.""  I dropped to 140pounds pretty quickly, but managed to develop a moderate fear of carbs that I still carry.  At some point, I decided to step it up a notch and try intermittent fasting as well, which brought me down to 130pounds.  My brother and his then-fiance came back around the time I hit 130, and my specialized eating got interrupted, so I stopped losing for the remainder of the semester (And probably put a few pounds back on as well).  I knew at this point that my eating was becoming disordered again, but it wasn't at an unmanageable point, so I was largely unworried.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     This summer came and went quickly, and largely in a blur.  I came out of the summer still weighing 130, still jobless, and getting progressively more depressed again.  I settled back into the schedule, no longer able to maintain Keto since I had to cook for my brother and his now-wife (Who are basically children) but I cut my intake of food back to only eating dinner on most days.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     At the end of the summer, and for the first month or so of the school year, I had been talking to--and even visited--that same ex of mine.  Then, eventually, we got in a fight and she abandoned me.  I don't know if that shattered my already cracking mind or just opened a door where I felt justified in ""misbehaving,"" but I've proceeded down the restricting road pretty aggressively since then.  I found a love of broth, a comfort in standing up and nearly passing out, and as of very recently an excitement in sugar-free things.  
&amp;nbsp;  
     I'm down to 121.6 as of this writing, and well on my way to my goal of 118 (Which will officially put me underweight).  After that I'm headed for 111, which will put me at an officially anorexic BMI and will finally validate me (Despite already having the diagnosis).  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
In closing, I apologize for how long this ended up being.  I have more that I could share--some on topic and rant-y, and some off topic--but I'll save that for another time.  I didn't come into this expecting to bear everything to the internet, but I guess I felt I really needed to share my story.  I hope at least some of you relate (Sort of at least...  I don't want anyone to have to suffer in the ways that I have, but if you have I hope it helps that you're not alone) and I look forward to getting to know this community better over time.  I've missed having a group of people to relate with."

763ctd,0,2017-10-13,"M4f - If my mind were any dirtier, my brain would pop in an explosion of jizz (Subtitle, I have a dirty mind?)",DPPviking,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/763ctd/m4f_if_my_mind_were_any_dirtier_my_brain_would/,"As the title suggests, I have an incredibly one track mind and right now it's getting a little too much to bear!  I'm sat at work and needing to write this to get some of my thoughts out of my head in hope it will relieve a little of the pressure.
So there are a few random thoughts that could prompt lascivious, enjoyable conversation or a dirty roleplay!

**Get White'd (like get blacked but with a white guy!)**

I'm a white guy who has always had a big thing for Latinas and Asian girls. Maybe it's because they are different - most girls I chat to or have dated are white - or maybe it's because they are exotic. All I know is I love brown skin, exotic features, even a little raceplay and I know for a fact some of you have a big thing for white guys!

I am well built - 6ft with broad shoulders, a slim waist and very muscular and athletic. I have short dirty blonde hair and beard and most importantly, I am quite dominant.

If you want to take this further and add the race play factor then I'm sure we can work it in. But it's not mandatory!




**So your mom did porn!?**

A simple premise to a fun scene with a multitude of possibilities! My character finds out that your mum did porn (either in college or later on in life; just a one-off or a few; etc we can decide on those details together). Naturally as a good friend I decide to tell you about it - this is purely because I want you hearing it from someone you have known since kindergarten and trust, rather than a complete stranger. I want to save you the embarrassment and shock of someone else showing you in public and you being humiliated in front of a group of people. Well, that and the fact that the just thought of how you might react is making me hard, the vision of watching even just a little of it enough to make my balls ache. Ok, so maybe it's not because I'm a good friend, maybe I'm telling you because I'm a perv who has already jacked off to it multiple times and because I quite enjoy putting hot girls like yourself in awkwardly lascivious situations!

(kinks - mild humiliation, porn watching, awkward situations, potential between MC and YC or YC's mother, plus many more)


**I just love to be inappropriate!  Especially around innocent or slightly prudish ladies!**

I've always felt that if a thought appears in my head - especially when it is essentially a compliment! - that I should just say it.  People have said that there is no filter between my head and my mouth, but that's not true.  There is a filter.  I just choose not to use it.  

This often results in me giving compliments that people may find mildly to incredibly inappropriate.  For example, a colleague yesterday was wearing a new skirt.  Someone commented in the usual way that it looked very nice.  Whereas I told her that her ass looked amazing in it and if she was going to wear that to work everyday, I will get no work done as I would spend my entire week staring at her ass.

I especially love saying this to ladies who are incredibly likely to blush or be taken completely out of their comfort zone by it.  For example ladies that are not particularly sexually open or liberated.  I just love seeing how it makes them react

**A pornstar in the office!**

The office is generally very boring. People here don't hate Mondays because of the stress their job gives them. They hate Mondays because it's the start of another work week of mind melting monotony. Dull, tedious work that seems to transcend the very concept of time. 

But this week there's something new. Something different. A new starter who seems somewhat mysterious. He's tall, around 6'2 and while he's only averagely attractive with his blonde hair and beard, he's built like someone who would look more happy swinging an axe around on a battlefield somewhere. Broad shoulders, muscular arms and chest fill out his plain work shirt to the point of it stretching. While his plain black trousers must have been specially made to fit round thighs that more resemble tree trunks than legs. 

There's talk going around too, spreading through the air like a virus without a host. 

'Former prisoner, 'once killed a guy'.

'Don't be silly, we don't hire ex cons. No, I reckon he's a failed sports star'

'Janine says he was in a couple of films'

'I've not seen him in anything! Are you sure?'

'That's because he was in porn. Hung like a gifted horse apparently!'

'No way! Bullshit!'

'why not send in the intern. Find out the truth!'

The girls snigger before approaching you. You've not worked here long but all the time you've been dying to be brought into the circle of trust. It wasn't hard for them to get you to agree to do his induction...

((So I'm trying to set up a rather awkward interaction between my character, a former male pornstar who has taken to working in an office to try to get a real job. And your character, an innocent, naive intern who has very little sexual experience and would certainly never have watched porn))

763g62,94,2017-10-13,The r/actuary Effect?,calculatorcarried,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/763g62/the_ractuary_effect/,"People often ask: Why do you want to be an actuary?

For me, it's because of r/actuary. WARNING: Apologies for the long emotional post.

2 years ago I fell deep in severe depression. Didn't do anything with my days besides eat and try to find a reason to see another day. Food and alcohol were my only sources of happiness. I quit my part-time work, I dropped out of school, and I had no plans of the future. Every bit of my identity was wrapped up in impostor syndrome, believing I was never cut out to do the things expected of me. I had no intentions of seeing a career for myself.

12 months ago, I found myself still shutting myself in, away from the real world, playing video games and my social interaction was from joining online communities: discord, reddit, etc. I'd pretend I was unavailable IRL if anyone wanted something from me. But the truth was, I was just too afraid to face reality. I'd go weeks without leaving my room. Not sure how I survived.

6 months ago, the relationship between me and my parents got a little less rocky. Because of it, I thought I could try again at everything I gave up on. Shortly, I fell even deeper and harder into depression. After trying and failing harder at being an active, productive person, it certainly took a toll on my emotional and mental health. I thought that was my final push, and that I had failed miserably.

Over the past 6 months of ups and downs, I've been lurking r/actuary. As I read posts and comments here, the actuarial career really started sounding like a good fit for my interests. I learned about the exam process, and although I knew it was a long way away from where I was in my life, I figured I owed you guys an honest attempt at it. I decided to sign up for Exam P and give it my all.

In July I managed to pass P. I had an internship interview last week. I'm actually going back to school next semester, and I'm starting to believe I can finish my degree. I joined my school's actuary club and met some amazing people already, chipping away at my recent anti-social tendencies. Today I passed FM. Next up, MFE in November. My entire lifestyle is built around a newfound confidence and sense of self-fulfillment.

None of this would've happened if I hadn't found comfort checking reddit and reading discussion and debates here. The community here was so open and welcoming. You could've easily focused on your own self-improvement but instead decide to take the time to explain pathways and concepts, and even answering silly trivial questions from newbies. That gave me hope and reason to try my best to continue it forward, and better myself so I can one day help others as well. You guys made such an impact on my life, and so I really want to say thanks.

I love you all so much. Best of luck to all of you out there grinding and bettering yourselves as actuaries or simply as a person. Remember that people really do care about you and want to see you succeed."

765dnn,4,2017-10-13,Coming for an internship in consulting - some questions and all tips welcome,interestedplayer,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/765dnn/coming_for_an_internship_in_consulting_some/,"Hi guys,

Im from the UK (studying in London) and coming over for a four month internship in a consulting firm starting in the new year. Have only been in Dubai while getting out of an airplane during a layover for like 5 hours so little to no experience.

First of all how much would be reasonable to spend for a bedroom for myself for short term? I have been seeing some stuff around 1.5k USD (5500 AED) pcm...is that reasonable? (My salary will be a little over 20k AED pcm, and I would like to come out having saved something to have to spend over the summer).

Also, where is the best place to look for short term accomodation? Should I just look on Airbnb? For London there are websites like gumtree where you can specifically find people who want short term sublets, is there something like that?

Where is a good place to make some new friends as someone young? 

Is there anything you yourself would have liked to know coming into Dubai?

Lastly, one small question, I myself quite enjoy some gambling action, of which there obviously is loads in London, what is there in terms of that in Dubai? Are there live poker games and stuff like that?

Thank you for your responses, definitely appreciate them.

765kqg,9,2017-10-13,Summer Troubles NEED HELP,MarchOrInternship,drumcorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/drumcorps/comments/765kqg/summer_troubles_need_help/,"Hey Guys,

I am here today to talk about something that's a really big stress source in my life, and I need your input.

**Do I march my age-out year or return to my internship?**

Here's some background information:

I am 20 years old (age-out 2018)
I am a Junior at university where I am studying to be an actuary (Temple U., Philadelphia)
I play the Mellophone
I marched with the Cadets in 2016, and over the '17 summer, I had an internship with an insurance company.

So here we go:

I am having issues deciding what to do for my 2018 summer. Do I march my age out or do I go back to my internship? That's the big question.


First:

For any of you understand the insurance/actuary industry, will I lose my competitive edge if I only have one internship on my resume? (I am sitting for P and FM before May, and I have a 3.44 cumulative GPA) Will not having two internships (at the same location) be critically harmful to my career? I understand that two is always better than one, but is it majorly harmful? 


Second:

 Should I go back to march? 

I marched the Cadets in '16 and it was a grab bag of emotions. I have loved the Cadets since I was a wee lad of 14 and I auditioned there 3 times before they contracted me. I was so excited to march with the idols that I had looked up to for years... then... '16 happened. The season was hard. I was a rookie to drum corps, so I expected it to be hard, but on further inspection and talking to others, I realized that it was harder than normal for everyone. Certain Vets had bad attitudes and projected it onto the rest of the group, our design team was **CONSTANTLY** changing our show and we were learning new material and drill up until 1.5 weeks till finals, and of course, scores hurt our morale. To me, dealing with the crap of bad logistics, cranky people, and changes to your show just seemed like that what a Cadet does. And I powered through for the 3/4th of it. I did lose hope a few times, but by the end I was numb. Numb to the anger, numb to the scores, and numb to myself. At the end of our Finals performance, I didn't cry. I didn't have a wave of emotions. I just said to myself ""It's over"". And I marched off the field and sat on the bus. I was checked out.

Even with all the shade, I love the activity. It dazzles me. I want to be a part of it, performing at my highest level. But, the question is, is my internship worth more than marching again? I didn't have the best time in 2016, but parts of me wants to go back and ""right"" all of the ""wrongs"". However, have I romanticized marching into this unattainable thing? Can I escape the bad time, or am I just not cut out for Drum Corps?

Third:

If I re-enter the activity, where do I go?

Do I go back to the Cadets? So obviously I love the Cadets. I loved their drill, their hornline, and their intensity. The 2000's-2015 Cadets, to me, were idols. I loved the intensity, the uniform, the drill. It was all I wanted, and In my own back yard! I live in the Philadelphia area, so Allentown was just an easy $8 train ride away. A match made in heaven. Then I marched, and as you read, shit happened. Do I go back? They have a new Brass caption head, the same guard, and a ""new"" design team? Also... side note, if the Cadets go back to the maroon and gold west point traditional uniform for 2018, **I will march Cadets**... I would sacrifice everything for that uniform... to me it epitomizes everything excellent to me. Just a personal quirk of mine. Not the most rational, but that's just me on that point.

If Not the Cadets, then where?

I care about popular opinion of my group, so unfortunately scores matter to me. I like to be recognized for my effort and excellence. I like groups known for their excellence, so Cadets and BD always appeal to me. I am not a fan of the Bluecoats, and I just can't do bent leg techniques (sorry cavies or SCV, I love you, but I just can't do it). I don't really have a connection with Boston, but Gino is there, and they're projected to score well. I haven't really seen any of their shows as FANTASTIC like I've viewed the Cadets' shows, but maybe I could learn to love them? And Carolina Crown's brass excellence is undeniable, but I have not really liked their shows since 2012. Where do I go? Let me know what you think, and please give reasons **why**.

So obviously Cadets is the easiest for me to march financially. I have about 3k in savings prepared to be used on my summer if I march, and I guess I could fundraise the rest. How hard is it to gather the funds through others? If I were to go out for BD, I'd need to do some substantial gathering. How have you done it in the past? Is gathering ~2k really difficult?


tl;dr:
I marched in '16 with Cadets, got an internship in '17, and am wondering if returning is the right thing to do? And if I return, who do I march with?


Let me know what you think. If you were me, what would you do? Your feedback is very valuable to me.

Thank you.

765oiq,2,2017-10-13,When to accept pro rata tIRA conversion tax?,GoldenTechy,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/765oiq/when_to_accept_pro_rata_tira_conversion_tax/,"I currently have money in a number of accounts including both a rollover tIRA from a previous employer 401k from where I was an intern as well as a rIRA that I have been contributing to.  Starting this next year, I will no longer be able to directly contribute to a rIRA due to income limits and will have to go about using the backdoor roth conversion.  My only issue with this is that I will have to take the tax hit from the tIRA that I currently hold.  I have already contacted Vanguard (everything including current 401k is with them) and they have stated that my company's plan does not allow an IRA to be rolled into the 401k plan in order to avoid this.  Because of this, is it worth taking the additional tax on in some year to be able to take advantage of the backdoor roth?  Would it be best to take is as a pro rata hit or just do it all in this year where my marginal tax rate is still within the 25% bracket instead of being into the 28% bracket next year?

Any advice from individuals who have done this before would be appreciated."

[The swamp runs deep my friends.](https://i.redd.it/wfrgjnlnq8tx.jpg)  It took a man like Donald J Trump to open our eyes to the utter uselessness of the politicians in Washington.  **I am now under the belief that the establishment Republicans have no intention of passing any of GEOTUS's agenda.**  They are simply putting on a show for all of us, hoping we are dumb enough to believe their bullshit.  They are going to try to delay..delay..delay any significant legislation until the next presidential election all while pretending they stand behind Trump.  **It's not going unnoticed.**
_____________________________________________________________________

[If you haven't seen Steve Bannon's interview on Hannity, please give it a watch.](https://youtu.be/7rB6r_Yt8B4)  Every establishment Republican is now on notice.  **We are coming for you at the ballot box.**  If they think they can fool us, they are making a very big mistake.  GEOTUS has awakened something in us that cannot be put back in the box.  **You either get on the Trump Train, or you will get run the fuck over.  MAGA!!**

#Liberal Hypocrisy

Liberals.-----&gt;  **No one believes you anymore.**  [You can't put on a pink pussy hat and call Donald Trump a misogynist and at the same time ignore the misogyny that is occurring under your  own noses.](https://youtu.be/ffb_5X59_DA)  **For 20 years, Ashley Judd has known that Harvey Weinstein was a a dirty, misogynist, sleazeball, and she said NOTHING!. CRICKETS!**  If she was such a champion of women's rights, she should have been the one to take the story to The New York Times in the first place.  It is only now, when the truth is out, she opens her mouth about the harassment she received from Weinstein.  
___________________________________________________________________

The truth is liberals only care about misogyny when it serves their political interest.  Not a word when rapey Bill Clinton was sticking cigars in interns and not a single fucking word when Weinstein was sexually harassing young women for movie rolls.  **As long as the money rolls into the Democratic party, you can break every rule in the moral handbook while accusing opponents of the exact same fucking thing you are guilty of.**  That is the TRUTH!!  Write it down, frame it, and put it on the wall.  Liberals are the biggest fucking hypocrites on the planet and no one is falling for it anymore.

765wq9,7,2017-10-13,What age did you start using Drugs? I am pretty surely damaging myself... (tl;dr included),ilovetheusa1,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/765wq9/what_age_did_you_start_using_drugs_i_am_pretty/,"Hi There!(I would love if you read this/at least the **tl;dr at the bottom** and give me some tips etc as i am still pretty young/have a hopefully long life in front of me which i want to make the best of)

**Introduction**

First of all: Please do not have too many prejudices because of my age. I might be young, and i know that i am damaging myself with the use of certain substances and that it would have been better(except for the ""experience""/learning factor) to wait till im at least in my mid twenties. But i think, that this gives me more experience in life which might help me in the future and it made me more open minded/helped me with my social life/deal with a little bit of bulling i experienced as a child-which let me to always ""hate"" and judge new people(especially the ""popular kids"") in a bad way, i think it also helped me in some different ""regions"" for example appreciating Friends who i only met 2 times a year but whom i had great times with. I informed myself before using every single of these drugs(except alcohol/weed. I already knew much about alcohol already as there is a pretty good alcohol(sadly not all drug) (safer use) education/ in my country)). My sisters both know that i have taken a few drugs, same with my over 30 yo brother(he has experience with LSA and Shrooms tho told me to stop LSD(which i did not follow/which is a little sad but i just have a different opinion)(he is kinda my compass of reason if you want to say so and one of the smartest persons i know)). Also most of my closer friends know it, I think that it is better that way for some reason, maybe it also gives a little safety. Only disadvantage is that i think i have a Druggie/Junkie reputation as most teens/young adults in my surrounding have no clue what drugs actually are/that they can be used safely. Btw i am consuming alone(excluding Shrooms one time/Weed/Alc), only had a trips sitter on Shrooms once as most of my friends don't wana take ""harder"" drugs/not while they are this young. It is kind of sad that i have not M8s i can really share/enter this world with but i am not only fine with them not taking anything excluding alc/weed but i am actually a little happy/never ever would want to persuade them to take drugs.

**the following passage is not to important but if you have time i would love if you take it to still read this**

**to my person(to maybe better judge my person/situation):**

I am 18 yo male, live in a wealthy, educated, open minded family, started using drugs(except alcohol) just before i turned 18 and since then have gained a lot of drug experiences. I love Physics/ Chemistry/ Politics/ (English as a 2nd language in school(haha my English is probably terrible here))/ movies(&lt;3 Stanley Kubrick)/ gaming(which boy doesn't?)/ art/ like to draw(this sounds not just a little arrogant)- i am really good at drawing realistic. I like Woodworking(this sounds arrogant too, I know, but i am talented at knowing what looks good/Design/graphic Design/ Drawing(i actually think this is actually mostly practice) and doing creative stuff in general like building stuff). I had switched school(was bullied a little/was always an outsider), switched school, was super lazy(i am still super lazy) but i did not care to much for school, so i had to go back a year. But then (which is the thing i wanted the most at that time) i was finally able to be a better student(and used my ""potential""(haha i really sound arrogant, would not talk like that to people in real life)). I also got to know a lot of nice people. From there on i was not an outsider but instead I became friends with so many that i have since been able to choose who i want to spend my time with. I am a fan of all kinds of modern technology(although i have no clue of programming) and tech companies like apple/tesla/space x/google and i have a good knowledge of how technology works. I am not a sports guy/i am pretty skinny(i would call myself a weakling), but i want to change that but my stamina is terrible/my laziness is in my way(i know that other people were able to overcome that too but i still struggle with it(hope i get mentally tougher)). Oh and i to add: i never had a girlfriend/never made out with someone. I looked like 12 till i was nearly 17 and had the matching voice which is probably the reason for that time and i have in the past 2 years never really found any girls that have a interesting character. I would favor a interesting maybe a bit different or even crazy girl universes above a plane boring girl even if she is extremely beautiful.
Probably a reason i don't have a girlfriend also is that i am maybe a bit crazy/different too(not 100% in a positive way). But while i am craving to get some experience i would rather wait for the right relationship than just a shitty boring one.

I am still in school and doing the highest(which ist nothing special in my country) graduation next year. I probably want to study something like Physics/engineering tho i would love to combine that with something creative/do both things parallel. I want to do an internship at some tech/electronic/physics or design/furniture design company after school and will try to get an idea of what i want to study in that time.

**Now the part this Reddit post was made for: what i have taken:**(what are your thoughts?(YES, i know that drug use in my age is not a good thing, but i was too curious/now that i have taken following substances i want to continue taking (most) while paying attention to ""safer use""). I am trying to follow what is said to be safe/ take drug free weeks/ month if possible although i find it to be hard with a lot of spare time)


* Alcohol (mentioning because i started pretty late compared to my surrounding after my 17. birthday. Never was a problem/drinking rarely atm)
* Tobacco (never felt a need to smoke, had 2 phases where i smoked a little for a month, said no to every Tobacco after the first break, then started again for a week and at the end i think me smoking a cigarette scared of one of the sweetest and nicest girls i have ever seen. I just find no single reason(than the social aspect) to consume Tobacco.)
* Weed (pretty common too/widely accepted in society tho illegal(not abusing it/had some heavy use weeks tho).)
* LSD/Shrooms (first use before/when i turned 18. Used it multiple times since/i surely should have waited longer of course(developing brain) but i was to curious and liked it too much to stop. I was close to abusing it/still have to force myself to do it less often(&lt;2 times a month). But i think i can handle stressful/strange/challenging situations ((bad) trips) pretty good and can let go of bad/emotional moments in my life very well(E.g.: death of close family members) mostly. No reported case of a psychosis in my family/i hope and pray(&lt;-just a phrase/i am an atheist) that i will not get any serious brain damage from it like HPPD
* DMT (I am probably a little to young for this stuff(as with nearly every substance on this list). Will probably come back to it at a later point in my life. I think it is super interesting tho, but the first three and only three uses where underwhelming(same dosage, only had major effects the third time))
* 2-CB (wanted to try it for its aphrodisiac effects tho that did not work out/I have a high natural tolerance therefore had to plug 30mg (pretty high dose for first timers) after two failed attempts.)
* Xanax (bought it for bad trips/but have used it for sleep cure 2 times/once recreational. I know that it is super dangerous/addictive and therefore only ever have a low amount of it on hand/take longer breaks between uses even if i would like to/""need""(if i cant sleep and have to wake up early) to use it. Natural sleep is preferred always ofc, as REM sleep phase is important for you)
* Codeine (we have a lot of medicine floating around. Wanted to try it because i already had access to it but i was totally underwhelmed so i only used it 2 times/not planning on using it again RC soon. Tho used it probably 6 times when i had dry cough and it is awesome for that/used it in the recommended low doses and only for short periods ofc.
* Speed/Amph (Friend only got this by accident for free(vendors mistake) and a pretty high amount to, enough for about 500 RC doses. I did not want to try it in first place, would not have made any effort by myself to get some. I have used it ~10 times since. I used it for learning/cleaning when i had to do much work in short time periods. I am still super afraid of tolerance/abuse/Addition/serious heart damage and therefore i am trying to dose around the therapeutic dose which did not work out in the past when i had a little tolerance/i was well informed but as many people here dose higher i did so too. I have to say that i have fallen in love with this stuff a little(Nearly as much as with LSD-tho it is much more magical) as being productive/not getting distracted was always pretty hard for me, but i still love to be productive. That might be a danger for me using it but i am planning to use it regardless in the future for learning/being more active in class. But i think i have enough self control to not overdo it/i don't have the time to dose in the morning (and if i would dose later i would not be able to sleep), i would never up the dose by a lot because of a build up tolerance and only dose higher when i have a ""free day"" on which want to get a lot of shit done/when it is not too important if i go to bed a little late and when i don't have to many social interactions as i tend to get angry when i am in the right and arguing with someone about it.)
* N2O (Not to much to say about, in moderate consume it is pretty safe if i am right and it is pretty fun sometimes. And it is Legal to)

Hey, you read so far? Thank you at first, please read the 2nd Part of the tl;dr.


 **tl;dr**: I used following substances just after i turned 18(Yep, that is... well young... i am probably not the only one but that is not a justification...): Alcohol, Tobacco, Weed, LSD/shrooms, DMT, 2-CB, Xanax, Codeine, Speed, N2O. That is pretty early, i know. When did you start? Have you got any tips for me as i am pretty young and have a hopefully long life in front of me and as some of you have gained a many experiences in life/are older than me(and hopefully wiser) you would do me a really big favor!

PS: Well, i know that i am still to young, but that will probably not stop me from trying other drugs i have not before. Just wanted to give a quick list:

* MDMA (not sure if now, probably wana do that in part of my life where i have less spare time. I really dont wana fuck areound with damaging my brain. If i informed myself right(i haven't done so to a big extend because i will not take it ""tomorrow"") if you take longer brakes(which i am afraid i will not take atm) of in the best case 3 month(which i would like to do) and take a few other precautions you are pretty safe- safer use ftw!)
* Cocaine (this would probably be the ""hardest"" drug i would take besides Alkohol and Speed. I am not willing to do it just now but i will definitely try it at some point in time. And the good thing is that it is so expensive for the effects you get that i will not buy it often hence low addiction potential)
* Maybe some other Psychedelics, DXM(have NOT informed myself really about these last ones), Ketamine, "
766094,27,2017-10-13,Hate-Read the Georgetown University College Republicans Freshman Representative Candidacy Statements,ilovebinderclips,ChapoTrapHouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/766094/hateread_the_georgetown_university_college/,"Feels like this sub needs something to laugh at this Friday. Every year the Georgetown University College Republicans (GUCR) elects a Freshman Representative that is responsible for reaching out to freshmen for recruiting and events. Sadly, I am an alum of this idiot university. The GUCR mailing list is the only one I remain on--because every year they hold this election and send out the candidacy statements and they're *incredible*. What's more, sometimes picture are included and the ones they choose to include to represent themselves... well, you'll just have to see for yourself.

The GUCR Freshman Rep Candidates invariably describe getting involved in the GOP at a young age, being in debate club, being able to talk to Democrats (the GUCR has a huge hard-on for bipartisanship), and are almost always from New Jersey. It is horrifying to think about the fact that many of these people will end up in some position of economic or political power and significance.

So without further ado, here are my favorites over the years, lightly edited to make things comprehensible to non-Georgetown alum. Click through to the images, too, they're incredible.

# Maggie, 2010

Once upon a time, in 1984, during the good old days when Reagan Red was always in, love blossomed at the Republican National Committee. She was the internship coordinator, he was with communications. Three years later, the couple was happily married and decorated their newfound home with elephants, pictures of the Gipper, and quotes from famous conservatives. Four years after that, they welcomed a little elephant into this world. Her name is Maggie/ All of this and more has led her to a love of conservatism and all things Republican. Last summer, Maggie co-directed the GOP Youth Convention and helped to start a conservative youth-run PAC. She hopes to get very involved with the GUCR's and has already volunteered for Fimian. She promises she will always show up and devote everything she can to the on-campus Republican Party. She will represent YOU, freshmen! If you'd like to talk to her about anything Republican, she can be found on the fifth floor [of the library] (by the elevators and front windows) virtually any day past 9:00 PM. She's approachable and would love to talk to you. Please vote for Maggie for Freshmen Representative 2010.

(Note: Maggie won this election and would go on to win the election for Chair the next year, promising to be ""as much as Margaret Thatcher as possible."")

# Nolan, 2011

My name is Nolan and I am declaring my candidacy for Freshman Representative of the Georgetown University College Republicans. I have been a political junkie since my mother started working for Fox News in polling during the general elections as early as 2000. President George H.W. Bush was a hero of mine when I was in 2nd grade because I have an autographed picture of him in my room, and when I realized his son was running for elections, I became a huge Bush supporter. I know I started out young, and probably had some political bias because of my father, but I never stopped pursuing politics. In high school, I was a speaker in the Young Republicans Club, and debated on behalf of the club for school events. I was in student government, and was senior class president, and I loved campaigning for the Republican Party in my district. I am from Northern Virginia, very close to D.C. where both my parents worked. I am in the College and am looking forward to running as the Freshman Representative, and I will serve the party well.

# Seamus, 2012 [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/AbjmuKP.jpg)

Hello and welcome- welcome to a world full of beaming and enthusiastic freshmen. No, this is not a football party that someone forgot to man the door for, but the Georgetown University College Republicans after I, Seamus, have been elected to be your Freshman Representative. I will take on the duties of the representative as an obligation to this room, our conservative cause and the betterment of the United States of America by recruiting loads of other bright eyed and bushy tailed young Republicans. I look forward to assuming these responsibilities and would be honored to be given the opportunity. So a few others have spoke, and some will speak again, but I'll say to them and all of you, ""Read my lips: Lots of freshmen.'""

# Ellie, 2013 [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/Dna9xzk.jpg)

Hey friends!!! I'm Ellie, and I'm a freshman in the [School of Foreign Service] hailing from the Grand Canyon state (Zona)! Besides loving Muricah, I'm a big fan of excessive emojis/exclamation points, stealing the red Jell-O from Leo's (to my friends' disgust) and exercising my Second Amendment rights via water guns whenever possible :) I've sufficiently embarrassed myself trying to recruit GUCR members by asking anyone I run into on the [freshman dorm] staircase, ""Are you by any chance Republican?"" But it's not about converting the Hilltop or memorizing the name and voting record of every single Republican member of Congress. As your Freshman Class Representative, I'm looking forward to a year full of American Flag Chubbies, Vineyard Vines koozies, and bonding with you all over fattening fried foods, preferably served in baskets!

[NB: As a friend of mine pointed out, ""she's going for the horny vote.'"" I think Ellie won that year.]

# Paul, 2013 [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/3k7fT65.jpg)

This one doesn't have a funny statement but his picture is just so good.

# Cole, 2014

I should be a Freshman Representative of the Georgetown University College Republicans because I have invaluable hands-on experience with conservative politics, which I can apply to the GUCR's activities and strategies on campus. Growing up in Arizona, I have been involved with conservative politics since the beginning of my freshman year in high school. I helped lead a group of students to participate in the 2011 March for Life in Washington D.C., and I have had the opportunity to meet and discuss politics with some of Arizona's leading politicians and community leaders, like former AZ Governor Fife Symington and head of the ""Ken and Randy Kendrick Fund for Free Market Research,"" Randy Kendrick. I have spent three years at a boarding school in Massachusetts, which has provided me the chance to better understand liberal policies and thought processes, which has in turn strengthened my conservative positions. Finally, I am currently interning in AZ Senator Jeff Flake's office for the remainder of this year, and the real experience I gain from this internship will allow me to apply my experiences from a real, working senatorial office to the GUCR and help it succeed in every way possible.

# Hunter, 2015 [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/J5eVR9Q.jpg)

My name is Hunter, and I am proud to be an American, a flag waving, gun-toting, freedom-loving, proud American. My love for country drives me to desire to make it the best it can be, with a strong international policy, fiscally conservative ideals, the protection of the Constitution, and the upholding of freedom, all of which bring me to deem myself a Republican. I am a very outgoing person and I love to get involved in leadership which has inspired me to run for the most admirable position of freshman representative. I have been blessed to hold many leadership positions before, for in the past I have held elected positions in the student government, I was a founding member of my school's young Republican's club and wrote a newsletter for them, I was also the captain of the debate team, president of the international relations club, president of the diplomacy society, president of the Arrupe Society (club dedicated to community service), and the president and founder of the outdoors club, along with participating in many other clubs. I love politics and hope to help foster an environment in which young Republicans can thrive and go on to have fulfilling careers while representing the ideals of conservatism. No matter what I hope to dedicate myself to the success of this club and to help all of the members feel that they are truly a part of a community of like-minded believers.

# Alexander, 2015 [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/pn6V0PB.jpg)

Joining the College Republicans was probably the only thing I knew I definitely wanted to do when I came to Georgetown. To be involved in Republican politics in D.C. at one of the most prestigious universities is an honor and a blessing. As Freshman Representative, I will put my passion and strong work ethic into practice through promoting conservative ideals and values. I will be dedicated and committed in assisting all upperclassmen on the board with whatever they might need help with. In particular, I will use my outgoing and friendly personality to reach out to other Freshman whether it be through tabling, special events, or simply just talking politics with them. Furthermore, I think that I can bring a positive attitude to help make politics more fun, exciting, and enjoyable than most people find them to be. While my top priorities will be helping to set up events, speakers, and meetings, I will promote other activities as well. For example, if the College Democrats and Students for Bernie can throw a party, then I think the Republicans can throw an even better one. With the election coming up and the first primaries in just a few months, there are so many opportunities to get students at Georgetown (particularly Republicans) involved and engaged. As Freshman Representative, I will get other Freshman excited about the election and inspire them to want to come out and support the Republican candidates. Overall, I am just excited to be part of this organization and am extremely confident that I have a lot to contribute as the Freshman Representative.

# Noor, 2017 [PIC](https://i.imgur.com/AnhJwWv.jpg)

[This is not the funniest one but it is easily the most horrifying one]

My name is Noor and I am a freshman in the MSB from Monmouth Junction, New Jersey. When I was ten years old, we drove by a store with a poster saying ""we accept food stamps."" I asked my mother, ""Why do some people get food for free, while we have to pay for it?"" She replied, ""Some people are poor and can't afford to buy food."" I responded, ""Why don't they get a job so they can pay for their food?"" She replied, ""Noor, you're such a Republican."" I had no idea what that meant at the time, but in hindsight, I've been a Republican since day one. Most of you may already know me as the free speech warrior and meme who wasn't having any of Lawrence Hill's liberal propaganda. If not, you may know me as the guy who walked around during CAB Fair holding the ""Socialism Sucks"" poster with ""Socialism Sucks"" and ""Big Government Sucks"" pins. As freshmen representative, I will continue to be passionate and fearless in providing platforms to conservative thought. May the market allocate votes to the best candidate."
7665i3,52,2017-10-13,Best way to solve this issue? (Realtime problem right now),phillysliq,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/7665i3/best_way_to_solve_this_issue_realtime_problem/,"So I'm here at my internship and they ran into an issue. They were adding a new Cisco 3850 switch to the network, however the new switch took over as a the master having no configurations and cause our entire network to crash.

They are trying to fix the issue by resetting all the switches and then slowly adding in the new switches. 

What is the best way to fix this, and how do you prevent and issue like this?

Edit: so they sat down the interns and gave us all a talk. I brought up the VTP issue, but they said it was completely separate from that. So I'm assuming it was stackwise?

Edit2: thanks for everyone's input. This was a fantastic learning experience and what I was waiting for since becoming an intern. Before this it's been, get a call, and go set up their computer.... but today was fucking awesome. Thanks!"
766d79,1,2017-10-13,Need advice on which offer to accept.,The_Steezy_E,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/766d79/need_advice_on_which_offer_to_accept/,"So a little back story, I am graduating spring 2018 from my schools accounting program and will be eligible to take the CPA exam.  My meet the firms event went really well this year and I was able to score an internship at a tax firm during the spring semester. However, because I am graduating in the Spring I interviewed for some permanent positions in addition to the internship. I have recently been hearing back from some of these other firms and I think one or two might make offers for a permanent position.

If I were to pick a firm to work at, I would choose the firm that I have an internship with. But here is my dilemma, I don't doubt that I will receive an offer from one of the other firms before I could potentially receive an offer from the firm I am interning at. If I were to accept one of the other offers then receive an offer from the firm I am interning at, I would be extremely conflicted. 

If I were to accept a job at another firm, and then my internship ends with an offer, I have no doubt that it would look bad to tell the previous firm that I wanted to back out.  But is this unheard of? 

I also realize that an offer after the internship is not a for sure thing, and if I were to blow off the other firms to hold out for an offer that was never going to happen then I would be out of a job.

I'm stressed can anyone offer any advice on the situation?"

Got an offer from Firm A following internship.  Was told to let them know if we heard of major pay discrepancies.

Later learned Firm B pays much more for the same location, line of service, education level, etc.  Informed Firm A.  Hear nothing for a month.

Fed up with waiting, I started interviewing with Firm B.  Have been invited for a final round, but it's two days after the Firm A offer deadline.

I asked for an extension of just one week from Firm A.  In this request, I was very transparent and let them know why I was asking.  This request was declined.

I don't want to renege on an offer, but the truth is I am more interested in Firm B at this point.  I am very scared of declining the first offer, going to the interview, and not getting the second offer.  I am also afraid of outright accepting the first and living with the knowledge of this pay difference.

What do you think?  This is the toughest choice I've faced thus far."

Yesterday, their was a meeting held specifically for females majoring in a tech related field. I wasn't planning on going (I never really attend any optional meetings at my school...) but another girl in my department that I knew nothing about (except her name, all the girls in the CS department are aware of one another's existence. Even though we don't necessarily socialize everyday) asked me to go with her. Me not knowing how to say ""no"", I agreed :-) . So I attended of course, and basically I heard what I expected. Salary gap... female to male employee ratios... not that I have a problem with having heard this but as a female CS major, it's no news to me. However, the main point of this meeting was to present a mentoring program that is organized by a few women that work at Cagemini (a software company in France, where I'm attending college). Throughout the year, students that decide to participate will have a mentor that will help them through their career choices, writing their CVs, finding internships at places like Airbus, Amazon WebServices..., providing reference letters for our Masters Degree applications, and eventually getting hired at Cagemini. Of course, I found this awesome, especially considering the fact that getting an internship, no matter your major, in this city can be hard. So I decided to sign up.  
  
Today, I told one of my closest friends in the department (a guy, let's call him Jack) about what happened at this meeting. His reaction honestly made me question his sense of reality. First of all, Jack is a very opinionated person and he's never afraid to let people know that, be it a student, teacher, bus driver... So talking to him about a meeting directed towards females, arranged by females... well, I was expecting him to find some sort of problem with it. So basically, he went off on me saying that he hopes that I didn't apply (I didn't tell him whether or not I did) because the fact that this opportunity is only available to females is ""ridiculous"". ""What are us guys supposed to do?!"". Honestly I had know idea how to answer him because, I deal with these sort of reactions from him often, but him saying that as a guy going into the tech industry, in my opinion, is thoughtless. Jack is going into a field that is dominated by men and even in classes I have had to work much harder to prove myself to my professors than he has ever had to.  
  
The thing that bothers me the most about this exchange is the fact that I had know idea how to counter what he said or how to deal with mindless outbursts like those in general (trust me I have to deal with them on regularly...). Something I despise about myself is my inability to thoroughly express my opinions... So, onto the point of this post: Am I overthinking this? How would you have defended yourself in this situation?
  
TL;DR I'm a female Computer Science major that was provided a wonderful opportunity, and a close (male) friend of mine felt disadvantaged... How should I have responded?"

From what i've read about a career in UX, computer science knowledge is not completely necessary. How can I, as a psychology student, find an internship? I have basic coding knowledge but thats about it. Am i searching for the internships wrong? I tend to use the search terms; UX design internship or user experience design internship. My portfolio is not completely where I want it, but it's coming along. Should I apply to internships that require a CS degree even if I don't have one?

Can I fix myself?",KeybladesChosen,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/768yrr/never_had_a_date_before_i_finally_understand_why/,"Hello Reddit, I would like some resources wisdom from you guys. Last night I read thr famous ""6 Harsh Truths"" article (http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/)
And man did it f*** me up. I haven't cried in ten years but sitting by myself on homecoming reading that article restarted the waterworks. I seem to be the exact person the author goes off on here , I'm a loser nice guy in college with no friends, a worthless major, no network, and no skills that would draw anyone to me. I'm halfway through college and I've had less life experience than am average 16 year old. Never been kissed or had a girlfriend; went to one house party but had a panic attack and had to leave; never was good enough to join a sports team (the few I tried kicked me out after a few weeks) and never did anything to deserve all the comforts I currently have. My parents are paying for me to go to college, but they don't know how much I hate my major or how I spend every weekend alone in my room. They probably think I'm secretly having the time of my life like they did in school. I dont want them to know how scared and alone I feel.

Of course being a straight guy at a university renowned for having gorgeous women everywhere its hard to get my mind off of romance. I've been browsing through askwomen and dating_advice and noticed a phrase repeated a lot to virgin guys: why would anyone want to date you? Do you offer any value?

This is the same sentiment that the cracked article expressed. I can fairly confidently say I don't. At least not enough to be competitive with all of the other guys on campus. They all seem to be so funny and outgoing, and most of them are jacked as well. Even the nerdier ones at least probably have a good internship or career ahead of them; I have nothing. My hobbies are pretty much limited to music (saxophone, but I wasnt able to pass any auditions for music groups near me) and video making. I used to want to be a YouTube star but never had the money for equipment. Ive studied filmmaking, animation and sound design but have no way to apply them. 

  All of my skills are theoretical, academic stuff that teachers tell you are really important in school but apparently dont mean jack s*** in the real world. I'm skinny with a puffy face so most women turn their nose up at me if even try to talk to them, the acne makes it worse. I've tried accutane and it helped but it also gave me horrible suicidal thoughts. I'm also shy and stumble on my words when I'm around others. My voice is unnaturally deep and I hate how it sounds. 

I've transferred schools so I don't know anyone or have any groups to fall back on. I'm more alone than I've ever been and I'm starting to see its all my fault. I chose to play video games and daydream instead of work out or go to parties. I chose to spend hours reading music books and studying music theory only to still be unable to write my own music. I chose to be a lazy, low-value individual because I thought that things would eventually just get better. 

Turns out that my horrible high school years were actually the best part of my life. At least I had a few friends there. I'm 20 and havent got anything to show for it. If you asked me who I am or what I like to do I would stare at you blankly because I do not know anymore. Everything in my life just feels empty so that must mean that I'm empty on the inside. Sometimes I try to walk through walls because I swear I'm a ghost to most people. All ive ever wanted in life was a group of friends to banter with and a cute girlfriend to hold me at night. I clung to this stupid fantasy all while avoiding the pain necessary to make it real. 

I am the most worthless person I know. Ive taken my privilege and squandered it. I'm socially awkward, out of shape, depressed, cast out from normal society. I cant watch tv or listen to modern music anymore since its all about love and partying and whatnot, stuff that I will never experience. When I'm not angry and hitting myself for being such a f***up I just lie in my bed bored. Nothing seems worth doing if I have to do it alone. I want to have something of worth to provide to people, to friends, to women, but at the end of the day I'm just a ""nice guy"" and boring f***s like me are a dime a dozen.

I don't want to give up but I don't see a way forward that doesnt end in misery. I wish I could kill my personality and take on someone else's. How do I start over when I have no foundation? I've realized that I am the problem in my life but the only way to fix that problem seems to be to destroy myself completely. Help me please.

Miserable about it.,thxsc2609,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/76969m/i_have_never_been_asked_out_and_ive_never_had_a/,"Hi, everyone. Forgive me if this isn't the right sub, I needed to vent a bit and see what others think.

Like the title says, I've never been asked out or been in a relationship. I'll be 21 next week, female, and in college. I've always been very successful academically. I graduated at the top of my high school class and have continued to excel in college. I'm a member and officer of several clubs on campus, doing an internship this semester, and starting a prestigious internship next semester.

Socially, it's always been a different story. As far back as elementary school, I had very few friends and was never allowed to have anyone over.  In middle school, I enjoyed talking to my teachers more than my classmates. I met my best friend freshman year of high school and we've been inseparable since. Other than her, I had two or three other friends that I talked to regularly, but no one else. 

I chose to go far from home for college. Best decision I could have made so I could learn how to handle stress on my own, advocate for myself, and meet new people. I've had few problems making platonic friends in college, but I haven't met anyone yet that I've been interested in dating, or vice versa. 

In high school, I wore nice clothes and makeup and took care of myself, but didn't have much sense of style. I was also quiet and not interested in socializing much. I preferred to keep my head down and focus on getting into schools that I wanted to attend.

Now, I'm more stylish, started styling my hair, and tried to be more outgoing. Still, I feel like there's no way I'll ever meet someone I'm attracted to or is attracted to me. I'm worried that I'm spending too much time on schoolwork and not enough time on socializing.

Any advice or opinion is greatly appreciated!"

Hello to everyone. I was really torn between picking up Fujin or Larsa on the CT banner when it dropped and went with the first option. Now that we're able to choose one more relic I'm thinking about Larsa or Prishe (who is also a solid option IMO).

Well, I was checking the dates of the [last JP Report we had](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/74dawy/jp_ffrk_report_27_ffix_ffv_ffii_ffxii_ffx_2x/) and realized that the XII event focused on Larsa and Vayne will start 10/20, which is the same day the Crystal Tower selection closes.

Usually the information of Relics, Legend Dive and Legend Materias of JP events are datamined 24h before they start. That means that if you haven't chosen you 2nd CT relic yet (and is thinking about Larsa too), it is an interesting idea to wait until we know what kind of Legend Materias he will have.

Hope this helps you guys with your decisions."

Anton rushed headlong down the hall of the Federal Palace, separating the traffic against either wall. In his right hand, a coffee carrier was balanced precariously; in his right, a sheaf of papers. As he approached the third door on the right, it opened just before he reached it. The opener stepped halfway into the hallway, reaching for both items. 

""Anything else you'll be needing, Mr. Berset?"" Anton asked somewhat shakily. The bald Social Democrat shook his head and gestured for him to leave.

""That will be all, shoo back to the intern section, thank you,"" Alain responded, turning his back before the sentence was complete, shutting the door almost as quickly. The Councilor set the drinks upon a long, oval conference table, his four colleagues descending upon it and reaching for their own order. ""So, now that we've got the majority here, we should begin discussing the agenda our coalition's considering."" The leading Liberal delegate, Didier Burkhalter spoke first among the alliance of liberal-leaning Federal Councilors, which also included Liberals Johann Schneider-Ammann and Fulvio Pelli, and Social Democratic Councilor Simonetta Sommaruga.  

""The FDP would like to focus first on energy policy, specifically what we can do to increase Swiss energy independence from foreign nations and lower the industry's carbon footprint,"" Didier read off by rote, his eyes half-closed as if he knew the outcome of the meeting already. 

""Well, of course, this is what most of the Assembly wants. But the SDP wants to also include a carbon tax in any legislature involving an energy bill,"" Berset replied, drawing a couple of sighs.

""You know we can't support that, Alain. It's not the government's place to have such tight regulation on private business,"" Pelli stated, confident in his position. 

""Have you *seen* the kind of revenue we currently generate? It's pitiful, and the best way to increase it is to kill two birds with one stone,"" Simonetta insisted, gesturing firmly and speaking defensively. 

""Like we said, it's not our right to increase regulations and taxes on our people. An initiative to help encourage green, renewable power is more than enough to start cutting down on the Swiss footprint as a whole. When fossil fuels start being phased out-"" Johann was interrupted by Alain, who rolled his eyes at what he perceived to be a wait-and-see approach.

""And when will that be? Twenty years? Thirty? Longer? We give businesses an incentive to move over to renewable energy, have a penalty for those who stay, and we can double the rate at which we switch over,"" Berset insisted. 

""You assume too much here, Councilor. You cannot bake a potato twice as fast by doubling the heat, you will only manage to burn it,"" Burkhalter interjected almost lethargically. 

""Okay, maybe you have a point there. So why not introduce a progressive carbon tax, focusing on those who can afford to make the switch faster or pay slightly more on their taxes?"" Sommaruga proposed, to groans from the FDP members. 

""You will only manage to complicate the tax code more. Those who have the resources will find loopholes, those who do not will be dragged down further by this economic whirlpool. It is a losing situation for both our parties. It makes government subsidies look bad, it makes our tax code look especially bad, and it doesn't accomplish much more than a minute adjustment to our coffers,"" Fulvio Pelli asserted, drawing nods from his two compatriots. Berset and Sommaruga shared a look of defeat before turning back to the three opposite them. 

""Alright, then how about cannabis?"" Alain suggested. Johann and Fulvio chuckled for a moment, while Burkhalter just stared with heavy eyelids. 

""What about it?""

""Setting it up as a new industry in Switzerland boosts our revenue, reduces the number of instances where citizens run into the law, and makes us both look like progressive parties taking advantage of the electoral blessing we've received,"" Berset explained, pitching to those opposite him. A couple of nods bode fairly well.

""Well, it does appeal to the idea of decreased regulation. It turns the industry into a legitimate free enterprise, and massively undercuts a dangerous black market. We've had the idea on our platform for a while, but it's never been taken seriously before,"" Johann said, ruminating on the idea. ""How do we package a joint bill like this? ...if you'll pardon the incidental pun.""

""We get people to view it as a bold reform for the hottest topics of liberal politics currently. It doesn't matter that they are radically different propositions, we just have to emphasize the common points between them. The people we need to appeal to will be able to swallow it. And if we can't get it passed due to certain elements, we can always attack the conservatives on the renewable energy portion, it will give us a great high horse to speak from,"" Berset asserted at length, gradually solidifying the support of the classical liberals before him. 

""So, what shall we call this new bill?"" Burkhalter asked, the one skeptic still unsatisfied. 

""Pot and Progress?"" No, it appeared the group did not like that one.

""Energy to Burn?"" 

""What is this, a fucking tabloid?""

""How about we just call it 'Progress 2024'?"" Sommaruga suggested, shrugging as she said it.

""That one, we can swing,"" Didier confirmed, nodding slowly. 

""Well, alright then! Let's get our people working on the details,"" Berset said with an excitement to his voice uncharacteristic of a Federal Councilor.

""I'll get to whipping the votes into place on the National Council,"" Fulvio Pelli commented, already typing on his smartphone. 

""Berset?"" Burkhalter said, turning to his junior. 

""Yes, Didier?""

""Don't call me Didier, and make sure your party does its share of the work.""

""Can do, sir. Thank you for the opportunity, Councilor Burkhalter.""

769vto,2,2017-10-13,Will they revoke my offer?,Isalock,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/769vto/will_they_revoke_my_offer/,"Long story short, I got an internship with a firm. I have a lot of industry experience that most of my firms audit around me, but I’ve never had an audit internship before. Subsequent to my accepting the internship offer, I got a full-time offer from a Big Four firm. I love the clients they audit and I loved everyone I met at the practice, so I accepted the full-time offer from them.  They knew about my internship with the other firm and didn’t tell me to get rid of it. I would start with the B4 firm after my internship was over. 

Well, my professors urged me to give up the internship so I could make room for someone else who doesn’t have an offer. I felt it was the right thing to do and gave up the internship. Now I’m worried the Big Four firm won’t want me to start if I don’t have any audit experience. Is this a realistic concern?"

I have limited funds and the job opportunities that an AP degree would offer are quite appealing.
 Now ... I know that a bachelor degree is really recommended If I want to get professional but the real problem now is money. Also after I graduate I am willing to stay in Denmark for the rest of my life and I'll apply for a citizenship as soon as possible

Now... the question is what are the salaries that I could get with a fresh AP degree and the experience from the internships and what are the salaries and the job opportunities that I will get from my bachelor diploma. I am considering an AP degree in IT(IT Project Manager, It Consultant , Network technician) and the bachelor degree in Computer Science.
I know that you can get your Bachelor degree after you finish your AP degree (TOP UP) so basically I would get a job much faster (That would help me integrate and not depend on my parents).

I hope that someone could answer me. See you soon in Denmark ;)

76ai4o,2,2017-10-14,21FHL and 22MLL,spicy-but-sad-boi,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/76ai4o/21fhl_and_22mll/,"Just to let you know, long post ahead because I need to rant.

I'm a 21 FHL dating a 22 MLL for the past five years. We have been friends since we were 12, dated in high school, moved to separate colleges where we continued to date long distance. We first broke up when we got to college because we didn't want to hold each other back. I used this time to experiment with other people while he didn't make the effort to do the same. We eventually reconnected and wanted to work things out long distance. Then in the summer of this year I moved to his town where I started an internship that I needed for my college program and I will be living here until it is over (end of December). As things became more serious, we agreed that moving in together temporarily would be a good trial run for how we would work in the long haul.

As typical in most of these posts, sex wasn't an issue until now, specifically until fall came, and we have a loving relationship apart from that. When we were doing long distance, we would visit each other for 3-4 days and have sex about 4-6 times. I thought that frequency would continue when we moved in together but I was obviously wrong. I even remember asking him how often he thought we would have sex when we would live together and he wouldn't give me an answer. When we did first start to live together, sex was happening about every other day. Not as much as I would like, but I was okay with that. Then it was happening with longer and longer gaps, and now we have ""quickies"" once a week-week and a half. 

Since the fall semester has started, he has had a busy schedule filled with school, homework, and a part-time job. In comparison I haven't had to do much other than my internship since I don't have classes until next semester. That has been a large issue in our DB - our difference in schedule. Regardless, I'm always the one to initiate. I often initiate when I know he's not busy since I'm more flexible time-wise and because he easily gets stressed from schoolwork and doesn't handle that really well.  This almost always results in an excuse.  I can usually keep the pain of continuous rejection to myself but in the past few days that built up resentment has been too much for me and I brought up my dissatisfaction. He'll get mad that I want his time when he gets a break because he's ""always fucking busy"" and wants some time to himself. Which is completely understandable, but I need something in this relationship where I do all the cleaning, cooking, and give all the affection. Or he'll say he's too tired, or he won't reject me when I initiate but as we get into it he stops and leaves me to guess whether it's going anywhere (which it isn't). I told him that he can't expect me to be happy and giving when he's making me feel so unloved everyday. I've suggested that it could be a hormonal issue to cause him to not want sex and he denied that that was it. He doesn't even masturbate. I ended up crying and going into our bedroom, where after a little while he apologized and came in and said when he was finished with his homework, we could have sex and that he would try harder in the future. We did and it was great and I felt loved and vulnerable and happy. This wasn't the first time this argument has happened. It has been happening weekly for the reasons above and has been happening because there hasn't been an improvement. Each time, I have communicated what I needed more clearly so that there wasn't anything left to question.

Fast forward to tonight when silly me thought that he really meant it when he said he would try harder last night. I initiated and was met with rejection. I didn't even feel sad like I normally do, just angry and with a feeling of disconnection. I tried not to let these feelings influence my communication as his lack of arousal caused the issue to be brought up again. This time I tried to suggest alternatives to PIV sex or for him to tell me when he would be up for sex again this week. This was met with silence. Then he said he couldn't understand why I needed to have sex again because we did last night and we were talking and playing around around right before this. I tried to steer this to be more productive and asked actually how often he wanted sex so we could compromise and asked him to think about his schedule so we can plan on having sex. This was again met with silence and eventually he turned off the lights and went to bed.

I cannot be in a sexless relationship for the rest of my life. This issue needs a solution and without it, we will not last. A part of me truly hopes that he will finally get it and do what he needs to do. I would be thrilled as I think we're compatible in almost every other aspect. Another part of me thinks he will make an effort for a little to appease me and then stop. I want him to understand that he has until I move out to show me that he cares. With the chance that we head towards a breakup, how do I cope with the feelings that come from constant rejection? It's not really feasible for me to move out right now as I'm paying very cheap rent as his parents own the house we live in and can't really find an apartment this late into the semester or really even afford one. How have you guys been able to make it through a DB temporarily until you can leave?

I've been lurking this subreddit for a little over two months (when this started to become an issue) and it has helped me immensely on how to healthily communicate my problems, not make me feel so alone, and to validate my feelings. I would appreciate the kindness and feedback that this community offers. 

Tl;dr: LL bf keeps rejecting me (hl) and I've had enough. This is something that needs to be fixed soon. If that doesn't happen, how do I cope with being in a DB temporarily until I can move out of our living situation in a few months?"
76bop8,224,2017-10-14,SimGurus: let's talk Jobs and Careers in TS4,bellends,thesims,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/76bop8/simgurus_lets_talk_jobs_and_careers_in_ts4/,"One of the things that breaks my heart about TS4 is the lack of careers. I, along with many people, can get emotionally invested about the backstory and personality of their Sims characters. And so many times, as I am currently on the 21st generation of my legacy (oops), have I thought “I can so picture this job as being perfect for this Sim, but it’s not an option”. There are so, so many jobs that you could add with such little effort and your consumers are GAGGING for it.

And honestly, Sims team? I work in programming. I *get it*. Programming a game is an immense amount of work, and hats off to you because I can tell that a lot of the content we see in the game is the fruit of unimaginably long hours of labour. I never complained about not getting toddlers or pets or any of that in time, because I knew it was something that takes a lot of time and labour, and that you wanted to deliver on it properly. And from playing with toddlers, and seeing what we’ve seen so far for Cats &amp; Dogs, then oh BOY did you deliver! So, all of that was worth it. Thank you.  

But. Adding more jobs? It’s… well, for you, and for EA, and for Maxis, it’s a freebie. You HAVE the code! You just take the template for literally any of the other careers — because I’m not even suggesting that you make these live, or semi-live like vets or restaurants — whip up some new chance cards and job titles, do a coooouple of more outfits (but still only as many as you would do for any other stuff pack or game pack, as many of them can just make do of the preexisting suits etc) and boom: cash cow. Talking money, it’s by far the best ratio of effort spent/revenue gained for YOU because I assure you that it would be such an immensely popular pack.

I mean, Simmers, discuss with me; these are some jobs I thought of just off the top of my head. Wouldn’t you want some of these in your game?

* Lawyer: start off as intern, end up as a judge. Work on logic and charisma.

* Firefighter: start off as fire engine washer, end up as captain. Work on fitness and some logic.

* Teacher: teach through the ages, have a choice between becoming a principal/headmaster or a professor at a university. Work on logic and charisma.

* Fashion: start of as a pencil sharpener, then design your own brand, end up as a CEO or some kind of copyright-safe knock-off-version of that Devil Wears Prada lady. Work on painting/photography and charisma. 

* Photographer: I mean… there’s already a photography skill! Maybe also work on writing and be a photojournalist.

* Movies: have a choice between actor or director. Work on charisma or photography accordingly.

* Florist: work on gardening. 

* Army/navy: not sure if there’s anything political behind this but it hasn’t stop you guys in previous games…

* Fishing/sailor: again, already a fishing skill!

* Therapist: start off as a school councillor or equivalent, end up as some kind of Freud-glasses-wearing psychiatrist

* There are some teen careers that should totally exist as full time! Like retail (end up as CEO of some big brand), construction (end up as city planner), daycare/nanny (end up as principal/headmaster of some big children’s school, or maybe head of chief at a children’s hospital or something). All of these should allow a head start to sims that worked in these jobs as teens.

I realise that you’ll be saving some of these for future EPs; maybe if you do a Celebrity/Fame one like in previous installations, then actor/director will come with that, or teacher might come with a University pack… but there’s still a lot of jobs that you can get from this, and it would be immensely popular within the sims community for very little work from you guys.

Food for thought, my Sim guru friends. Food for thought. I’ll take my 25% share on release day.

Edit: two things that have come up in comments: adding part time jobs. I agree wholeheartedly. Also, yes, there are mods... but they're really just highlighting that there is a demand for it. They're good but pretty unreliable as they often break after updates. Just saying!"

There are also 10 unique weapons excluding unarmed, which every character has available to them. More weapons are coming with the start of Ranked Season 6, which started on September the 13th. 


The Brawlhalla subreddit consists of three things: serious discussion topics, artwork and sh*tposts - a pretty even mix don't you think? There is something there for everyone, whether you're a [d4nK m3mEr](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlhalla/comments/6zurho/the_evolution_of_chuck_e_cheeses/), [a calculating player who has dedicated their heart, soul and social life to balancing Brawlhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlhalla/comments/69566i/my_thoughts_on_spears_nerf/) or [a talented artist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlhalla/comments/6zs18a/stress_reliever_of_my_waifu_mirage/). There is something for absolutely everyone!


&amp;nbsp;


**You:** So you're just linking us to a Super Smash Bros. clone?

**Me:** Absolutely not! Just because Brawlhalla is a cartoon figher, that does not mean that it is just a blatant copy of Super Smash Bros. Brawhalla is unique in many ways, such as that items like mines or bombs are used in ranked. Not to mention that the main focus is on weapons, not characters themselves - though, as mentioned earlier, characters do have unique signature abilities. I'm also forgetting that Brawlhalla has dodges and gravity cancels, that make your character immune for certain lengths of time and making them able to use ground abilities in the air. There is tons more, but Brawlhalla is absolutely not a copy of Smash!


&amp;nbsp;

&gt;##1. What do you love about the Brawlhalla Community?


&gt;&gt;**Pluckerpluck (subreddit mod)** I love the community which was incredibly quick at banding together and preparing tournaments to help this game become what it is, but most of all I love the developer interaction with the community. Having them be part of the community itself really helps ensure the game progresses in a good and healthy way, whilst also allowing the community to feel close and almost like a family. Still hoping for a UK based Brawlhalla event as I've yet to be able to go to anything in person.


&gt;&gt;**Raidhyn (game developer)** My favorite thing about the Brawlhalla Community is how young everyone is. For a lot of players Brawlhalla is the first time they've really dived into a fighting game, so seeing a whole new generation of players learning fighting game concepts like footsies, neutral, combos &amp; strings, and pressure is an awesome thing to be a part of. 


&gt;##2. Why do you think people should start playing Brawlhalla?


&gt;&gt;**Pluckerpluck** Well for one it's free! There's literally nothing to lose by just downloading the game and giving it a go. Most people have never played a fighting brawlhalla like Brawlhalla, and those that have are mostly limited to Smash Bros, so I think Brawlhalla is a genre that anyone may end up enjoying and everything needs to try it out. This is especially true if you can get your friends involved. It's a fantastic party game with the 4-player local multiplayer.


&gt;&gt;**Raidhyn** It's fun, it's free, and you should check it out! Honestly, if you've never tried to play a fighting game before Brawlhalla is a fantastic place to start.

&gt;##3. What do you think of the new weapon?


&gt;&gt;**Pluckerpluck** The cannon? I haven't actually seen much about the cannon but I'm torn about it as a concept. I would have perfered a close quaters weapon or a weapon with slicker animations (whip?) but I think a cannon can be made to play smoothly and well so I don't worry about it too much.


&gt;&gt;**Raidhyn** I've really been enjoying Cannon in the playtests I've been a part of. The weapon feels like this awesome mash-up of previous weapon kits, and includes a little flavor from Rocket Lance, Guns, and Hammer that is just a really cool combination. The Corsiar Legend that is launching with Cannon is also really cool. All of her signatures are based around this idea that a giant sea monster is constantly chasing her down, trying to kill her. But since she's gotten so used to avoid it's attacks she uses its attacks against her opponents. It's really awesome.


&gt;##4. Should people go to BCX (Brawlhalla World Championship)?


&gt;&gt;**Pluckerpluck** It's hard for me to answer this being from the UK and it being massively difficult to get to as a result. But I think that if you live nearby or can get some easy travel to it then people should definitely go. Getting to meet some of the top players, interacting with the devs and just all round having a great few days. If you can make it, I don't know why you wouldn't! Also, the exclusive swag you get to show off is always a plus :P


&gt;&gt;**Raidhyn** Absolutely. BCX is our annual World Championship and it is one of my favorite weekends of the year. Being in a room full of fellow Brawlhalla players, playing games, watching the best in the world compete, going out to eat with people you've been friends with online for ages is just a fantastic experience. This year at BCX we've gotten a bigger space, and we've also improved how the tournament is going to be run so that even the most novice players can play a bunch of games and compete in the World Championship.

My anxiety levels went through the roof and I eventually got a panic attack. But I managed to pull myself together in the last interview and got an internship offer which I'm not so much interested in.

I'm not satisfied. I did 1% of what I knew I could. As I drove back home my thoughts were of how years of PMO totally shattered my self confidence and turned me into a pussy unable to stand up for myself.

I'm on day 6 now. It's the longest I've reached in years. I was proud of it until today. Maybe I thought 6 days of NoFap would make me ace all the interviews. Today I realised my place in this competitive world. I've got myself stuck deep in this mud. Even if I make my way out, I have years of catching up left.

Though I'm dejected about today and doubtful about NoFap actually helping me, I'm willing to push away my thoughts and hold on to the stories of success you guys have been sharing here. I'm willing to not let go of the fact that I managed to sit through four interviews. I have to expect less but at the same time be adamant about pushing through.

I'm about to break one week tomorrow. That will be a first in my 9 year PMO history. I got this.

Good luck guys. Love y'all."

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

76cmz6,6,2017-10-14,My [21F] Gf and I [22m] are on a break after 6.5 years slight (nsfw?),ShPose,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/76cmz6/my_21f_gf_and_i_22m_are_on_a_break_after_65_years/,"Throwaway account. Also sorry for the length of it. It has a lot of important minor details. 

So my girlfriend and I have been dating since early highschool. This is both our first serious relationship. We both make eachother extremely happy and both know we are right for eachother. 

Every once in a while we would go through these phases that we want to be in an open relationship, but those always passed quickly and we we're back being happy with eachother and even sometimes happier and more in love. 

This is our last year in college and she is going through one of these phases. Although it went a lot farther and longer then before. She decided she wants a break for a little bit to ""find herself"" and ""become more independent"". She still wasn't exactly sure why she just said she's confused. 

She recently started a new internship within her major and she hates it so much. I thinking she's starting to regret her major. I definitely think the stress is adding to this whole break thing. 

Her family is extremely upset with her decision on the break. They constantly call her to make sure she knows she could lose me through this. They also constantly call me to make sure I'm alright. After talking to her family we all agree that this is absolutely not like her at all. We think stress and friends may have contributed heavily for this and we fear that she would regret this whole thing. 

Before the break I expressed my feelings by saying that I don't feel comfortable with her sleeping with other people. I wasn't telling her not to but I was telling her it would really hurt me. 

Every week we would have these long talks about how she was feeling because I was genuinely worried she wasn't making the right choice. This time we started making out hard and it almost seemed like the break didn't happen. She was smiling and happy to be with me.

The next day she made an unexpected visit and told me she slept with someone. She told me she got blackout drunk and I think she was talked into it by a friend. Then she told me she bled on him and didn't even finish so she clearly didn't like it. She said regretted hurting me but is relieved to know what its like being with someone else. 

I told her I need time to think because I was hurt she slept with someone and she understood. I also asked her if I was OK with it would she want to get back together and she said she still wasn't  ready. After thinking about it for a while I'm not really mad she slept with someone I mean it was just meaningless sex and it was cheating because we're on a break. However I am upset that she still did even though she knew it would hurt me. If she wanted to do it so bad with someone else she really should have just told me straight up. I asked her many times if that's what she wanted and she always said ""I really don't want to sleep with someone else but if it happens then it happens"". 

I decided that I could eventually forgive her but can't forgive her now that were not dating. If she comes back and is able to show she cares about us and is willing to try to save our relationship then Im sure I could really forgive her. 

She constantly tells me that she wants to end up with me and that she loves me very much and I know she's means it because she's on the brink of tears and I can tell its really hard for her during this. 

Meanwhile I havent been OK. Ive been in shock and confused about this whole thing because we we're so happy like 2 months ago.  I havent been able to eat or focus in class. I lost 16lbs in 2 weeks and my hangovers have been atrocious. After finding out she slept with someone it became clear that this is could be my last chance to sleep with someone else. I want to try it but I really don't know if I'll be able to. 

The break has been going for 3 weeks and I'm not sure what do for the next step. She probably thinks I hate her for sleeping with someone, but she has no idea what I'm thinking because I stopped talking with her to give her space. 

TL;DR my girlfriend that loves me very much wants a break and eventually get back together."
76czcl,66,2017-10-14,"Hello from the other side! Penelope’s birth story, induction, epidural, a little traumatic",lahdeedahdee,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/76czcl/hello_from_the_other_side_penelopes_birth_story/,"It’s been a month on the other side and I’m finally getting time to write this out!

I was due on 9/4. I had an appointment at 40+3, when my doctor and I discussed induction. I was completely closed and had been having contractions on and off for the past week and a half.  I went in the next day for an NST, which she passed with flying colors, and had one last scan to check my fluid levels, which were on the low side, but not so low that she was concerned. LO was estimated to be 9 lbs, 12 oz. She scheduled the induction for Monday, 9/11, when I would be 41 weeks exactly. 

DH and I arrived at the hospital at 8 pm for my induction. I was 1 cm, so they decided to insert a Foley bulb catheter, IV antibiotics (I was GBS+) and started me on a very low dose of pitocin. Happily, once the Foley was in, my body was like OH YEAH THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO DO and I started progressing on my own. I was kept on a very low dose of pitocin (I think the highest I got was 6 or 8).

Around 10:30, the contractions had progressed to where I couldn’t do anything but try and breathe. I asked for the epidural and was told the anesthesiologist was in surgery but would be out within an hour. My nurse (thank God for Ashley, she might be an actual angel) suggested using the bathroom and trying to take a lap of the room, because I would be confined to bed once the epidural was placed. I used the bathroom, threw up a couple of times, and walked about ten feet before I was noped the fuck out of that and got back into bed. The anesthesiologist arrived around midnight and placed the epidural. Holy fuck. Getting it in there was agonizing. I was sobbing and holding on to Ashley for dear life, snotting all over her scrubs (DH had of course stepped out to make a call five minutes prior). However, once it was in, bliss. They inserted a catheter since I could no longer walk.

I fell asleep shortly after the epidural, and woke up around 3 am to the gross feeling of having peed myself. Ashley checked me out; my Foley catheter had fallen out, which meant I was dilated to at least 3 cm, and my water had broken on its own! She checked me, 4.5! Sweet! She changed the pad underneath me and rolled up a towel to absorb the fluid and I went back to sleep. I woke up periodically whenever staff would come in and check me out, long enough to determine that I was progressing well, and didn’t require a ton of intervention. 

Around 9 am, I was dilated to 8 cm and was told that LO would be out before noon. An hour or so later, I was fully dilated and started pushing. My nurses (unfortunately not Ashley, who left at shift change at 7 am), guided my pushing so I was more effective. The OB on call (not my OB) comes in to see how I’m doing, and pulls up a chair cause shit is going down. I’m pushing for a while, my nurse Nicole holding up one leg, my husband holding up the other, when I am told to STOP PUSHING. What? This is exactly the opposite of what you’ve been telling me! Before I can really absorb what was happening, two more nurses are at my shoulders holding me down, with another two pushing hard on my abdomen. I can feel the doctor’s hands inside me. I’m screaming and scared, but a minute later I felt Penelope Grace come all the way out (felt like the biggest shit of my ENTIRE life). It was 11:44 am, 9/12. She gets whisked off to the warmer by the nurses and I start to panic because I don’t hear her crying. I start to notice the sheer number of people: DH, my sister, my two nurses, two nursing students, the OB, his intern, the head of the OB department, plus three NICU nurses for Penelope.

My doctor stood up and came up next to my head and told me what happened: Penelope’s cord was wrapped around her neck, and her shoulder had gotten stuck (shoulder dystocia), which is why they essentially had to force her out. His hands inside me were pulling her out of me. She was okay (she had let out a little squawk but didn’t actually cry, and I couldn’t hear it over the bustle of the room), but they needed to check her out. I had two tiny tears that only required a stitch each. By all accounts, I was no worse for wear, he said. I would beg to differ, sir.

Penelope was given back to me a few minutes later, slightly bruised from being stuck but also no worse for wear. She required no additional monitoring. She was perfectly healthy at 9 lbs, 9.5 oz and 21 inches long. 

It’s been a whirlwind four weeks, and peanut is starting to notice the world around her, which is an amazing thing to see. She was slightly jaundiced her first week, but it corrected itself. She’s pretty amazing and is a champion cuddler. I’ve healed up almost entirely and my husband and I successfully had sex for the first time a few days. I’m catching little snippets of my old self, which is comforting because this newborn thing is all consuming. All in all, I have an awesome baby.

76d0gc,2,2017-10-14,I'm sick of being sick,wannapuke,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/76d0gc/im_sick_of_being_sick/,"It started over two years ago, after my junior year of high school. All of a sudden, my body rejected food. I'd sit down for dinner and immediately lose any desire to eat. I'd puke my guts out after breakfast then head to my internship like nothing happened. This went on for over a month before I tried a doctor; a couple tests later and all they found was mild reflux. Senior year started and while I'd still get nauseous from time to time, it seemed whatever I'd had had passed.

Then I went to college. After eating whatever sludge the dining hall had served up that day I'd leave quickly, desperately trying to not let the various smells of food get to me. In my second semester it got worse. I started missing morning classes regularly because I'd be in my dorm, either paralyzed with nausea or throwing up in the bathroom. I stopped feeling hunger after a while, and limped to the end of the semester.

It seemed to improve for two weeks after I got home. I was eating what and how much I wanted. Then I pushed too far, and lost everything. My condition reverted to worse than it was before. Months and doctors visits flew by, with no change in my condition. I decided to take fall semester off and get this fixed.

It's now mid-October. Every test I've had came back perfectly healthy. I force myself to eat enough but I hate every moment of it. I just started a drug they normally give to chemo patients to help with nausea; feels like it's barely doing a damn thing. That awful sense of queasiness and unbalance is still with me all day.

I just want an answer. I just want to feel normal. I just want to get my life moving again. As long as there's some kind of promise of those things I can keep going. I don't know what I'll do once I've exhausted every test and treatment that could help. I don't want to give up but I can't stand living like this."

I have mental health issues and alcohol makes it so much worse. I finally got on antidepressants which have been helping, but not to their full potential because of drinking/smoking weed. I get horrible anxiety and depression while hungover and the effects can last for days. I’m just so sick of feeling like I need to put these substances in my body. The problem is, I feel like I need to hit this rock bottom before I can truly quit. I know this is irrational thinking, but I can’t seem to get around it. I feel like I’m just making up problems and being silly while there are people out there actually suffering from alcoholism. I go through periods where I feel like I have it under control, so I can’t possibly have a “real problem”. I managed to get my bachelors degree last year, and even traveled abroad for an internship, so I feel so far away from the alcoholic you see on the sidewalk. Granted, my grades definitely would have been better had I been sober, and i did call in sick at my internship a couple of times due to a hangover. Why isn’t this enough for me to stop? I will be getting a job soon and I want to be clear headed and successful in it. I almost want to prove to myself how bad it is by going on a bender and just letting myself lose control. This is so stupid and I wish I could just stop before it gets worse. Can anyone else relate?

For context, I'm American and my family has no history of compulsiveness/addiction to anything. When I refer to drinking, I mean having hard liquor - I'm not a big wine/beer fan and I prefer having Rum and Coke or Vodka and Coke. 

When I was about 16 years old, I started drinking for the first time, and mostly in secret. I would drink about once a week - usually even less - but I would get pretty drunk each time. I was never caught and I never did anything crazy, so I'd say that I had some self-control and was in a good environment.

Around 18, I got a fake ID which with I used to buy alcohol for not just myself, but also friends. I did this throughout my senior year of high school so the drinking increased as I was invited to more events (parties) as a responsible alcohol supplier. At this point, I was drinking once or twice a week - if even - but I never really felt the need to drink. It wasn't debilitating at any point.

My Freshman and Sophomore year of college were pretty much the same, but with more drinking - I'd end up drinking 3-4 days a week and get pretty drunk each time. My friends and I are part of the Honors Program, and though I usually ended up drinking more than them (higher tolerance + drinking on different days with various friend groups), I managed keeping my grades up, still had good relationships with friends that didn't always involve drinking, had a girlfriend, and found good internships.

However, when I interned and lived in New York City over the summer, the drinking increased a lot to 6 days a week. I was still able to do fairly well at work and workout at the gym, but almost every day was Happy Hour with someone else and then clubbing, more bars, or drinking at an apartment afterwards.

I'm in my Junior year of college and though I'm currently able to stop myself from drinking during the school week, I've found that I can't stop drinking on the weekends - I just feel the need to get super drunk. I don't want to do it to lose control, but I just feel ""Why not? Why not drink another shot? I'm still coherent so I can drink some more!"" Or, ""A glass of Rum and Coke is a good way to relax/do work/watch a movie"" (pretty much what people say, but about wine). 

I still want to say that I don't feel like drinking gets in the way of friendships, but a lot of that does revolve around drinking.

Now, I can finish 0.5-0.6L of vodka/rum (35-40% liquor) in a night without eating hours before and barely feel the effects. 
Part of me is worried about this, but is it that bad? 

Am I even addicted if I can stop drinking for 5 days in a row? I'd try to go longer, but every weekend is like a party weekend and drinking is very common before/during going out.

What are your thoughts? And what are your tips for reducing the amount I drink? 
I don't mind having a beer with friends (instead of say, having water), but I can't stop myself from going for the harder liquors or more and more beers.

Edit: I'm now 20 years old (almost 21), and I haven't gone more than a week without drinking at all since I was 18. I've probably drunk (on average) 2-4 days a week since I was 18, but possibly even more now - I'm thinking 3-4 days a week. 

I still have no (physical/physiological) changes: no shaking/problems on days I don't drink, I still have a healthy friendship group, I haven't made any bad irrational decisions or been caught with anything, and I'm able to exercise, do well in school, and intern at awesome places over the summer.  But, I'm just worried about the amount of alcohol I can drink in one sitting and my increased tolerance."

Now, I can finish 0.5-0.6L of vodka/rum (35-40% liquor) in a night without eating hours before and barely feel the effects. Part of me is worried about this, but is it that bad?
Am I even addicted if I can stop drinking for 5 days in a row? I'd try to go longer, but every weekend is like a party weekend and drinking is very common before/during going out.


What are your thoughts? And what are your tips for reducing the amount I drink? I don't mind having a beer with friends (instead of say, having water), but I can't stop myself from going for the harder liquors or more and more beers.

Edit: I'm now 20 years old (almost 21), and I haven't gone more than a week without drinking at all since I was 18. I've probably drunk (on average) 2-4 days a week since I was 18, but possibly even more now - I'm thinking 3-4 days a week.

I still have no (physical/physiological) changes: no shaking/problems on days I don't drink, I still have a healthy friendship group, I haven't made any bad irrational decisions or been caught with anything, and I'm able to exercise, do well in school, and intern at awesome places over the summer. But, I'm just worried about the amount of alcohol I can drink in one sitting and my increased tolerance."

I have a 3.4 overall GPA, and all my work experience comes from the family catering/restaurant business. We work with some of the biggest organizations in the area, and I've learned a variety of skills (managing, customer service, bookkeeping etc.). I thought my experience in running a business would set me apart from other candidates, but speaking to recruiters at the event i got the feeling they were looking down at me (especially big 4). I know how to speak with people in a professional setting, i do it all the time with clients. Yet, every time i tried to sell myself while engaging recruiters, (yes i asked them lots of question) they would roll their eyes at me. One asked if i knew what auditing was (i literally had to provide a definition). Another recruiter told me my skills didn't transfer into auditing, and that I  would have to learn a lot. I believe i'm a strong candidate, i'm confident, handsome, charming, and i have the skills to succeed. However, i feel that the corporate world stigmatizes people from a small business background.  Should i take my small business experience off my resume? When i apply on-line i put down my father as a supervisor ( i will not lie). What am i doing wrong how can improve my chances of getting hired?  Should i leave the business and try to get a internship as a senior? Or should i say fuck accounting take over the business and make 5x the starting salary of an entry accounting position, but work 16 hours a day.

While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. NOTE: all characters are over 18, and actual incest doesn't necessarily come into play. This is more about a married couple spicing things up. COUPLES' CABIN This is a fairly straightforward setup. Two couples (or more, if you prefer) spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods where the fireplace is warm, hot-tub steamy, and walls are thin. Over the course of the weekend, they all start to loosen-up and let go. This might include some voyeurism (listening/spying on the other couple); exhibitionism (showing off for the others); bi-play (girls and/or guys get friendly with one another); swaps; or group sex. I'd be ok with some jealousy, reluctance, or other drama if you want to spice things up too.
THE NEIGHBORS' DAUGHTER A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could college or post-college in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.
ABUSES OF POWER A single mom desperately wants to get her daughter into the best high school in the community, but her grades just aren't good enough. She meets with the school's principal to discuss her options; he suggests there may a way he'd agree, involving a late night visit to her house. I'd also be up for anything involving a married couple spicing things up."

I apologize in advance for every typo or mistake I could make as I m typing on my phone. Also english isn't my native language. I guess I really need to vent since I m feeling a little sick from what I've heard from the man I currently live with, although we've been together for 5 months only.

I work nightshifts in a highschool. Indeed I m in charge watching a total of 42 teenagers, along with another female coworker, since all these young girls subscribed to, you guessed it, an internship.

My whole work team is awesome. We're in the field of education and you have to rely a lot on relationship skills and empathy if you wanna get these teenage girls to follow the dormitory rules smoothly. Since we all get along well we decided to meet and have a little party at my coworker's house. I was excited to get to know my team a little more and have a good laugh/ vent about our job.

I asked my host Emma if it would be ok to bring my boyfriend along and she said sure.

As soon as we both arrived we were warmly greeted and one of my coworker started enumerating anecdotes about what happened on past years.

We have a good laugh and she tells us how at some point she came in a room where students were supposed to follow the rules of study time only to find the girls dancing in underwear. 

""Oh..."" intervenes my boyfriend in a very interested tone. 

She follows up on her tale all about what her hilarious reaction and comeback was when my boyfriend comments:

""If I were you I would have taped it... For proofs ! Hahahah""

My coworker seemed to find it quite unsettling and so did I. I felt a little bit sick.

Then she moved on to her story and told us that some boys of an other dormitory saw the girls one evening  by the window as they were on their table with underwear above their clothes. They were trying to pull a prank on the boys. Things escalated as these boys found it inappropriate and decided to punish our girl for their so called sluttiness...
What followed can only be described as a yoghurt intifada targeting our highschool girls.

My boyfriend leans on to me and whispers in my ear:

""yoghurt bukkake !"" with a fucking grin on his smug face. He is talking about 15 to 18, mostly underage girls. At this point I am disgusted. I m pulling out as he tries to fondle my thigh. I want to disappear into a hole. Not only did he unsettle me but it's pretty obvious by now my coworker thinks my boyfriend is a creep. 

I need you to tell me. Am I overreacting ? Were these sentences nothing but banter ? 

See, he's my boyfriend. He's the person I tell everything about my nightshifts. The ones that give me advices. Now I can only think about how inappropriate his reactions have been. I am deeply disturbed by the fact sexual innuendos is what instantly comes to his mind as we talk about our mostly underage student girls. I remember everytime he had a piece of advice to share about how to. ""discipline"" them. How he calls them ""these little bitches"" so easily when I tell him about a night a little rougher than another... 

Am I overreacting ? Please reddit. This issue has been plaguing our week end as we didn't talk at all today. I m celebrating my birthday tomorrow, supposedly alone with him and I actually do not want him anywhere near me or interacting with me. 

I know I can not build my life with a man that is lusting upon barely legal teenagers when I tell him about my nightshifts. This episode is making me sick because I have high doubts about what's going on in his mind, and the fact that he humiliated me in front of my female coworkers implying he could be sexually interested in the girls we spend our nights protecting and trying to keep safe. I feel like the agegap between us could not be sufficient for himin the future. 

What must do, reddit ? I m lost.

76gd4x,1,2017-10-14,Anxiety Panic Attacks Medication and Travel,ShoneKitty,Anxietyhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/76gd4x/anxiety_panic_attacks_medication_and_travel/,"Hey Guys,

I just wanted some advice on anxiety. 
I applied for an internship to work in America for 6 months. I left everything to do this internship and was under a lot of stress because I spent the last of my money to get there, moved out of my house, left my partner, family, friends, and pets. I've travelled before and never expirenced problems with strong anxiety while I travelled. So far America has been the futherest away from home I've been and the first trip I have done on my own. I didn't feel scared or any anxiety when I got there, but when I went to go to sleep I got a panic attack/anxiety attack (basically my first one). I ended up flying home (Australia), 5 days later because I got a panic attack every night, and I didn't sleep not once for 5 nights until I left. I thought when I got home I would stop getting them but all of a sudden it became worse. I was in a constant state of strong anxiety where I couldn't sleep or eat or shower. 

This was two months ago and I've been getting lots of therapy and I have been getting better but still not to the stage I was before I left. I am not expirencing that strong constant anxiety anymore. When I say that I mean my heart would be racing, my whole body would be tense, my stomach and chest would be sore and tense, my mouth would be dry, and I'd get this awful rising feeling in my back and chest of panic. I used to feel like that for days and days on end, so in my opinion it's worse than a panic attack because it was just so long lasting, does anyone else get this?. I can eat and sleep a bit better now, I can shower and go out to go for a walk and get groceries without too much trouble. But I am still not able to go back to work, or to see people that aren't my house mates without experienceing extreme anxiety. 

I am not currently on any medication which is partly why I've written this forum. 
I have a fear of medication for various reasons. Mostly because I tried an antidepressant when I was about 17, I'm 25 now, that didn't mix well with me and it was horrible me suffering through the shit side effects. 
I tried Lexapro when I first got back from America but I had a panic attack and ended up in ER. 
I know it was probably more my fear of taking Lexapro rather than the Lexapro itself that caused the panic attack, but it still doesn't stop me from expirencing the panic attack. 

I am definitely getting better, but my life is not liveable like this, so I am condisering taking medication. My sleeping in particular is still pretty bad. I usually have no troubles getting to sleep but then I'll wake up four hours later and can't get back to sleep and have a lot of nightmares and experience shortness of breath at night. I have a friend who is in a similar boat to me, but she is on four different types of medication, one that's an anti anxiety, one that helps her sleep, one that's a mood stabiliser and I think one for panic attacks. That really scares me. I'm scared of medication as it is so I don't want to be on four, and because of my fear of medication I wouldn't be able to take Lexapro just on its own because it will increase my panic attacks and I probably won't be able to sleep so I am at a draw here as to what I should do. 

I just wanted to hear people's expirences/opinions on medication and recovery without medication, or things that helped them to get better?. By just doing CBT therapy I feel like I have improved a lot. But my therapist basically tells me that a thought will pop into my head and then I'll feel anxious, and the whole idea is to dispute the thought to reduce the anxiety. Wheras sometimes I will feel really anxious about something really stupid like watching cartoons on TV and it doesn't feel like I am thinking about anything, and this makes me wonder if eventually I will need the medication to help me get back to my life before, but I am at that point where I have gotten better and come so far from me not being able to even eat or sleep at all, so I don't want to fuck around with medication and make myself possibly worse. But I want to be able to live a normal life and particularly travel again one day and i am really not sure if I can achieve that without medication. I am meditating, seeing a psychologist for CBT, and walking everyday. 

Thanks Guys!. "
76gfp1,2,2017-10-14,Trouble with clinical psychology internship. Help?,k2933,clinicalpsych,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalpsych/comments/76gfp1/trouble_with_clinical_psychology_internship_help/,"So I'm a clinical psychology graduate student in Europe (further info held back as this account is kind of anonymous), I'm currently taking a master's degree with clinical placements (20 ECTS (course credit units) is working as a student-psychologist). The study itself has gone well and I excel in my academic coursework. I've had some difficulties though with interviewing people, out of stress or low self-esteem and was wondering if you had any insight or helpful input. For the record my social life (or social interaction) is fine even though I‘m somewhat of an introvert.

I started my study in the fall of 2016 and had my first placement this spring at The Psychiatric Ward of the National Hospital. My mentor (psychologist that was responsible for me) said that I could manage my time and interviews as I saw fit, and he's very laid back so I kind of came in every other day or so, attended all important meetings, CBT courses I had to attend and everything else obligatory and then put some interviews in between. Early on I kind of freaked out though and stopped showing up. I had a few dozen hours on record but had only interviewed a couple of patients by that time and put off inviting new ones to come in. I was scared, real scared. I've been depressed in the past and like I said, suffered from some low self-esteem. It felt absolutely overwhelming for me to interview these random people in what is essentially the center of our nation's assistance for people who are severely mentally ill. The first person to come in didn't even want to speak to a student, he/she wanted to talk to a senior psychologist. I know that's supposed to be okay but it kind of caught me off guard and after that I was afraid, I let my fears get to me and some low self-esteem issues/images from the past started surfacing. The next interview however (with another patient) went very well though as that person was open and optimistic about the whole thing but it was too late. Everything ended with me just abandoning everything and then calling my mentor 3 weeks later (after effectively going off the radar) and wanting to mend things, he said it was kind of too late (understandably) and that my internship was over. I knew it already but it felt pretty shitty, I had messed it up.

After that semester I had flunked some ECTS which had essentially set my graduation back a year. I'm set to finish now in 2019. I took this fall off and just went to work a bit. I start back in January, basically starting my internship again and some research courses I had also not finished last spring.
I don't know where I'll be placed for my next internship but I'm scared shitless this will happen again. I'm trying to work on the low self-esteem stuff and my depression. I'm trying to improve my diet (I'm way overweight) and things are going good for now. I also know that a partial reason for me messing up the last time were some very bad sleep habits. I'm gonna try improving those, they've been a constant problem the last few years while studying. But I'm just so afraid that I'll stiffen up again and run away. Okay, I'm not going to run away again, that would be career suicide. But I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it and just mess it up. I've had real problems with improving my sleep patterns and even have a really hard time of going to school at 8 am or going to work in the morning (mostly just work night shifts though). I feel so intensely that I'm on the edge of entering a new field and it just feels a bit threatening somehow. I get so anxious because of these issues that I have a hard time preparing for interviews and I don't know what to do. Do you have *any* ideas on what might help me? This must've happened to people before me. If someone has any help to offer, I would be most grateful. 

Thanks
xoxo

I had a very normal dating life as a young teenager, and come from a very traditional family who would PREFER for me to wait to have sex until marriage, but realistically my parents said I should wait until I feel 100% comfortable with someone who I am in a committed relationship with.

I always held off on physical affection just because it comes unnatural to me. I like my personal space, and physical affection is my LAST love language. 

I started dating someone very mentally ill my senior year of high school. To make a long story short, he refused to touch me at all (wouldn't even hug me), and self-harmed whenever I didn't give him attention. When I broke up with him he attempted to kill himself. He survived, was committed to a mental hospital, and three weeks after he got out not only did he have a new girlfriend, but they were MAKING OUT in the hallway. I remember feeling so GROSS about myself. I already felt guilty he hurt himself, and this made me feel beyond undesirable.

I didn't date for a long time after that, but when I did this guy was worse. I admired him that he took things slow. I even curved him when he first tried to kiss me and he was patient enough to wait another date. But as soon as we were official? He would wait until I was drunk to try and initiate sex. Yell at me if I wouldn't put out in PUBLIC PLACES. Not a good guy, broke up with him.

So here I am... more afraid of physical affection than ever. Even holding hands makes me feel like I am a huge slut. I hate that. So here is where I tried to change.

I've known this guy since high school, we became friends in college and mildly flirt with each other. I intern at a magazine downtown and my editor told me I could leave early, but I didn't have a ride until 5 PM. I'd be stuck in the office for 6 hours by myself. I complained to this guy and he offered me a ride home.

I told him I'd buy him lunch because I knew it was quite the drive. He picked me up, we went to a coffee shop, and when we got back to my apartment I offered him to stay for wine and watch a movie. Three glasses in I was pretty tipsy, we ended up cuddling on my couch.

By the end of the night we were basically laying on top of each other laughing and watching tv, he finally left around 4 AM. No kissing, no sex. But as soon as he left I felt that GROSS feeling again. Like I did something wrong. Like I was doing something majorly inappropriate.

What do I do? Is it because of my two bad dating experiences? Is this normal for someone inexperienced (I've never actually had PIV sex before)? All of my previous sexual encounters with my ex were very negative. Idk. I just need advice. I feel so dirty and gross.

**tl;dr:** Had two bad ex boyfriends, one was abusive and the other pressured me for sex. Now physical affection makes me feel dirty. Had a guy over for a movie, we cuddled on the couch, and now I can't shake the feeling that I did something wrong. Need advice."

You have a lucrative medical malpractice business, allowing a lifestyle with all the trappings of success: a driver to chauffeur you around, a large home with an immense home theater, a personal shopper who has helped you purchase hundreds of suits (some of them lucky), etc.  You toil in relative anonymity, save the occasional mention in some geeky law publication.  

Then DNA analysis is perfected, and you start dabbling in wrongful conviction.  By screening cases carefully (those where there is biological evidence to be re-analyzed) the win percentage is high.  Victories are sudden and instantaneous once the analysis comes back supporting the defendant's claims (contradicting the state's case at trial).  And the public's appetite for these cases is large as both a human interest story and a social justice cautionary tale of the imperfections in our system of jurisprudence.  These cases get wide press coverage, you find yourself giving press conferences and you are the subject of numerous laudatory news articles and profiles describing the good you are doing.  Your fame starts to grow and your ego is stoked.  And your contingency percentage of settlements of civil suits related to these exonerations is huge.  Authorities don't fight these cases, they settle in order to maintain the appearance of fairness and to take the cases out of the public eye.  You start to expand into cases with mainly eyewitness testimony supporting conviction, where you can attack the witnesses and get them to recant.  Things are going pretty well, you win about 50% of these types of cases.  You create a myth of invincibility by claiming yo never represent guilty people, and your track record is somehow enshrined as all wins.  You are solicited frequently by prisoners and their families to take new cases.  Normally you don't give these people the time of day.

Now comes a cable TV phenomenon, ""Making a Murderer"".  Millions of people have binge watched this series and been swayed to sympathy for the protagonist, Steven Avery.  A groundswell of support for him is spontaneously sweeping social media and the country.  It is a sensation.  You know the name from prior solicitation of you, and your interns implore you to watch the movie yourself.  You do and your marketing genes kick into high gear.  It is obvious this could be the biggest case since OJ in terms of the public consciousness.  You contact the filmmakers and they are interested in continuing their gravy train by following the story forward.  You contact Avery's people and offer your services, and contracts are signed with both them and the filmmakers.  You start tweeting meaningless and unfounded declarations supporting Avery, and your followers blow up overnight.  There are now tens of thousands of adoring fans imploring you to right this wrong, and hanging on every word in each eagerly anticipated tweet.  Things are going fantastically well, better than you could have imagined.  Your name is a household word.

Then you have to start lawyering.

The case is shit.  There is no avenue for a DNA exoneration.  There is no eyewitness testimony that damned Avery.  There is a wealth of both physical and circumstantial evidence, far more than most murder convictions.  Despite the public perception created by the movie that much of the evidence has the taint of police wrongdoing, there is zero actual evidence supporting that.  The case is 11 years old (new evidence is doubtful), and numerous appeals have been adjudicated against Avery and already exhausted the typical defense lines of procedural error and ineffective assistance of counsel.  You keep tweeting out a narrative of bravado, making unsupported claims of airtight alibis, foolproof knowledge of the actual killer, new evidentiary discoveries, and new witnesses coming forward.  Your Hail Mary strategy is intended to scare conspirators into coming forward, should they exist.  You wait and delay and tweet.  You request more time on the pending appeal started by Avery.

Eventually you have to start filing things.

You file a motion for new testing.  You make a big splash by hand-delivering the motion to the courthouse, and hold court on the sidewalk outside.  You trot out your cliches saying guilty men don't agree to testing,  and that this will be the most comprehensive analytical investigation of all time, exposing Avery to grave risk were he actually guilty.  In fact, your slate of proposed tests is designed to pretty uniformly avoid finding new inculpatory evidence, and is pretty much a fishing expedition designed to try to find extraneous data that will muddy the waters and allow for argument of doubt.  One exception that puts Avery at some risk is the request to test the age of the blood to see if it matches the vial date or the crime date.  This has the possibility of supporting the previous EDTA testing that placed Avery in the vehicle.  But the precision of these tests is low enough that an argument could be made against a result negative to your client.

Your motion has the desired effect with the public, who question why the state would not want to take your offer of performing these tests to finally find ""the truth"".  You are in no hurry though, and continue the twitter campaign.  The case is fading from the public consciousness, save the occasional gossipy story about Avery girl friends.  And there have been some negative reactions to your testing motion, as many people expected for some reason that you would make a filing encompassing all the things you promised in your tweets.  No publicity is bad publicity though, as long as they spell your name right.

Months go by and you buy more time by working out a deal with the state to allow access to trial evidence already promised by the trial judge (blood samples) plus a couple more (key and hood latch swab).  Eventually you will have to make some claim to the court, but you put this off for another 6 months, and decide not to actually test the blood evidence.

The filing you finally have to make is a bloated collection of theory, speculation, unfounded claims, and character assassination of the trial prosecutor.  The expensive reports you bought from experts don't go far enough to support your theories, but you make claims extending their findings.  It is a steaming pile of shit, and even your most ardent supporters question where the beef is.  It bears no relation to the braggadocio twitter campaign promising exoneration and redemption for your client, has jurisdiction issues, and fails to provide legal arguments and citations as to why your main ""determinations"" have not been previously waived.

After four more months, the judge shoots down your new trial request, citing the jurisdiction and waiver issues, and pointing out that your own experts don't actually support the claims you make.  After nearly two years, you are back at square one, having made no progress, and can only tweet about ""new evidence"", intentions to amend the filing, bad judges and an unfair system hiding from the truth.

You have been on a downhill slide for more than a year.  Your legal work in the case has been laughable and embarrassing by any valid standard.  You have identified no promising or even pursuable legal lines to advance the case.  New publicity you are receiving from the case is pretty uniformly bad, and you appear powerless and bitter as you complain about the ""unfair"" system.  Your zenith in terms of PR you could reap from the case was reached a year ago or more.

At what point do you recognize the diminishing returns, and harm being done to your reputation, and find a way to exit this quagmire?

76ie30,11,2017-10-15,S4E03 Theory,gandalfergrigio,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/76ie30/s4e03_theory/,"I think they’re trying to make us believe that what happens in the two months after is about the baby. I think every hint they dropped is misleading. 

In the bathroom scene with Annalise and Laurel, the latter pointed out, out of the blue, that her baby is a boy, with the statement not being related to anything regarding the conversation with Annalise.
Fast-forward to Laurel in the hospital and we have Michaela staring at the nursery and asking the therapist if “he’s dead”.
On the hype of the episode one would say that, given the baby is a boy, Michaela must be referring to him.
BUT.
She adds: “everyone around us dies”. 
The us is obviously the Keating 4 (I believe Annalise, Bonnie and Frank can be considered in the us but let’s just take the four of them in consideration for now) which means that, if we believe that the dead HE is not the baby (as they’re trying too hard to lead us toward that), then it can’t be someone from the group, as ‘around’ means not inside and therefore not a member of the group. But if we also take into consideration the fact that the baby is unborn (therefore in Laurel’s belly) it isn’t part of an outside either. I would include the baby as part of the group as well and this would also mean that he isn’t dead. 

I believe the baby’s status is still something that has to be investigated but I don’t think he’s dead. I’m also pretty certain none of the group will die, according to Michaela’s statement. The ‘he’ who dies is an outsider and I’m still trying to figure out why the therapist is involved into this (I believe he is a spy). 

EDIT: I was thinking about when Laurel went to Bonnie to ask for an internship and Nate came and said ‘no munchkins allowed’. Could that be foreshadowing? That could also have to do with the reason why Bonnie is on the crime scene."
76jwo1,138,2017-10-15,‘I could hire new grads at half of what I pay you’,Battlement74,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/76jwo1/i_could_hire_new_grads_at_half_of_what_i_pay_you/," Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this story, but quite honestly it’s been keeping me up at night, and this seems like a place where people understand the current state of pharmacy as a career...and if this post helps even one person in any way, it makes it worth it. 

I graduated from RX school in 1997. Practiced retail at a few different chains, held positions as high as market director (supervised the RX part of 29 stores). As time went on, I saw the pharmacist shortage become a surplus (as more schools popped up, and cranked out more and more grads), and tried to prepare accordingly. Which, more or less, I have - I’d been working at a certain very large big-box company for about 10 years, as an ‘H2O full-timer’: 24-hour/week base, but despite the promise of a ‘regular schedule template’, I was pretty much sent across 3 states, unpaid for travel time (sometimes stores 2 hrs away) with absolutely no regularity in scheduling. It wasn’t great, but I usually managed to get about 30 hours, fill the scripts and push the shots while still being short on staff like we all are.  Plenty of unpaid late night hours were ‘donated’ in my attempts to leave a clean store for the morning person. Again, not a great setup, but it is what it is.  

Until, last April, store meetings were held across the market. My particular event consisted of about 5 techs , 9 pharmacists, and the MHWD (area boss). The first hour was a video and rah-rah-rah session about upcoming ‘changes’ that would make us even better at serving our patients, etc. Then, the techs were all allowed to go home. With zero fanfare, compassion, or empathy, our MHWD proceeded to:

-Fire all the grad interns

-Fire all the part-time hourly pharmacists and

-Inform all staff pharmacists they’d be taking an hour cut from 40/week to 32/week. 

Boom. Done. 

Now remember: this all happened at a table, in a meeting room in personnel - all 9 faces looking at each other in absolute shock (except the 2 who were crying).

Then, the boss came to the ‘H2O’ people (myself included). She said she had 5 of us currently (why on EARTH she’d hired so many was beyond me, I thought it was myself and one other person) but only had hours for 2 of us. I didn’t make the cut (can tell you my theories on why not, but this is a 100% factual tale, no conjecture) so 3 of us were ‘offered’ a bump down to hourly positions - no guaranteed hours, and the implementation of something called Shift Bidding, which basically means the person who lives closest to an open shift gets it. 

She closed the meeting by adding the quote that’s the subject of my post:

‘I could hire new grads at half of what I pay you.’

Still, I decided to hang in there, work the remaining shifts I was scheduled for. Until, one day, this very same MHWD happened to stroll into a store I was covering (short-handed 2 techs, out of 4...100RXs left from the person who’d closed).  Instead of helping, she starts quizzing these terrified techs the usual stuff: tamper-proof RX policy, Refusal-to-Fill, etc. The lines begin to grow. My part of the process is totally caught up, but the techs simply can’t Input and Fill anywhere near quickly enough. Boss just ignores it. Finally I ask, totally politely, if I can jump in and do ‘tech work’ to help out. Boss says, sure, but you have to have a login for that store - which I don’t, because no one has codes for 50 stores. She says it’s a ‘Terminable Offense’ to fill under someone else’s codes, so I don’t. 

5 minutes later, the line has gotten so insane that the boss finally cracks. She grabs the handheld and starts filling. I say ‘oh, cool, do you have a universal login or something?’ 

We both look down at the handheld, and it’s still signed in as the tech who’s currently ringing register. 

Boss gives a guilty smile, shrugs, and says nothing. 

So I walked over to the restroom, texted my wife, and told her I was about to resign (we’d discussed it before).  Full wife support.  30 minutes later, my ‘overlap’ pharmacist arrived (was supposed to be 8 hrs, cut down to 4). I took the opportunity to ask to speak to the boss in private. ‘Sure!’ Gave my resignation, which she immediately accepted. In fact, she said I could leave right then. 

It was all extremely civil. 

I filled out my paperwork (voluntary resignation, Rehirable status), turned in my badge and discount card (hardest thing to lose!) and walked out the door. 

No ‘good luck’, ‘thanks for your decade of service’, nothing. 

Now let me finish by saying this: everything in this post is a fact. It all happened. Now, some of you may be thinking, ‘this guy must just suck as a pharmacist, he’s just bitter, etc’.   Sticking to facts only: 

I’ve never gotten less than a glowing performance review, ever

I’ve been a pharmacist, pharmacy manager, and Pharmacy District Manager

In 20 years of practice, I allowed one dispensing error. One. No patient harm. 

Thanks for reading this long post. Any and all feedback is welcome. And to those who are just starting out: fair warning. This has become the new RX reality. It’s NEVER too late to change course.

76kbap,0,2017-10-15,Stop complaining and help make things better they said...,EggyLove,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/76kbap/stop_complaining_and_help_make_things_better_they/,"Me again, here's how I would improve D2:

&amp;nbsp;

**1 - Crucible**

&amp;nbsp;

One of the big issues over the years has been the balancing act between PvE and PvP in a game where the designers want you to be able to keep your character, stats, loadout between the 2. I like this, and I get it. But it has caused problems.

&amp;nbsp;

**Solution**
Casual and competitive playlists have a pool of fixed loadouts you can choose from, using crucible weapons and armour. Trials lets you use whatever you want. Iron Banner lets you use whatever you want with level advantages enabled. Not only does this add variety to the activities but it puts them back *into* the lore and story of Destiny. They all reward *only* their respective loot. (more on loot later).

&amp;nbsp;

**2 - End Game/Lack of Content**

&amp;nbsp;

Raid is cool, should have been released a little later. Prestige mode is coming, and challenges too. I think this is working for the most part. *However* loot should drop from encounters. Taking tokens to a sweeper bot is truly bizarre. Chests in the underbelly? Kinda cool I guess, not sure if there is more or a deeper puzzle to the underbelly, happy to wait and find out.

&amp;nbsp;

There should have been a 3-person endgame activity from launch. Anything like PoE would have sufficed. A hoard mode, survival mode, whatever! But for those who can't always get 6 people together, or don't want to, here's a challenge with unique mechanics to push you.

&amp;nbsp;

Patrol mode - I actually think this is pretty well done. Public events are great, flashpoints are great - couple of glaring errors though... Why oh why are Lost Sectors marked on your map!? Wanna extend the lifetime of the game - don't spoon-feed your audience every piece of content. If we had to search for and find lost sectors and region chests this sub would be alive with how-to videos and guides. It would add some mystery back in to the game. I think they should also have tiered difficulty - I want to stumble into a dungeon filled with enemies that have skulls next to their health bars telling me to GTFO! Then I'm gonna assemble my fireteam and try to take them on anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

Let me repeat missions and strikes like in D1. Some of them are just cool and I want to experience/explore them again. Why not time-gate some missions, maybe one adventure per week appears on the map? Then it'll feel more like a living world and not try-annual lumps of content followed by months of head-scratching waiting for the next DLC.

&amp;nbsp;

**3 - Loot**

&amp;nbsp;

It's kinda hard sequencing these things when they are so intertwined, bear with me.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Destiny 2 gives loot far too easily. I don't want to be handed exotics just for taking part, it totally removes their importance. Their drop rate needs to be severely nerfed. I understand wanting to make the game more accessible and rewarding for those who can't spend more than a couple hours per week on it, but come on, where is the challenge? PSA it's ok for games to be hard!! Exotics were always the rewards for taking part in the hardest content, or crazy luck. That made them special, even if they weren't that great.

&amp;nbsp;

Trials gives loot far too easily. Stop it.

&amp;nbsp;

The raid needs to go back to loot drops after encounters.

&amp;nbsp;

Iron Banner loot worked great in RoI. Stagger the rewards and drops so you can't get everything in the first event.

&amp;nbsp;

Patrol/world loot - There needs to be some distinction between public event participation and completing a heroic publication event. In fact, why are we rewarding failed public events!? It feels like when schools did away with medals for sports day winners... As I mentioned earlier, lost sectors and region chests shouldn't be marked on the maps - make us HUNT for them! If I discovered a lost sector by accident it would feel so much more special. Each lost sector could have one piece of loot it drops, from an emblem to a titan mark to a hunter helm - like strike specific loot from D1. The ogre gauntlets for hunters looked cool and were totally unique. Thus begins the discussion - ""Where did she get *that* helmet from!? I'm gonna message her and find out."" Hey presto - social interaction in a social game.

&amp;nbsp;

The token system kind of works, I don't hate it but lore-wise what are these tokens? Why not just reputation gains? Is it because faction packages can't stack so if you store rep in your own inventory you won't miss a faction package/engram? 

&amp;nbsp;

**4 - Grimoire**

&amp;nbsp;

We didn't want it gone, we wanted it in-game. By the end of D1 we had grimoire and record books, they were great! Imagine if they were combined - We just have one mega Grimoire, in-game, that tracks weapon kills, enemy kills, scannables found (and we can replay the audio/read a transcript), enemies encountered (I'm sure there'd be some cool lore surrounding lost sector bosses), milestones achieved, pages that aren't unlocked yet hinting at future content or secrets? Dead ghosts (bring them back!!). And maybe, just maybe, there could be actual secrets or scavenger hunts revealed through the grimoire like we always wished there was in D1. Basically, the Grimoire becomes the be-all and end-all record book that grows and changes with us and our adventures, gives us the ability to read into the amazing lore of this game, and gives the grinders something to grind towards (member those 5000 sniper rifle kills?).

&amp;nbsp;

**5 - Story**

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like the D2 story had 2 directors - one working on all the Ghaul cutscenes, and one intern working on the rest. The Ghaul cutscenes had depth, character, motive, great scripting! The consul was brilliant, the speaker was brilliant, and I loved how brooding Ghaul was.

&amp;nbsp;

By contrast, the vanguard and world NPCs (with the exception of Failsafe) were wooden, poorly scripted, lacking motivation, and frankly irritating! Really Ikora? You've really only just realised that all the warsats are offline!? There wasn't a blinking light that said ""warning, warsat offline"" that you could have brought to our attention earlier? And Zavala, you ran off to Titan when you lost your light, you questioned your very existence as a guardian, but 3 short missions later fighting the Hive, for some reason, you've found your inner strength? Come on!

&amp;nbsp;

There was a story, and it was better-told than the story in D1, but it still wasn't great.

&amp;nbsp;

**In conclusion and just beginning**

&amp;nbsp;

I love this game, I've loved Destiny since I first played it. But all of the things I've mentioned above are basics that could be easily implemented into the game to give it more depth. There are many many more issues, and even more ideas that we all have to improve this game. These are the first quick-fixes I can think of. And don't give me the 'game development is hard' crap - because all of these things either have existed in D1 or exist in other games. With the budget, sales figures, and talent at Bungie/Activision there's no excuse now...

&amp;nbsp;

Come on Bungie, use your loaf.

After a BSc and an MSc in chemistry and in the chemistry of polymers and materials respectively, as well as various internships, I am finally starting my PhD in applied Materials Chemistry. This is a position that I have wanted to have for many years due to the skillset required and expected to have to do good research, the creativity and knowledge required to be able to propose my own projects or research routes but also to quench (somewhat) my thirst about making of novel chemical technologies as a full time job.
My question to you PhD holders and current PhD students is: what are the best lifehacks and life-lessons that you acquired during your PhD that made your life better and more effective as a researcher and more specifically in the following areas:
1. Literature reading
2. Lab note taking
3. Experiment design and creation
4. Start of new projects
5. Frustrations and hardships
6. Any other category you may think of

I highly appreciate your opinion and concentrated wisdom.
Best to you all!!

76kvnc,23,2017-10-15,Vulcan Flies! (Kinda...),wllmbr,ula,https://www.reddit.com/r/ula/comments/76kvnc/vulcan_flies_kinda/,"Those of you who follow Tory's twitter may have noticed [this tweet](https://twitter.com/WillBusacker/status/918922832863813634) that has a miniaturized version of Vulcan. That was mine, and I figured I'd go into a little bit of detail on what it is and how I built it. 

Vulcan Micro (or as I like to write it, Vμlcan) is a high powered class rocket built for recreational launches such as the ones that Tripoli and NAR put together. I got my Level 1 certification with it this past Saturday through Tripoli MN. While a rocket launch of this caliber holds nothing to that of an Atlas V, going to club launch days is a lot of fun and I really recommend it!

Vμlcan is built out of 3"" cardboard tubes reinforced with fiberglass + epoxy composite. I decided to glass the cardboard since early simulations showed it having to withstand on the order of 40Gs and I was a little worried about how it would handle repeated launches with boosters firing. The nosecone was 3D printed PLA whereas the caps on the boosters were 3D printed using PETG. Both where printed on a Lulzbot Taz 6. The avionics bay had a single Stratologger CF as the primary parachute ejection mechanism with motor eject as a backup. There as also a GPS attached to an Xbee Radio so I would be able to track it for recovery. Just for fun, I decided that it would also have a payload in the forward section: a figurine of CST100 space suit design. My favorite part of the rocket is the 6 ""boosters"" attached to the side. Those are all 18mm cardboard tubes (not reinforced) and regular fins made out of polycarbonate. I wanted to have a transparent (or at least translucent) fin material so during flight you wouldn't see them.

The motor I flew it on for my cert flight was a 29mm Cesaroni H118-CL motor. According to OpenRocket I was supposed to get up to about 2250' AGL but my stratologger said I only went to 1864' :( . However, I exceeded the simulated speed by quite a bit, projected Mach 0.42, actual 0.51. My guess is due to OpenRocket not being able to model the ""boosters"" (entered as tube fins) very well and that I had a slightly punchier than usual motor that I had a lot higher acceleration, but way different drag. Not entirely sure. As for those boosters, I found that Aerotech makes 18mm D10 Motors which when I have OpenRocket attempt to add those, I increase apogee by a little over a thousand feet. Only one way to find out how accurate that model is :)

I designed the rocket by painstakingly measuring the STL model that ULA has on their website of a Vulcan 561. In order to get cheap tubes I had to skew some of the proportions to make it even feasible to build. The boosters have a slighter longer diameter than they should, the collar is a little bit wider to account for switches, and the nosecone I'm pretty sure is correct but was difficult to model. I ended up going for a Von Karman shape about 4.5 inches long. Total length of the rocket is 33 inches long so it is pretty short for its diameter. The fin can was done separately with slots cut in from the bottom up to where they rest. Since the fins had notches in them to go into the motor centering rings, it was easiest to assemble and epoxy the fin can together first, then put it in the rocket.

I had the structure of the rocket finished weeks ago but the paintjob took *forever*. My sincere condolences to the people who work at Decatur because if the paintjob scales in difficulty with size, they're in for a tough job. The red stripes were pretty easy to do, I overlapped a bunch of painter's tape which I then laser cut the right width strips from so I could wrap the bottom section of the booster with it, take off every other strip and then spray paint it silver (I had put a layer of red down beforehand). I had to mask off some more space for the epoxy to hold the boosters in place as will as filets for the fins. The stars however.... good grief, the stars. All my friends thought I was insane for putting as much time and effort into those as I did, and they're probably right. I did the same thing for the stars as I did the stripes. Use promotional pictures of Vulcan to get the rough size of the stars, draw them up in Solidworks, laser cut, spray paint. Except it didn't work. Unlike the stripes where the silver went over the red, the stars needed to have the blue on top of the silver. The board I was using the hold the tape in place left a lot of particles on the tape and the it didn't stick to the silver as well, so the blue bled into the silver a lot making the stars look really bad. I repainted the top part of the booster section silver again went through several more tape stencils for various reasons (more particles on tape, tape structure didn't hold, attempted to line up the tape too many times so it got warped, etc) but finally got them done. All to wreck them a few days later when I painted the boosters. I had taped off the rest of the booster section to give the boosters another coat of white paint, but where the silver didn't stick to the tape very well, the blue stuck a little too well and came off with the tape. Luckily I managed to just go in with a paintbrush and touch up the more egregious looking stars so they looked good again.

The forward section had its own set of problems too. The texture of the fiberglass showed up a lot through the paint so I put some spray paint primer on it which ended up cracking somehow. Some extreme sanding and a lot of time later, I managed to put another layer of primer on (of a different brand this time) which didn't crack, and painted it white. When doing the holes for the key switches to arm the altimeter a friend of mine scratched the paint on the forward section (yes Max, I'm calling you out on that) so I had to add another layer of paint to the top. In all I'm pretty sure I added nearly 100g if not more of paint. In my opinion, the thing that makes the model is the Vulcan sticker on top. The original circle sticker in came on was a different color white than the forward section so I took an xacto knife to cut out around the actual Vulcan logo. That's why I asked Tory for a new one.

So why Vulcan? Another friend of mine built a kit to L1 on in a week and flew same day as me, so why I did I sink all that time and money into building this thing myself? As is the case for a lot of ULA employees, working on building the real-deal Vulcan is really special because its not often that a rocket like that gets designed. Working on designing and creating something itself is already pretty special, and when it is an orbital class rocket that has the potential to really ""make a difference"" as the cliché goes, it kinda hits a soft spot. I may have only been an intern working on Vulcan from a software perspective, and what I was working on won't fly for years to come, but to some kid from a no-name small town who only dreamed of working on something going to space, Vulcan already is special to me.

I just want to let everyone know why I've been a bit absent over here for months. Mostly, I just been busy. It's been fucking crazy at school and work. The fucking pervs are probably the other reason. You can definitely tell a difference when a girl makes it known she is a girl. I have other anonymous social media, and no one knows I am a girl there. My inbox is different; it's like fucking night and day. All my favorite subreddits and dirty shit are on this account, and I've been just too lazy to create a new account resubscribe to everything. I also love this username too much to delete it. 

Seriously, I'll give you one example. Take a look over at /u/HardtoControl . I have partial screenshots, so if this dick decides to delete everything, I can still show everyone, everything. He sends me this ""soul searching"" comment responding to another one of my comments that takes up my entire screen just to read his message. He specifically says, ""Im not here fishing for up votes, or validations, or jerk off buddies."" But, it is quite obvious he is using me to jerk off to. Around the same time he made that comment he posts a gfycat video of him jacking off to /r/jacking with the title ""My first post. This happened after reading a confession that struck and incredible sensitive nerve on me."" Guess what? It isn't even his first post of him jacking off in his history. At least, be fucking honest to your pervert audience. You don't want to lose your fanbase overall, motherfucker. He was obviously just trying to lure me in with conversation hoping it would get to the point where he could send me dick pictures that would magically make me want to magically suck his dick or something. I just told my my brother about him, and I did snicker to myself when my brother said he'd punch that guy in the face if he ever met him. My brother used to be on the boxing team in high school, he's no pushover. If you guys want me around more, keep your private thoughts to your fucking self. It isn't like /u/HardtoControl is an isolated case either, he is just the latest, dumbest one. After my brother posted, two more guys read my history and message me directly asking for advice. They didn't bother to directly message my brother, so you know exactly what they are looking for. I pretty much ignore direct messages.

Let's get back to the topic at hand. Like I said, I've been real fucking busy. I'm an intern at a really demanding place, and I have a really demanding major at school. When I think about my brother too much, he ends up taking up my entire mind. I just need to not be distracted so much right now. I even started ignoring my friend that I was casually hooking up with too much, so she found a new playmate. I'm cool with it, her and I talked it out. Honestly, sex has been the last thing on my mind lately. I've just been tired.

I called my brother. We spoke on the phone last night and again this morning. I'm going to check in with him from time to time, but I explained that I'm not going to be calling for an hour weekly or anything. I'll just chime in text message or Facebook a bit more. I've already accepted we aren't going to be a thing, but I'd just die if I didn't have him at least as a brother. I get how he feels without me. 

My parents and his wife really only get texts because they obsessively message me. I'll shoot them quick messages to get them off of my back. My brother is considerate and doesn't text me practically everyday like they do. Sometimes I am just feeling tired, and I assume his wife or our parents will keep him updated. His wife tells me everything about him to an annoying degree at times. She is just still so excited from the wedding, the pregnancy, them buying a new place to live that she just won't shut up at times. I get it though. I was one of her only close friends, and she doesn't really have anyone to talk to about that stuff. 

I'll be done with my prerequisites and most of my required electives after the summer. I'll probably find more time to talk to everyone and have a life after this school year is finally fucking over. My parents starting giving me extra cash, so I could afford my apartment without a second part time job on top of my internship. They did it, so I could come home every big holiday. 

I've already made plans with my brother for Thanksgiving and Winter Break this morning. I'm not ignoring him or cutting him out of my life. It's just been a crazy time, and I wasn't anywhere mentally except school and work.

I read the comments over on my brother's post. I'm not going to get between my brother and his wife. I'm not going to fuck with their happiness. I'm always going to be his sister, and I guess I'm her sister now too. Yay! blah... I have a sister now, haha. Whatever, she has practically been my sister our entire lives. She was always like a sister to him too, so the irony is he is still fucking his sister. Take that bro! I'm just a little petty, just a little.

I am not sure if my brother is sticking around. I told him I was going to make a post, and I asked him if he is going to respond to anymore comments. He said he wasn't sure. I get it; he gets a lot of negativity here. /u/Shade-kun said it best, ""If the sexes were reversed, everyone would be on the girls side."" It's only fair because the girls get all the perverts too. But yeah, he only came here to reach out to me. I kind of feel like an ass for ignoring him like I did. It wasn't on purpose, and he understands that now. He wished me luck in college and said he feels a bit better now about the whole thing. He said he was afraid I was pulling away again, and I get it. Like I said, I'm going to make a point to drop him a message from time to time just to let him know I am still alive and not literally dying from stress. I'm actually a little glad he did reach out like this. Even if just as a brother, it is nice to know he cares about me that much. Luv you, Bubby!"

I will sum it up by saying that for various reasons I had to quit my residency during my intern year and it does not look good in terms of me matching again this cycle (no interviews yet...). 

I am wondering what types of Non-clinical pathways there are for MDs who have not completed residency? I have been applying to jobs in pharmaceutical R&amp;D with little luck - this in spite of the fact that my bachelors and masters degrees were in Biotechnology. 

At this point, I am willing to travel anywhere, even outside the US to find substantial work... I have had odd jobs here and there, mostly in construction or property management, but I haven't been able to find anything medicine related. 

I have heard that marketing in pharma is always looking for people... but I couldn't live with myself if I had such a shallow and un-interesting job... I really want something science or engineering related.. but for the life of me, I don't think there are many who have tread this path. Am I going to have to go back to school to get a decent job? I would not mind going back for a second master's, but the problem would be if I went back to school and still couldn't get a job after that. 

I have been unemployed for 10months (aside from the side jobs and temp jobs)... I have been applying nonstop, really putting effort into each application and cover letter and submitting 10-15 per day. I have been networking as best as I can as well... but that is hard to do without money..

I'd really appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance. "

76mflv,2,2017-10-15,"Why do I [20F] only attract married men, and men who just want sex? Why doesn't anyone want to DATE me and not use me for sex?",pauly_jay,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/76mflv/why_do_i_20f_only_attract_married_men_and_men_who/,"I just want to rant and get your input/advice. So disappointed.. I am complexly exhausted and tired of trying to date and find a boyfriend. 

Today, I found out (background check) that the guy I went on a date with is married. This is the second time in 2 months this has happened. And this is probably the 10+ time my high interest in someone turns out that they just want me for sex and nothing more. 

I am introvert, don't really go out - so I am on dating apps (OkCupid.. and recently Tinder) because that's the best way I can open up and meet guys. I get literally thousands of likes/messages, constantly told I'm attractive and gorgeous, but the guys I like want nothing more from me than sex.

I'm in college majoring in finance, intern and have a great work history, smart, fun/funny, very nice and sweet (maybe too kind..), open-minded, GREAT listener and can hold a conversation, straight-forward, and very ambitious. I have way more to offer than my looks, great potential in my career, and have my shit together.. so why am I cursed with the bad luck of only attracting men who do not care about ME or actually being with me?? All I'm asking for is for a guy to like me for who I am.. and who genuinely wants to date me. Why is that so hard to come across???? Isn't that a normal request?? I'm not asking for a lot..

I am a virgin, btw.. never even had my first kiss yet.. but I do not share this info right away to guys (to avoid men faking their liking of me). I obviously want sex (badly), but I can not/do not want casual. I want a relationship and to do this with someone I am exclusive with. My fear is being intimate a guy who will delete my number the next morning and move on with his life after getting what he wanted from me. 

So I finally went on my first, first date with that guy a few days ago and I am so sad that - once again - this person belongs to someone else and his intention was to obviously lie/manipulate me for sex (I haven't texted him about this yet.. I don't care to. I give up. I'll bring it up when he texts me) That other guy who turned out to be also married got married in late May, we started chatting in JUNE, and I found out 3 months later (3 MONTHS OF TALKING, no- not sexting.. legit talking as great friends interested in each other) that he was lying the whole time. What if I dated him and lost my virginity thinking that he was serious about me???? He would have dropped me and disappeared obviously, and I would be so sad and felt stupid. Thankfully, I never went out with him despite his constantly telling me to and his passive suggestion of me losing my virginity to him. I began actively seeking to date in May - so during this whole time and in between all of this - I get men who love how I look and my body.. but can't hold a conversation outside of sex. As soon as I let them know I am seeking to date/relationship and want to get to know them.. they drop me. Say they just want sex, nothing more. I'll be honest here.. these men all range in ages 29-37. Yes, I like older guys.. always have (which is also why I am late wth dating, I wanted to be age-appropriate and ready before I started) and are all very successful guys (lawyers and business-related fields). Also, I am a black girl, and they are usually white guys. I don't think it matters - but I feel like their age and background is important to mention, so you can get an idea of who I am talking to.. if it somehow makes a difference. 

Overall.. I feel like men will always lie to me. Whether it's their age, their intention with me, if they're single, not disclosing they are married, that they ""like me"" and want a relationship but in reality they just want to fuck me and disappear (thankfully I have avoided getting to that point!!) I don't think I can ever trust a guy anymore. I hate to say that.. but even the most sincere guys who I talk to for some time turn out to have been lying to me. I feel like I will always have trust issues. Either I'm the one the guy is cheating with (without my knowledge!) or I will be cheated on when I finally do find a guy who dates me. This was me growing up (and still now) seeing my dad do this to me mom.. now it seems like I can't avoid it either.

TL;DR: Only get attention from men who are married and/or just want sex from me. Can't find a guy who actually likes me. I feel like I will never get into a relationship. I will always be the woman who guys want behind closed doors. Someone to play with and not be taken seriously. A fetish. Nothing more. Why do I have this bad luck? I am sad. Disappointed. Sick and tired. Crying.

I escaped by moving away. I'm NC but we have mutual friends and he finds ways to contact me. Last time we spoke was about a year ago (I'm 26 now, for an idea of how much time has passed).  I have CPSTD from this abuse and abuse from my childhood.

So, my husband is currently an intern with a company that is all over the US, with his team covering the northern part of our state, and all our neighboring state (my home state). Well, a job is about to open in my home state and is most likely going to be offered to him, which is great because we need the money.

But... It's in the same town my abuser is from. He grew up there. His family is there. His friends are there. I know he isn't living there during the school year, but what I gather from mutual friends is that he visits a lot. 

I'm terrified. My husband got ask to apply for the position. We need this position. But I'm so scared I will see my abuser or he will find out I'm living in the area. He still asks people about me. I have gone home, years after we broke up and I tried to go NC, and he was telling hairdressers he knew I visited about me and how he loved me. When he contacted me last year, he did something similar while also sending me explicit messages that centered on old abuse. He still tried to control me after years away from me. I'm panicking about moving now. It's brought up all these thoughts of guilt and shame.

What do I do? My dad, who works for the company, is encouraging us to go for it. When I mentioned to my mom my hesitation due to ex being there, she didn't say anything. She just asked if my husband had applied yet. The boss has personally reached out to my husband. I'm worried it will mess up his job if we turn it down. Shouldn't I be okay? He doesn't live there all the time. It's not a small place. We could never see each other. Am I overreacting?"

[Long ass story],TheTacHam,Veterans,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/76nvlo/inside_the_vultures_nest_behind_the_scenes_on_how/,"My damaged mind had to deal with almost dying in flight several times. One of the problems on a bird was at someone did not install any of the fasteners on all the flight controls on the left side flight control rod closet in the UH60. Now they have redundancies, I know that. But someone who fails to do their job, followed by some QA/QC type somehow fails to miss all the flight control rods. Pretty effing important. This incident is discussed in [this link to another Vultures nest story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheMilitary/comments/70nc90/inside_the_nest_the_story_of_the_sick_helicopter/) It is not necessary to read this secondary story to understand this one.

&amp;nbsp;

My unit deployed to Maraz-E-Sharif in late May for OEF 11-12. By June I was not on flight status for two weeks because I had been grounded recently. My wife had been told by the doctor that our son in his 8th month of pregnancy, had developed a symptom called fetal hydrops which is where the fetus swells up with fluid and will soon die. This is because my wife has a rare disorder and was considered a high-risk pregnancy. She had to have twice weekly NST and weekly ultrasound. She also had a weekly blood flow scan to detect the levels of anemia, which is the indication of if the fetus is being attacked by my wife's immune system. I had requested staying back at the rear detachment, but the company command refused, I was too ""vital."" Yet, they allowed our senior maintenance test pilot stay back, his wife was not a high-risk pregnancy. He also would not be there during the critical folding and unfolding the aircraft before and after transit from Hood to Kuwait when you need the test pilots the most. We had a fleet of 10-12 aircraft and we sometimes loaned out to our Medevac company that also had 10-12 aircraft, so our workload was pretty intense during this time. We work 12-hour shifts regardless, it is just the intensity level fluctuates. 13 - 15 hours for the NCO's. I mentioned we have an hour-long round trip commute, we also had to eat, go to the gym, go to the MWR to call or talk to our families, conduct personal hygiene, jerk, if you had not performed a combat jerk during the day, and sleep.

&amp;nbsp;

My wife waited two days before she shared the information about the potential of our son dying with me because she was torn whether to tell me or not. She decided to tell me which I am very thankful for. I immediately went to my company commander and demanded to be sent on emergency leave. He told me that he would talk to talk about it and get back to me later in the day. When he came back he said him in the first sergeant and a platoon sergeant decided to have me remain and deployed and that I would have the first leave opening when it came up. I give up because I am stressed enough. I was so angry I was grounded by the flight doctor because of my checked mental health history. We are told 9 days later that the doctor who told her was an intern doctor and he should never have told my wife that because he was not qualified to. The pressure lifted, but was replaced with anger over the entire incident and realizing how little my command really cared about me. I was on my second deployment with the company and we had all been together for 3 or so years. My company commander had been a boot lieutenant in this company. I was reinstated to flight status and continue flying. I ask to be moved to Delta Company, my request is denied. This is the third time I have made this request and the third time it has been denied. 

&amp;nbsp;

About a week or two later, my wife contacts me with an email that the company commander's wife had sent to my wife. My company commander's wife yelled at my wife stating that she had no business telling me about the health risk to our son because it ""took me off flight status."" She said that if any lives were lost that it would be on her because I was no longer a flying member of the company. She told my wife that she should have leaned on immediate family. My wife was an active member of the Family Readiness Group, the wives, and family of those deployed, who are supposed to help each other out. My wife was extremely antisocial and was not a part of the FRG doing my second deployment when we married and I asked her to be a part of the FRG for my third deployment because of how hard it is. She became a key caller, responsible for passing messages along. The commander's wife was the leader of the FRG. Some of the other wives were also really angry with her. They had email conversations then forwarded my wife, so we got an email line from them that they considered her a traitor. Their anger was hinged upon the fact we were already down two crew chiefs and I would be the third. So again she was told that any death would be in her hands. Wonderful FRG conversations. We also have no family to lean on because both of our parents were violent and abusive, so my wife only had me to lean on. That is none of the FRG's business, nor is my family's business.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the email if you are curious. I have not altered anything other than the names for decency.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;She was at the gym with us for deployment... Maybe remind her of that.
On another note, how's the pregnancy going? How often do you see the OB? What have they said?
I know it's hard being prego alone, especially when there are concerns. I found out I had some cancer while preggo and CT was gone, but he was able to make it back in time for my surgery. It was scary to go into major surgery while preggo, but it all turned out ok.
Now they're concerned about delivery coupled with the spine surgery I previously had and some other stuff, but I do my best to make sure CT doesn't worry about it because its beyond our (especially his) control.  I have to lean on my folks so that I make sure I don't distract CT from the mission at hand. His guys need him and everyone they have and they need to know he is focused on the mission and completing it safely.
It's miserable to think he won't meet our baby girl til she's 7 months old, but it's part of the job for both of us.
I can't imagine telling him all the stresses I have with the house and baby because I can't possibly risk his mind being on me. I know what they're doing is dangerous because they can't discuss it. They're already short two guys who were deployed with division or late and they just switched dick for cox, which makes things even more hectic.
I doubt CT is the only one with 19 hour days and flying almost daily.  I can only hope and pray that every other spouse and family member realizes that the soldiers have to stay focused and do their job, basically unless an immediate family member dies.  If one guy cant do his job fully and safely, it puts everyone else at risk! It's hard on them and it's hard on us, but that's why we have each other back here... To vent and share our concerns and lean on to help make it through a tough year.
I hope you know that you have people, including me, that you can talk to if you need or want. I also hope you know how lucky you are that he will be able to be home for the birth of your child -- that's truly special. And that whether things are easy, hard, or scary now, that it'll all be worth it and you'll feel so strong and proud knowing you did it ""alone"" and your husband will never forget how strong you are.  I know how much it means to them and how much it comforts and relaxes them when they know we have it all under control back here... Even if we don't! We just use our resources and do our best.
If you have a social, talk to those who show about making sure they keep their soldier focused because we all want our guys back home safely. And the only way to do that is by being selfless and strong so they can do their job to the best of their ability. If they don't, then it puts extra (unneeded) pressure on the rest of the company and if theyre already working close to burnout, then one guy falling out really could cause irreparable damage, which hopefully wouldn't be an injury to a fellow soldier. I could never forgive myself if ty made a mistake or slacked off cause of me and someone got hurt as a result! That would be the worst :(
Well I noticed I rambled on and on -- my bad, I do that when I can't sleep!
Like I said, I hope all is well and you can talk to me anytime if you like!

&amp;nbsp;

I became furious and started screaming my company commander. Now I was not the type to scream at a Company Commander at that point. I was the type of NCO that only cared about getting the mission done after making sure my soldiers were taken care of. I was kind of soldier that had no administrative actions taken against me because every time I fucked up. I would just take physical punishment as opposed to something on paper. But that day is the day that I snapped. My First Sergeant stood there in shock for a few minutes until he finally pulled me off of the commander. I was obviously aggravated and had a history of suicidal ideations (and I had no business at all touching an aircraft, I also had bipolar and borderline personality disorder) so I went to the Flight Doctor and he grounded me. I went on leave and was able to get back to the successful birth of our son. I returned September 1 and I am promoted the same day to E5. My SSG is pissed, we have an oil and water relationship. I keep it professional, he skates on the edge. I am slightly useful now even though I am grounded. He ends up being blown off a tail rotor about 13 feet and fractures his arm. He is in a sling. They make me maintenance NCO at night. A few weeks later I am cleared by the doctor to return to flight status. I fly for the rest of the summer and into the beginning of fall I tear my rotator cuff yet again, so I am placed off flight status. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fun fact, the company commander was off for over 12 hours in front of the Battalion VTC so he could be there for his wife's birth over the skype. Then he got to go home. Must be nice to use that rank to your advantage, because that would not have been offered to me or anyone else.

&amp;nbsp;

I had my SSG who was not a fan of ol' TacHam. As the section sergeant in my company, he was one of four people on limited Technical Inspector (TI) orders. Limited orders allow simple non-critical items to be signed off. Screws, electrical plugs, lubrication, and so on. You cannot TI a Fuel line packing replacement, nor the tightening of the nut on the line He disconnected the fuel line. Which is okay he is a mechanic. Replaces an O-ring. Which is a foul, because a TI has to verify the O-ring by stock number and parts diagram to show it is the correct O-ring, make sure it is new and lubed, this was not done. Then he signs off on his own packing. Which is not okay because you cannot sign off your own work, even as a TI. Then he tightens down the fuel line. Something he can do, except not in his current evolution of maintenance practices. Then he signs that off as well. As we talked about earlier. He cannot do that. Then he closed the engine cowling climbed down and went inside. Now what he should have done is he should have gone inside. Written up that he had done all this work and take it to an actual TI so that he can tell them that he is fucking stupid too and to go back and undo all the work and have another TI sign it off like he supposed to. He also has no right to sign off the 13-1 which is the maintenance form that identifies what overall is broken on the aircraft is. The 13-2 is the forms mechanics use to write all the steps they take. Any Red X grounds the aircraft from flight and requires a TI to sign off. Most critical 13-1's need to be signed off by a maintenance test pilot once the test flights are completed. These are the items that make the aircraft unsafe. Untorqued items, major component replacement, engines, transmissions, basically everything.

&amp;nbsp;

But no, he avoided all that stuff by not writing any of it down, a failure that could have legal consequences especially if there is a loss of life or damage from maintenance failures. Fast forward to the night shift. I come on as the night maintenance NCO and my other day maintenance test pilot tells me to have the aircraft do a full run-up of the engines, shut down and inspect for leaks, then go on the training flight. I briefed the night crew chief, my other NCO, to instruct his pilots the orders given to me. No, the instructor pilot knows best. He, of course, is the Blackhawk whisper so he goes on his merry way to teach the boot pilot how to fly without checking the engines first. He teaches the lesson of what happens when you do not follow common sense procedures and they have to land because they smell fuel during the flight.

&amp;nbsp;

They land and the crew chief comes and lets me know what is going on. We open the cowling. Lo and behold fuel line is leaking. The packing was pinched when it was reinstalled. This would have been caught if it was actually inspected by someone who did not do the work themselves and who just simply wanted to get the job done. Which by the way we just threw safety out the window. This was done by a Section Sergeant in charge of maintenance. He was also an active crew member. So I go to the computer logbook to see all the work that was done as I was unaware of exactly what fuel lines have been messed with. Strange. There are no writeups in the logbook at all about fuel lines. I figure the book must have dumped all of the data which they commonly did. I went to production control to tell them that the aircraft was down again for the fuel line problem. They told me they had no idea about a fuel line problem. PC tries to find the write-ups but they are not there. Which is pretty solid if I remember correctly, I appreciate any corrections. 

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of my shift. The NCO shows up. I confront him about it professionally and privately to figure out what happened. He just flies into belligerence and starts screaming and yelling at me. My other maintenance NCO shows up and stands there as we both get yelled at. I do not recall what was said but I do know it went on for about 10 minutes before I said ""Sergeant, if you cannot talk to me like a man about this. Then I am going to go ahead and take off and we can talk about this at the end of the shift."" So we left and we bitched about how stupid the SSG was for the 30-minute bus ride from the airfield to the living area. No one even happens to notice how off the rails shit is. Except for the Apache crew chiefs who came from about 150 meters away hearing the screaming.

&amp;nbsp;

When I arrived for the beginning of my shift 10 hours later. I was intercepted by my First Sergeant before I showed up into the maintenance tent. He told me that I had disrespected a senior noncommissioned officer and that I was fired from the company. He instructed me to go straight to Delta Company and the orders for my transfer would come later. I asked him if he was curious about my side of the story to which he said no. I left without any further fight because I was beyond worn out. I was passing out during flights, a lot of us were. I just could never sleep enough or feel rested. We were worn to the bone. We were all given automatic extensions on our flight hour limitation because we were maxing people out two weeks into the month. This is not uncommon in aviation, just a factor worth mentioning.

&amp;nbsp;

Afghanistan was not like Iraq. Iraq we were on our game flight wise. Rarely over 1000 feet above the ground. Rarely in the sky longer than 15 minutes before landing. The landing was a fucking rush. Just ready to fucking murder people, I am getting a thrill just thinking about it. We were landing over and over. We were well oiled. Afghanistan we were flying 45 minutes to 3 hours at a leg, stopping for fuel for 15 minutes, then taking off for another 2-hour flight. Then returning the same way. It was brutal. Thick sand was almost always guaranteed. We were often flying only instruments. There is nothing to keep you awake. We were 4500 feet usually. My 240H is only really good at about a 1000 feet. I prefer 250 - 500 feet.

&amp;nbsp;

The other maintenance NCO was not fired. The difference is that he was on flight status and I was not. I was no longer ""vital."" Next day. I was sent to be the maintenance NCO at night in the maintenance platoon. I go from having 7 soldiers to 12. Still no business leading maintainers.

&amp;nbsp;

So now I am in Delta Company. I am extremely happy, I am turning wrenches and learning more in 6 months than I learned in three years as a crew chief. I was screwed when I came in because the units CSM asked me what my MOS was since I was a reclass. I told him I was a Cavalry Scout (glorified Infantry for those not aware). He asked me if I was good with an M240 machine gun. I said yes. He said for me to report to Alpha Company to be a crew chief. So I had practically no time turning wrenches on major items. I did washes and replaced engines and a lot of work, but rarely and of the teardown stuff. I only did that when I was (frequently) off flight status for my shoulder. I still logged 720 hours over three years, which was a lot lower than most of my colleagues at 900 - 1200 hours. I do not recall if MTFs in theater count as combat or not, but I had 560 hours of flight, I never got my damn 500-hour combat award. Probably shouldn't have screamed at my commander for that one. I still got my air medal, but only because it had already been written and submitted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am in Delta Company for three weeks or so. We are returning from lunch and we hear an explosion. An AH-64 crashes on the side of the runway because of faulty maintenance. I think I might have talked about this somewhere else. The short story is the pilots lived, but one was scalped by the crash. We went and pulled the crew out and then secured the crash site. We had to pull guard duty for 6-7 hours until they finish marking shit and put up a fence. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next day. All maintenance must first be approved by an NCO before a maintainer can go to the TI, spread the blame around for the shit maintenance outcome of aircraft falling out of the sky. We have this long ass safety briefing that was mandatory after the lawn dart maneuver the maintenance failure caused the Apache to take. The work does not stop though, so we exceed our 12 hour day and I release my soldiers and ask my other E5 to stick around to help me cover, and he refused. Grabbed his bag and left. He fucked off, he was going through a divorce so I just hated him internally and let him go. No big deal, a couple extra hours at work but the job got done, so I can be happy with that.

&amp;nbsp;

From the shit leadership we had, an incident we had where a crew chief can fall out of the Ch-47 cargo hole because she is not wearing her harness that tethers her to the aircraft that we are required to wear.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I have to deal with an absolute shithole of another SSG. This dude is only more useful than a box of rocks because he can move under his own power to sit somewhere else and be a random weight. We are starting to get into the deep of winter Afghanistan. Our hangers are just the giant Alaskan tents. All of the heaters that we have in the hangar are German and broken. We all try several times unsuccessfully to get them working. I was able to get one of our American ones running for about three hours before it died. The bottom line is it was fucking cold. I never had a thermometer nor have I bothered to look up the data since then, but I know it had to be about 10° or less. You can only hold your wrench for about 20 minutes or so before it was just too damn cold hold anymore. So I was out working. I had two of my maintenance guys inside of our little-heated clamshell thing, the only thing that has any heat. In the clamshell with my two soldiers is my staff sergeant. Kicked back in the chair and asleep. He even has his hat over his face for extra measure. Of course, he sets up his laptop and he is watching movies to pretend like he is actually awake. You do it every day and you do not move, we know what the fuck you doing. I bitch about this to another E5 who is a TI, he complained as well. But as usual, nothing happens. So every 20 to 30 minutes I am rotating my two shifts of guys out. I stay out most of the time because I am running around and observing three different aircraft receiving maintenance in the hangers and then a third out on the flight line. I am also trying to do maintenance on another aircraft because we are swamped with broken aircraft. About four hours into the shift, right before mealtime, the staff sergeant walks out and starts screaming my name. The kind of scream that an NCO does to a private, not to another NCO. I go over and he tells me his grand idea. That I should be rotating the guys in and out of the clamshell. I tell him that I have been. He looks at me like he can understand what I am saying. Eventually, the message gets crossed and he literally walks out of the clamshell for the first time, picks up a mallet and a brass drift, goes over to the cargo hook, and just starts beating the fuck outta this thing. It was like watching a goddamn child. 

&amp;nbsp;

I screamed them. He screamed back. It was not a good time. He did some pretty serious damage because he hit something he was not supposed to. I was on a roll at this point, screaming at Captains, 1SG's, and two of my upper NCO's. I only gave a fuck because I had to support my soldiers. Otherwise, I would have fucked off. I was so over everything at this point. I really needed to be in a goddamn psych ward no in charge of maintenance.

&amp;nbsp;

Thankfully, after that screaming match, I asserted my dominance and simply cut the SSG out of everything. I went to the Platoon Sergeant meetings, he was told not to attend. I went to the Production Control meetings, he was not. I coordinated everything, he watched more TV. I took everything off his hand receipts. I set the schedule for when I could give my guys days off.

&amp;nbsp;

After a few weeks, we catch a break where we only have two aircraft and both are waiting on parts. We clean the hanger and have nothing to do. We decided to watch some Big Bang Theory. Our Production Control Officer busts in the clamshell and just light us the fuck up. Said we were lazy and some other shit, how dare we just sit around fucking off when we have CH-47's to fix, really off his rocker since I am not a hooker. (A hooker is a cute term used for CH-47's because they are a flying hook that you attach shit to and they fly it around). So we went out and pretended to work, the Army standard.

&amp;nbsp;

March 22. [Another AH-47 crashes after the pilots were caught fucking around on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3rR8OIkSpA)

&amp;nbsp;

In May the deployment ended. Come September I transfer to Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks Alaska, I will be on permanent profile in two months for that recurrent rotator cuff tear. 

&amp;nbsp;

[From the Army AR 95-1 Flight Regulation](http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/r95_1.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;(2) Each element of the RAW represents a specific hazard which in the assessment process is translated into a risk. Use caution because one element of the RAW may be assessed at a higher value then diluted or overlooked if the overall mission assessment is a lower value. Also, accident data shows that there are a number of critical elements called crew-error accelerator profiles such as when lunar illumination is less than 23 percent and less than 30 degrees above the horizon, visibility is obscured, total flight time of the crew is less than 500 or more than 2,500 hours, or the aircrew duty day is longer than 12 hours with four hours of flight time. Independently these factors on the RAW may indicate one level of risk but because of the combined effect of these crew-error accelerator profiles, they should be
added together to elevate overall risk to a higher level or appropriately mitigated.

&amp;nbsp;

[Another example from the FAA guide.](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/recently_published/media/2120-AJ58-FinalRule.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;First, flightcrew members’ circadian rhythms needed to be addressed because
studies have shown that flightcrew members who fly during their window of circadian
low experience severe performance degradation. Second, the amount of time spent at
work needed to be taken into consideration because longer shifts increase fatigue. Third, the number of flight segments in a duty period needed to be taken into account
because flying more segments requires more takeoffs and landings, which are both the
most task-intensive and the most safety-critical stages of flight. These takeoffs and
landings require more time on task, and as pilots generally appear to agree, “flying
several legs during a single duty period could be more fatiguing.” 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to make it clear I am not bitching about the amount of work we had to do. My intention is to point out the sheer insanity of how our unit worked us with no regards to the crew. We consistently put people's lives in danger, the crew, the passengers, anyone we might fall on, and the airframe itself. Falling out of the sky at best leaves us on the ground. Hopefully our sister ship can pick us up once we strip off the gee-whiz stuff off. We also now have a single ship operation, a no-no. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was the only crew chief that had two precautionary landings in our OIF 09-10 deployment. Our transmission has what are called “chip detectors.” They are an open circuit with a magnet if a metal piece in the oil is picked up, it sets off a caution advisory warning panel light. It can burn off within 15 seconds or so if it is small enough. Otherwise, you have to land immediately as it means a large piece of metal has sheared off in the transmission and it could fail at any time. I did that twice with the same aircraft about a week apart. Flying was terrifying enough for me. I constantly war-gamed scenarios in my head as to what to do if we were shot at or crash landed somewhere. So I was always fixated on the idea of falling out of the sky. Flying in an aircraft that really might fall is really shitty.

&amp;nbsp;

We flew the aircraft back both times after replacing the oil, no guarantee if the transmission was eating itself up. The main transmission was going out. It was not until the second time we replaced the whole shebang. Two CW4’s flying, one the Battalion MPT instructor pilot. Just kept expecting the transmission to seize up. The Blackhawk transmission holds 7 gallons of oil and is designed to run for 30 minutes with no oil before it dies. 

&amp;nbsp;

It took me quite a long time to realize how screwed up that unit was.

76o5wu,1,2017-10-16,"I went to a therapist and she mostly talked about herself. I am not sure where to go for help, mostly want someone to listen.",Neonina05,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/76o5wu/i_went_to_a_therapist_and_she_mostly_talked_about/,"TL;DR: Don't know how to navigate out of this hopelessness and the only therapist  available to me was completely unhelpful.

I've struggled with depression for a very long time, with it waxing and waning with circumstance. I recently moved back to my hometown to finish my degree after having a year-long internship in a place I liked .

But I've never felt more hopeless, angry, and rage-filled. In my head, I see everyone as purely inconsiderate jerks who have no regard for circumstances of others. In the past 2 years I didn't have this attitude--I was forgiving and little things didn't bother me. I've become very cynical.

I am also struggling with self-esteem issues which was a problem when I was a teenager, but went away in the past 3 years. These problems are back, to the point where I go from not eating to binging, and am considering surgeries (rhinoplasty, lip surgery, ear surgery to name a few). I don't think any of this is healthy.

Lastly, my libido is gone and so is any desire to be touched or looked at by another human being. I no longer desire the notion of romantic love or sexual contact. 

A lot of this is, in my opinion, because my previous relationship (only about 5 months and not official) was abusive. He told me I was attractive enough for him to have sex with, but not attractive enough to date long term (said this to my face). If I threatened to simply leave him, he would cry to get me to stay and then give some non-apology apology like ""I'm sorry you were so offended, now we can both calm down."" This is something I never thought I'd fall into, and certainly never thought would affect me so deeply. It ended about 4 months ago and we haven't really spoken.

I'm now just stuck trying to figure out how to navigate everything I'm feeling. I went to a therapist at my school, she took about 45 min of the hour appt to talk about her own experiences feeling rage and how meditation helped her.

I had a girlfriend for 2.5 years and things were great.  Super cute girl, and we were goofy as hell together.  I literally thought she was the one with no doubt, and that after I graduated college I would propose.  Well during some difficult times, I was studying a lot and I was not as available as I would have liked, later to find out that during the time period that we were trying to work things it, she was getting piped by other guys.  In fact, it was during the spring that we were working things out, and that summer I did an internship. I found out from her during the school year a couple of months ago that she had been getting railed by a bunch of guys while we were trying to make things work. 

This was my realization that she did not care about the two years invested in her, or that I was going to get a good job as a petroleum engineer, she simply jut needed a cock to fill her holes.  

Fortunately I was able to get over it rather quickly, but I can't help but wonder what I will do as I grow older in my mgtow life.  I am only 21,  but I have single friends in their late 20's feeling like losers for not having a woman, and those same friends feel like time is running out.  

I am just curious for the older mgtows, how do you live a fulfilling life in your post 30's while single?  What occupies your time and dobyou enjoy it?   I need your guidance.

### Training
Over the summer I had been living in Boston, working an internship and doing so put me a 12 hour drive from school (Virginia Tech) and home (Williamsburg, VA). Being so far from home and in a strange city and knowing nearly nobody it was easy to dedicate a lot of my time into running after work and on weekends. 

With this in mind I decided to step up from pfitz 12/70 program I did for the 2016 Boston Marathon and dove into the 18/85. Most of the miles that I did in this training cycle were on the Esplanade concrete path that goes along the Charles River in downtown Boston. [Not ideal for the knees :( ] One of my many downfalls that I have when I am in a training cycle is  taking easy runs easy. Generally my easy runs were around 7:00-7:30 pace. Normal runs normally near 6:20 pace  (long runs included here). I did skip a few long runs (a few 18 milers and a 20 miler I think) but as a whole I followed along really well with the workout schedule and the mileage schedule. 

### Pre-race
Night before the race my friend and I ate at this really good Italian place. Had some chicken. Had some pasta. Not to interesting. Went to bed and woke up at some ungodly hour so that we could get ready for our race. Got to the starting line for the race and immediately knew I was going to have an issue with the ole stomach during the race (I wasn't able to use the port-a-potty before the race. I always race shirtless so I lost the outer layers and headed over to the line. 

### Miles [1] to [13.1]
The gun went off and I settled in toward the front of the race.

 Before I talk about the race itself to much I just want to say that I am a firm believer of negative splitting marathons. This is the way that I run all my long runs and in my opinion much more comfortable and fun! (Fun because you get to pass all of those unfortunate souls that are dying in the later half of the race) 

So the beginning I told myself in order to warm up I would go out the first mile ~25 seconds slower than goal pace, second mile ~15 seconds slower, and then by mile 5 I would be running somewhere around what felt to be a comfortable goal pace (somewhere between 6:0high-6:20) This section went really well and passing the half marathon I had a decent ~4 guys I was running with and having casual conversation. 

### Mile [14]
This is where I had to make a very unfortunate stop at my friend the port a potty and that added some time to my race and also made me lose the pack that I was running with. This would end up costing me one of my goals for the race. 

### Miles [14] to [22]
This section of the race I was mainly focusing on two things. 1) Was chasing down the guys that I had lost because of my bathroom stop. 2) Was focusing on running this race just like i had run my long runs, hammering it in. in this section I was just feeling really good and rolling through the miles listening to my music.  

### Miles [22] to [26.2]
Here I knew I was home free and that if I just kept it all together I would be able to really run a decent time. I reconnected with one of the guys that had left me before and we just started hammering. This was the all guts part of the race where negative splitting really starts to feel good. I was extremely tired but still able to knock seconds off of almost every consecutive mile split. Crossed the line in 6th place over all and in a time of 2:43:19 dead as could be. 

### What's next?
Now what I have been working on is getting healthy (I am struggling with patella tendinitis and I hate it. Any advice for this would be awesome) and build my base back up to hopefully knock a few more minutes off my time at Boston 2018

______________full situation: we had a huge falling out this summer when he was supposed to pick me up from work, and basically he was 3hours late and admitted he had his female ""friend"" over to his place alone. gave me an attitude, screamed at me, defended the female, and laughed at me when i was in tears. i had walked out on him then but we ended up getting back together within 2 weeks. but we also had been living together for a few months. I'm finishing up my college and he is wrapping up a few prereqs this fall semester. i think something is still going on with him, maybe cheating. everyday he leaves for class between 6 and 7am, and his class doesn't start until 10am. theres other times when i know his class is done by 11:15pm latest, and he doesn't come home until close to 2. when i ask about his day he's really quiet and barely remarks. he studies a little, so i find it odd he actually spends this much time on campus. __________________my parents sold their house where i lived and now they live in the middle of nowhere. i can't afford my own place or even to rent, so i would have to move back w my parents or uncle. they would gladly have me but it would be a really hard adjustment, and it would also be very difficult to get any studying done there, let alone both places are a good drive from my work and school. its october and my bf will have to move out of state by feb. he is begging me to move as well. I'm sure i can get a new part time job out there and i have the option to finish my degree with online classes (I've done summer ones so I'm familiar). while moving would hold new opportunities especially with me trying to get an internship, I'm scared that he is cheating and that our relationship is already so bad. he hardly communicates with me and lacks the same motivation i have. he likes to treat himself buying lots of stuff and sit at home smoking weed and playing video games, when i don't smoke, have to budget, and love going for walks/ little cheap adventures. ___________i gained a little weight from last semester being so work heavy so i started eating better and working out, but he makes a lot of comments about going to the gym and how ""he doesn't love me the same"" and ""I'm not the same person"" recently he is accusing me of becoming pessimistic as well as cheap because i have to turn down $40 and $50 attraction and concert tickets that i really can't afford. one of my former friends i would always personally text to hangout and she started ignoring me completely and always says she's coming to Facebook invites/group texts but then always flakes last minute. he wanted to invite her to a party he was having and when i brought up these facts and said don't bother he said i was pessimistic and depressing him with my ""negativity"". I suggested to invite more reliable friends instead. i have 2 really close friends, but everyone else doesn't keep in contact or lives kinda far, and he saw my phone and was telling me i am pathetic for only having 2 friends and that i need a social life. we all work but they always are making an effort to hangout when their schedules permit. -______________its sad i am so attached to my bf and love him so much but i really know that its not reciprocated. i would love to move out of state w him, and I've always wanted to move out of my hometown (there's no jobs here for what i want so ill have to move sometime) but I'm scared that we'll move and it'll just get worse, and that he might cheat. it'll suck to move home and be single though, but i think i should just suck it up and go for it. maybe I'm just to comfortable. what would you do if you were me?"

In Short: my girlfriend and I are in deep shit!
Finishing each of our masters in Dundee in Scotland and looking for an apartment in London for the 4 month internship of my girlfriend, so we did the apartment visits by whatsapp. Everything seemed ideal and we thought we found the perfect apartment.
However, when we arrived there, we had the surprise of a dirty apartment, not maintained by the tenants and that our room itself was in a pitiful state. We simply said that with a little cleaning, it would be our little "" home "". after the first week, we were able to see that the "" Professional Weekly Cleaner "" promoted in the announcement of the apartment is all Just non-existent. After multiple calls to the agency, they finally told us that the person in charge of this cleaning was well present and that it was not their fault that it did not match our standards of cleanliness and that the ""dust"" Behind the sink came from outside when the window is open. From that moment on, we thought the shit started.
In addition, the announcement boasted a ""Master bathroom"" that seemed ideal once more during the visit by whatsapp. However, when we arrived, this dream disappeared fast enough. The Bath / spa is in fact a giant bin for the bathroom, the toilets are black at the bottom of the bowl and the shower is made up of two showers in opposition: it is like in gym locker rooms. In order to amplify this nightmare, you have to choose between pressure or hot water when you want to take a shower. After a dozen calls to the agency, they finally decided to change the shower to show that they're doing something for us. However, the pressure problem did not come from the mixer itself, it had absolutely nothing to change and even worsened the problem in order to find a way to make this shower work. The Secret: Light the second shower to make the first...
Apart from these little details of cleanliness and half-functional shower for 8 people in the apartment (which finally turned into 12-14 people since everyone is in a couple), we have now been able to see That the shower decided to drip through the ceiling of our room. First time through the ceiling ceiling, then right through the ceiling. It was therefore necessary to contact the agency once again so that this problem could be set as soon as possible since we were not aware that it was a ""bedroom suite"". someone from maintenance finally came yesterday In the afternoon to ""fix"" this ceiling problem. It just turned out that he just enlarged the hole and that this morning, during my ""shower"", it drops even more...
So finally, in order to avoid having one day or another an open room on the bathroom, my girlfriend and I would like to leave this little paradise... so we are looking for an apartment in London with conditions Much better life (which is not complicated) so if you have something to offer us or if you know someone, we're 100 % ready to move.
At the same time, we also want to continue this agency for everything that has been mentioned earlier. If you know how to follow or give a few leads, we are also a taker. Tomorrow I'm going to see citizens advice to begin.
Thank you for your help!"

76r3qn,1,2017-10-16,Inside the Vultures nest. Behind the scenes on how Army aviation can be. When the birds gently crash. (Long story),TheTacHam,TheWorkofTacHam,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWorkofTacHam/comments/76r3qn/inside_the_vultures_nest_behind_the_scenes_on_how/,"My damaged mind had to deal with almost dying in flight several times. One of the problems on a bird was at someone did not install any of the fasteners on all the flight controls on the left side flight control rod closet in the UH60. Now they have redundancies, I know that. But someone who fails to do their job, followed by some QA/QC type somehow fails to miss all the flight control rods. Pretty effing important. This incident is discussed in [this link to another Vultures nest story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheMilitary/comments/70nc90/inside_the_nest_the_story_of_the_sick_helicopter/) It is not necessary to read this secondary story to understand this one.

&amp;nbsp;

My unit deployed to Maraz-E-Sharif in late May for OEF 11-12. By June I was not on flight status for two weeks because I had been grounded recently. My wife had been told by the doctor that our son in his 8th month of pregnancy, had developed a symptom called fetal hydrops which is where the fetus swells up with fluid and will soon die. This is because my wife has a rare disorder and was considered a high-risk pregnancy. She had to have twice weekly NST and weekly ultrasound. She also had a weekly blood flow scan to detect the levels of anemia, which is the indication of if the fetus is being attacked by my wife's immune system. I had requested staying back at the rear detachment, but the company command refused, I was too ""vital."" Yet, they allowed our senior maintenance test pilot stay back, his wife was not a high-risk pregnancy. He also would not be there during the critical folding and unfolding the aircraft before and after transit from Hood to Kuwait when you need the test pilots the most. We had a fleet of 10-12 aircraft and we sometimes loaned out to our Medevac company that also had 10-12 aircraft, so our workload was pretty intense during this time. We work 12-hour shifts regardless, it is just the intensity level fluctuates. 13 - 15 hours for the NCO's. I mentioned we have an hour-long round trip commute, we also had to eat, go to the gym, go to the MWR to call or talk to our families, conduct personal hygiene, jerk, if you had not performed a combat jerk during the day, and sleep.

&amp;nbsp;

My wife waited two days before she shared the information about the potential of our son dying with me because she was torn whether to tell me or not. She decided to tell me which I am very thankful for. I immediately went to my company commander and demanded to be sent on emergency leave. He told me that he would talk to talk about it and get back to me later in the day. When he came back he said him in the first sergeant and a platoon sergeant decided to have me remain and deployed and that I would have the first leave opening when it came up. I give up because I am stressed enough. I was so angry I was grounded by the flight doctor because of my checked mental health history. We are told 9 days later that the doctor who told her was an intern doctor and he should never have told my wife that because he was not qualified to. The pressure lifted, but was replaced with anger over the entire incident and realizing how little my command really cared about me. I was on my second deployment with the company and we had all been together for 3 or so years. My company commander had been a boot lieutenant in this company. I was reinstated to flight status and continue flying. I ask to be moved to Delta Company, my request is denied. This is the third time I have made this request and the third time it has been denied. 

&amp;nbsp;

About a week or two later, my wife contacts me with an email that the company commander's wife had sent to my wife. My company commander's wife yelled at my wife stating that she had no business telling me about the health risk to our son because it ""took me off flight status."" She said that if any lives were lost that it would be on her because I was no longer a flying member of the company. She told my wife that she should have leaned on immediate family. My wife was an active member of the Family Readiness Group, the wives, and family of those deployed, who are supposed to help each other out. My wife was extremely antisocial and was not a part of the FRG doing my second deployment when we married and I asked her to be a part of the FRG for my third deployment because of how hard it is. She became a key caller, responsible for passing messages along. The commander's wife was the leader of the FRG. Some of the other wives were also really angry with her. They had email conversations then forwarded my wife, so we got an email line from them that they considered her a traitor. Their anger was hinged upon the fact we were already down two crew chiefs and I would be the third. So again she was told that any death would be in her hands. Wonderful FRG conversations. We also have no family to lean on because both of our parents were violent and abusive, so my wife only had me to lean on. That is none of the FRG's business, nor is my family's business.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the email if you are curious. I have not altered anything other than the names for decency.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;She was at the gym with us for deployment... Maybe remind her of that.
On another note, how's the pregnancy going? How often do you see the OB? What have they said?
I know it's hard being prego alone, especially when there are concerns. I found out I had some cancer while preggo and CT was gone, but he was able to make it back in time for my surgery. It was scary to go into major surgery while preggo, but it all turned out ok.
Now they're concerned about delivery coupled with the spine surgery I previously had and some other stuff, but I do my best to make sure CT doesn't worry about it because its beyond our (especially his) control.  I have to lean on my folks so that I make sure I don't distract CT from the mission at hand. His guys need him and everyone they have and they need to know he is focused on the mission and completing it safely.
It's miserable to think he won't meet our baby girl til she's 7 months old, but it's part of the job for both of us.
I can't imagine telling him all the stresses I have with the house and baby because I can't possibly risk his mind being on me. I know what they're doing is dangerous because they can't discuss it. They're already short two guys who were deployed with division or late and they just switched dick for cox, which makes things even more hectic.
I doubt CT is the only one with 19 hour days and flying almost daily.  I can only hope and pray that every other spouse and family member realizes that the soldiers have to stay focused and do their job, basically unless an immediate family member dies.  If one guy cant do his job fully and safely, it puts everyone else at risk! It's hard on them and it's hard on us, but that's why we have each other back here... To vent and share our concerns and lean on to help make it through a tough year.
I hope you know that you have people, including me, that you can talk to if you need or want. I also hope you know how lucky you are that he will be able to be home for the birth of your child -- that's truly special. And that whether things are easy, hard, or scary now, that it'll all be worth it and you'll feel so strong and proud knowing you did it ""alone"" and your husband will never forget how strong you are.  I know how much it means to them and how much it comforts and relaxes them when they know we have it all under control back here... Even if we don't! We just use our resources and do our best.
If you have a social, talk to those who show about making sure they keep their soldier focused because we all want our guys back home safely. And the only way to do that is by being selfless and strong so they can do their job to the best of their ability. If they don't, then it puts extra (unneeded) pressure on the rest of the company and if theyre already working close to burnout, then one guy falling out really could cause irreparable damage, which hopefully wouldn't be an injury to a fellow soldier. I could never forgive myself if ty made a mistake or slacked off cause of me and someone got hurt as a result! That would be the worst :(
Well I noticed I rambled on and on -- my bad, I do that when I can't sleep!
Like I said, I hope all is well and you can talk to me anytime if you like!

&amp;nbsp;

I became furious and started screaming my company commander. Now I was not the type to scream at a Company Commander at that point. I was the type of NCO that only cared about getting the mission done after making sure my soldiers were taken care of. I was kind of soldier that had no administrative actions taken against me because every time I fucked up. I would just take physical punishment as opposed to something on paper. But that day is the day that I snapped. My First Sergeant stood there in shock for a few minutes until he finally pulled me off of the commander. I was obviously aggravated and had a history of suicidal ideations (and I had no business at all touching an aircraft, I also had bipolar and borderline personality disorder) so I went to the Flight Doctor and he grounded me. I went on leave and was able to get back to the successful birth of our son. I returned September 1 and I am promoted the same day to E5. My SSG is pissed, we have an oil and water relationship. I keep it professional, he skates on the edge. I am slightly useful now even though I am grounded. He ends up being blown off a tail rotor about 13 feet and fractures his arm. He is in a sling. They make me maintenance NCO at night. A few weeks later I am cleared by the doctor to return to flight status. I fly for the rest of the summer and into the beginning of fall I tear my rotator cuff yet again, so I am placed off flight status. 

&amp;nbsp;

Fun fact, the company commander was off for over 12 hours in front of the Battalion VTC so he could be there for his wife's birth over the skype. Then he got to go home. Must be nice to use that rank to your advantage, because that would not have been offered to me or anyone else.

&amp;nbsp;

I had my SSG who was not a fan of ol' TacHam. As the section sergeant in my company, he was one of four people on limited Technical Inspector (TI) orders. Limited orders allow simple non-critical items to be signed off. Screws, electrical plugs, lubrication, and so on. You cannot TI a Fuel line packing replacement, nor the tightening of the nut on the line He disconnected the fuel line. Which is okay he is a mechanic. Replaces an O-ring. Which is a foul, because a TI has to verify the O-ring by stock number and parts diagram to show it is the correct O-ring, make sure it is new and lubed, this was not done. Then he signs off on his own packing. Which is not okay because you cannot sign off your own work, even as a TI. Then he tightens down the fuel line. Something he can do, except not in his current evolution of maintenance practices. Then he signs that off as well. As we talked about earlier. He cannot do that. Then he closed the engine cowling climbed down and went inside. Now what he should have done is he should have gone inside. Written up that he had done all this work and take it to an actual TI so that he can tell them that he is fucking stupid too and to go back and undo all the work and have another TI sign it off like he supposed to. He also has no right to sign off the 13-1 which is the maintenance form that identifies what overall is broken on the aircraft is. The 13-2 is the forms mechanics use to write all the steps they take. Any Red X grounds the aircraft from flight and requires a TI to sign off. Most critical 13-1's need to be signed off by a maintenance test pilot once the test flights are completed. These are the items that make the aircraft unsafe. Untorqued items, major component replacement, engines, transmissions, basically everything.

&amp;nbsp;

But no, he avoided all that stuff by not writing any of it down, a failure that could have legal consequences especially if there is a loss of life or damage from maintenance failures. Fast forward to the night shift. I come on as the night maintenance NCO and my other day maintenance test pilot tells me to have the aircraft do a full run-up of the engines, shut down and inspect for leaks, then go on the training flight. I briefed the night crew chief, my other NCO, to instruct his pilots the orders given to me. No, the instructor pilot knows best. He, of course, is the Blackhawk whisper so he goes on his merry way to teach the boot pilot how to fly without checking the engines first. He teaches the lesson of what happens when you do not follow common sense procedures and they have to land because they smell fuel during the flight.

&amp;nbsp;

They land and the crew chief comes and lets me know what is going on. We open the cowling. Lo and behold fuel line is leaking. The packing was pinched when it was reinstalled. This would have been caught if it was actually inspected by someone who did not do the work themselves and who just simply wanted to get the job done. Which by the way we just threw safety out the window. This was done by a Section Sergeant in charge of maintenance. He was also an active crew member. So I go to the computer logbook to see all the work that was done as I was unaware of exactly what fuel lines have been messed with. Strange. There are no writeups in the logbook at all about fuel lines. I figure the book must have dumped all of the data which they commonly did. I went to production control to tell them that the aircraft was down again for the fuel line problem. They told me they had no idea about a fuel line problem. PC tries to find the write-ups but they are not there. Which is pretty solid if I remember correctly, I appreciate any corrections. 

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of my shift. The NCO shows up. I confront him about it professionally and privately to figure out what happened. He just flies into belligerence and starts screaming and yelling at me. My other maintenance NCO shows up and stands there as we both get yelled at. I do not recall what was said but I do know it went on for about 10 minutes before I said ""Sergeant, if you cannot talk to me like a man about this. Then I am going to go ahead and take off and we can talk about this at the end of the shift."" So we left and we bitched about how stupid the SSG was for the 30-minute bus ride from the airfield to the living area. No one even happens to notice how off the rails shit is. Except for the Apache crew chiefs who came from about 150 meters away hearing the screaming.

&amp;nbsp;

When I arrived for the beginning of my shift 10 hours later. I was intercepted by my First Sergeant before I showed up into the maintenance tent. He told me that I had disrespected a senior noncommissioned officer and that I was fired from the company. He instructed me to go straight to Delta Company and the orders for my transfer would come later. I asked him if he was curious about my side of the story to which he said no. I left without any further fight because I was beyond worn out. I was passing out during flights, a lot of us were. I just could never sleep enough or feel rested. We were worn to the bone. We were all given automatic extensions on our flight hour limitation because we were maxing people out two weeks into the month. This is not uncommon in aviation, just a factor worth mentioning.

&amp;nbsp;

Afghanistan was not like Iraq. Iraq we were on our game flight wise. Rarely over 1000 feet above the ground. Rarely in the sky longer than 15 minutes before landing. The landing was a fucking rush. Just ready to fucking murder people, I am getting a thrill just thinking about it. We were landing over and over. We were well oiled. Afghanistan we were flying 45 minutes to 3 hours at a leg, stopping for fuel for 15 minutes, then taking off for another 2-hour flight. Then returning the same way. It was brutal. Thick sand was almost always guaranteed. We were often flying only instruments. There is nothing to keep you awake. We were 4500 feet usually. My 240H is only really good at about a 1000 feet. I prefer 250 - 500 feet.

&amp;nbsp;

The other maintenance NCO was not fired. The difference is that he was on flight status and I was not. I was no longer ""vital."" Next day. I was sent to be the maintenance NCO at night in the maintenance platoon. I go from having 7 soldiers to 12. Still no business leading maintainers.

&amp;nbsp;

So now I am in Delta Company. I am extremely happy, I am turning wrenches and learning more in 6 months than I learned in three years as a crew chief. I was screwed when I came in because the units CSM asked me what my MOS was since I was a reclass. I told him I was a Cavalry Scout (glorified Infantry for those not aware). He asked me if I was good with an M240 machine gun. I said yes. He said for me to report to Alpha Company to be a crew chief. So I had practically no time turning wrenches on major items. I did washes and replaced engines and a lot of work, but rarely and of the teardown stuff. I only did that when I was (frequently) off flight status for my shoulder. I still logged 720 hours over three years, which was a lot lower than most of my colleagues at 900 - 1200 hours. I do not recall if MTFs in theater count as combat or not, but I had 560 hours of flight, I never got my damn 500-hour combat award. Probably shouldn't have screamed at my commander for that one. I still got my air medal, but only because it had already been written and submitted. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am in Delta Company for three weeks or so. We are returning from lunch and we hear an explosion. An AH-64 crashes on the side of the runway because of faulty maintenance. I think I might have talked about this somewhere else. The short story is the pilots lived, but one was scalped by the crash. We went and pulled the crew out and then secured the crash site. We had to pull guard duty for 6-7 hours until they finish marking shit and put up a fence. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next day. All maintenance must first be approved by an NCO before a maintainer can go to the TI, spread the blame around for the shit maintenance outcome of aircraft falling out of the sky. We have this long ass safety briefing that was mandatory after the lawn dart maneuver the maintenance failure caused the Apache to take. The work does not stop though, so we exceed our 12 hour day and I release my soldiers and ask my other E5 to stick around to help me cover, and he refused. Grabbed his bag and left. He fucked off, he was going through a divorce so I just hated him internally and let him go. No big deal, a couple extra hours at work but the job got done, so I can be happy with that.

&amp;nbsp;

From the shit leadership we had, an incident we had where a crew chief can fall out of the Ch-47 cargo hole because she is not wearing her harness that tethers her to the aircraft that we are required to wear.

&amp;nbsp;

Now I have to deal with an absolute shithole of another SSG. This dude is only more useful than a box of rocks because he can move under his own power to sit somewhere else and be a random weight. We are starting to get into the deep of winter Afghanistan. Our hangers are just the giant Alaskan tents. All of the heaters that we have in the hangar are German and broken. We all try several times unsuccessfully to get them working. I was able to get one of our American ones running for about three hours before it died. The bottom line is it was fucking cold. I never had a thermometer nor have I bothered to look up the data since then, but I know it had to be about 10° or less. You can only hold your wrench for about 20 minutes or so before it was just too damn cold hold anymore. So I was out working. I had two of my maintenance guys inside of our little-heated clamshell thing, the only thing that has any heat. In the clamshell with my two soldiers is my staff sergeant. Kicked back in the chair and asleep. He even has his hat over his face for extra measure. Of course, he sets up his laptop and he is watching movies to pretend like he is actually awake. You do it every day and you do not move, we know what the fuck you doing. I bitch about this to another E5 who is a TI, he complained as well. But as usual, nothing happens. So every 20 to 30 minutes I am rotating my two shifts of guys out. I stay out most of the time because I am running around and observing three different aircraft receiving maintenance in the hangers and then a third out on the flight line. I am also trying to do maintenance on another aircraft because we are swamped with broken aircraft. About four hours into the shift, right before mealtime, the staff sergeant walks out and starts screaming my name. The kind of scream that an NCO does to a private, not to another NCO. I go over and he tells me his grand idea. That I should be rotating the guys in and out of the clamshell. I tell him that I have been. He looks at me like he can understand what I am saying. Eventually, the message gets crossed and he literally walks out of the clamshell for the first time, picks up a mallet and a brass drift, goes over to the cargo hook, and just starts beating the fuck outta this thing. It was like watching a goddamn child. 

&amp;nbsp;

I screamed them. He screamed back. It was not a good time. He did some pretty serious damage because he hit something he was not supposed to. I was on a roll at this point, screaming at Captains, 1SG's, and two of my upper NCO's. I only gave a fuck because I had to support my soldiers. Otherwise, I would have fucked off. I was so over everything at this point. I really needed to be in a goddamn psych ward no in charge of maintenance.

&amp;nbsp;

Thankfully, after that screaming match, I asserted my dominance and simply cut the SSG out of everything. I went to the Platoon Sergeant meetings, he was told not to attend. I went to the Production Control meetings, he was not. I coordinated everything, he watched more TV. I took everything off his hand receipts. I set the schedule for when I could give my guys days off.

&amp;nbsp;

After a few weeks, we catch a break where we only have two aircraft and both are waiting on parts. We clean the hanger and have nothing to do. We decided to watch some Big Bang Theory. Our Production Control Officer busts in the clamshell and just light us the fuck up. Said we were lazy and some other shit, how dare we just sit around fucking off when we have CH-47's to fix, really off his rocker since I am not a hooker. (A hooker is a cute term used for CH-47's because they are a flying hook that you attach shit to and they fly it around). So we went out and pretended to work, the Army standard.

&amp;nbsp;

March 22. [Another AH-47 crashes after the pilots were caught fucking around on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3rR8OIkSpA)

&amp;nbsp;

In May the deployment ended. Come September I transfer to Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks Alaska, I will be on permanent profile in two months for that recurrent rotator cuff tear. 

&amp;nbsp;

[From the Army AR 95-1 Flight Regulation](http://www.apd.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/r95_1.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;(2) Each element of the RAW represents a specific hazard which in the assessment process is translated into a risk. Use caution because one element of the RAW may be assessed at a higher value then diluted or overlooked if the overall mission assessment is a lower value. Also, accident data shows that there are a number of critical elements called crew-error accelerator profiles such as when lunar illumination is less than 23 percent and less than 30 degrees above the horizon, visibility is obscured, total flight time of the crew is less than 500 or more than 2,500 hours, or the aircrew duty day is longer than 12 hours with four hours of flight time. Independently these factors on the RAW may indicate one level of risk but because of the combined effect of these crew-error accelerator profiles, they should be
added together to elevate overall risk to a higher level or appropriately mitigated.

&amp;nbsp;

[Another example from the FAA guide.](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/rulemaking/recently_published/media/2120-AJ58-FinalRule.pdf)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;First, flightcrew members’ circadian rhythms needed to be addressed because
studies have shown that flightcrew members who fly during their window of circadian
low experience severe performance degradation. Second, the amount of time spent at
work needed to be taken into consideration because longer shifts increase fatigue. Third, the number of flight segments in a duty period needed to be taken into account
because flying more segments requires more takeoffs and landings, which are both the
most task-intensive and the most safety-critical stages of flight. These takeoffs and
landings require more time on task, and as pilots generally appear to agree, “flying
several legs during a single duty period could be more fatiguing.” 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to make it clear I am not bitching about the amount of work we had to do. My intention is to point out the sheer insanity of how our unit worked us with no regards to the crew. We consistently put people's lives in danger, the crew, the passengers, anyone we might fall on, and the airframe itself. Falling out of the sky at best leaves us on the ground. Hopefully our sister ship can pick us up once we strip off the gee-whiz stuff off. We also now have a single ship operation, a no-no. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was the only crew chief that had two precautionary landings in our OIF 09-10 deployment. Our transmission has what are called “chip detectors.” They are an open circuit with a magnet if a metal piece in the oil is picked up, it sets off a caution advisory warning panel light. It can burn off within 15 seconds or so if it is small enough. Otherwise, you have to land immediately as it means a large piece of metal has sheared off in the transmission and it could fail at any time. I did that twice with the same aircraft about a week apart. Flying was terrifying enough for me. I constantly war-gamed scenarios in my head as to what to do if we were shot at or crash landed somewhere. So I was always fixated on the idea of falling out of the sky. Flying in an aircraft that really might fall is really shitty.

&amp;nbsp;

We flew the aircraft back both times after replacing the oil, no guarantee if the transmission was eating itself up. The main transmission was going out. It was not until the second time we replaced the whole shebang. Two CW4’s flying, one the Battalion MPT instructor pilot. Just kept expecting the transmission to seize up. The Blackhawk transmission holds 7 gallons of oil and is designed to run for 30 minutes with no oil before it dies. 

&amp;nbsp;

It took me quite a long time to realize how screwed up that unit was.

According to Hope: *Adnan stayed in my room and started talking to me about relationships and my opinion on what should one do if religion got in they way of a relationship -- should you let someone go? Should you try to work it out? He stayed there most of first period. Finally I had to leave and asked him to leave as well.*

 - *He was in the far corner of the classroom looking out of the window, and was also asking questions. Along the lines of what should one do if they are in love with someone who is not their religion. Should one – should one break up over this, or is love strong enough that it can overcome everything.

 - Adnan: *You'll probably want to examine* - [this line is crossed out.]

 - Aisha: *Maybe she was pregnant &amp; she had an abortion on Saturday while we went to Adventure World.**

 - Adnan: *Her clumsy self probably tripped and fell on her way to the clinic and caused an abortion.*

 - Aisha: *She would never think she's pregnant. And every time I do something with a guy, I think I am.*

 - Adnan: *Whenever you kiss a guy, you probably think you are pregnant. She's scheduled for a sonograms and she's still in denial.* 

 - Aisha: *Not that bad, for me, for her hell yeah.*

 - [**Note:** Aisha testified that the words ‘I’m going to kill’ were not on the note, when she was writing on the back of it, that day. [Trial Testimony page 253](https://serialpodcastorigins.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2-1-28-2000-fri.pdf)]

76rtex,3,2017-10-16,[ROLEPLAY] Corralling Councilors,LBHMann,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/76rtex/roleplay_corralling_councilors/,"As Fulvio Pelli approached the door to the conference room, he could make out several gregarious voices within, laughing and joking. He even caught a couple of phrases here and there, mostly deriding the combination of energy legislation with marijuana legalization. When he reached the door, he gave himself a second to wipe the grin off his face and regain his composure before pulling it open.

“Alright, let’s get to work, act like my staff instead of a bunch of hyenas,” Pelli demanded as he entered, shutting the door with some force and making his way to a whiteboard along the wall. 

“Of course, sir.” “Pardon us, sir.” 

“Now that we’re all here and all professional, let’s get to doing our jobs. So, currently, this is the status of the voting blocs in regards to Progress 2024 in the National Council,” Fulvio addressed the ten or so aides, as he sketched out a table on the whiteboard.

-----

Libs.  | Vote | Party | Total | Cons. | Vote | Party | Total |
----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
- | Aye| SDP | 34 | - | Nay | SPP | 63 
- | Aye| FDP | 33 | - | Nay | CDP | 23 
- | Undecided | Green Party | 15 | - | Undecided | Conservative Democratic Party | 15 
- | Undecided | Green Liberal Party | 11 | - | Undecided | Evangelical People’s Party | 2 
- | Undecided | Christian Social Party | 2 | - | Undecided | Ticino League | 2 

-----

“Now needless to say, we’re seriously lacking in voting power when it comes to the National Council. However, *Progress 2024* is just conservative enough that we might be able to swing votes from their side of the aisle,” Pelli explained, his staff listening carefully. “I don’t care if you have to call every councilor’s goddamn grandmother, we need to generate at least thirty-four votes, or this bid is dead.” While his subjects scattered, wrote talking points, and grabbed phones, Fulvio made out towards the exit, letting the door close behind him to shut in the cacophony. 

-----
“Hello? Hello, ma’am, I’m calling on behalf of the team behind the *Progress 2024* bill that’s going to be voted upon in the near future, I’m hoping you’d be willing to discuss contacting your canton representatives about the bill.”

“…”

“Hel- Ma’am? Hello? Dammit,” the staffer muttered as he realized he was hung up on. “There’s gotta be a way to get these people to listen.”

“Maybe we should call the Conservative Democratic Party leader’s grandmother,” an intern joked with a short laugh. 

“Eh, fuck it, what else have we got at this point?” The staffer pulled up a name on a quick internet search, then applied it to the phonebook on his desk, eventually finding one Grunhilde Zemmit. 

The line rang once. Twice. Thrice. On the eighth ring, she answered. 

“Hello, Mrs. Zemmit, this is Mark Schmidt, calling on behalf of the team behind the *Progress 2024* bill,” he asked, as if the matter were as tedious as counting spots in the ceiling. 

“Ooohh, you’re with the fine people my grandson works for,” the demented woman replied, laughing as old people do.

“Yes, ma’am, you’re correct. See, we’ve been calling a number of people in your area and other cantons, hoping that some might be willing to contact their local federal representatives.”

“Oh, I can blow in little Klaus’s ear about it, don’t you worry,” she replied with a giggle. The group breathed a collective sigh of relief. Over the past four hours, they’d only managed to convince the Green and Green-Liberal parties. Having the Conservative Democratic Party locked down would push them past the threshold. 

-----

“Ok, Pelli, tell us what your staff managed to whip up,” Alain asked for the other three councilors besides himself and Fulvio. 

“I think we’ve got enough,” Pelli answered, a wry smile on his face. 

“Give us the raw numbers, man, come on,” Berset demanded, anxious to hear it.

“Well, the Christian Social Party defected due to the marijuana, but we managed to peel eight votes off the Conservative Democratic Party due to the tax credits. A special someone had a helping hand in arranging that one,” Pelli said with a chuckle. “So, overall, we have…one hundred and one votes.”

“Damn, we wanted a guarantee, we only have a chance as it stands,” Simonetta interjected. “One rogue member of any party and this bill fails.”

“Hey, what did you want, results, or an ass pull, huh? A chance is all we ever had with the National Council so heavily weighted against us,” Fulvio stated fervently. Didier Burkhalter, the old Liberal, awoke from what appeared to be hibernation.

“Go easy on him. He’s right, now all we can do is wait and see if someone defects. When does the bill go to the floor?” Didier asked, looking about the room. 

“Ah, we vote on it in two weeks,” Berset answered, putting his hands in his pockets, fishing about for whatever councilors carry in their trousers. 

“Then we’ve got two weeks to shore up this majority,” Burkhalter asserted, standing and staring at every one of the others. “Now get to it, all of you!”

I'm a relatively recent grad (year out now...) looking to expand my portfolio and learn some new things. I studied CS at a top 10 public college but did not graduate with many projects or much internship experience (only 1 summer). I hardly coded in anything but java, but in the past year have taught myself some javascript/React.js and worked in Python a bunch. Now I am considering trying to get some specialized knowledge/experience in either data analysis or AI. 

My hope is that I can find some courses that will not only help me learn, but also include projects with a bigger scope than those done it tutorials. The artificial intelligence nanodegree ($800) from udacity seems to have what I'm looking for in terms of projects:

https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889

I'm also interested in EDX's offering because it can be used as credit should I eventually pursue a masters as columbia:

https://www.edx.org/micromasters/columbiax-artificial-intelligence

While I'm adverse to paying $1000 a month for a bootcamp, I really like the course progression offered here:

https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track?utm_source=classcentral&amp;utm_medium=ad&amp;utm_campaign=classcentral

Pandas/Numpy, databases, data viz, machine learning all seem like a good start which could eventually progress into more AI.

Thanks for looking at this!

76sfzf,74,2017-10-16,[FWB] [MF] Asians FWB?,Lilopanda,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/76sfzf/fwb_mf_asians_fwb/,"FWB?

So last weekend I was at my friends house because she needed some help moving into her new apartment. 

I get to her old house and we spend about 30 minutes drinking coffee and catching up. We talked about our weekend plans and how work is going. Simple stuff like that. We have been friends since high school. We had a thing for each other during our freshmen year in high school but she wasn’t single for very long. I believe her and her boyfriend are still together but he now works out of state for an internship. She accepted a new job and is moving out to live closer to it.

But anyway, we finish catching up and start packing. She has already packed some boxes and I start loading those into my truck first. After a while, I finished loading all of the boxes and asked her if there’s anything else I could do. She said yes and I followed her to her room. There was a bunch of stuff scattered everywhere such as clothes, makeup, shoes, heels, random books, etc etc.

I asked if I could start with her clothes and she said okay. I neatly fold everything and she said that it wasn’t necessary and to simply stuff whatever clothing I could find into the boxes. She would sort them out later. After a while, I eventually get to her bra and panty collection. I noticed she has a lot of bra and panties from Victoria’s Secret. I asked her if she would feel weird if I boxed those and she said no. I then jokingly tell her at least now I know where to shop if she ever needed more. She laughed and said to make sure they’re either black or red because those are her favorite colors. I said no problem at all. Her bra size is a 34A and she seemed to like thongs. She was a nice small girl at 5 feet 3 inches tall. I’m 6 feet tall. Not bad for two Asians.

I then jokingly tell her that I like to wear Calvin Klein and my favorite color is also black. She laughed and asked me to let her see a bit. I get a little nervous but I pulled my sweats down just a bit to reveal the Calvin Klein label until she saw enough. She said they looked comfortable and I told her I’ll buy her a pack one day. She laughed and said she’ll keep this in mind in case I ever needed more.

I then asked her if I could also see a little bit of what she was wearing and she turned her side towards me and pulled down a bit of her sweats just below her hips. I could see that was wearing a black lacey panty. I said she looked good in them. She said thank you and pulled her sweats back up. Then we start talking about random things like clothing brands, work out routines, etc etc… 

I finished packing up and start to unload more boxes into the truck. When I came back, she handed me a box and asked if I could load it up into the truck. I said yes and take the box. Then she pulls my arm and asks if I can show my briefs one more time to her. I said I’m not sure but let me load this box into the truck first. She stops me and cups my crotch area with her hands and looks at me. Then, her hands slowly moves up and pull my sweats down. She looks down at me and at this point, I’m hard as a rock. I set the box down on a table and hold her hands. I then tell her that she can’t ever tell her boyfriend about this.

She said that her boyfriend is far away and nobody will know if we don’t tell anyone. She leads me into her bedroom again and she sits down on the edge of her bed. She then puts her lips on my briefs and begins to kiss my cock. I hold her head as she does this and she pulls down my briefs revealing my cock. She immediately starts sucking me and I hold her head tighter. Her tongue was so warm and wet I was seriously about to cum in her mouth but I held back. 

I then lift her up off the bed and begin to take her panties off. She was not shaved but at least she was trimmed. She sits back down and scoots up to her bed. I lay down on top of her and my cock is literally resting on her pussy. I pull up her shirt and she undid her sexy red bra. She had the most beautiful and softest set of titties I’ve seen. She moans a little and I ask if she wanted me to go in. She said yes and I slowly push myself in. She was so tight but I slowly inch my way in being careful not to hurt her. She moans louder and at this point, her legs and arms are wrapped around my body. After a few light thrusts, her pussy is soaking wet. I grab her arms and pin her arms down. I slowly thrust my cock into her with my hips. I go a little harder and faster and each time I did, she’d moan and beg for more. I never knew she was such a freak and I couldn’t help but think how sex was with her boyfriend. I didn’t care at this point and kept on grinding my cock into her. I tell her I’m going to cum soon and she says to cum in her mouth. I push hard 5 or 6 more times and pull out. She gets up and puts my cock in her mouth and I release everything I had inside her mouth. I must’ve squirted maybe 7-8 loads and she swallowed everything.

I kiss her soft lips and tell her again that this would be our secret. She smiled and says “Yes daddy. I promise.” We both take turns cleaning each other up and take a shower together. We talked more about random things like how moving sucks, cleaning and sorting things, video games (we’re both a LITTLE nerdy), and of course sex. She grabbed my cock at one point and says I have a bigger cock than her boyfriend. I thank her and tell her she has a nice set of boobs and her boyfriend is a lucky man. We finished showering and started to pack the rest of her stuff. But I couldn’t help but think about her sexy body and tight little pussy. I wanted to have more sex but I tried my best not to make the rest of the day awkward or anything like that. We continued to have conversations throughout my time there. By then, it was already lunch time so we go out for a quick meal and I dropped her off at her new place with her stuff. Needless to say, we had another moment before the evening but I’ll save that for next time.

I'm a 17 year old British state school student in the process of applying to University in the United States, specifically looking at Northwestern as my Early Decision choice.

I love the vibe and style of the university and how it merges old and new architecture to give a unique feel, and the possibilities of internships and future prospects in Chicago.

Obviously, this is huge step for me considering I'll be moving far, far away from home. So I was somewhat worried by the fact that so many NU students live off campus. Obviously, this is due to the proximity of Chicago to Evanston, but does this often negatively affect the social life or experiences people have at Northwestern? 

Would love some current students to give me an insight.

Cheers

I'm currently doing the whole big firm recruiting thing at college so I wasn't really expecting to land an internship until the spring and not start till after graduation but this opportunity came up and i would be an idiot not to take it.

But..since I was planning on having a while before interviewing or anything I feel extremely unprepared. So i need some advice.

First..clothing?
I was going to do nice black pants and matching blazer but do I need to do the standard button down or can a cute (modest) top work instead? (Oh, I'm a female)

Cover sheet tips?

Do you think it would be ok to ask to start after my semester ends because this would be a really rough time to start a second job while taking 15 credits? 

How many hours should I be prepared to work while I'm still in school? Will they work with my schedule or do I just need to work with theirs and not question it?

What should I say when they ask me about how much compensation I am expecting?

He has an internship 5 days from 8 till 18:30 (travel time included). 2 nights were he has his job, 1 night with some work and another night where he goes to the gym.

I also have school and work every saturday.
I notice that I really miss spending time together.
Last weekend we had a long talk about how we both felt as if we weren’t working anymore. Neither of us knows what to do or how to make this work but we’re not sure how. We decided to keep trying because we love eachother very much.
But how are we gonna make this work? Did we make the right choice or should we break it of now to save the hurt?

I just want to share my story, found this place and here I go.

It was 5 years ago. I was 17, I met her during one of my travelling trip. She was 14, we fell for each other instantly, as a teenage crush kind of thing. I was innocent, foolish and all, but I knew she was the one.

We exchanged texts, and Facebook messages, and Apple's iMessages, a lot. She was funny, trustworthy, reliable, lovely, or maybe let me say she's just perfect. Or more like we were perfect. Our only problem was that we lived a thousand miles away from each other, during teenage, without stable incomes to travel and see each other frequently.

We managed to see each other once a year for three years, until I moved to Europe to study. She fell for someone else, I did too. I went through three dating partners in a year, she got two for herself I think. We ceased contact for a year. I was never happy with my dates, they were just not for me.

This summer she moved to America to study, while I also started an internship in a new place. I'm all alone, no friends, no family, no relationships, nothing gives me joy anymore. Work is depressing and I really have no time for anything. I'm away from home from 7 to 19, and just fall asleep as soon as I get back. Life went like that for a while and I went deeply into depression. 

And then she called me. She told me that dating those guys only made her miss me more, and she wanted to resume with our relationship (albeit distant, as always before). The moment I saw her smile, my life was just good again. I now work my ass off all week with the only goal in my mind is to have a video call with her on the weekends. I knew she was the one, and she still is.

But now what? We're now like, 10 hours of flying (which translates to a thousand bucks of travelling cost) from each other. I can try to graduate and find a job and find my way to her place but it's gonna take years, and a lot of efforts. And she's not even sure where she will be in 3-4 years after her graduation. We know all we want is to have a future close to each other, but I can't even think of a scenario in which we can. Due to our citizenship, paperwork is a huge problem if we ever want to move anywhere from anywhere. I also need to find a job (which honestly I don't know where to start), stable my income and whatever. Arrange a visiting trip is hard enough, let alone moving together. From her side, she's gonna be a student for the next four years, and then she will just face the same situation as I'm in right now: floating through life with all the doubts and uncertainty

I don't even know what I'm supposed to feel right now. I found the one who also thinks of me as her one. I wish that were my whole story but it's not. I don't know, should I devote the following years of my adulthood to get close to her (which honestly may just results in disappointment if we break up along the way), or should I give up on this all-the-way-wrong relationship and try to move on like a normal person?

76t401,5,2017-10-16,I don't know how to help my sister,uniqueeleni,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/76t401/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_sister/,"Okay, long story short, I am worried about my sister.
My family and I, come from a European country and my sister was born and raised here as well. She has a masters degree and was always a good professional.

Two years ago, she got an internship in a major company in America for about a year and, since the position was great, she decided to go for it. While she was there, she met a guy with whom they started dating.

In general, he is a nice guy, but very immature and always tends to think that everything will ""figure itself out"". When my sister's internship came to an end, she had to come back to our country because of visa reasons, so her and they guy she was dating (they were never in an exclusive relationship) had to call quits.

After a few months, though, they started talking online again and the guy decided to come to our country for holidays. He actually cancelled last minute because his ex, with whom he had a brief fling after my sister left USA, told him he was pregnant. It turned out that she actually lied (for the third time) about that and he finally booked the tickets to come a few weeks later after breaking it off with her completely. To me, that was one of the first indications that this guy had something weird going on. If only I knew what was about to happen.

He stayed for over a month and then he had to go. My sister decided to go there for a couple of weeks to visit him, because a) she never stopped obsessing over him (when she was living in the US, she kept trying to make him commit, but he didn't really want to) and b) she wanted to eventually marry the guy and get a green card. She thought that our country was kind of lame and not as cool as the US. We all told her it was a bad idea but she didn't listen.

Anyway, the guy is 27 and still lives with his parents so my sister stayed there too. It was supposed to be for a little while, but my sister kept postpoing her return again and again. After a couple of months, they sponteniously got married because if they didn't my sister would have to go. Even at that point, he wasn't willing to commit to her fully yet, he would say that they were friends with benefits and that he married her as a favor, so that she would get the visa. When my parents found out, they were devastated, especially my mother, because her daughter would live so far, married with a random guy, living at his parent's house.

Months were passing by. Over a year later, she was still living there and no matter how hard she tried to convince him to get a new place, he would just brush it off and avoid the conversation. In the meantime, she started working at his little company, so she was completely dependent by the guy. No family there, no close friends, they shared a car and went to the gym together. I want to tell you now that financially they could afford to rent a place, but the guy would rather spend the money on very expensive TVs and fancy dinners. Of course, he never threatened or abused my sister, she could have left that house if she wanted to and find a new job (she actually got one at one point but he convinced her to come back to his company but it was ultimately her stupid decision).

Another thing I want to say is that one day that he was getting bored at this routine, he dumped my sister at his parents' place and he flew with his best buddy to Vegas. She had to fly there to keep an eye on him and bring him back. (again, she should have left him by them but apparently she is a rare kind of idiot.) In general, this guy has good intentions but he is a bit immature and selfish like a child. He also gets excited quickly, gets annoyed quickly and when he does, he is a big drama queen and blames my sister a lot.

Anyway a few months ago, my sister accidentally got pregnant with him. She wasn't feeling ready for that baby and she was 50-50% in getting an abortion, but the dude is very anti-abortion and would have divorced her and she would have to leave the country. Anyway, she figured that everything would go well (he promised that he would actively search for the home now, and they were in an actual relationship by that point) so she decided to keep the baby.

Fast forward to now, they FINALLY found a place (which he picked by the way) and signed a two-month contract, but turns out he doesn't like it. He actually said that his routine was ruined, the bed was uncomfortable and there was a weird smell (I have actually been to his parents' house and it was the dirtiest, I guess he didn't mind that). He said that it was my sister's fault because she rushed him to find another place etc. Then, he took his stuff and just abandoned my pregnant sister at this new house alone. His mom was really happy that he came back.

My mom got so worried that she actually took the first plane and visited my sister. He came back to stay with them, but still says he wants to go back to his parent's place when my mom comes back, but promises to find a new place by the time the baby is born (I don't know if I trust him). In general, the atmosphere in the house is very negative. My sister is sad because instead of being in a stable situation while pregnant, things are going downhill, the guy feels like all the responsibilities of the world are now his to carry and my mom is angry with the immaturity and stupidity of both. The three always fighting over stupid things instead of focusing on the important ones. I skype with them for hours everyday and try to make them more positive and happy.

However, today I did something stupid. From day 1, I have been trying to kindly explain my sister that what she was doing would lead to problems sooner than later. At this point, and after yet another temper tantrum of the guy, my sister was really worried and unhappy. So I told her that things were shitty, he would never change and they would definitely break up in a few months from now. She would be left alone, miserable, with a baby she didn't really want, stuck in a place with no friends or family (as soon as she has the baby, it will be hard to come back to our country because he will definitely go to the courts and try to not let that happen).

I only told her that, to ""wake her up"". I was afraid that she didn't understand the severity of the situation. I also tried to advice her that she should consider aborting the baby, it's really her last chance.

Turns out she did understand the severity of the situation. She told me that she asked her doctor about abortion and at this point, she would have to ""give fake birth"" to abort the baby. She told me she couldn't do this and the reason why she has been very submissive to her husband lately is because she is just trying not to raise her child alone, at least for the first few years. She is devastated but tries to be optimistic that the things could eventually work out. Maybe his promises will turn out to be true this time.

I am so bummed that I made her already crappy situation even more negative. I apologized and told her that I was overreacting and knew she can make it. I told her that no matter what she needs, her family would be by her side  and that we all love her very much. I aksed my mother to try and be extra nice and supportive to her while she is still there and she agreed. I still feel like shit! That poor thing!

Anyway, I don't know what to do, I don't know how to help her, she is just so far away and alone with someone she can't really count on. And she is not very motherly anyway, she has told me that so many times. She has told me how she doesn't feel ready for a baby at all. She is very young, healthy, pretty, with great degrees and our family is quite comfortable with money... she could have a happy life at her own pace. I know she is paying dor her own mistakes, but she is my sister and I am so, so sad for her unhappiness. I can here her suffering from her voice."

Breastfeeding issues and jaundice, plus some mom post-partum anxiety and mental illness.

[Baby tax.](https://imgur.com/a/1duip)

This story is extremely long because I will be using it in my journal, sorry in advance.  It’s also about a week late but today (although this longass story will be written over several days, in between boobs and poop and pees and screams) is the first day i haven’t felt like I was falling apart.  It’s been a really hard first week and a half for me.

So the actual birth.  All week leading up to my due date and especially the weekend (October 2) I had been exhausted.  Literally sleeping alllll day.  Sunday, my lymph nodes in my neck were super swollen and I was again so sleepy I was sure I was getting sick.  I kept googling if this was a sign of labor, but everything just said ‘flu-like symptoms’ and nothing mentioned actual lymph nodes being swollen so I was bummed.  I was positive I was going to be overdue.  

Quick background.  This is my first baby and I’m a little older (35).  My husband has a 9 year old, so he’s done the baby thing before.  I can’t say that I had a rough pregnancy because I’d had no major complications, but I felt like garbage pretty much the whole time.  More importantly, I kept having to go in to get ultrasounds.  First, they couldn’t see the baby’s foot, then they thought that it might be clubbed once they could see it.  During one of those foot ultrasounds, they found that she was measuring super small, 9th percentile.  Cue me beginning to be really anxious around week 28.  I stopped working out (I was doing a lot of very low low impact stuff like walking and swimming) and just started eating whatever.  She eventually increased up top something like 35th percentile, but there was a lot of stressful waiting in between.  I was constantly worried.  I do have a history of anxiety disorder and have been on a low dose of medication through my pregnancy.

So my lymph nodes were swollen, then on Monday I woke up and felt a little better from all of the sleeping but was still really tired.  The night before I felt like I was leaking discharge a bit more than usual, so I spent the night googling ‘leaking amniotic fluid’ but determined that it was just discharge.  I went to the bathroom and then back to bed for a minute around 8:30 am, and while I was in bed my water broke.  There was no ‘maybe’ about it.  I went to the toilet and my underwear was soaked, I felt the mucous plug come out and more fluid came out on the potty.  So all of that googling for nothing, you definitely know when it breaks!

This was a day before my due date.  We called the OB and she told us to head to triage.  We live very close to the hospital so I took my time eating a ton of food and taking a shower.  My husband was super anxious, it was cute.  We loaded up the car and headed over.  At this point I had no bloody show. They asked me for a pee sample and when I worked on that I started bleeding.  I was having zero contractions, maybe veeeery faint ones, so after placing an IV they transferred me over to the labor room and started Pitocin and fluids.  Putting the IV in was terrible.  I have medically related Vaso-Vagel response, meaning I pass out when I get shots and the like, sometimes a bit after, its not really fainting but sort of seizure-like.  This has been happening since I was like 12 so I always let medical staff know.  I luckily didn’t pass out but the IV was really painful for like hours after placing it.  I kept feeling it, but then it eventually went away.

I started having contractions due to the pitocin and we watched them progress on this little monitor thing they had hooked up to me.  An anesthesiologist came in to talk to me about epidurals, and I wasn’t really sure when I should ask for one.  After a million questions I learned that it really cant be too early to ask for one.  After a really painful cervical exam by my doctor (the baby’s head was like, over the cervix so she had to reach around it and it sucked) i asked for the epidural.  I was only about 3 cm dialated at the time and it was something like 4pm maybe, my memory is getting fuzzy at this point.

Oh man, the epidural was pretty rough.  My contractions really ramped up by the time the anesthesiologist got to me (which wasn’t a long time I might add) and the first local anesthesia was ok, but then he put the epi in and I got this really strange feeling.  He kept asking me if it was sharp or burning or numb (I think) and I was like, “It’s none of those it feels like...” and at the time I couldn’t find a word to describe it.  I told my husband much later that it felt like the word “envelope” for some reason.  What?!?  In reality I think it was more like a wavy vibration.  It was very not cool.  So he tried it again and i got the same feeling.  It wasn’t pain per-se, but it felt...bad and wrong..  So he went in a different side or something and it was fine.  THANK GODNESS for that thing.  Once I had the epi everything was much more manageable.  He called it something when the doctor came back, I think he was an intern.  Anyway, that feeling has a name and if anyone knows wtf that was please let me know.  They were able to do the epi while I was laying down, because of my vaso-vagel.  Maybe about 5 minutes after they put it in I started getting light headed and ringing in my ears that I always feel when I’m about to pass out, so they put something in my IV to raise my blood pressure, it had dropped down to 80 over something, but i luckily didn’t pass out.

The epidural was awesome.  It took the edge off the pain. Once I progressed I kept hitting the button but more on that below.  

I’ve read that you should eat before labor and all of that, but i didn’t really realize how badly I would be starving.  By 6 or. 7pm I was seeing cereal and donuts when I closed my eyes.  My hospital was great, but I was complaining about being hungry and my freaking nurse starts eating her dinner in the corner of the room!  I had farted a few minutes earlier and I thought that’s what I was smelling and I was really embarrassed, but my husband told me she was eating.  So weird and rude!

I was dialating something like 1 cm every hour, so by something like midnight I was at about 9.5 or 10 and they told me to start pushing.  I got freaked out at hit the epidural button which I regret.  Towards the end there I was hitting it about every half hour the contractions were getting so bad even with the medicine.  But when I started pushing I realized that I couldn’t feel if I was focusing on the right muscles, or trying hard enough.  The doctor left and I was alone with the nurse and my husband to push for a few hours.  The nurse was great trying to shout and motivate me but the doctor was better.  She was SCREAMING encouragement at me and it was really helpful.  Everything is kind of fuzzy after this, the doctor came back in after a few hours, at which point I was totally exhausted.  They could see her head but i couldn’t get her past my pubic bone or something.  They also told me to pull my legs back and push, I ended up pulling them so hard that they were impossibly sore and almost immobile for the next several days, so word of advice, maybe chill on straining your arms too too much.

At around 2 AM on Tuesday they could see that I was just too tired.  The doctor told met that they were going to use forceps.  Now, I didn’t have a birth plan, I’m not particular, I didn’t have many expectations.  But one thing I sort of wanted to avoid was forceps.  I’d read a bunch of horror stories about babies being hurt and killed and all of that, so I got a little scared but honestly I was too exhausted and in too much pain to really think about it.  I trusted my doc.

My husband had to look away, I guess it was pretty rough.  He said that after they were done the one doctor turned to the other and said, “Now that is a near perfect forceps delivery!”  She had maybe like 3 tiny little cuts on her head in two places, which is what I imagine being rom the forceps but who knows.

We weren’t able to do skin-to-skin and my husband couldn’t cut the cord because of those complications, but whatever.  The placenta coming out was super weird.  Oh, also right toward the end they told me that they were giving me an episiotomy.  So after the placenta came out they stitched me up and told me it was a second degree cut.  The baby wasn’t crying which I thought was odd but they told me it was normal.  NICU came in to examine her but left after a few minutes, she was completely fine.  They send the placenta off to be examined when there are complications, too.

I was completely destroyed after that.  I think that she spent the first night in the nursery.  I don’t remember much except asking for pain pills.  The nurses gave me these disposable ice packs and the disposable underwear, but the ice packs dont really absorb anything so blood just leaks everywhere and it looks horrible.  My husband and I slept until something like 7 or 8 am.  I asked for food before I left the labor room and ended up with a styrofoam bowl of chicken soup, thank you kind nurse!

The next few days in the hospital weren’t so fun.  I was in a ton of pain down below.  My butthole hurt SO BAD which I didn’t anticipate.  It was all bruised from her head pushing against it.  I could feel my ibuprofen wearing off like an hour before it did.  The nurses were on time for the most part but when they were running late with it it was horrible.

Nurses came in over the next few days to tell me about breast feeding, but I couldn’t see any colostrum and I had a feeling she wasn’t getting enough.  She tested fine at first, then on something like the second day she lost 12% it s of her body weight and was jaundiced.  Finally, in the early morning of the thirdly day a pediatrician let me supplement with formula.  I was relieved because I could at least see that she was getting some food.  She was pretty yellow but they let me go home.

Going home was a relief, but that first night was TERRIFYING to me.  I was still in so much pain.  I was told upon discharge that I needed to avoid going up and down stair for a while, something that I had not anticipated.  Our only bathroom is on the second floor, which is fine but I was still starving and our kitchen and water is all on the first floor.  Thank goodness for my husband.  He works from home and was still working at this time, as well as taking care of his other daughter who is a little high maintenance.  Our stairways are super steep so I would get really winded and shakey going up and down them.

I wore diapers (well, still am wearing them) so thanks for that tip, Reddit! I started putting a pad on the diapers without sticking the pad to the diaper, just to stretch them out more.  They really just were there to catch overflow and save our one set of hand-me-down fancy sheets.  I wondered if I would ever stop hurting.  And I wondered if I would ever produce milk.  I was pumping and getting nothing even on the third day.  They told me how to do a sitz bath at the hospital but I hated it. It didn’t feel good, and it wasn’t necessary for healing.  I hate the idea of messing around with putting something in a toilet.  I realized that i wasn’t using the peri bottle correctly until about day 4.  I didn’t have burning when I peed, but it was useful after a BM to make cleanup easier.  Lift up to one side and really go in there at an angle!

Our day one appointment was on Friday.  Getting her into the car seat was horrible.  She screamed the whole way there, and I’m thinking now that she was just very hungry.  She also screamed the whole way home from that appt!  That morning my boobs felt harder,  but I didn’t think milk was really flowing yet.  She lost a little bit more weight.  My previous instructions were to breast feed 20 minutes on each side and then give one ounce of formula every two hours.  Since i still had no milk my pediatrician told me to continue to breastfeed and give formula.   I was there for two hours, asking questions and talking to a lactation consultant.  They gave me a nipple shield which was a total game changer!  She didn’t really have a hard time latching before, but she would fall asleep.  The nipple shield made it easier to get a grip and suck.  IDGAF what boob people say about these shields, we’ll figure it out when she gets stronger.  

They also did a blood test for jandice which is SO SCARY and baby screamed the whole time.  Once those results came back a few hours later, they were high and the doctor told us that we would have to have a home nurse come in the next day to weigh her and test her blood again.

Later that night, my milk came in!  Thank goodness.  I was worried the whole time that it would not come in, or it would and I wouldn’t know.  Holy COW.  I was so engorged and it hurt.  But I could finally see milk coming out so I was extremely relieved.  That day, the home nurse came in and drew blood for jaundice.  The results came back better, so we were just instructed to keep supplementing and feeding her.  The next day or two is a blur of lots of boobs and all of the formula that she could handle.

A few days later, back at the pediatrician, and she had gained a ton of weight!  Is as instructed to cut back on formula and try to just do breast milk.  A few days later, weight was back down.  More instructions to supplement and see a lactation consultant.  AND THEN through the course of conversation it as discovered that I was breastfeeding wrong!  I wasn’t finishing off one boob before switching to the other, and then starting on that same boob again next feed.  Through all of the classes, youtube videos, nurses, and reading I’ve dont for some reason that was never fully explained to me.  Or my pregnant brain never got it.  Once I made that change it was a world of difference.  That day she ate great, I saw the lactation consultant and she had gained .5 oz in one day, right on track.  I’m currently still able to supplement but she hasn’t seemed to need much more than an ounce or two over the course of the day or night, and that’s usually only if she gets distracted by a big scary fart or poop while she’s eating.

So I’m a little nervous for our Monday appointment, I don’t think I can handle another weight loss disappointment. If so, I might just pump and do formula.  This is all too stressful every 2 hours, and I’m losing my patience with breastfeeding.

Overall, not a real positive nor negative experience.  I remember the day after thinking that labor was the worst day of my life.  And several days thereafter promising I would never do that again.  But memory is fading and I can’t say in hindsight that it was entirely negative.  I am, however, so so greatful that I’m done being pregnant.

I overpacked for real.  I also brought a lot of things that people on this sub and r/babybumps had recommended.  Things I really was glad I brought:

* My own pillow and blanket - my husband really needed these things to sleep on the weird couch in the room
* A camping light - someone had mentioned bringing a table night light for night time feedings, I had a battery powered camping lantern that I brought that was so much easier than getting out of bed and trying to find the light.  
* A water bottle with a straw - I got a camelback and glad I did.  Someone mentioned that in September bumpers I think, I would have spilled a nalgene all over me.  In recovery they gave me a cup, but before labor I needed the bottle.
* Woman Diapers-  so glad I had these! They were much easier than the mesh undies.

Things that I didn’t need:
* A sleeping mask and ear plugs - every time one of the nurses came in I needed to get up to take meds or feed the baby anyway, so no point in that.
* My own meds - they would not let me take my own meds in the hospital.  Even stool softeners had to be brought in.  Add that to the list above tho, I’ve been taking stool softeners every day and they’ve made a world of difference.
* Snacks - I didn’t have much of an appetite, and my husband just ran over to the cafeteria for a bagel every once in a while.  We packed way too many snacks and I could have done without.
* Footed pajamas for baby - You have to strip baby down to breast feed, the only time I’ve put her in outfits was to leave the house.  There’s no point otherwise really.
* A robe - i loved a robe when I was pregnant, and thought I would wear it all the time in the hospital.  But I didn’t realize that a long robe would be dangerous going up and down stairs, so I’m not wearing it now because I’m carrying my baby up and down stairs a lot.  I just used the robe in the hospital so I wouldn’t have to worry about leaking blood all over it.
* Diapers or wipes for baby. - provided by hospital
* Fleece baby anything - so babies need to be kept on the cool side, I didn’t know that.  Fleece is too warm in a controlled environment like a hospital for sleeping.  Cotton layer worked for us.  Again, provided by hospital.
* Nail clippers: baby's nails are attached to the skin when they first come out so it’s recommended that you file them instead of cutting them for a while.  I had a tiny nail file at home and that’s been working well.

There wasn’t really anything I wish I had, since I overpacked so much.  I’ll add items to this post as I think of them if that would be helpful to folks!

I mentioned briefly that I am on anti-depressants.  Before I got pregnant I noticed a trend in my hormones, where when my period was coming I would get very anxious and paranoid.  I talked to a few doctors about it but none of them had anything useful to say about paranoia and hormones.  When I got out of the hospital I was SUPER anxious and paranoid the first few days, in addition to being extremely tearful.  I joke with my husband now and say that I have a “daily neurosis”.  But it was serious and badr almost a week after the birth.  I went from being afraid of anyone carrying the baby down the stairs, to being afraid that someone was going to walk through doorways and accidentally smash her head on the doorways because of how narrow my house is.  I got really mad at my stepdaughter because I told her that she could not walk around with the baby until she is like 6 months old (kid is 9) and when I stepped out of the room to get in the shower I heard her ask her dad if she could carry the baby downstairs.  I got extremely mad to the point that I was rage sobbing in the shower because I thought that she was being sneaky and going behind my back to try to do shit that would hurt  the baby.  She alleges that she forgot that I had told her she couldn’t carry the baby.  I still don’t buy it, but there was no reason for me to get so worked up about it and think that she was being almost evil about it.  My current thing is being afraid of using my cell phone too close to the baby.  Like I know all of this is really stupid, and it’s waaaaaay less intense than it was a few days ago, and it gets better ever day.  But those anxieties are still present.  I can’t wait until the hormones go back to normal.  

We are still trying to gain weight and it’s a bit disheartening because it’s going so slowly, even with supplementing.

I have a bachelor's degree in Accounting, got it in may of 2016. I'm looking for some advice here. I'd like to know how some of you in here landed a permanent JR or Staff Accountant. I have worked a jr accountant type role for a major retail company, but that was through an agency on a temporary basis. I have also held an AP position, and again that was a temporary contract role only. I have complete a facilities 
management/accounting internship while I was in college. I'm having a hard time landing a permanent job. Currently I am unemployed. I'd really like to land a permanent role so I can begin advancing on my career.  What were some of your tips and tricks that you guys used to locate the permanent job(if you used job board sites like indeed or something like that) Did you directly apply to random companies though their website ? Did you go through an agency like I did but find permanent roles there, or temp-hire roles and land your job that way? It's pretty frustrating for me to be honest because I really feel overwhelmed not knowing what the most effective ways and it makes me feel like its impossible at times. Any kind of advice that you think would help me in my job search would be greatly appreciated.

76tq9c,22,2017-10-16,They do this to own you,false_utopias,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/76tq9c/they_do_this_to_own_you/,"Hey all! Long time lurker, first time poster. I’ve been going through some tough times lately, and thought that maybe letting it out might help. Also thought I might share this revelation I had a few days ago regarding something related to Nparents. Reading about people’s experiences on here has helped me get through so much. This subreddit keeps reminding me that I’m not alone. That a lot of people have been through a lot worse, and have still managed to regain control of their lives. All in all,  it reminds me that it can get better. Which, really, is all I need to know to get through the day. 

But enough of all that rambling! Let me tell you all about my NDad, and how entertaining living with him for the past 21 years has been! (I’m 21 lol, before anyone freaks out):

I’ve always felt guilty about hating my NDad. Not because I thought I was the cause of the shit he pulled. But because I just kept telling myself “It’s not bad enough to be classified as abusive”.  Which, I think, is something a lot of sufferers of emotional abuse go through. I would read stories about children who went through horrific experiences with physically and sexually abusive parents, and I immediately think “You’re just being a big baby. He’s probably just treating you the way all dads treat their kids”.  I still struggle to accept that emotional abuse is its own form of horrible; that all abuse is horrible and it’s not a competition of who had things worse. Though I can, and always will, appreciate that I had it a lot better than many people out there. 


More than anything, though, I felt guilty because my dad was spending money on me.


In most of the experiences shared here, the Nparents would force the kids to pay rent, or throw them on the streets to fend for themselves, or force them to get jobs at the age of 12 to support themselves and their younger siblings. I never had to do any of that. My Ndad has been supporting my brother, mother, and I since forever ago. He’s currently paying for our Universities, while supporting us with a roof over our heads and food on the table. Would make his making us suffer every form of emotional abuse (which I’ll talk about later in other posts so I won’t clutter this one) imaginable seem like a perfectly reasonable price to pay, considering he’s spending so much money on us, right? 

No. No, it absolutely isn’t. I still struggle with the idea that it is, but let me tell you why it **actually** really isn’t. 

Divine inspiration struck me while watching a cheesy Netflix series, believe it or not. Character A was explaining to Character B that their rich friend, C, and his parents took care of A during his time of need. See A was poor, and his stepfather was abusive and would often throw him out on the streets. C, the rich friend, would offer A a room to live in, warm meals, and even helped him with his school necessities from time to time. C was A’s brother from another mother. He helped him when no one else would, with his free room and board and gifts and what not. So A would turn a blind eye to all the fucked up shit C did to other people. Made sense. Until Character B tells him, quite simply, “They do this to own you.” 

And it clicked in my head that...that’s exactly what my dad does. He pays my Uni fees, but I’m not allowed to leave the house or else he’ll yell and threaten to throw me out on the streets and cut my studies short. He pays my Uni fees but I’m only allowed to wear clothes he picks out for me. He pays my Uni fees but won’t allow me to work to support myself in the meantime, because then people will say he’s not taking care of his daughter properly (it’s frowned upon for the daughter to get a job without a degree here. It reflects badly on the parents, for some weird reason). He pays my Uni fees, but he’s allowed to treat me like pure shit in front of his friends and family, telling them how worthless, stupid, and useless I am. How I’m never going to amount to anything. How every achievement I’ve ever had was dumb luck.  He’s allowed to yell at me whenever he pleases, threaten to beat me, invade my privacy. He pays my Uni fees, but I’m not allowed to wear make up because he doesn’t want me to. He pays my Uni fees, but I’m not allowed to have any friends. He pays my Uni fees, but I’m not allowed to see doctors, even though A)We can more than afford it, and B)I asked him on more than one occasion to let me get a job so that I’ll pay for it myself, only to have the world come crashing down on my head because asking to get a job is basically like insulting his mom. I have a chronic tremor, and have no idea what might be causing it. I have a chronic disease, and can’t follow up on it. 

Basically, he pays my Uni fees, but I’m never, under any circumstances, allowed to have money of my own. Because then I won’t need him. Then I won’t feel guilty for not giving a shit about all those ridiculous rules. I won’t have this fear of losing my future if I don’t do exactly what he says, I won’t live in constant fear, trying everything I can to keep him happy just so he can sneer at me and tell me I’ll never be good enough. And, most importantly, so people will tear me to shreds should I ever decide to move past all this and start my own life. Because “How could you cut ties with your father? He paid for your University!”

He does the same to my mom and my brother. My mother is an architect. She used to have a very well paying job, and she used to LOVE working. It was tiring as hell, but gave her a sense of purpose. He made her quit when they got married, convincing her to take care of the kids and to go back to work as soon as we grew up. Except now that we’re all grown and don’t need her to take care of us 24/7/365 like babies, he still won’t let her work. He’s terrified that, if she become financially stable in any way, she’ll leave him. 

I don’t know how I feel about this  “revelation” of mine, to be honest. I don’t know what I’ll do about it. I’m in my final year of Uni, and still have a year of unpaid internship to go,  which I’m terrified of wasting after suffering through so much to get here. At the same time, I shudder at the idea I’ll be stuck with my NDad forever because I feel guilty that he paid my fees and supported me financially. Even though I know he’s never done any of this out of love; the way he treats me, my brother, and mother, has proven that on numerous occasions (which include, but at not limited to, inviting people over the day before my mother was going in for surgery, and making her cook for them. Just to spite her. Or refusing to speak to me for a month in my senior year. I still don’t know why. All I know is that, while my friends were studying for the most important exams of our lives, I was juggling that and anxiety attacks because I couldn’t understand what I’d done wrong to my shithole NDad).  

I guess I just thought it might be interesting to share what I came to realize. Even though I have no idea what to do about it lol.

Sorry if this is messy! I had a lot on my mind and just wanted to put it all out. Also, English is not my native language, so thanks for bearing with me ❤️.

76tv6s,145,2017-10-16,By Request: How Getting Jacked at 40 Did Nothing for my DB,wandering-llama,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/76tv6s/by_request_how_getting_jacked_at_40_did_nothing/,"In some comments I have written about my experiences, a few people have asked me to make a post.  The idea can persist in some people’s minds that how attractive you are can make a huge difference in sex inside a long-term relationship.  If you are a 8 and your partner is a 5 - they would bug you for sex every day…. This is a story of how that didn’t work.

**The Story:**

At the age of 37 after our kids were all over 4, I had more or less hit rock bottom DB-wise.  I was the HL male and my wife the LL F.  Classic “DB fairytale” where things started off well and just gradually eroded in the bedroom.  I was so frustrated and beaten down I just stopped initiating.  Sex dropped to once every two to three months whenever she happened to think about it.

We were getting along fine - quite literally a picture-perfect upper middle class suburban utopian existence.  Without much sex.  I have a great job, am nationally recognized in my field, do all the normal “man-stuff” in the house, am home at 5:30 every day, do more than my fair share of laundry/cooking/cleaning.  I also have a great sense of humor and am exceptionally humble.

In my subconscious, I seriously think that I felt my appearance was the last box I needed to check.  I was attracted to her - so that wasn’t a problem. She had all of the security and companionship that she needed.  I must just not be good looking enough - maybe if I look like one of those guys on her historical romance novels things would be better.  I didn’t do this consciously - it was only on reflection about a year back that this was what drove me.

So over three years I learned how to strength train.  I learned how to eat enough food to gain a pound a week.  I learned how to diet off fat from my bulk at a pound per week.  I used this to seesaw my muscle mass up and am currently on my third bulk phase.  I started at 170 pounds and 16% bodyfat.  At present I am 6’2, 218 pounds, and 13% bodyfat.  My chest went from 37” around to 46”.  Arms from 13” to 16”. Thighs from 22” to 26”.  I am about 5-10 pounds from what most predictors say my maximum muscle mass is without using drugs.  I can pick 500 pounds off the ground and stand up with it.

This necessitated a completely new wardrobe since I can’t fit into most of my old clothes - so I upped my style game.  I also got a new hairstyle.  I improved my already good hygiene.  Total.  Human.  Makeover.

**Impact on General Population:**

Overall I have gotten lots of compliments.  I have been hit on by college students, mistaken for a college intern at work based on looks three times, and now have to fend off tipsy wives at social gatherings.  The being mistaken for an intern is always a lot of fun when your are the director of a division.

**The Impact on My Wife:**

At one time she asked me (during sex!) if I was going to leave her for a fitness model.  She has also asked me if I was going to stay with her forever.  So basically it made her feel insecure.  It also made her more self-conscious about her own body.  Those feelings don’t make her feel sexy - there was no change in our sex lives.

**Impact on My Life:**

Here is where something positive happened.  I feel powerful.  I feel more confident.  I no longer feel emasculated.  My deadbedroom is more tolerable.  For me specifically, I think I was struggling a lot with self-esteem.  This helped me get through that and to stop blaming myself.

**Overall Conclusions:**

This whole thing helped me a lot and I did increase my sexual attractiveness to women in general (and apparently gay men.)  But with this women in particular - the one I want to influence - it did absolutely nothing.

Why is this so?  Because physical attraction was not a root cause.  I went from wiry runner build to heavyweight MMA fighter and got nada.  For us the root cause is something else - I think related to combination of responsive desire, anxiety, inattentive ADHD, and low-T.  I am certain she would acknowledge that I am more attractive now from an aesthetic point of view - but that doesn’t automatically translate into sexual desire.  I am convinced that there is nothing I could do physically that would drive her to have sex with me - I could be [insert buff actor] and it would not make a difference.  That is just not where the issue lies.

I would also note that she was legitimately afraid that I was going to leave or have an affair. For those familiar with the Red Pill - what I did here was inadvertently run what they refer to as a dread game.  Purposely putting your partner off-balance with the notion you might leave in order to elicit what I call “fear sex.”  I was not trying to do this and was not even aware of that at the time - but it retrospect it was kind of a textbook example.  And it did not work at all.  So goes the theory that “once you bench 225 and are below 15% bodyfat her panties will drop”.

I will say that there are some cases on here that have turned up where physical attraction or hygiene was an issue.  So I am not saying that my experience is universal - but I expect that these cases are the minority.

**Workout Program:**

If anybody has questions on my workout program I am happy to answer.  You will find it to be relatively boring but perhaps entirely refreshing after reading all of the fitness junk on the internet…  Spend 3-4 hours a week doing a variety of compound lifts and a few isolation exercises.  Do 3-4 sets a rep or two shy of failure and keep adding weight when you can.  Eat more healthy food to gain mass.  Eat less healthy food to lose fat.  Get a good night’s sleep.  I don’t count calories, macros, follow any fad diets, to any kind of complex programming, or any exotic training techniques."

76ua95,2,2017-10-16,[M4F] Young Male with Old Female prompts,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/76ua95/m4f_young_male_with_old_female_prompts/,"Hello, let me present you some basic scenarios involving MILF or Older sisters and a young guy, let's hope you like one of them:

---

**1) Young Bull:** They don't deserve these women if you ask me, this neighborhood it's full of the same generic couple and even the 20 something are following the same path, boring dates with friends, boring movies, the same routine day and night slowly killing them.

But the worst part it's how pathetic their sexual life it's, they're not even ashamed on admitting when they're drunk ""Enjoy your sexual life while you're young because when you get old it disappears"" and most of the girls laugh with a weird mix of shame.

All of them know about me, how i look at them with hunger all the time, they catch my glances at the pool and how i'm always trying to be the one who puts sunscreen on them when their husbands/boyfriends are not around.

You're one of them, tired of the family life, the boring sex, the killing routine and i'm the only one who it's different, probably it's the worst idea to give a chance a kid my age but the idea always come up in your mind at night, letting me feast in your body and go wild, not only that but i really want to make them watch how to please a woman, my training wheels with girls my age are starting to get boring and repetitive and i'm ready for the real challenge.

Note: This prompt might need a slow build up of you lowering the defenses and letting me get what i want.

**2) Bully Destroying Your Family:** It's a slow takeover that starts with abusing verbally your kid/brother, never leaving any trace of the abuse and always winning the arguments with the teacher if he says something, calling him name and humiliating him in front of girls who say quiet just to get a date with me.

The next step it's beating him without leaving to many marks ""It's just marks from playing around with boys who are way bigger than him"" tells you one of the teachers who looks afraid to talk about me, they don't tell you about the last teacher who slowly started to lose his mind, telling the other teachers that someone cut one of the brakes in his car.

Beating after beating he starts to submit, that's when your underwear starts to dissapear but you don't know about the connection, each time they appear again they're covered in my cum, you're the hottest Milf/Older sister and i hate him for that. If he doesn't bring something at least i want a picture of you taking sun on your private pool.

Now i'm his new friend, we spend time in your home playing games and doing homework, he tries his best to not look afraid around me, you catch my hungry glances all the times but ""Boy are just being boys"", the amount of time that i spend on your home increases, many times by mistake you catch my morning boner while looking at you.

During dinner i look at you with more hunger than your pathetic husband, my presence it's strong and now both your husband/father and the kid are afraid, my contacts go beyond your expectations and he is being blackmailed for trying to have sex with an intern.

This is your odd new life where i'm slowly being the man of the house without even touching you yet, but today the tactics change and i'm going to start more frontal attacks about your sexual life, that body you have and what your place in this house really is.

Note: Maybe it's a little dark but nothing super crazy, i want you to either submit or do anything i say to remove me from your life forever.

**3) Bloody Fists:** I'm walking to my home looking like i've been dragged trough the dirt, but in reality today i won again, the same guys who enjoy making fun of me for being a deform monster, telling me that no girl would touch me, trying to beat the shit out of me to make me leave school.

Recently my parents had ""the talk"" with me, but not only to explain me what sex is about, they're worried about other kids noticing a huge bulge in my pants, i'm gifted say my dad with a huge smile while my mother smiles in shame ""It's the gift of my family, your penis is above average and guys who are afraid of being the small guy will always hate you. Son, always fight back until they stop, these people will never stop trying to destroy you"" after that night i started to take personal defense clases, but 1 vs many it's not always easy.

I hear a car slowly drive next to me, when i turn to my left i see you, my neighbor with worried eyes probably wondering why there is traces of blood on my fist and my clothes are full of dirt.

Note: Her you can chose from a mid 20's girl, the older sister of a friend or just the mother of a friend, i'm looking specially for a sizequeen that will drop her jaw if she sees my penis, but also someone reluctant but intrigued about my gift works well too.

**4) Fake Friend (Celeb)**: I'm the ""best"" friend of your little son/brother and that it's surprising to you, he is just a nerdy shy guy with no luck but out of nowhere he has one of the most popular guys on the school with him most of the time.

The thing it's that most of the time means when you're around the house, we go to a kinda expensive school where everyone knows who you are but some just don't care. But for me you're a goal, i don't want just to watch you from the pool while you're getting tan, my goal it's to dominate you and make you addicted to me.

---
**5) Nude Beach:** My parents told my i'm old enough to be surrounded by other naked woman, my mother doesn't create on my any of that sexual desire but without a doubt she help me understand how our bodies work, even with that preparation i was not prepared for the incredible amount and mix of ladies that will be at this beach, from 18 to MILF's the beach it's probably heaven on earth, i feel the blood starting to rush my dick and i run towards the water, hiding my boner until it goes away and looking amazed at the beach, that's when out of nowhere i feel someone getting close to me and with my deer eyes i look back at you amazed by the body you have.

Note: Not sure where to go from her but if you like it then let's talk about it.

Living in UW would mean that I would have a better social life and easier time to make friends while combating the Seattle Freeze. I definitely do want to stay close to a younger university environment as well as downtown Seattle. However, I'm wary about the rough traffic on 520 or the I5 during rush hours.

If I lived in Kirkland, I'll only be 5-7 minutes away driving to/from work and I can probably even walk to work, but I think it'll be harder to make friends since I have to make a 20-30 minute trek to UW or downtown Seattle. I've heard that Kirkland is more expensive but prices have appeared to be similar in my search so far?

I'm also having a bit of problem finding places to rent. A lot of places (including UW and Seattle Facebook groups, Padmapper), are looking for people to fill up units immediately and would prefer people who would move in earlier than January. Does this mean I should wait until December for a better chance of finding rent? Is it supposed to be ironic that I should wait last minute to find immediate rent?

Will the traffic be worth the social benefits of living near UW? Is the traffic really bad on these highways during peak hours? Is rent typically higher in Kirkland than Seattle? Will I get a good ""Seattle experience"" if I lived in Kirkland?

Any type of advice or tips in regards to these questions help a lot. Thanks in advance guys!"
76uvxy,1,2017-10-16,[Screaming out into the void] I feel trapped; I just realised I've been suffering from depression on-and-off for 10 years.,54D_AF,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/76uvxy/screaming_out_into_the_void_i_feel_trapped_i_just/,"I'm gonna tell a bit of my story, as speaking my mind is one of my biggest fears. 
I recently turned 21, and it downed on me that I've been suffering from depression for 10 years. I got raped by a friend in boarding school in 9th grade, and my life has been different ever since.
I tried to commit suicide shortly after, but my amateur effort failed, as the belt I was trying to hang myself with couldn't handle my weight.
Initially I didn't understand why I felt so horrible, and why I was so prone to mood swings, but over time, it downed on me that I was dealing with trauma, and I wasn't yet healed.
I was bullied all through high school as I was 3 years younger than everyone in my grade. I barely could fit in, and I remain socially awkward till today.
After graduating high school, I went to college, where my quality of life improved, as I went to school, knowing I'd leave after about a year, as I already had gotten admission to a bigger school in a different country. My parents thought age 15 was too young to send a child to a different country thousands of miles away on his own, so they had me go to a college 3 hours away, so they could come check on me if need be.
The year and a half there was easy, as it was extremely low stakes for me, leading to no worries. At this time, I thought I was healed.
Fast forward to 2 years later, I move to the US for college, partly enthusiastic, partly nervous. First year was a breeze, got an internship I enjoyed, and my life seemed to be looking up. I got called back for the internship for a second summer, and I felt really proud of myself. Life seemed peachy, and maybe just maybe, I'd be fine from then. &lt;Not the case unfortunately.&gt;
First semester of second year was absolutely horrible, as I isolated myself from everyone because I had no energy to deal with anything. I have only one decent memory of that semester, my 18th birthday; as some ""friends"", determined to cheer me up, threw a surprise party for me in my dorm game room. I had to be carried down from my room as I wasn't really feeling it.
Later that semester, I got into therapy for the first time, and my therapist urged that I get moved to a dorm with other people I knew, to help reduce my isolation. As expected, I had a good semester again the second semester of my sophomore year, as I was around people a lot more. I went out of my room more often, went to classes, and aced all my classes.
My second summer working, I developed anxiety. I was a Software engineering intern at a very reputable company, but I just could not muster any confidence in myself. I'd always get nervous about disappointing my manager, and that'll leave me frozen on my work, unable to give presentations sometimes due to panic attacks, and I once had to leave work due to a panic attack while talking to my bosses. 
I ended up not returning for another summer, as although I had outstanding work, I wasn't told why I wouldn't return despite my work output. (I think my mental issues might have been very obvious, probably prompting the team to mark me as unstable or risky). I went on to have a horrible junior year, almost losing my scholarship in the process, but surviving by mustering up all the energy I could whenever I could, and returning to therapy. My therapist suggested medication which I declined due to fear of dependence. Survived junior year without a major incident, in my sophomore year, I got the cops called on me, as people were afraid I'd harm myself.
Most of my junior year, I spent tonnes of my time playing video games, to help hide the numbness I felt.
In my senior year, I returned to therapy, and at the end of my first semester of senior year, I was committed to a psych ward as I had a major panic attack and break down, and was suicidal. I had to get incompletes in all my classes, and had my last semester of college to complete work for both semesters if I wanted to graduate on time. I was put on medication for anxiety and depression during my second semester of senior year, to help me stay up and running. I ended up graduating, with decent enough grades, a far cry from expectations. Even when I was committed in the hospital, my parents didn't know I was in the hospital, and had no idea what was up with me, and they barely do till today, as I don't feel comfortable talking to them. (I don't know if anyone has this sort of relationship with their parents, and how they got past this stage). Fast forward till today, I'm done with college, but can't find the motivation to interview at companies. I've had companies reach out for interviews, but I can't get myself to practice for the interviews, mainly because I'm scared I'll have a breakdown at work someday and handle it horribly.

I don't know how saying this out to the world will help me, but I'm trying new things to wiggle out of this horrible life I'm living, as I'm getting tired of it."

As stated in the title, I’m currently doing my CFY in a SNF, and I’m looking for guidance as I’m feeling very overwhelmed. I’m hoping to get some resources and input here. 

1) One of my main quandaries is dysphagia therapy with patients with dementia. What kinds of goals can one set that are realistic and achievable? What do you trial in therapy? Do you usually shoot for caregiver training? 

2) When do you refer for an MBSS? I did my internship at an acute care hospital, and all of the patients typically had an MBSS upon admission. Considering that most residents at a SNF are LTC, when do you refer for an MBSS vs when do you not?

3) For cognitive-linguistics, my CFY supervisor tends to give the MOCA and make goals based on those results, but I'm not sure if this is the best approach. What do you do to gather info that will help set functional cog-ling goals? (I should mention that I do not have any formal assessments.)

4) How do you decide who is appropriate vs. who is not for therapy? My colleagues maintain that “If it were my grandpa/grandma, I’d want you to do therapy,” but I’m starting to feel like I have to put my foot down on this. 

Any input would be much appreciated!"

76v8sc,2,2017-10-16,The Case of the Unpaid Retweeters,bitscape,POWToken,https://www.reddit.com/r/POWToken/comments/76v8sc/the_case_of_the_unpaid_retweeters/,"++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**UPDATE** -- Oct 20, 2017
This morning, the following was [tweeted](https://twitter.com/POWtoken/status/921393808239091714) by the official POW Token account:

*Thanks to Kirtana (our brilliant intern in Chennai) for making all the retweet payments and updating the schedule*

Payment made it to my wallet, and I hope everyone else got theirs too!  This helps restore my confidence in the operation.  The POW Token economy has taken another step in being born!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

During the hours leading up to the POW Token launch, the official POW Token twitter account sent out a series of tweets offering 10,000 POW to everyone who retweeted their promotions.  ([example](https://twitter.com/POWtoken/status/915075371933904896))  Thinking what the hell, why not, I retweeted one of them, then sent a DM to the POWToken twitter account containing my Eth address, as indicated by the instructions.

A few days later, they posted another [announcement](https://twitter.com/POWtoken/status/915394122319409152) containing a link to a list of Eth addresses to be paid.  My address was not on that list.  I noticed that others in similar situations had replied to their tweet, so I added a reply containing my Eth address too.

In the days that followed, there were more announcements, promising that retweeters would be paid.  Transaction records on etherscan.io indicated that payments were sent to a few of the addresses on their list, but the overwhelming majority of listed addresses continued to remain unpaid, not to mention retweeters like me whose addresses somehow didn't even make it to the list at all.

Now it has been almost 2 weeks, and they still have not replied to inquiries, and I'm really starting to wonder what's going on.  I see that I'm not the only one, as other retweeters have been adding more new replies to their promotional tweets about this issue.  One unpaid [retweeter](https://twitter.com/salihbalkan/status/919476079403859968) went to far as to call the whole thing a scam operation, going on to speculate that the promised ERC-20 bridge may also be a lie.

I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the longer this goes unaddressed and unexplained, that's getting harder and harder.  Let's be honest, compared to the quantity of POW allocated to people like me who claimed via fb during the first days, 10,000 is a tiny amount.  At this point, it's really more about the trust.  How can we trust a project that doesn't keep these little promises that are technically quite trivial to fulfill?

If it is a scam, and they have no intention of following through with any of it, none of us have actually lost any money, so it's hard to see what they gain.  (Except of course, people who may have purchased some POW on etherdelta, but volume there has been tiny.)

Assuming the project is for real, all this does is damage their own project's reputation and among the early users who could potentially be their biggest promoters.  By failing to pay the retweeters, they may even be turning off potential buyers, as people who otherwise might have considered purchasing more lose faith in the project.

It really does seem kinda odd that a legit startup project would fail this badly on what should be a relatively trivial matter.  Whether an intentional scam, or just a failure to get things done, it's causing me to doubt the capability of the project to follow through.

Anyone else care to share thoughts or experiences?  Any other retweeters care to comment?

I have an internship that I do every summer on the east coast. I live and go to college in the Midwest. 3 weeks before the end of my internship, I met this guy. He’s a decent amount older than me and we had this incredible connection. It’s very hard for me to connect with people and even though I’ve been in a decent amount of relationships before, I’ve never liked anyone the way that I like him. 

We decided to keep talking even though we’d only been on three dates before I moved (one of which was an amazing weekend in NYC). We text every day and try to FaceTime for a few hours once a week or so. Two months have gone by like this and I’m currently at his apartment for fall break. 

Like a month ago we got close to having the DTR talk but he said he’d rather do it in person. I’m leaving tomorrow night and it’s the last opportunity we’ll have to have the talk until I come back to the east coast in January. He’s hinted at wanting to be together, saying things like “I want to be the only guy hitting on you” and I’ve met his friends but it’s been 4 days and the topic hasn’t come up. 

Should I try to initiate it tomorrow? I don’t want to rush into it because of the age difference, I don’t know how “adult” relationships start. I’m not trying to ruin things by moving too fast. How do I even start the conversation? Any help would be very nice. 

TLDR; I’m in a very ambiguous relationship with a guy who lives across the country. Should I have the define the relationship talk and if I should, how do I initiate it?"

And I'll tell you: I went to the mail room and looked at his mail box. I got his last name, got on Google and searched. Bam. Richard. 47. 

He was a silver fox. He had short but stylish silver hair and a beard to match, muscles -- so many muscles! And a few old tattoos on his forearms. I wanted to fuck him. I wanted him to fuck me. But I was too shy.

My parents bought me the apartment when I enrolled in college. They rented it out for two years and then, this year when I became a junior, I moved into it. My very own place! 

I saw Richard on my first night in the studio apartment. He was on his balcony smoking a pipe. A pipe of all things. I thought, this guy is probably an author. Didn't hurt my fantasy when he sat down and pulled out a thick book. 

I started thinking about his cock and I wondered if it was as thick as the book he was reading. I just needed an in. I'm shy, okay? Too shy. I'm not like the girls in my school who send guys a pic of their tits and say ""come over.""

That's not me. But maybe ... I could pretend to be like them.

I was going to be the free spirited girl. The girl who always giggled and flirted and tossed her hair. And topless. Topless helps. 

I opened my window and leaned out, my C cup tits in full view, and I shouted towards the neighbor, ""Hey you!"" 

He turned and saw me. His eyes grew wide for a second, and then, assuming I was some sort of free spirited chick, he locked eyes with me, puffed on his pipe and said, ""Yes?""

""You mind blowing some of that smoke over here? It smells good.""

""Sure thing,"" he said with a chuckle. And before he could turn back to his book, I called out again.

""What's your name?""

""Richard. You?""

""Casey. What are you doing tonight?""

""Well, this. And then I'll go in and make a drink a little later and watch some TV. Then maybe ... bed?""

""Maybe bed?""

""Definitely bed.""

""Sounds nice.""

""You ... wanna join me? I mean, for the drink?"" 

I perked up. ""Sure! I'll be right over.""

I grabbed my lacey see through old white t-shirt and tossed it on. I didn't want to be friends with this guy. I just wanted to drown in his cum. 

I have this working theory about women born in the 80s and 90s vs. women born in the 2000s. If you were a teen age girl in the 80s or 90s - pretty much before the internet - you read romance novels where the guy sweeps you off your feet for a weekend of romance. And that's what you want. But girls of the late 90s -- after the internet arrived -- and every moment after - watched porn. They were curious. Curious 80s girls read romance novels. Curious girls born in the late 90s? They watched porn. I was one of those girls who was curious. That's why 80s and 90s girls are such prudes and will never let a guy bust a nut on your face. But I do. I love it.

Anyway, I ran to Richard's apartment and gave a little knock. He had to have known my game plan. Especially when he opened the door. 

I was wearing knee high rainbow socks, booty shorts and my old white see through t-shirt. 

He welcomed me into his apartment. It was dark, masculine, and smelled vaguely of lingering cherry pipe tobacco. 

""What can I get you to drink? You ... you are over 21, right?""

""Mmm-hmm,"" I said, twirling my hair. 21 last month.""

""Oh, good."" 

It wasn't a lie. I took a gap year before starting college, so I had a leg up in the age department on other girls. 

He poured me a drink and we clinked glasses and then I bit my bottom lip and sat down on the sofa across from him.

""So, Richard. What do you do?""

""I write.""

I laughed to myself. I knew it. 

""What do you do?"" He asked.

""I'm a student at State.""

""Oh, cool,"" he said. ""Like it?""

""It's okay but I get so stressed out with work and all that. School work and my internship. Sometimes I just need a stiff one ... a drink, I mean.""

""Huh,"" he said with a chuckle.

""Is my drink ... stiff enough for you?""

""It is. It's very stiff."" 

I licked my lips and stared at his crotch. I could tell he was getting hard under his jeans.

""Fuck this,"" I said. I put my drink down and charged to him, ripping his shirt off. He was shredded as fuck! He had abs and white chest hair and he was absolutely ripped. 

""Oh my god, you're hot,"" I said, leaning in and kissing his neck while my hands undid his pants and pulled them to his ankles.

Soon, his 9.5 inch cock was in my mouth and tears were running down my cheeks. I watched a lot of porn. I knew what guys like. 

""You wanna fuck my face?"" I asked.

""Sure,"" he said.

I stood up and flipped over on his sofa, hanging my face over the end of the seat. He walked towards me and leaned down, pushing his cock into my gaping mouth. I gagged and a little drool ran out of my mouth and down my upside-down face and into my hair. 

I could see his asshole. I wondered if he liked buttplay. My last boyfriend did, but I decided I'd better not risk jamming a finger up there until I got a better idea of his desires.

He pumped away at my mouth. I gagged and choked and writhed on the sofa as more saliva and drool soaked my face. When he accidentally slipped out, I used it as a chance to speak.

""Fuck me harder. And eat my pussy, dammit."" 

Soon, we were doing the good ol' 69. I was soaking wet. My pussy was ALWAYS wet. I masturbated like 12 times a day sometimes. I couldn't get enough and I was always cumming. With Richard's experienced tongue on my clit, I was cumming three or four times in a row, it felt like. 

Finally, he stopped and pulled out. I flipped over. My face was soaked with saliva and mascara. I was gasping for air. I was naked, except for my rainbow knee high socks.

""Fucking shit,"" I said. ""Hey ... do you like assplay?""

""I suppose,"" he said. ""Think my cock will fit in your ass?""

We looked down. His cock WAS huge. 

""That's not what I meant,"" I asked, holding up my right pointer finger.

""Ohhh,"" he said. ""Yeah, why not?""

""Good. Get on your back.""

He got onto the sofa and I got on top of him - reverse cowgirl - and started riding his cock. His cock and balls were so lubed up by my saliva what I was easily able to lean down and slip a finger in his ass. 

I rode him harder and harder and every few seconds, he'd pinch my ass cheeks or slap them. Soon, he was maneuvering his finger towards my asshole. When it slipped in, I gasped.

After a while, I flipped around and straddled him, my tits slapping into his face. 

""Are you a dirty boy?"" I asked him.

He nodded.

""When you're ready to cum, I want to drink it.""

""Okay,"" he said as I kept riding.

""Your cock is so big!"" I yelled out as I reached down and rubbed my clit and orgasmed on top of him. I squirted a little and my juices ran down his thighs. I pulled out and squatted down and lapped up my juices.

""Meow,"" I said. 

He writhed. 

I took his cock into my mouth and sucked my pussy juices off of him while he watched. It seemed like his cock got even harder. Even bigger.

""Your cock,"" I said. ""It's huge.""

He smiled.

""Where do you want me to cum?"" He asked as he started to writhe with pleasure.

""We have a few choices. You can cum in my pussy. I'm on the pill. And then I can squirt it into a cup and drink it.""

His eyes grew wide. I don't think he was expecting such a freak.

""Or ... you can bust on my face and then you can clean the mess up with a spoon and feed it to me.""

He laughed. 

""Or, least exciting. You cum into my mouth and I swallow.""

""Get on your hands and knees."" He instructed.

I did and he fucked me from behind, his finger inside of my ass, until he finally shot a thick load of cum inside of me. I moaned. He moaned. And then he pulled out.

""Wait here,"" he said as he walked into the kitchen and returned with a small juice glass. He hovered it below my gaping wet cunt and said, ""Now.""

I sat up and pushed, my asshole gaped open a little and soon, a flood of jizz gushed from my pussy and into the cup. He came so much the glass was nearly full.

""Holy shit, that's a lot of jizz.""

""I cum a lot,"" he said as he held the cup to me.

To be honest, I'd never done this before. I swallow cum all the time, but it's a different story when the guy busts down your throat versus handing you an 4 oz cup of cum. I gulped, nervously, and took the cup from him.

""Thanks, daddy,"" I said as I tilted the cup back and took a thick sip. It was hot. Warmer than warm and thick as shit. I gulped down at least two ounces of his cum while he watched. And to my amazement, his cock got hard again. He started jerking off. I couldn't believe it.

""Rub your pussy,"" He instructed. ""Finger it. Finger your asshole, too.""

I did as instructed while I gulped down the other half of his cum. 

""All gone,"" I said.

""Round two coming up,"" he announced as he straddled my face.

""Oh my god you're going to cum again?"" I asked.

He nodded and I laughed and brought myself to orgasm, accidentally pissing uncontrollably all over his floor. I blushed and started to freak out, but he stopped me and told me it was okay. It turned him on. And it would turn him on even more if I leaned down and lapped it up again.

""Meow,"" he said.

I grinned and did as I was told, slurping up my own mix of pussy juice and piss and maybe some of his leftover cum from his hardwood floor.

He leaned down and ejaculated an even thicker stream of jizz onto my face. I mean, my face was already wet from the saliva and sweat, but there were six solid streams up my face and into my hair. 

I burst out laughing. One time in high school, my boyfriend and his best friend double teamed me in his basement and they both jerked off onto my face, but they barely even came compared to this explosion of jizz. 

I fell backwards against the sofa and rubbed my pussy, cumming again while Richard went into the kitchen and got a spoon. "
76ytz6,24,2017-10-17,Looking for ways to improve my RMV,veganbjjgirl,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/76ytz6/looking_for_ways_to_improve_my_rmv/,"Hey everyone! I have been reading this sub for a few months but this is my first time posting, so I apologize in advance if I made any mistakes or broke any rules. 


Before I swallowed TRP I considered myself feminist, but in the past months I have been learning and changing a lot. TRP helped me to realize what I really want in my future (a husband who leads me, a family with kids) and I have been making changes accordingly. For me this has been a very positive experience, I feel way more certain about who I am, what I want to work towards, I am happier with myself, feel more secure, confident and feminine. This is largely due to this sub so thank you all very much! I feel like I still have a long way to go and have many things to improve on. In this post I want to share my progress, current situation and the things I may want to change/improve on. I’m hoping to hear your feedback and/or personal stories and I am very open to criticism! My goal is 1) to improve myself just for me and 2) to attract a man who can lead me and provide for me, and who I can support and love in return. I am 20 years old right now and I really want to start a family before my 30’s (however only when I find a man I am certain that I want to have a family with). Below I made a list of pros and cons about me from my own POV, things that I’m working on and things I need to work on. I am open to any feedback! 


Things that may affect my RMV positively:

* I’m at a healthy weight, have a toned body with visible abs, exercise 10+ hours a week. 

* I started wearing minimal makeup (mascara and brows) and I grew out my curls to almost halfway my back. I try to wear my hair untied as much as possible whereas before I had it up in a bun most of the time. 
* I shaved my leg and armpit hair (yes........ I know......... blame feminist media and my own idiocy I guess)
* I started wearing skirts and dresses every day except for when I’m exercising or working my side job which requires me to wear pants (one day a week). 
* I make an effort to look put together every day. 
* I cook for myself every day and try out new recipes, I love cooking and am actively trying to improve my cooking skills. 
* My room is organized and I’m pretty minimalistic. 
* I don’t drink or smoke.
* I try to always eat healthy, eat pretty much only whole foods like veggies, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds. 
* I’m a virgin and ideally only want to sleep with one person in my life. 
* I deleted all of the pictures on my social media where I was showing my body and started using social media way less. 
* I’m studying Nutrition and Dietetics full time (currently in my last year doing an internship) and have a side job at a health store. I’ve read on this sub that men don’t care much about career or financial success, which I think is true, but I would think that the fact that I’m not slacking in life still affects my RMV positively? 


Things that may affect my RMV negatively: 

* I have no dating or relationship experience.

* I am quite shy when talking to guys I am interested in. Usually I have no problem talking to strangers and I really enjoy socializing, but when I like a guy I become a bit nervous and because of this I close myself off which makes me seem uninterested (or maybe even rude) so I’m achieving the opposite of what I want. This is something I really want to work on but I’m not sure how. 
* I train Brazilian jiu jitsu, this may be a problem for some men because it’s a very physical contact sport and I train mostly with other men. However this is not something I’m willing to change because 1) I love it too much and 2) it makes me more able to defend myself which I think is really important. On a side note: if any of you ladies are looking for a way to learn to defend yourself, Brazilian jiu jitsu is the way to go! From what I know it’s the absolute best way to learn to defend yourself, especially for women. 
* I don’t wear heels or jewelry often, it just seems impractical to me and not worth it as I think it wouldn’t change much about my RMV. What are your thoughts? 
* I’m vegan which some guys may not like? But this is also something I’m too passionate about to change so I think it would be better for me to find a partner who has similar values. 
* I’m not very disciplined when it comes to things like washing dishes straight away, cleaning, watering the plants, making my bed etc. I need to prioritize this more and keep my space tidy. 
* I think the way I act in public may make me unapproachable (for example wearing headphones and not making eye contact with people). Guys never approach me in public places (I am from The Netherlands and I think this may also be partly because of culture. I think it’s much more common in America for strangers to talk to each other.)


Thank you in advance ladies!"
76zu7w,9,2017-10-17,Pistons Tickets,Icwood10,DetroitPistons,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitPistons/comments/76zu7w/pistons_tickets/,"Hey everyone,
My name is Cullen Wood, and I am a student at Central Michigan University, and I am currently taking a marketing class that is partnered with the Pistons! I am currently selling tickets for the Pistons at the group rate, what that means is that I am selling every home game at a discount rate which is usually only given to people who buy in groups. 

This opportunity is only for the Fall semester, but you can buy any home game the entire season. Ticket prices do vary on how well the matchup is, and how the game is selling. 

The link to look at all the games are [Here!](https://www.fevo.com/discovery/CENTRAL-MICHIGAN-UNIVERSITY-SPORT-MANAGEMENT-4xFG7K5g)

If you choose to purchase them they will give you a link after finalizing the purchase, and you can give that link to people who you want to sit with, so if they purchase the same ticket off of your link the system will know that you two want to sit together, of course you can buy tickets in bulk at once as well. When buying tickets make sure when it asks who referred you to these tickets select **CULLEN WOOD!!** It should be one of the last options on the drop box. 

The tickets will be sent to you two days before the game, thats the deadline to purchase tickets for that game as well. 

I am really passionate about this project because If I sell the most tickets I will get an interview with the Detroit Pistons Sales team, and I could do an internship with them over the summer. I really appreciate you guys reading through all this text and hopefully you guy will help a fellow Pistons fan out and help him achieve his dream of working for his favorite NBA team!

If anyone has any questions please just private message me for any more details."
7708iz,1,2017-10-17,Is it acceptable to haggle the pay on an internship if I'm coming from a different state?,PolakOfTheCentury,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7708iz/is_it_acceptable_to_haggle_the_pay_on_an/,"I have a call with the main manager at the company I'm looking to intern with to discuss some internship details and one of those things is pay. To make this internship worth it for me, I am looking to get at least $18/hr as I would need to  relocate to a new state all the way across the country. So to be financially comfortable for the summer in Seattle, WA, that's the rate I feel will be best to make the move worth it. I'm not afraid to dip into my savings as this would be a great opportunity for me but I'd like the company to help out as much as possible.

My overall question would be is it frowned upon to ask for higher pay as an intern or is that something I can do if it is lower than expected? This is not my first internship and I'm coming in with significant experience but I just don't want to overstep and look like a fool. "
770nhc,13,2017-10-17,"Feeling like my career is heading nowhere. Advice, encouragement welcome.",ljt53,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/770nhc/feeling_like_my_career_is_heading_nowhere_advice/,"I recently graduated from my 2-year Masters and internship this past may and moved from Missouri to Seattle. I was so excited to begin my career as an RD and really wanted to continue learning and developing my skills in the acute care setting. My internship was very clinically focused and so that's where I feel most comfortable, but I was really open to anything and applied at hospitals, clinics, and elsewhere for part time or full time work. 

It's been about four months now since the move, and I haven't heard back from any of the hospitals I applied for. Not even an automated email from some of them. I feel that I am qualified and that my resume reflects my skills adequately. I have even tried calling nutrition departments and trying to contact the nutrition manager but received no response when I reached out about my application and interest in the company.  I did have one position in an outpatient setting that I was lucky to score an interview for based on my cover letter and resume, but they left me completely in the dark after the interview, presumably because I didn't have the right experience. I did find a once a week job at a local nursing home and I am pursuing that avenue if only just for the experience, but I am feeling very dejected, depressed and unsure about my future. 

I know this is something that most young dietitians have to deal with in order to climb the ladder,  but I am suffering from an enormous amount of stress because I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place with my career and earning potential. I have over 100k in student loan debt, and still p work full time at Bank of America just to put 100% of that towards my loans. Working per diem jobs not only takes up one of my two days of rest but also is barely enough to cover my other expenses. 

I'm not coming here to complain or find pity just for maybe some words of encouragement that it gets better...I'm only 24, but I'm very ambitious and love Dietetics and nutrition science. I know I would make an excellent dietitian in any setting and would be a valuable member of any team but my confidence is shaken and my nerves are shot. 

Has anyone else had this experience-- new or experienced dietitians? What did you do in the first half of your career when you were just starting out? Any advice to overcome the experience gap and find my first job/network effectively? I've recently joined the local Dietetics chapter here in Seattle and an beginning to meet other dietitians.   I'm also volunteering my time whenever the opportunity arises. I feel this is probably the most I can do at this point, but I eventually really want to find a full time job so I can leave the bank permanently and really kickstart my career and pay more than interest on my loans. 


Thanks for your support!!

771hhc,4,2017-10-17,I am not sure if I [22M] want to move in with my girlfriend [22F] right after graduation,TheKillerBeaver69,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/771hhc/i_am_not_sure_if_i_22m_want_to_move_in_with_my/,"Hey everyone. I am a 22 yo M chemical engineer student and my gf is a 22 yo F college dropout (due to financial reasons).  We have been dating for a year and 9 months.

I am currently on an internship in my hometown ( I live with my parents) and will be done by Christmas. I will then go to my final 6 months of school and graduate mid-June 2018. My gf also lives in my hometown with her mom but is still about a 45-min drive form me (other side of town).

The issue is, she has a very hard time with loneliness and not seeing me enough (we see each other about twice a week, we use to spend every night together when we were both at college).

I have been planning to go to Europe with my little sister (she’s 20) after I graduate for years and we are actually gonna do it (with parental backing). However, my gf didn’t want me to go, and after much discussion we agreed that I would go for 3 weeks (rather than 4) and move in with her when I get back. I wanted to wait until the following year to move in, so I could live at home and save all my money to give us a better start. But I agreed because I like her a lot. 

Fast forward to now, she is freaking out at home saying she’s lonely all the time and misses me and that two times a week isn’t enough. She asked last week if I would move in with her in IMMEDIATELY after I graduate, but before I leave for Europe for 3 weeks. In a combined moment of drunkness and softness, I relented. 

My question is this: am I in the wrong for wanting to extend our time apart so that I can maximize the amount of money we will have? I really don’t want to move in with her that fast. Other details: she works at a Fred Meyers (Kroger for you east coast people) and said she would go with me wherever I got a job. Also,  Europe trip is totally paid for, and I have no student debt. She has about 2 grand of it.

TL;DR: GF wants me to move in right after graduate, I want to wait until back from Europe/later to maximize savings and figure out what the job situation is. 

I’d like to hear what you guys think."

772b5o,13,2017-10-17,"Yesterday I went to my first ""real"" NA meeting.",morallyill,REDDITORSINRECOVERY,https://www.reddit.com/r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY/comments/772b5o/yesterday_i_went_to_my_first_real_na_meeting/,"I didn't go because the court told me to, or to get  back into school, or to prove to my family I'm a changed woman.

I didn't accept the fact I had a problem, because it wasn't meth. I rationalized that I was a good mormon girl and addiction is something I could bounce back from. I didn't accept it when I was arrested, or when I was suspended from school, or when my mom kicked me out, or when my dad wouldn't talk to me, or when my roommates kicked me out.

I didn't accept it when I'd pass out when I got high, or pass out when I'd get drunk, or go to class and work every day fucked up. After the cops took all my stuff I shoplifted a waterbottle to make a bong. Before probation started I scraped off shake in my glove compartment and put it in a cigarette to get high. On my 21st I thought I was going to die. You get the point.

Life gave me one more chance. A higher power I used to not believe in saw something, the cops saw something, my PO saw something, my school saw something. I was given another life where I finish school, stay sober, become a professional, associate with future professionals. My PO said when I got back into school he'd give me an internship and I could help people. I'd like to spend the rest of my life helping people.

But my past is still there, It haunts me. There's another life that never got closure. There's a certain kind of hell of wanting to get fucked up in the back of your mind that I can't disclose or wish on anyone. 

A week ago I had a trigger. But I realized I was living on a second chance. I wanted to stay sober for the first time and I wanted to do it for myself. So I went to my first ""real"" NA meeting. The tag is on my keychain, I'm going next week.

The only reason I decided to go to school in my hometown (Atlanta) is because I had a full ride scholarship. I am thoroughly sick of living in Atlanta and have no desire to live here a moment longer than I have to. The second I graduate, I plan on packing all of my stuff into my car and getting the hell outta Dodge. 

A few years back, I lived in my car and traveled the entire United States for almost a year while taking my associate classes online. I definitely don't like the East Coast, but I completely felt at home in the intermountain west (UT, CO, ID, AZ, NV, MT, WY) and have felt completely nauseated upon returning to Atlanta. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing that those states exist and that I'll be out west again after graduating. 

I'm currently a senior with a 3.9 GPA, and I completely blew it when it came to internships this fall. Couldn't even pull a non Big-4 internship. That's probably because I told all the campus recruiters that I was adamant about leaving immediately after finishing school and interning in either Colorado, Utah, Arizona or Idaho. 

So what are my options for getting into a Big 4 or large regional firm in UT, CO, ID or AZ? I'm open to anything, but I simply can't stomach living in Atlanta any longer. 

My ideal state is Utah. I am not personally a Mormon, but I do like Mormon people. The PWC recruiter I talked to said the Salt Lake office only accepts Mormon interns, and it's incredibly difficult to get accounting jobs if you're a non-mormon. That's BS right? 

I'll have my accounting degree this Fall, and after that I'm gone. I can take filler online classes to meet the 150 credits CPA requirements while I'm in a different state, but I am definitely moving after graduating. I'd just like to know how, if at all possible, I would break into public accounting after moving. Thanks!

**Sweden backstory:**
Sweden at the beginning of the omnic crisis sent out some help to other countries but when ominics sent large attacks
in Stockholm and Gothenburg. They shut down their borders and rebuilt themselves. Massing a large army for the relatively small
Country and a even larger air force and navy. They became a completely neutral country and refused to send out more then small batches of
medical supplies to warzones.
*OP notes:We really haven't touched much about Sweden in the overwatch universe. We know Torbjorn is swedish but no one really talks about how Sweden was effected in the crisis.*

**Jace Forsberg background:** Born in Sigtuna,Sweden alil ways away from Stockholm to a normal family. Mother is a Doctor and father was a professor at Konstfack in Stockholm.
He went to school to become a paramedic but enlisted to swedish army where he became a combat medic. He came back to Sweden when large ominic attacks hit the large cities and during the attacks he learned his father had died. After this happened and he saw his goverment pull away from helping other countries
in need he went AWOL. He left his home country to go to warzones and help with his medical and fighting experience. He sends his mother a letter whenever he can to tell
her he's okay. 
*OP notes: wanted to give him a reason to fight outside  of sweden and give him a reason for wanting to help people other than just wanting to help. He wants to help so people aren't effected like his family was.*

✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜✜
TL:DR: Hero concept for mercy's old concept, Cool drones, A front-line healer that i think overwatch needs and background badassery of a awesome combat medic.

773raw,1,2017-10-17,[M4F] Young Male with Old Female prompts,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/773raw/m4f_young_male_with_old_female_prompts/,"Hello, let me present you some basic scenarios involving MILF or Older sisters and a young guy, let's hope you like one of them:

---

**1) Young Bull:** They don't deserve these women if you ask me, this neighborhood it's full of the same generic couple and even the 20 something are following the same path, boring dates with friends, boring movies, the same routine day and night slowly killing them.

But the worst part it's how pathetic their sexual life it's, they're not even ashamed on admitting when they're drunk ""Enjoy your sexual life while you're young because when you get old it disappears"" and most of the girls laugh with a weird mix of shame.

All of them know about me, how i look at them with hunger all the time, they catch my glances at the pool and how i'm always trying to be the one who puts sunscreen on them when their husbands/boyfriends are not around.

You're one of them, tired of the family life, the boring sex, the killing routine and i'm the only one who it's different, probably it's the worst idea to give a chance a kid my age but the idea always come up in your mind at night, letting me feast in your body and go wild, not only that but i really want to make them watch how to please a woman, my training wheels with girls my age are starting to get boring and repetitive and i'm ready for the real challenge.

Note: This prompt might need a slow build up of you lowering the defenses and letting me get what i want. 

---

**2) Bully Destroying Your Family:** It's a slow takeover that starts with abusing verbally your kid/brother, never leaving any trace of the abuse and always winning the arguments with the teacher if he says something, calling him name and humiliating him in front of girls who say quiet just to get a date with me.

The next step it's beating him without leaving to many marks ""It's just marks from playing around with boys who are way bigger than him"" tells you one of the teachers who looks afraid to talk about me, they don't tell you about the last teacher who slowly started to lose his mind, telling the other teachers that someone cut one of the brakes in his car.

Beating after beating he starts to submit, that's when your underwear starts to dissapear but you don't know about the connection, each time they appear again they're covered in my cum, you're the hottest Milf/Older sister and i hate him for that. If he doesn't bring something at least i want a picture of you taking sun on your private pool.

Now i'm his new friend, we spend time in your home playing games and doing homework, he tries his best to not look afraid around me, you catch my hungry glances all the times but ""Boy are just being boys"", the amount of time that i spend on your home increases, many times by mistake you catch my morning boner while looking at you.

During dinner i look at you with more hunger than your pathetic husband, my presence it's strong and now both your husband/father and the kid are afraid, my contacts go beyond your expectations and he is being blackmailed for trying to have sex with an intern.

This is your odd new life where i'm slowly being the man of the house without even touching you yet, but today the tactics change and i'm going to start more frontal attacks about your sexual life, that body you have and what your place in this house really is.

Note: Maybe it's a little dark but nothing super crazy, i want you to either submit or do anything i say to remove me from your life forever.

---
**3) Bloody Fists:** I'm walking to my home looking like i've been dragged trough the dirt, but in reality today i won again, the same guys who enjoy making fun of me for being a deform monster, telling me that no girl would touch me, trying to beat the shit out of me to make me leave school.

Recently my parents had ""the talk"" with me, but not only to explain me what sex is about, they're worried about other kids noticing a huge bulge in my pants, i'm gifted say my dad with a huge smile while my mother smiles in shame ""It's the gift of my family, your penis is above average and guys who are afraid of being the small guy will always hate you. Son, always fight back until they stop, these people will never stop trying to destroy you"" after that night i started to take personal defense clases, but 1 vs many it's not always easy.

I hear a car slowly drive next to me, when i turn to my left i see you, my neighbor with worried eyes probably wondering why there is traces of blood on my fist and my clothes are full of dirt.

Note: Her you can chose from a mid 20's girl, the older sister of a friend or just the mother of a friend, i'm looking specially for a sizequeen that will drop her jaw if she sees my penis, but also someone reluctant but intrigued about my gift works well too.

---
**4) Fake Friend (Celeb)**: I'm the ""best"" friend of your little son/brother and that it's surprising to you, he is just a nerdy shy guy with no luck but out of nowhere he has one of the most popular guys on the school with him most of the time.

The thing it's that most of the time means when you're around the house, we go to a kinda expensive school where everyone knows who you are but some just don't care. But for me you're a goal, i don't want just to watch you from the pool while you're getting tan, my goal it's to dominate you and make you addicted to me.

---
**5) Nude Beach:** My parents told my i'm old enough to be surrounded by other naked woman, my mother doesn't create on my any of that sexual desire but without a doubt she help me understand how our bodies work, even with that preparation i was not prepared for the incredible amount and mix of ladies that will be at this beach, from 18 to MILF's the beach it's probably heaven on earth, i feel the blood starting to rush my dick and i run towards the water, hiding my boner until it goes away and looking amazed at the beach, that's when out of nowhere i feel someone getting close to me and with my deer eyes i look back at you amazed by the body you have.

Note: Not sure where to go from her but if you like it then let's talk about it.

---

I write only on first person, my paragraph length it's from 2 to 3 depending of the situation it could be longer for a setup but i'm not looking for something super long. 

Open your PM with the prompt you choose, describing your looks, kinks and limits.

My kinks are Anal, Rough Sex, Name Calling, Recording, Lingerie, Clothed Sex, Master/Dom, Dd/Lg and others that you can find here https://i.imgur.com/sKlgkxc.png

It would be a huge plus if you look like a celeb in any of this prompts."

77466f,8,2017-10-18,"An Heart-felt Account of a Successful Screenwriter - ""Everybody f**g Knew!, but there was nothing to be Done"". Really?",Sandernista2,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/77466f/an_heartfelt_account_of_a_successful_screenwriter/,"So, to me, the account from this [link](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/a-screenwriter-who-worked-with-harvey-weinstein-on-some-of-his-biggest-movie-hits-says-everybody-f-ing-knew-2017-10?_ga=2.149770417.661593417.1508294259-472406719.1492507881) says it better than anything else I read about the Harvey Weinstein case celebre.

Everyone was in on the gig - may be not every detail, but one could surmise the details one doesn't know. Just as it has been going on forever in Hollywood - and not only there. And it will continue to go on, perhaps a bit more ""carefully"", with an eye over the shoulder.

As for the 'everyone"" it includes us, the audience. It's not like we didn't suspect that show business is a rotten business behind the scenes. Isn't that why we don't encourage our own offspring to go into that business? and if they do, isn't that why we worry about them all the time?

We all know that behind the facade of glamor there are dark secrets and dark corners, but we put it out of our minds, don't we? for those who had some exposure to Hollywood through whatever peripheral involvement they may have had, they all knew even more, because i am one who heard things often spoken of, sometimes in hushed tones, sometimes, loudly enough for all to hear. And I only spent some time in that part of the woods and knew a few people who knew people.

There has always been a very dark side to the performing arts - all of them, not just film (and i include football in the ""performing art"" category, as well as ballet, dance, comedy, news reading and what not). Performance arts, by definition, depend on - and derives its power - from showcasing physical bodies of humans. Often young ones. many times beautiful ones. And not infrequently, very talented ones. What on earth do people think it takes to get a role in, say, a movie? is an audition enough to get you in through the door? yes, it may be, once in a while, for some, but how do you even get that first audition? From time immemorial, the film industry in particular, has powerful older men (they are usually men) who can make or break careers of much younger and often extremely ambitious and driven people. people who want to become ""stars"". The supply of young talent way exceeds the demand too, so the power dynamics is even more skewed in favor of the established power brokers - from producers, to directors, to writers, to agents - and against the up-starts. Who can always be replaced. No one is indispensable in Hollywood and everyone knows that from the get-go.

Sure, it helps being the son or daughter of an already established actor/actress, and one can't help but notice that about 1/3 of all new roles go to people who have a relative in the industry. That too is the way it is, it's called Nepotism, I believe. If Weinstein offered a possible break to an unknown starlet, and the price was a certain humiliation, well, we might as well assume that the stories coming out now of the ones who rejected the advances are matched by the ones who didn't, probably more than 1:1. And, mind you, this only the sexual harassment part. We haven't even begun to hear the full sordid details of the abuse underlings are subjected to in industries such as film, fashion, theatre, etc. And that happens to men too - who would write the stories of the numerous instances of totally abusive behavior by the bosses that run the ""show""?

But there is that other side too, as this article makes clear - someone like Weinstein did have an out-sized talent for picking movies, shepherding them through and breathing new life into an industry that went into the doldrums. Weinstein could be extremely generous - as this screenwriter tells it - and charming when he wanted to be. So sometimes there is a little abuse to go with it - of all kinds -how far would some people go for a shot at something like the Oscars? many would probably go quite a bit further than they would like to admit, because of the feeling that the prize is worth a few insults to one's dignity. May be because 'dignity"" is something that's difficult to measure, and the price of compromised dignity may not show up for years.

My only surprise was how many people acted surprised. As if they didn't suspect that ""bad stuff happens behind the scenes"". As if they don't know that all too many people are willing to sell their souls for a chance for the big time. But people - as in most of us, me too - make the calculation that that's how show business is and figure they - who are not in the business - get off cheap - because the only price paid was the admission ticket..Do we really care how many lives may have been ruined in the course of making this one great movie we just saw? would any of us opt to not watch on moral principles alone? do we stop eating meat because the price the cows and chickens pay is measured in buckets of blood/ we are all like that, as humans. WE calculate that what we don't see won't hurt us, and so we go on as we were. 

We, the movie goers, the NFL football watchers, the ballet afficionados (as we tell ourselves that all these wonderful ballerinas are ""naturally thin"". Right. may be 20% are. The rest must take steps - daily - to stay on stage). To us, the tragedies that happen along the way to stardom seems worth it. The glitz, the glamor, the money - we assume that there are many tears backstage, and that makes us - who are not front and center stage - feel somehow vindicated and comfortable in our choices (assuming we had a choice) to do something else with our lives. 

Now we will all sit back and enjoy the sight of a Weinstein destroyed. Now, after we enjoyed the movies and watched the Oscars, and turned on the TV for the latest reality show. I am sure that when the book comes out about the Fall of the Titan, we'll read it and watch the movie about ""The Rise and Fall of a Mogul"". A new Citizen Kane for the ages. The one selected for opprobrium. But we should not delude ourselves - we were in on it all along, just as we are now eating popcorn and pruriently enjoying our scheidenfraude, especially as Weinstein, lets admit it, so looks the part. Who will play him in the movie sure to be made about him?

OK, so I know this sub is for politics, not idle reflections about the ""sordid politics"" of show business. But politics is also a form of performance art, and suffers from some of the same shortfalls. As if we didn't know that, either (of course we do! that's why we like Sanders - the clean politician, the one out of a thousand).

So, to end this little lamentation, let me ask - how many people were shocked to find out that Obama had his daughter Malia to intern with Weinstein? like there was no one to warn him? like he and Michelle shouldn't have been worried? like Bill Clinton who knew all about Weinstein (and Epstein) would not whisper a word in Michelle Obama's ear (if he didn't then he must be an even greater ass than I thought, were such possible)? I think the conspiracy of silence about hollywood (and new York) went far, but wasn't all that deep. If things reached my ears - me who is far far from that business, the politicians who took all the donations and were at the parties, heard nothing? and none would mention something to the Obamas?

I think we should think this one through because the conspiracy theorist in me is just wiggling.....

Again, you need to be specific here. The root cause of all the downvotes your parent comment has is that it was a response to somebody disagreeing with ""Hillary Clinton is completely self interested and incompetent"", and people are very fatigued with hearing about Benghazi in relation to this because it gets thrown up so often without specific details or links to Hillary Clinton.

Because you won't commit to a stance of ""Hillary Clinton intentionally burned US operatives in Benghazi in order to keep their illegal activities under wraps"", but instead want to say ""Lots of people in the State department were involved, including Hillary Clinton"", your stance that this is the proof needed to sway most reasonable opinions against her ends up lacking confidence. You've opened up with ""Hillary Clinton is bad because of Benghazi"", but elaborated into ""Anybody who ever worked for the State department is bad because of Benghazi"".

So you didn't end up being downvoted because reddit is full of Hillary shills or people who hate research or whatever. You got downvoted because this Benghazi thing has come up *constantly* in relation to Hillary Clinton, but getting a clear picture of what her negative actions actually were has been very difficult.

Again - Nixon ordered the DNC wiretapped. George W. Bush ordered a war over false pretenses. Bill Clinton convinced an intern to peform sexual favours on him in the Oval Office. Saying ""Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and the State Department is shady as fuck"" isn't strong enough.

Somebody I recently met told me that there was a change in Scottish legislation with regards to rented properties, that basically allowed tenants who had signed their contract before November 2017 to cancel their contract with a landlord or letting agency given 21 days' notice.

775hvs,8,2017-10-18,I have been approaching more and I want to know What am I doing wrong in approaching? My failures are affecting my confidence and my academics. How can I help myself?,subrooo,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/775hvs/i_have_been_approaching_more_and_i_want_to_know/,"It seems like just a few weeks ago I was 18 and a freshman with lots of potential. I was determined to have all the fun in college that I never got the chance to have in high school. I was in a coed dorm building with some of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen, I was majoring in a gold STEM field with rapidly growing job prospects. Fast forward to today and college is more than half over

 I have a large social circle. I am in a service coed frat (NO mixers with sororities, so that isn;t an option) and am in some service and sports (not intramural) clubs. I dorm. I don't understand why I am so alone and still a virgin if I have so many people around me. I feel so closed out from everyone, my weekends are spent sitting alone in my room watching happy couples and huge groups of eager friends walk by my window. I have to eat all my meals alone and everyone I DO know is busy/getting busier with school/work/SO.

Fall term is already 25% over and I am not making any progress. I've approached many women, but they either aren't interested or are taken. My desperation takes over and it creeps out the women. My game also sucks and I have NO idea how to cold approach a girl or how to flirt or get her to my place.

I'm becoming deathly afraid of the future. If I'm a lonely shut in virgin during college, the best time to meet friends, party (which only social Greeks can attend) and get girls, then what chance do I have once I have to get a job and never have any free time? What's worse is that all the fields I'm looking to are 90%+ male dominated so finding a partner through work is not something i can rely on. 
This is influencing my interactions with women and making me more desperate. My grades are also falling, and I never had internships. 

I have seen uglier and shorter and fatter guys with cute chicks.

I'm going to see a counselor (not wanting to harm myself, so don't worry). I don't know what I am doing wrong. I admit I need major help."
776okf,1,2017-10-18,"[M4F] You don't want him to see, do you? (Cheating)",hiddenrequiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/776okf/m4f_you_dont_want_him_to_see_do_you_cheating/,"It was a holiday party at your office. Everyone was drinking. Fun was had. When you heard one of the interns was a virgin, you decided to pay special attention to him for the night, and you even let him grope your bare breasts a little. it was all harmless fun.

But I was sober. I watched you flirt, and when you opened your blouse for the intern, I was close enough to snap a few pictures.

Months passed. You didn't even give a second thought to that night.

Then the email came. A picture of you, obviously enjoying the touch of a younger man, arching your back with your breasts exposed. You deleted it immediately.

Then one appeared on your phone, with a text message - ""You don't want your husband to see this, do you?""

You couldn't admit the truth to your husband - he's jealous and quick to react. He'd never understand. You maybe could have played it off if you told him right away, but it's been so long, there's no way this doesn't look like you've been covering it up.

It was time to play by my rules now. You reply simply; ""No.""

""Good. Do exactly as I say, and he never has to.""

*****

This is a cheating, coercion, blackmail scene that will hopefully become long-term. I'd like things to develop slowly, degenerating into a spiral of D/s, light humiliation, public/exhib, maybe even a free use scenario, as you do whatever it takes to save your marriage.

If you're interested send a message with a little bit about who you are going to be playing (or even a pic), and we can discuss how the story will begin.

If it's considered inappropriate to do so, then my second question would be, what kind of coding projects can I do on my own?

There aren't a whole lot of computer courses one can take at my Uni (although quite a few dealing with the mathematical theory, e.g. number theory, group theory, and encryption). Pretty much all my experience with computers is self-taught, and therefore with FOSS (e.g. linux/bash, python).

I don't really have work experience. I'm going to be doing some simple stuff on my github profile. Simple things like contributing to Windows 10 anti-telemetry scripts, and pet bash and python scripts. Should I be doing more? - e.g. answering questions on StackExchange and/or PowerUser?

778chw,2,2017-10-18,Is an Ivy League Degree Worth-it or Worthless?,Imgoingtogetit,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/778chw/is_an_ivy_league_degree_worthit_or_worthless/,"Ok, so quick background on me. I’m 18 years old, a recovering-beta, a chronic over-achier, virgin, and totally broke. 

I have a beefy scholarship to an ivy league college, majoring in Government (International Relations). My dream is to publish my novels, travel the world, and work in intelligence (Think CIA, FBI, Possibly UN), which more or less requires a fancy degree. So, I always assumed that it made sense for me to slog through a fancy university to make those dreams a reality. Plus, I’m set to join the craziest fraternity on campus next semester, which I’m hoping will turn me into a regular chad just by osmosis.

Trouble is, I’m on track to graduate with 50,000 in debt. Yeah, you read that right -- 50,000 dollars! I’m paying about 15,000 a year to these clowns, and although I might be able to pay off some of that with internships and hustle, I’m still doomed to struggle through soul-crushing debt after graduation. Now, obviously I’ve considered just filing for bankruptcy and starting from scratch, but that would destroy any chances of me snagging that intelligence job. Which brings me to the question:

**Is an ivy league degree worth-it or worthless?** With my major and career plans, am I making a smart choice, or am I just buying into a con?

My family doesn't know much about making smart financial decisions, and other mentors and friends are so blinded by the brand-name that they want me to commit. Plus, I worked my butt off just to get into this place, so I don’t really see what other option I have at this point.

Graduation income statistics are skewed because a huge chunk of the students are legacies, Chad’s who have a job waiting for them in daddy’s firm as soon as they graduate. I know because I’ve been taking notes on these guys, hoping that by finally being surrounded by winners some of that IDGAF mindset will rub off on me. Most of my life I’ve been surrounded by sheeple, and finally meeting the future movers and shakers is a big deal for me.

Any advice on how I can finance this ridiculously priced education of mine? Parents are paying for a fraction of it, but they’re not exactly wealthy, or even middle class. I’ve already maxed out any scholarship options, and I’m working my side hustle right now, but I don’t know if and when that will pay off. 

**I haven’t taken on any debt yet**, but I’m expected to buy into the system next semester. Guess I have cold feet.

Advice? Fire away!"
778ho2,1,2017-10-18,M4F - Opposites Attract,Mysterymanmeat1234,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/778ho2/m4f_opposites_attract/,"The cliche goes that opposites attract each other, just like magnets. You never thought that was really the case; throughout your first 3 years of high school you dated the typical good guy types, though nothing ever got really serious. Sure you kissed them and they put their hands on you, but none of them ever really tickled your fancy and got you just aching for something more. You wrote it off to just not finding the right person at the right time. But going into your senior year having just turned 18, you thought you had plenty of time to figure things out.

You were the poster child of the good girl next door. Naturally gorgeous without ever needing the slightest amount of make up. Your body had blossomed into one that models would envy; large breasts, thin waist, tiny features, pale skin, dark hair and shimmering blue eyes. In school you never missed a day, were at the head of your class in every respect, president of the student body, and never in any trouble with the law, never got into a fight and never laid a hand on anyone. Everyone thought you were this perfect little angel, and they were essentially right, until they became so wrong.

You had taken on an internship at a local office, apprenticing in business leadership, thinking that eventually you would work your way up until you were the head of some major corporation. On day 1 you showed up, everything in perfect place, not a single strand of hair out of place, nails manicured, dressed professionally and ready to do anything to learn about the world of business. You thought everything would be perfect, and then it fell apart...

So I hope you liked this setup. My idea is that this innocent angel becomes a corrupt little punching bag of a devil. Who am I in all of this? Well that's for you to say. Maybe I'm someone who used to go to school with you that wants to see your torn down to nothing, maybe I'm the boss who takes advantage of the pretty little nieve 18 year old and turns into a cum sucking slut, or maybe I'm a security guard who catches you in the building after hours and decides to use the unknown security violation against to get you to do what I want. Lots of possibilities here.

Heavy themes in this one would be dub-con turning into consensual, eventual submission, semi-clothed, public sex, cum play, blackmail, torture, anal, water sports, power play, impact play. What I envision happening is that girl who never really found what she wanted ends up falling in love with being treated like the lowest form of life there is and accepting every blow job, beating, and order given to her by whoever ends up taking control of her. I'm looking specifically for something long term, I prefer to write in first person but can change to third for the right person and I am only looking for someone who prefers longer, paragraph or more replies. Have a great Tuesday and I'll look forward to seeing some of you dirty girls in my inbox!"
778ijp,0,2017-10-18,Big 4 Office Transfer/Exit Advice?,timeforachange33,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/778ijp/big_4_office_transferexit_advice/,"Throwaway b/c some coworkers may know my username..

Alright so let me give a little background: I work in Big 4 in a major U.S. market. Started full time in August 2016 and joined up with the same team I interned on during January/February 2016 busy season - So I basically came back to the same team after having 6ish months off to study for CPA. Passed the CPA and now preparing for my third busy season (two full time and one as an intern) on the same client with essentially the same team. 

Since starting work I have always managed to maintain a positive outlook and be more of a half glass full kinda person even though I have slowly grown to despise what I do at work (fuck tons of control testing...) I have gotten above average reviews from my senior/manager and they seem to be very happy with my work/attitude. I am also extroverted, so I get along really well with everyone on our team and I have no problem striking up conversation with anyone on the team be it an intern or a partner. With that being said... I need a change. I told myself the moment I felt like I was going through the motions at work it was time to move on. I don't feel overly challenged and I kinda just go through the motions every single day. (Side note: I work with some very smart people but I feel like, on my team, you don't really start doing challenging work until you hit senior level at the earliest) I know I am learning but it doesn't feel like I am learning something you need an accounting background for... Lots of following step by step instructions and 'doing it how it was done last year'. Also, people are super nitpicky about bullshit things that do not add value to the client. I know it sounds like I need to go find a new job. Only problem is I really like everyone I work with, I don't want to burn bridges, and I don't know if I even want to leave the company...

What I do know is that I want to move. I have grown up, went to college, and taken my first career type job all in the same general vicinity of each other. I need some sort of change of pace in my life and despite all my complaints about work, I don't know if switching jobs is the solution. I think my job has become my scape goat of sorts. Sorry for the rambling.. I will get to the point of this post now. 

I'm basically wondering if anyone here has had any success transferring offices within Big 4? I know it happens all the time, but I don't know if it is easy to do at such an early stage in your career. I also have a lease signed that extends past busy season so I wouldn't be trying to leave my team until after this upcoming busy season. Any and all advice would be appreciated b/c if an office transfer is not possible then I know that I need to start looking for a job in a new location"
778nxp,14,2017-10-18,Jobs that pay ASAP that aren't physical labor?,cubitts,sanantonio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/778nxp/jobs_that_pay_asap_that_arent_physical_labor/,"The short version is the title: I need cash now, I don't have a structured settlement and I can't do physical labor jobs.

The longer version: I'm in a crap position right now. Basically when we moved I got really sidelined by being hospitalized for a few days, had yet another really bad post surgical infection, yadda yadda. I was planning on having a job by now but that hasn't happened! I'm in the process of applying and interviewing for several government agency jobs but that's a process that could take up to two months and I've got rent to pay and mouths to feed now. I'm tolerable at computer, type 84+ wpm with no errors and have one of those goofy Workforce Texas certificates to prove it, AAS in human services and BS in psych, some experience with homeless youth and at-risk youth via internships, bog standard customer service experience, I dunno what other salient points should go here. Hopefully the stuff I've already tried will be a good resource for someone in the future in a similar situation, so I'm including it.

Options I have considered or exhausted are:

- SNAP - as an adult with no dependents, I could only get 3 months of benefits, so I did that and now I'm tapped

- selling my bodily fluids like plasma - I'm on biologic medicines and I just finished a ten day round of antibiotics, so that's pretty much right out. I've also had two abdominal surgeries in the last calendar year, hence the no physical labor

- manpower for clerical - unlike heavy labor, options are limited and still require a screening process which takes time, which is not to say I'm against it but it doesn't solve the immediate problem

- rent assist programs - most of these require you to be on ""final notice"" before they'll help you and maybe it's just my complex but there doesn't really seem to be much time between ""final notice"" and ""police removing you from your home via court ordered eviction"" and I'd really, really like to avoid those situations if at all possible (essentially our complex is 3 day notice to quit on the 12th approx, court filings for eviction the 15th, which makes sense to me but doesn't leave a lot of room for error) not least because agency jobs will not love to see that I've got a court history; I like our complex and I don't want to put them in a crappy uncomfortable position

- food pantries - a lot of the ones I could find had drawn out approval processes with interviews to access a pantry that was open two days a month. 

- internet begging - most people on the internet are also broke. I received some graduation presents, moving fund presents sorta things, which is how we've made it through July - October on a single income, but even if I hadn't tapped out my friends generosity at a certain point it just feels icky to ask people I love to give me cash. my family is, generally speaking, far below the poverty line so family borrowing isn't an option.

- selling things of value - we moved 1800 miles with what fit in the trunk of a Chevy Cobalt, there is nothing to sell. other than the Cobalt, and selling our only vehicle in a city like San Antonio is absolutely pants on head bonkers.

last ditch resort, I may try getting a ""consolidation loan"" using the Cobalt title as collateral, but if I can avoid shackling myself to a predatory lender with 30%+ interest for the next three to six years I'd prefer to go that route. I don't have great credit (FICA sub-650) and my partner's is even worse so we aren't eligible for most shorter term loans through reputable, non-loan-shark institutions. I hate making this post but I hate it less than I hate being evicted or paying a vig on $2500 for the next six years so here I am. I know I'm hoping for some unicorn of a person who wants to pay someone immediately to do clerical or customer service or social work or pet care (oh yeah, I can do that too I suppose), but stranger things have happened."
778zr1,10,2017-10-18,Need some advice &amp; encouragement... (Day 42),citadel123,decaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/778zr1/need_some_advice_encouragement_day_42/,"I've been lurking on this thread for quite some time, but I’m finally posting because I need some advice &amp; encouragement.

I’m 21, go to a prestigious, intense university, and am set to graduate this year. I started drinking coffee when I was 12 or 13, and for 7 years there was not a day when I didn’t have (many) cups.

At school, my intake became more intense. I took a caffeine pill the second my alarm went off, ordered venti cold brews with extra shots, was consuming 500+mg a day often. Coffee was almost part of my identity, and certainly part of my academic success.

This summer, while working a pretty rigorous internship, I started realizing how debilitating this addiction was. I quite simply could not perform, could not think, could not operate without a large amount of caffeine in my system. I started reevaluating my relationship with the sweet, sweet nectar.

I also had been noticing symptoms of adrenal fatigue. I was always tired. It took me a long time to get my day moving. I slept in late whenever I could and slept badly. I was tired constantly and coffee was merely sustaining me.

So I quit. It was a difficult decision, but this sub helped me to it. That was 42 days ago. I’ve slipped twice (one green tea and one tall coffee when I had a huge project due) but otherwise nothing.

The first 2 weeks were classic — extreme (horrible) fatigue, brain fog, short temper, mild headaches, some digestive issues, etc.

But the last 3 have been arguably more difficult even as the acute symptoms subsided. A sort of filter of malaise has beset me. I am still tired. My energy is not where it once was. But above all else, I’ve fallen into a state of lethargy and depression that is tough to deal with at school. I’ve been consistently sleeping 7-8+ hours a night, but I do not have my energy back.

I also feel less witty, less sharp, and overall less happy &amp; invigorated.

Granted, there are plenty of positives as well. My sleep is deep. I feel “cleaner.” When the energy is good, it’s good. I eat healthier and drink a LOT more water. I love not relying on a stimulant.

I adore coffee and (likely) always will. But I am committed to reaping the benefits of this detox, especially after how heinous this process has been.

Can anyone relate to this timeline? What benefits can I still expect? I could use some encouragement from those who have made it this far.

77931o,372,2017-10-18,My (21F) boyfriend (22M) has a huge problem about me working at a club. Help?,itsjustajobbb,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/77931o/my_21f_boyfriend_22m_has_a_huge_problem_about_me/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I just turned 21, my boyfriend is 22. We met at school, almost a year ago. I’m a double major in biology and physics, and he is majoring in journalism. We both graduate in the spring, and will be joining the peace corps. This was both our individual plans before meeting each other. 

I’m an only child from a middle class, borderline abusive family that I don’t speak to and he is from a upper class (his parents make $1M+ together) family that would literally burn our city to the ground if someone so much as hurt him. 

They respect him, his opinion is valued, but he isn’t completely spoiled. He works, but only because his parents advised him to. They pay his rent, car insurance, health insurance, etc. He only pays for groceries, and he spends most of his time eating at my place. 

Our issue is that I’ve been working at a large gentleman’s club (the biggest in my state) for the past two years. I work 4 nights a week and have an internship with the Division of Public Health, but I make only a little more than minimum wage there. 

I make $500+  per night at the club. 

Unlike my boyfriend, I pay for all of my own expenses, including part of tuition (which his parents pay for) since my scholarships cover the rest. I don’t qualify for financial aid because of my parents income bracket, but I don’t speak to them or any of my family. 

He thinks my job is a waste of my time, that I could find one that pays “like just as much money” that’s relating to my career choice, he doesn’t like the way we have to dress (it’s lace bodysuits — not completely through — with thigh length satin robes and 4 inch heels). I’m just a server. I walk the floor and that’s it. 

I’ve told him before he could start paying my bills and I would quit, or he could just break up with me if he doesn’t like it and he won’t do either, but won’t shut up about it. He can’t find any of those other “jobs that pay just as much” and he even suggested that I’m only willing to work a low tier job because I’m black, and that I think he doesn’t understand because he’s white. 

I’m extremely close to just breaking up with him if he mentions it again. 

I’ve tried explaining that it’s just money, but he doesn’t get it. He thinks that if I can “do work like that” it says something about me as a person besides that I’m broke and paranoid about being even more broke. 

Any advice on what to do? I genuinely like him, which isn’t a common thing for me, but I don’t see why he can’t realize some jobs are just jobs and nothing more for working class people. And while he had statistical back up for his comment about our races, it still rubs me the wrong way. 

**TL;DR; : My boyfriend thinks me working as a hostess at a club is the end of the world and my self respect. I think it’s just money. Who’s right/wrong? 

Edit: he things “doing work like that” is bad because he thinks my “bright mind” should be used to help people and not feed into social and financial misogyny and some other bullshit that’s not going to pay my bills.  I wear my fair share of tight clothing outside of work, and he’s never made a peep. He’s also a self proclaimed feminist, and swears his issue with my job is the industry itself and the men it caters to. "
779tbl,2,2017-10-18,Question about Reference Letters,ArtDeco3,JETProgramme,https://www.reddit.com/r/JETProgramme/comments/779tbl/question_about_reference_letters/,"Hi, so I am almost done with my application and SoP, but I'm having a little trouble picking references...

There are 3 options, and I think I need at least one academic one, since I won't graduate until May, but all 3 are associated with my school.

Option A-- My University's Director of Global Perspectives. I don't know her that well, and had only had a few conversations with her until a few months ago, when I started an internship rebuilding her website. Ever since then, I have meetings with her every week, and she is impressed with my work and the ideas I have to offer. She also knows quite a bit about my international experiences, particularly a 4-month semester in Japan. She seemed very happy to write a reference, so I think this is a good option for a professional letter.

Option B-- The Administrative Assistant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs at my  school. I've known her for 3 years, and I've got 70 hours of experience as her volunteer TA. It is for a couple of classes that teach elderly people how to use computers at my university. Also, she really likes me, and has invited me back multiple times. I feel that I could make her an academic source, because she taught me how to be a TA and technically my volunteer hours count as a class with her. She is not a professor, but is in the higher ranks of the university. If I supply give my GPA and Graduation date, I can take care of the requirement...

Option C-- Associate Professor of Computer Information Systems. My major is computer information systems, and I have had the most classes with this professor. She is also an unofficial advisor to me, helping me more than my actual advisor. I have known her for almost 4 years, and she would be an obvious academic source. But I feel that she wants me to get a ""real job"" rather than go to Japan and be an ALT. Because of this, I am torn on what to do. But, I have made an A in every class of hers, and she could really vouch for my academics.


I've really been thinking options A and B, but maybe I need a letter from a professor, and that's starting to bother me.. What do you think? Thanks"

Looking to sell a printed HHKB Type-S. Bought it off of another user here at the beginning of the summer, and used it during my summer internship, but it hasn't been getting as much love during the school year. Looking to let it go at 280 shipped, or 270 local in NYC- haven't been on mechmarket for a while though, so let me know if this is unreasonable.

77cexp,2,2017-10-19,My job is making me depressed and I think this girl is breaking my heart.,Silver_Frost08,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/77cexp/my_job_is_making_me_depressed_and_i_think_this/,"I’ll start with a disclaimer. The novel of text below details my thoughts which have been building for far too long. Enter at your own risk. I salute you. But seriously…it’s long.

Not sure where to begin. I’m a 24 year old dude who has no reason to be depressed. I have friends. I have a degree in mechanical engineering. I have a job…but I hate it. I’ve been interning at this place since the end of July and I never leave happy or satisfied. My supervisors don’t acknowledge my work and most of my days consist of me standing around. Some days are the absolute epitome of nothing. I go home after work, cook dinner, watch tv and then go to bed to do it all again.
 
Now here is where things get interesting. I met this girl at work and we were/are dating. Quick background about my work. I’m an engineering intern and she’s a machine operator and our company is affiliated with Tesla to manufacture parts for them. The work space is a giant warehouse and they’ve been hiring high school kids through a temp agency. Let’s just say no one acts their age. Even the guys/gals in their 50s are just as immature as the kids. Everyone gossips and it reminds me of high school. Okay so now about the girl. She started working in August and we hit it off way too well. Like way too well as in I’ve never connected with a person this quickly as I did with her. She seems like a really good old friend I’ve never met before. Due to the immaturity of our work environment everyone “noticed” that we talk a lot. This led to a kid coming up to me saying if I find anyone attractive. Of course I knew who he was talking about but I played dumb. He said everything was okay since this mystery person liked me back. I eventually asked her out to see It and everything seemed perfect. We got ice cream afterwards and we talked for hours. We ended up driving in my car for the majority of the night discussing mutual interests: movies, cars, metal music, you name it. She seems like a perfect match for me. We have the same sense of humor and like I said I’ve never hit it off like this with another person before in my life. So we drove and drove trying decide what to do for the night. We got purposely lost just to enjoy each other’s company. I asked if we were on a date and she jokingly read some articles on the internet detailing signs if it’s a date or not. 

Now here’s where I dropped a bombshell. I told her that I’ve never been on a date before. Never kissed a girl. Virgin. All that good stuff. She didn’t have a problem with it. I eventually dropped her off and said goodnight. I texted her saying date or not thanks for coming. And she said she hoped it was a date. I then said I was gonna try to muster up the courage to ask her on another questionable date and she said if it wasn’t a real date she’d say no. We texted some more during the night and she said she was shocked that I’m a virgin because she thinks I’m so cool. She knows that I’ve lived a sheltered life and she said she can teach me about life. So the next day we texted all day until we went to sleep. The next few days I’d text her after work and we’d talk for hours. We exchanged stories of hoodrat things we did as kids and how her life is vastly different than mine. Let’s just say she’s had one hell of a life. By definition she’s a loner. More on that later.

So she came over the next night and we watched a movie on my couch. We weren’t sitting too close together so I eventually pulled a move and she fell asleep on my chest with my arm around her. So this is what’s going through my mind. She’s the first girl in my life who’s said she likes me and now she’s the first girl who’s ever been close to me. For someone to cuddle with me is like the equivalent of landing on the moon. So the movie ends, we talk some more and she leaves to go help her friend who was in a toxic relationship. She texted me later in the night saying sorry she left so abruptly. She said she hasn’t been with a guy in two years so this is new to her as well. Oh here’s a detail I’ve left out. She has a two year old son so this two year gap is because of her ex. I knew she had a son like day three of when she starting working. I mean it’s no big deal to me. But I know what you’re saying. “You’ve never been in a relationship before and you want to date a girl with a kid and very apparent emotional problems?!?” I know. Believe me. I know. 

Okay next night comes around. We get ice cream around 7:00 and we drive again until midnight or so. She dropped me off and I wanted to make a move but I didn’t. I texted her saying if I’m supposed to make a move that she should let me know. She said I’ll know when to do it but I’m scared. Damn straight I’m scared. We ended the conversation by saying she likes being around me and I like being around her too. Let’s just say that not many people can convince me to stay out that late. Oh and I have epilepsy so I don’t like to stay out late.

Next night. We go to see another movie again. We saw Mother! and it was batshit insane. Anyway. I drove her back to my place so she could get her car. And this is how you know I’m insane. I let her drive my new car which is an honor I rarely give out. I drive a modded Mitsubishi sports sedan so it can really get up and go. I let her drive for a few more hours and we go back to my place. Her loner vibes kick in and she said she was going to karaoke alone. She does this a lot so I say that’s fine. Cue 10 minutes later and she said she’s coming back to my place. I know she wants to go slow I have no expectations in mind. She comes over and we watch Twin Peaks until one in the morning. Bad idea since we have to get up at five. So we sleep in the same bed and it was only cuddles which led to the best worst sleep I’ve ever had. Her alarm goes off and we hold hands until she leaves. Nothing like this has ever happened in my life before so it all feels like a dream. After work she texts me saying we should do it again on a weekend so we don’t wake up dead. That sounds great to me.

Two nights later. She invites me over even though she has her son. She gets him every other week. She said she normally doesn’t let guys around her kid but I’m an exception. So we hang at her place and she puts her son to bed. We watch more Twin Peaks and she falls asleep on the couch. We hold  hands and I ask her if she wants me to stay and she says yes. So we sleep together and it was cuddles again but I’m not complaining. This was on a Saturday and unfortunately, we had to work seven day work weeks but I got off since I’m an intern. She leaves at five and I sleep in and go home around nine or so. All of this still feels like a dream to me. 

We text almost every day for the next ten days or so. She works the first shift and I spill over into the second shift since I start work at eight. It’s around four in the afternoon and the operators are on their ten minute break. I’m working with the other intern and a few of the operators thought it would be a good day for a street race on their motorcycles. They fly by going at least eighty. Ten seconds later someone comes in saying to call an ambulance. Yup. One of the guys crashed riding his Hayabusa. He died on impact. They let us go early. That was interesting way to end the day. I text…I still haven’t given her a moniker. She’ll be an arbitrary letter; M. Earlier on in the day I made plans with a guy from work to hit golf balls at the local marina lake. I ask M to come along and she says okay. I carpool with her to the marina and we get some dinner at a 1950s diner while we wait for our coworker to show up. The other intern shows up and we had a blast hitting golf balls. We later go on to play laser tag and we finish the night riding a mechanical bull. I haven’t had that much fun in a long time. We all needed it. We part ways and I let M drive my car again. On the way home we hit over a hundred miles per hour on one of the city boulevards. That was a first in my life. Especially since I wasn’t driving. We get to my place and she needs to charge her phone. We watch The Twilight Zone for twenty minutes and she decides to go downtown. I secretly wanted her to say but I didn’t say anything. I trust her since she goes to the same dive bar a few times a week. Yes she suffers from depression. Yes she’s told me. Yes it’s probably not healthy for a relationship. 

I forgot to talk about an important day. A few days before we went out to hit golf balls, one of our strange coworkers came up to me out of the blue during work. She bombarded me with things like “You shouldn’t see M again. Give up on her. She’s not interested.” While she’s saying this to me one of the 18 year high school kids is agreeing with her. He says that M is in a “prime hoe period of her life” and I should let her go. I don’t really know what to say. The weird lady says M has never been turned down by a guy in her life. This feels like an icy spear in my soul. But I know I have to talk to M to find out. I text her after work and she says the weird lady messaged her on Facebook saying she was sorry for what she said to me. She also said she was gonna quit since she feels like she’s in her 20s again when she talks to us. Oh and her husband died a year ago and she still has all his things including yogurt in the fridge. M says she’s “not not interested” but she doesn’t want her depression getting in way of a relationship. Okay I respect her for telling me that. M says we can still talk and hang out and the likes. This was before the laser tag night so things still go well.

But now I’m depressed as hell. Like I think I need to talk to a shrink depressed. So M lives a vicious cycle. She has her son every other week and I let her enjoy that time. The week after that she goes to the bars and drinks since she misses her son. The next week her son gets admitted to the hospital. I let her know I’m here if she needs me. Her son recovers just fine. The next week I ask M to hang out but she’s moving from an apartment into a house so I know she’s legitimately busy. She says we can hang when she has time. A while back she said that’s one of the reasons why she doesn’t date; she doesn’t have time. This is all last week mind you. She finishes moving early in the week so I ask to hang and she says we can when she has time. My depression hits with a vengeance. It’s a mix of intense sadness and anger so I’m starting to think I’m bipolar. I live alone so the loneliness doesn’t help. And yes sometimes I cry at night. The other night I punched the walls and I cracked one of our flimsy doors. I sort of broke down and I sit on the floor for a while. I was gonna call M and tell her I need to talk but a friend of mine calls and says they need a ride from downtown. It’s like it was meant to be. So I pick them up and everything is fine. Now it’s this week and I’m still depressed. I haven’t seen M since the night of laser tag (coming up on three weeks). I’ve been talking to my friends and I ask “How many times should I be the one to try to initiate plans? But I still have hope since M texted me first plenty of nights even if it was to chat. All my friends say she sounds like too much work and there’s a bunch of red flags. I texted her last night to see if she wants to grab dinner on Friday and I get no response. She has her son this week so I attribute it to that. Here’s another thing. I texted her last Friday which is when she gets her son. I text her asking if we can finish that Twilight Episode since we only have eight minutes left. She says she has her son and I ask if we can finish it while he’s asleep. She says no. But it’s a no I don’t know how to interpret. She said she prefers total alone time with her son and if he’s sleeping she doesn’t want anyone over. She goes on to say that she tried it once with me and she didn’t enjoy it. This confuses me because she said she wanted me to stay that night. 

So that pretty much leads up to now. I’m still depressed. My friends say to forget about her. A part of me says the same but another part of me says to hang in there. A few days ago I took a step back and revaluated the bigger picture. I’ve come to realize that it’s not all about me and my emotions. She’s not there to make ME happy. So I’ve sort of come to terms with that. But at the same time I think about her every day. She’s usually the first thing I wake up thinking about and she’s the last thing on my mind at night. Sometimes I even wake up during the night in a sort of depressive spell thinking about her.  I’m killing myself and I know it. This isn’t a healthy way to live. What do I do? She’s the first girl in my life who said she likes me and has shown me affection. I think that has a lot to do with it. Like I’m still stuck in the “honeymoon” phase. I find myself clinging to those happy nights of us sleeping together. I reread our conversations to feel happy. But I also think about how I may not ever find a girl like her again. Sure there maybe someone “like” her but it won’t be her. And what if I don’t? What if I’m alone forever? What if? Lately I’ve been watching Mr Robot and I feel just like Elliott. I feel too alone. I cry. I have nothing. Except I do. I have friends and family and a job and an education. But it just doesn’t feel like anything. I honestly don’t remember the days since I’m stuck in a loop. Good thing I keep a journal; I have been since 2013 when I was depressed then. I do the exact same thing every day. I have nothing to look forward to. I’ve lost interest in things that I used to like. I also can’t finish things. I don’t want to finish tv shows since I’ll miss the characters and I don’t want their story to end. Same with books. I don’t want their stories to end since I become so engrossed in immersing myself in their story. 

I’m lost. I feel bipolar and depressed. I’ve been looking for a new job. It took me seven months after college to find this one. I want to be with M. How long do I wait? What do I say? Say I want an answer from here? Tell her these thoughts? Or play it cool? My friends say she sound wishy washy. To sum up with M. She’s strong as hell. She intimidates the guys at work with her sense of humor and backbone. She’s not afraid to say what’s on her mind. But that lends to my insecurities. Yesterday at work she said she’d suck a coworkers dick for a favor or something. I know she’s joking since the kid is 18 but still (she’s 24 too). And the other day a kid said he saw someone getting head in the parking lot during work so my mind instantly though of M. He said it wasn’t her though. 

I feel like I could continue writing for hours. And I kind of want to. But what’s the point? I just want an answer from M. I want a new job. I want to feel happy again. I want to be with M. If you stuck around this long to read all of this I applaud you. If not, at least I tried. And before you say, “get out and meet new people” I don’t know how. I’m tired and alone and I’ve been that way for years.

77efqe,4,2017-10-19,"Me [23 M/] with my girlfriend [20 /F] duration, unsure of how to proceed",Reading1233,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/77efqe/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_20_f_duration_unsure/,"Hi /r relationships, i am in a bit of a predicament and am unsure of how i should proceed and would like to seek opinions of other people.

I (23M South Korean) have been dating my (20F Serbian) girlfriend for almost 4 months now, and provided we have had our share of ups and downs, everything has been wonderful. I have met this girl at university, at one of the social clubs that I have recently joined. This club primarily organises parties, events and such for other university students.



I should provide a bit of background information, I have always been fairly popular with women, and have had plentiful dating experience (in the double digits). However that was during my early to late teens and since then I have matured significantly and have been pursuing something far more substantial without much success. Whether it was my standards being too high, or having not found the right person just yet, or a mixture of other reasons, I have ended up being single for a fairly long time.



From the moment I met my current girlfriend I had this odd feeling that something would happen between us. We were in the same interview groups for the club, and ended up making small talk during and after the interviews. As we got accepted into the club it was only natural that we would spend more time together as we would run into each other quite frequently in and out of university, and began to talk on facebook/snapchat. For me whether it was my arrogance or just gut instinct, I had a feeling that this girl saw me in a way that was more than a friend, and was confirmed by mutual friends. At this point however I have expressed zero interest in her, and made it clear that it was so, as i respected this girl for who she was and did not want to lead her on or give her any false hope. 



Fast forward 6 months, during our semester break, the club has organised a trip for all club members where we would rent a house and pretty much drink for a week straight, a club bonding experience if you will. This was where my and my girlfriend first got together, as I wanted to give her a chance since she pursued me so relentlessly after stopping all of her advances and out of respect i felt like what could be the harm in giving her a shot. And boy am i glad i did. As i got to know more about her i began to realise how similar we are in so many regards, and just how comfortable i felt around her.



It is here where the problem lies however. My girlfriend has always had quite a few guys continuously going after her and trying to get in her pants bla bla just guy stuff. Obviously I am not exactly thrilled about this, but at the same time I know relationships are built on trust, and i trust her implicitly, and let her do what she wants as i know she wouldnt compromise what we have.



There was always one guy within the club she was quite close to. He had a girlfriend at the time and was not interested in her, but she expressed that she thought he was 'cute'. My girlfriend developed a fairly strong bond with him as she felt he had a massive impact on her life (forced her to join the club which she is very thankful for) and provided other opportunities internship wise through his connections. They began to talk frequently and became good friends that way. However shortly before the trip, he ended things with his long term girlfriend and planned to move to a different state for good. 



It is here that he began to express interest in her, whether it was for a rebound or because he knew she thought he was cute or because he was bored whatever i do not know. But he began to persistently flirt with her touch her and whatnot. I should note this is before me and her got together. However, she told me that he came clean with his feelings towards her and tried his best to get with her. What i did not find out for 4months later was that she said he ended up kissing her, (to her recollection which she did not reciprocate) and that was the end of that nothing went further. She furthermore states she never wanted anything to do with him in that way, and only sees me in her life.



Now it is here i propose my dilemma reddit. She told me she couldnt bear to tell me about this until 4 months later because a) she felt it was unnessecary since we werent together yet. b) she knows i have quite strong emnity with the man and didnt want to cause problems. c) thought i would overreact and could potentially ruin what we had.



While i do appreciate her honesty in telling me eventually albeit a bit late, what hurts me is that she still continues to talk with this man on a friendly basis. My girlfriend is the type of person who finds it hard to say no, and is so bright and friendly, and yet she doesnt have many 'close' friends. I understand that she has had a big impact on her life, and while she did offer to cease all contact with him, I still trusted her and know that he is important to her. So built on my trust for her, i felt bad about taking that away from her. To be completely truthful the kiss doesnt bother me in the slightest. Its just a combination of the fact that she didnt tell me that piece of information until now, and why she continues to talk with him if she knows thats just how strongly he feels about her.


**TL;DR; : I am not sad, angry. While i am happy my girlfriend is comfortable enough to share everything with me, i am just a bit confused on how i should react.**

77emcs,18,2017-10-19,"Me [17 F] with my family's expectations for me, more specifically my mom [40sF].",jiffylube247,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/77emcs/me_17_f_with_my_familys_expectations_for_me_more/,"Hello! I'm a person who struggles immensely with anxiety. I'm diagnosed ADHD, and have been so since I was younger, but I think there might be more than that here.

Currently, I'm a senior in high school. My parents hired a person to help me out with college applications and essays, which I think is awesome! I'm very thankful to them for that. Me and this lady have been discussing what kind of school I'd like to go to, and I've stressed that the kind of school I want to go to is one with opportunities above all else: I'd like to go to a school with a lot of internships and job opportunities if I can. I was offered a full time job as a graphic designer for 60k a year pretty far from my state, and I have significant experience doing contracted work.

However, my mom is a **complete** worrywart, and has been that way since I was younger. Her stress has negatively influenced me immensely in the past. I used to ball up tests and throw them away when they weren't grades she would like in elementary school because I knew that if I brought home a bad grade I'd get yelled at for hours on end about how I was useless, basically. This happened for years upon years and eventually led to me developing a ridiculous fear of judgement: I tear up and shut down. Around sophomore year, my brother started getting arrested and becoming a troublemaker, so my mom spent hours a day getting angry at him: since he wasn't home, she would spend hours ranting to me about him and taking her anger out on me through more and more lectures when I haven't really done anything wrong. I started having panic attacks around then, I think? 

Anyway, my fear of judgement is very, very deep rooted. I want to get into rock climbing, but am so worried about meeting someone I know near me that the only place I'm considering is a 30 minute drive away. I'm a very accomplished person, but because of that fear of judgement, I don't tell my parents anything about what I'm doing upstairs. I founded a couple clubs at my school, was the leader of all of them, had 3 jobs, and am currently getting paid as a graphic designer! I've done a very, very large number of extracurriculars, but stress at home led to a lack of sleep which led to a low GPA (3.42), but I am taking all honors classes and have been doing so all throughout high school.

Last night, everything came to a head when the parents sprung on me that they want me to go on college visits. I've told them in the past that I don't want to visit colleges because it'll interfere with my ability to study and finish out the first semester strong. I need to get my grades up like they say, so I've told them to please stop scheduling things without telling me. My mom panics, sits me down at the table with my dad and yells at me for an hour again about how I'm making a mistake. How my grades should've been better, but I'm too lazy and I didn't try hard enough and am a disappointment to her and my dad and now I have to choose from these no-name schools that she's never even heard of and how I'm gonna make her waste money on college. She doesn't want to visit these colleges -- she's doing it for me! She said how she wants to see my essays because she thinks I'm lying on them about the stuff I did during high school and how if I worked harder I wouldn't be in this position where I'm not gonna get into the ivy league schools. She doesn't think I'm gonna get an internship because my GPA isn't high enough and I don't have any experience with anything in her eyes, and how going to a college without taking visits first is, in her eyes, a mistake.

Now, I understand where her fear's coming from. My father went to a school that he thought he'd like without researching it first and ended up miserable. He was able to transfer to a different school that changed his life, but he felt like he wasted a year of his life there and she doesn't want that happening to me. I get it. I probably could have retorted with something to counter any or all of those points, the jobs or any of that, but the complete disapproval from her over everything basically caused me to shut down and panic and start crying at the table again. I asked her if I could go so many times, but she wouldn't let me leave. She was like ""why are you tearing up over a conversation?"" I couldn't explain myself because I was stuttering too hard. She responded ""that's stupid. you're stupid."" I started feeling worse and worse until I ended having a full-on panic attack and had to take 2 hours in my room after dinner that night to calm down. I'm looking at out of state schools especially because I just can't deal with anything coming from any of them anymore.

This morning, it took me an hour and a half to get out of bed. I've been fighting off another panic attack all morning. I can't live like this anymore. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Mom doesn't realize how bad my fear of confrontation is and deals with everything the wrong way. It's led to problems on my end. I don't know what to do."
77eq85,1,2017-10-19,[M4F] My Mom's Friend (And Maybe My Mom Too!),bladesofsteel21,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/77eq85/m4f_my_moms_friend_and_maybe_my_mom_too/,"I'm home from school for the summer and the days are dragging. I'm about to enter my senior year of college and my internship is nearly half over already. It has been several weeks of the nine-to-five and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I want the summer to end. Being an only child, I was always given a lot of attention from my loving mom. I did my best to make my dad proud, but it never seemed to be enough. With his constant travelling for work, he wasn't there to see me play youth sports and was only proud when I brought home a trophy...mainly so he had something to display next to his self-made wall of fame.

You...you are my mom's best friend and neighbor and the woman I first ever fantasized about when I first discovered the joys of masturbation. You have a loving husband but over the years, something has been missing in your life. You simply don't know what yet. You and my mom both don't have to work as your husbands bring in more than enough to support the families. You often find yourself lounging around our pool with my mom.

It's Friday around 3 PM. I got off work early and couldn't wait to come home. The truth is I knew you would be over and I could get a glimpse of you in a bikini as you lay out. It's nearly 90 degrees and I cannot wait to jump in the pool. I throw on some trunks and head out to the pool and find [you and my floating around sipping your drinks](http://www.clearwatercolumbus.com/two-women-pool-float.jpg). We make small talk and my mom excuses herself to go inside for a moment. 

The conversation between you and I continues and we get a little personal. I tell you I am not seeing anyone and you tell me your husband is away on business so you're staying alone. You tell me that you often get scared staying alone and you were thinking about staying at our house for the night since my dad is away on business as well. Soon after my mom comes out and you quickly change the subject. You and my mom excuse yourselves after and I continue to swim alone. I begin think to myself ""was she just trying to tell me something?""  

I swim for a little longer then get on a float and begin to daydream as I cannot get the image of you in your bikini out of my head. I start to wonder just what it is you two are doing inside the house and my fantasy begins to include my mom. I envision the two of you in her room slowly pulling your bikinis off as you lay next to each other and are making out. I begin to doze off and wake up sometime later. The sun is still out but it is time I head back in to the house. I grab my towel and head for the back door...
______________________________________
I will let you decide what happens from there. Do I walk in on you and my mom going at it? Do you go back home and invite me over? Do you spend the night and find a way to sneak to my room/somewhere else in the house? Do we include my mom as well? (if you cannot tell, a kink of mine is definitely incest). We could both play the role of her and direct her based on whose turn it is. You can determine your age in the RP, add more back story to your character, and make any other changes you like.
___________________________________________
I'm pretty open sexually. Some of my other kinks include being dominant, anal, light bondage, deep throat, threesomes, public sex, and age play (18+ only). But I'm open to any and all suggestions. I am looking for long term RP for this. "
77ezzx,2,2017-10-19,Depressed Uni student,Hous3r,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/77ezzx/depressed_uni_student/,"Hi, I hope you don't mind if I vent here for a bit..

I'm not exactly sure if I have depression. I was a sad kid throughout all of my life really, but it's not like I could not get out of bed or do things I wanted, but it was always a challenge to some extent. I always had social anxiety, at least I think I did because besides my few true friends, i could not talk to people at all.


Now I am studying abroad at a nice university and could not be more proud even though it took me a lot of will power to get here. But the experience here was not what I expected. I am now a third year compsci student and for the past two years I couldn't make any friends. My social anxiety worsened the more time I spent alone. To the point where I always felt isolated and judged by everyone. 


While at first I was a really good student, due to my worsening anxiety my grades started to drop. I started missing lectures and really struggling with exams. Then I didn't get the internship I wanted and I know that there is a lot of competition in my field and I dont even have experience. Then I had to find a supervisor for my dissertation and I just couldnt think of anything I would be interested. I think that's when I sort of gave up. Came back home because I couldnt deal with it anymore and spent my whole summer just trying to exist as hard as I could. Went for many walks feeling depersonalized and really low.


The summer ended and I had to come back to my uni life. The problem is that I was still feeling the same way. And now I really have to do a lot. And Im afraid I just can't. I don't want to drop out. I had to choose whatever the supervisor was left after the summer, and I really struggled with coming up with a topic. In fact I still dont really know it. I just agreed on whatever my supervisor suggested because I couldnt come up with anything myself. And now I feel like I am in a territory where I have no knowledge. And its scary. My deadline for the project proposal is really soon and I havent slept and Im shivering from anxiety and I just dont feel like I can cope. 

There is a counselling service at uni and I think its time to get an appointment. What else can I do? Life feels really hard right now.

Hoffman said recently that some students already are being placed for summer of 2018.

Businesses and nonprofit organizations outside the church also are encouraged to take on interns, providing them experience related to majors or a career. Jan Gray handles those inquiries at the college.

Internships are an integral part of Graceland’s experience for students, Hoffman said. Positions related to a major or career help them prepare for employment. An internship related to the Community of Christ's mission can help prepare students for bi-vocational ministry.

Most students would benefit from paid internships. Transportation, housing, and meals might also be considered for internship plans. Resources to help plan an internship are available.

This amazing news had a catch though, a big one. The rich man had seen you, and was immediately taken. When he approached your father, he already knew a lot, and had the terms of the deal already lined up. You tell your father he can’t possibly take the deal, and that’s when his eyes fall to the floor.

“It’s already done,” he tells you, the excitement slipping from his voice, “I signed the papers.”

You protest, standing up and stomping your feet. This is illegal!

“The contract was very thorough,” he says as sweat forms on his brow, “you’re going to be an intern of sorts. This will give you the best education, and opportunities I never could.”

Tears form in his eyes as you beg him to take it back. You clutch at his sweater, and he takes your hands in his. You can feel now how much he’s shaking.

“If I do, he’ll take away my funding. And- and he owns the shop. If I back out, he could take it away,” he says. “Please, do it for me.”

A knock at the door makes both of you turn towards it. Your father stands up a little straighter and informs you that the driver is here for you, ready to take you to your new life. He wraps his arms around you, hugging you tight to him.

“I’ll come visit if he lets me. I love you,” he says, kissing you on the forehead. He steps back, and nods towards the door.

I am looking for someone for a long term roleplay. I am as into the plot and world building as I am the smut. We can discuss some details before hand, or you can jump right in to things. While there’s definite dubcon elements, I think there’s still a lot of room for fun and some lighthearted parts. Perhaps you take to the lifestyle instantly, or maybe you need a firmer guiding hand.

As for ages, we can discuss that or just both decide in the moment. I wouldn’t want you to be younger than 13, or me older than 50.

My kinks are oral, anal, teasing/edgeplay, partially/clothed sex, dom/sub, rough sex, age gaps, public/risk of getting caught, name calling, light pain, group (preferably FFM), and a lot more. If it’s not listed, I am likely still open to it.

My limits are gore, scat, beastiality, futa, and rape."

77gfjh,0,2017-10-19,Aizawa was a mistake,Soncikuro,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/77gfjh/aizawa_was_a_mistake/,"Good morning/afternoon/evening.

First of all, please excuse my english. Second of all, this a pretty long text, I'm sorry I couldn't summarize it.

Let's get to the point, Aizawa's Quirk is absurdly powerful, it negates the Quirk of others and essentially makes them vulnerable, they can no longer defend themselves with their Quirks, the only exception to this are mutant types, but that's irrelevant because of two reasons, one is that the story hasn't shown any major villain with a mutant type Quirk and two, Aizawa  retconned/specified to us in [Chapter 135]( http://manga.fascans.com/manga/my-hero-academia/135/13) that he DOES affect mutant types, what he doesn't affect is the inherent strength that some of Mutant type Quirks grant, as shown by a drawing of a person's Quirk, a **tail**, being unable to be used when Aizawa  uses Erasure on him.

Horikoshi knew that Aizawa's Quirk was too strong from the beginning, which is why he gave Aizawa dry eyes, but I have problems with that, one is that there's medicine for dry eyes and not just the standard eye drops that he uses, which alleviates the symptoms by quite a bit. Not only that, but the weakness itself is a bit convoluted, Horikoshi could have simply written that in battle, sometimes, you can't help but wink, but then there's also the fact that Aizawa should have trained himself to not close his eyes, that and combined with proper medicine he should have a good 30 seconds without closing his eyes no problem.

Then in the USJ arc, we were shown 2 other weaknesses, one of them is that the more he uses his Quirk the less time he can use it before it turns off, that's understandable, but then we were given the absolutely most idiotic weakness for a character power I have seen in my life: whenever Aizawa uses his Quirk, his hair floats up and when he deactivates it, it goes down. This is pointed out by Shigaraki and exploited by him, [breaking Aizawa's elbow]( http://manga.fascans.com/manga/my-hero-academia/16/14). Now, as a weakness, it's fine, but here's the thing and the reason it's idiotic: Aizawa has been presented as the most logical thinker of the manga, and you're going to tell me that, not only he didn't know about the weakness, but he also **didn't cut his hair after being taught by Shigaraki?**. Horikoshi understood it was dumb, he messed up big time with that, which is why it was never brought up again in the story.

And then finally, after getting his face pummeled to the ground multiple times, he acquired a new weakness, after deactivating his Quirk he has to wait some time to use it again. I'm guessing, said time is left undetermined for writing freedom. 

Then even after all that, Horikoshi knew that Aizawa was still simply too strong, because when it comes to fights, Aizawa hasn't actually done anything impressive in the series (I will only mention the arcs where he fights):

- USJ arc: defeats some mooks and then gets wrecked by the anti-All Might Nomu. To be fair, he used his Quirk on shigaraki when he attacked Tsuyu, avoiding her death.

- Final exams arc: fights against Todoroki and Yaoyorozu and loses. I won't criticize this too much because of the weight bracelets and him going easy on Yaoyorozu at her mistake in the final attack to boost her confidence, which is ultimately what defeated him.

- School trip arc: get's sneak attacked, dodges it and the attacker (a clone) dissolves, whether because of Erasure or other reason we don't know.

- Internship Arc: used Quirk on some mooks in [chapter 139]( http://manga.fascans.com/manga/my-hero-academia/139/8), used his Quirk again against 3 of the Bullets and momentarily knockouts one of them, used Erasure against Toga, tries to capture her but instead gets outmaneuvered and get's stabbed on his back ( and remember, this is the guy with a 6/5 in Technique), then uses his Quirk on Mimic so that he can't protect himself and finally uses Erasure on Overhaul before getting sneak attacked and momentarily kidnapped ( we don't know if he gets kidnapped to be rescued in another arc).

Then there's also another problem, in the Hideout arc he went to the broadcast to give the villain Alliance a sense of protection, to make them think they weren't going to be attacked that same moment. On paper it sounds great, until you remember Aizawa could have been used to defeat AfO in a literal second with All Might attacking. I'm divided with this, overall both sides make sense, but I can't help but think that Aizawa helping would have made more sense. All Might and Gran Torino should have known AfO would appear, they should have brought the one human capable of granting them a sure victory. For dramatic purposes in the story I won't criticize this too much either.

So there's that. While I like Aizawa from a character standpoint, his Quirk has brought him done from a narrative standpoint. It feels like Horikoshi wanted to make another Kakashi, from Naruto, but went overboard and hasn't made him live up to the ''hype''. Let's just hope that, just like Kakashi, he doesn't get changed into Yamato and get kidnapped for his cells/power for the rest of the series, never to be mentioned again.

**So, what do you think? Do you agree or disagree? What's your opinion of Aizawa?**"
77gore,9,2017-10-19,How old were you when you were made manager? Am I selling myself short?,mkg_c,adops,https://www.reddit.com/r/adops/comments/77gore/how_old_were_you_when_you_were_made_manager_am_i/,"X-Post from /r/Programmatic

&amp;nbsp;

About me: 25y/o, M, 2 years of experience (3 if you count internships), no previous managerial experience other than hiring &amp; training &amp; mentoring interns. 

Yesterday, I passed up on the opportunity to lead a team at a reputable international agency (along with a **very** hefty pay raise, more than 50% of what I am getting paid now) to sign at a budding ad tech startup as an individual contributor (with less pay, of course). When I made the decision I felt like I wasn't fully ready to lead and manage people, as the last thing I wanted to do was be an incapable manager. I did hear that it's becoming more uncommon for people in the mid 20s to become a manager in this field, with only 1-2 years of experience (especially in digital). Now I'm thinking, am I doubting myself too much and letting the fear of failure get the better of me? Am I selling myself short? Will I ever be ready to be in a position of leadership?

&amp;nbsp;

So I wanted to ask you all, How old were you when you were first offered the position to lead a team? Did you feel like you were rushing into it? Were there any consequences of getting into it too early?"

I've been trying to write a post since months and every time I started writing I deleted everything and convinced myself that it's not necessary, but I can't take it anymore and I'm just going to write.
 
I am a 17 years old student at a technical secondary school in Germany. This year I am attending the 11th grade and therefor every I should do 2 internships, 1 per semester. I chose to do mine at a school in my area, because I find it very interesting to work with children.

By tomorrow it will be 3 weeks since I started working, and what can I say? I love this place; the children are very nice and I enjoy spending my time with them doing different activities.
 
Everything was great today, until a girl (11) from the 6th grade came to me crying.

I immediately went to here and asked if she is okay and why she is crying. She was so scared that she could barely speak, once she calmed down a little bit she started telling me what happened to her.
 
While walking to her class 3 boys approached her and asked if she knew a boy called ""T"", when she said that she knew him and that he is her older brother they pushed her to the ground and started kicking her and pulling her hair.
 
When I heard that, the only thing I was thinking about at that moment was catching these fuckers and just keep punching them in the face until they lose their consciousness, because that girl and her brother are the nicest people I’ve met and she doesn’t deserve to go through this. Did I beat the hell out of them? NO.
 
The girl didn’t know who they were, so me and my supervisor started asking students if they have any leads and after a few minutes we got their names and class, but guess what? We shouldn’t go to them because they were in another school department.
 
After many calls with their department and explaining what happened, they told us that the 3 bastards will just get fucking suspended for one week! After all what they have done to her, humiliating her and her dignity and damaging her personality probably for the rest of her life, that is all what they will get, just one fucking week!
 
“An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.”, no it fucking won’t Gandhi. The only thing that will happen is that the world will become a better place, a place where people would be able to live their lives without the constant fear of being attacked, killed or raped just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, a place where scumbags would think a thousand time before deciding to hurt somebody for no reason.
 
Every time I open the Facebook app on my phone I read about innocents being killed by some lunatic asshole. Every time I go on Reddit I read about people being cheated on even though they did many sacrifices for their partner. How is this even fair? Why did our world become like this?
 
Instead of helping each other, we stab each other in the back. We expect from others things we wouldn’t do for them. We complain about everything and everyone and when we get the chance to make a change we ignore everything and only look for our personal interests.
 
I could write and write till my fingers start to hurt, but I don’t think the thoughts of a teenager would interest anyone or do any favor to this sad world.

I'm the girl you go to when you want someone who worships you and is so happy for your attention, your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't care, glad that you have someone to take care of your less vanilla desires. 

You have a young blonde girl in the city who wants to be that girl, maybe you met me when I was touring your office, an intern you saw a better position for, maybe you're a friend of my father's and you groomed me to be so sweet for you.

Maybe you want me to lactate for you and every day I bring you lunch in you office and then you feed from my tits. Maybe you want me to wear a butt plug so when you come home to the apartment you can fuck me nice and hard before going off to your wife. Maybe you just spend the weeks with me and weekends at home and every day you come home and make sure I've been good for you, and if I haven't you spank me good and hard to remind me. You love that I wear what you like, that I'm so excited to create a world for you where your pleasure is the most important thing. We go shopping together and you approve everything I own.

Maybe you just need to come home and put me over the trendy breakfast bar, and fuck me good and hard. Maybe what you need after a hard day is to order me over the sofa and take it out on my ass with your hand. You love knowing that I'm at the apartment, waiting for you and so willing to do anything for you.

I'm not looking to be humiliated, just be the eager girl you can finally afford to keep to do everything you want to. Your wife either doesn't know about me or doesn't mind, knowing I'm a good way to keep you busy while she has her own life. She can do her high jet set life while you have your obedient girl in the city. She acts as your society wife and maybe she's glad not to have to deal with any of your baser desires.

I'm not looking for a novelist, but someone who wants to get into these characters and find fun ways to explore them as well as write some fun sexy scenes. Lets figure out how I got to be your mistress, what the relationship is.

Kinks: BDSM, spanking, anal, traditional gender roles, cheating, lactation play, older men

Limits: Humiliation, toilet play, feet, violence, bimbofication

Met in college and everything has been good. He's a very grounded yet adventurous guy and really balances me out.

He recently graduated and we are a couple months into long distance. We have flown out to see each other several times, and we're both people who like a bit of space anyway, so it works. 

However, last time he visited me at my summer internship in Chicago, we ran into jealousy issues. While I was at work one day, he went to visit a female friend's apartment and help her move in. This female friend and Josh have a lot in common (more than we do), and they only recently reconnected, so it makes me jealous. He didn't tell me about seeing her when I asked him about his day, and I only found this out because a text from her popped up on his laptop while we were watching a movie. 

I'm pretty sure nothing happened (he's not that kind of guy, and between us getting afternoon coffee and me coming home there was a small window), but I was upset that he didn't tell me and that he hadn't told his female friend that he was here to visit his girlfriend. Pretty sure that she does not know about me since he doesn't post about us on social media much (although I've met all of his immediate friends in family. He's not hiding me, just doesn't want our business on social media). Josh said that he hid his meeting with the girl from me originally because he knew I'd react badly, and I guess he was right.

He explained more, we talked it out, I worked on my jealousy issues, we dropped it. I know they still talk occasionally but I figured it was no big deal since neither Josh nor I live near Chicago and he still treats me really well.

However, Josh has a work trip to Chicago coming up in a week, and I can't help but think of this girl. Is it reasonable to ask him if he will see her, or ask him if he'd be willing to tell the girl about me/post about us on social media? Is it reasonable to ask him to be more forthcoming about his female friends if I work on my jealousy issues? I don't want to reignite old issues for no reason, but this is on my mind.

Thank you to all who read this!

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: BF hid a meeting with a female friend from me. Now he is going to be in the same city as her again for work. Should I say something or just try to calm my jealousy issues?"

I finished my coursework and am starting my six-month internship in January working with teens and adults with special needs. 

I got a job a month ago working at a day program for kids with autism. Most of the day the kids are younger with more pervasive communication and/or aggressive problems, and the afternoon kids go to school with the program in the evening to focus on targeted areas.

I have babysat in the past, and one of my semesters of college I did practicum with a ten year old with autism. I've also observed a special needs preschool under a music therapist several times so I was under the impression I had a relatively good expectation for the work, but I was wrong.

They did not inform me that at least half of the kids have aggressive behaviors. And these behaviors happen almost every day. I have never been attacked or had someone be violent (other than being spanked as a child) towards me, and having kids aggress towards me has been extremely difficult for me to process mentally. One of the kids I work with does it and honestly for that child, it doesn't bother me so much. But there's one kid who does it and experiencing that and thinking about it happening again is causing me major anxiety. I had to go home sick today right before working with her, I got extremely nauseated and felt like I was going to throw up. I'm still not feeling well and haven't since last night, but it's like I don't trust myself and think its a way for my body to keep me from working with this kid. I could have a stomach virus but a lot of the nausea and feeling sick stuff went away when I got back to my apartment.

Thinking about working with this particular kid fills me with a lot of stress. She scratches and has gone for my face  several times. She's drawn blood on me a few times, but the scratches are really small. I'm still relatively new working with her so we haven't really developed a whole lot of rapport, and it's gotten better, but last week I had to take her to the bathroom and ended up in a small stall with her, unable to leave as she grabbed my arms, trying to hit/scratch/bruise me. I started to cry and someone had to take over once I brought her back from the restroom. I had a good session with her earlier this week and wanted to continue to try working with her, but the thought of that is also really stress inducing.

I know she is using the only way she knows how to communicate, but it's like I'm having this biological reaction to what's happening and I can't help but feel powerless and scared of this child. I don't know what to do. I don't want to quit but I'm worried about my increasing levels of anxiety.

I would like to talk to the supervising BCBA about this, but I already had to scale back my hours because I got a stress-induced migraine after I began working, and I know they hired me to do my job. I also overhead a coworker when I was feeling sick say ""I'm not going to say anything"", and I think it was about me, like I was faking feeling sick to get out of work. I feel like she can't be the only one who doesn't have a good opinion me.

Because I'm going to be working with special needs in the same town for my internship I want to leave the best impression on the people running this program, in case we cross paths again. But I feel like no matter what I do it won't work out, either I'll be so stressed I can't work or I'll quit or something. I've held jobs before that were also stressful (lifeguard for four years, running professional music performances, working as a camp counselor) but I've never had this much anxiety about work.

Sorry this is so long. Does anyone have any advice? Or similar experiences?"
77i2yg,1,2017-10-19,[M4F] The Corporate Barbie Doll,prince_of_nothing82,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/77i2yg/m4f_the_corporate_barbie_doll/,"He had hit the jackpot as far as he was concerned. Martha, his grouchy old personal assistant had finally retired at the ripe old age of 67, and he had just hired [a much younger intern](https://i.redd.it/ofcch3l8qjlz.jpg) . For a horny old lecher like him, she was a dream come true. Not only was she the most beautiful creature he'd ever laid eyes on, complete with long peroxide-blonde hair, huge tits and a killer body, she was also the dumbest, most naïve bimbo he'd ever met. 

He remembered her interview, when he had been constantly squeezing his ever-present rubber stress-ball, afraid that if he stopped he wouldn't be able to help himself from leaping across the interview table and giving the voluptuous blonde a thorough fucking. Her sexy innocence drove him crazy, every lewd comment he made going right over her head. When he purposely threw his stress-ball on the ground and she bent at the waist to retrieve it for him, the view of her spectacular ass in her tight skirt had almost caused him to blow his load.

That interview had been yesterday, and now he was almost at the end of his first day being assisted by the beautiful and sexy intern. He had definitely made the most of it, calling her into his office at least twice an hour to pick up spilled objects or retrieve files from the lowest drawers in his cabinets. She had worn black trousers on this first day, he was disappointed that he didn't get much of a look at her spectacularly long and sleek legs. Fortunately for him, the trousers fit like a second skin and her beautifully rounded ass looked amazing in them whenever she bent over and presented it towards him.

As well as having her bend over whenever the opportunity presented itself, he also made a point of standing over her as she worked at her desk. Leaning over her shoulder a number of times to point out things on her computer screen and also get a brilliant view down into her mind-boggling cleavage, in her low cut purple top, it's plunging V-shaped neckline displaying a good portion of her impressively large tits and impossibly deep cleavage

Despite all his not-so-subtle leering, she seemed completely oblivious to her new boss's lecherous attentions. He, however, was absolutely crazy with lust, constantly squeezing his stress-ball for all he was worth. At this rate he would probably need a new one before the week was out.

At about 4.30pm he could take it no longer and decided he would head home and let off some steam with a good long masturbation session in honour of his lovely new personal assistant.

As he walked past her desk he saw that she was bent over, rifling through one of her drawers, her lovely round ass pushed out towards him. After his day of restraint he could no longer resist. As he moved past her he reached out and patted one of the firm round globes of her buttocks, his whole body tingling as he finally laid a hand on her perfect bottom, her tight fitting black pants doing nothing to disguise the glorious softness of her ass.

""Just a little pat for a job well done,"" he  assured her, doing his best to look nonchalant. Inside he was fighting the urge to give her big tits a great big squeeze through her top. ""I like to think of us like a sports team and think of me like a coach. A little pat to congratulate you is perfectly normal,"" inside he was very worried now. His impulsive action could get him in a whole world of trouble if she  complained about sexual harassment.

He reached around and gave her another quick pat on the butt and then he hurried headed for the door before she could say anything. The memory of the way her lovely round butt cheek had felt against his palm would certainly fuel his fantasies tonight, and he looked forward to pushing his luck and see how he could take full advantage of her slow wits and naïve nature...

So I am about to hit my one year mark in the audit practice at a larger mid-tier public accounting firm. So far I have passed 2 sections of the CPA and am expecting to be done by June 2018. As far as the job goes, I have to say I really am not liking the work. Most of my engagements are with mid market firms (including non profit) with rude, arrogant, and incompetent accounting staff. Anyone with audit experience knows how much of a nightmare this can be. As far as the people at my actual firm, everyone seems to be completely uninspired. And a lot of them, which I hate to say, are just flat out dumb too (I have had this conversations with other colleagues who agree). The partners and some senior managers seem to be the cooler people at the company. However, I just don't see myself here long term. The ""seniors"" and ""managers"" don't make squash.

I have considered moving to Big 4 accounting next year after passing my exam. I have also considered potentially moving out of accounting into a more financial role in industry/banking. My question is - what sort of opportunities are there outside big 4 for a 1.5 year professional wth a CPA? How tough is it to get into consulting with firms such as accenture/BCG? What about banking or even corporate? deally, I would love to get a banking job within the realm of IB, but understand that is an extremely difficult path without going to a top undergrad school and getting the internship experience. Advice/suggestions? What are some feasible and lucrative career directions to consider? I'm a bit lost as you can tell.. Thanks!

As the title suggests, I'm having a hard time finding my little space again. My boyfriend and I just had a really *really* challenging bump in our relationship, which nearly led to a breakup. Even now, I'm unsure about how things will play out a few months from now. The issue didn't have anything to do with infidelity (I know some people's heads jump there).

As we've been repairing things, he's asking about getting back into kink and little space again. Mind you; I'm demisexual and I felt like our emotional connection was *really* damaged so it's hard feeling any kind of sexual attraction at the moment. *And*, the thing about being little with a CG is feeling safe and being able to trust them to take care of you. I'm also working 54 hours a week (between graduate internship &amp; full time job) so that's a sucker punch to the opportunity to wear/be little as well.

I'm having a really hard time expressing these things to him because being told ""I don't trust you"" is always a gut punch. But I also *desperately* miss little space, and wearing, and everything that came along with it. I just feel so torn.

I know that was a lot, but if anyone has any advice I'd really love to hear it. Thank you :)"

I am a very independent person and I feel that me and my parents are constantly butting heads so I started looking at options to move out and discovered that if I started working full time at my job and went part time at school that I would be making 40k gross before taxes. Enough to move out on and live comfortably. The only downside to moving out is that I would be on my own to pay for the rest of my degree since my parents where paying half and have told me they will stop if I move out. Also It will take longer for me to graduate since I will be taking the slow route. The upside is I have been taking transfer courses so I only have 18 credits to complete at the state school so it wouldn't be to pricey.

The only issue I have with staying part time and living at home is that I might be giving up on an opportunity to move up at my current company since the company is very much known for hiring from within and I feel that might look down on staying a intern and that I might get surpassed. 

Also any IT expert's or people in the field is it even worth it for me to get my bachelors now or better to focus on the career and seize the experience and also go get some certifications in my spare time and get my bachelors down the road.

the schools I can definitely get into is University of Alberta and UBC, but I'm not counting on Waterloo or U of T. Anyway, I see Carleton has that sweet deal with Shopify, different concentrations for the program, good research groups, and apparently a good co op program.

I'm just uncertain about the admission averages which is like 78%-82%, which is slightly lower than I'd like my peers to be. Those are the kind of grades most people could coast through high school with.

77jj2e,116,2017-10-19,"Talk shit, get hot cocoa?",Ilickedthecinnabar,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/77jj2e/talk_shit_get_hot_cocoa/,"After a summer internship digging up dinosaurs (this is kinda relevant), I swung through the town where my alma mater was so I could visit some college friends.  They invited me to spend the 3-day weekend with them, since I was in no rush to get anywhere and we hadn't seen each other in months.  Three out of the four roommates I knew pretty well and where the main reason I was visiting, but the 4th gal I didn't really know all that well, but I knew enough that she'd ""found Jesus"" 2 summers before.  And she'd found him hardcore.


Kristi (not her real name) heard I was dropping by, and where I had worked and she pounced on it--according to my friends (her roommates), she wanted to debate me, to ""prove"" creationism and how fossils were bullshit and all that fun stuff.  My answer of ""Sure, whenever you want to is fine with me."" was relayed. 


I show up, and Kristi's not there.  I shrug it off, since this whole ""debate"" isn't a big deal to me, and spend the rest of the day after my 10 hour long drive relaxing and hanging out with my friends.  Kristi didn't show up until later that evening, and she promptly darted into her room and slammed the door.  Long story short, whenever Kristi was in the apartment, she'd keep muttering about how I needed to ""find Jesus"" and how her roommates need to get away from a ""devil worshiper"" like me.  Whenever I'd answer questions about my internship or show pictures from my summer, Kristi would proclaim it was all fake and that the devil was just tricking me.  I'd always ask how she figured that, but she'd always huff and lock herself back in her room, or just leave the apartment all together (I never pushed for the debate--she was the one supposedly wanted to have it, so I wasn't going to be the one to start it).  Every evening I was there, my friends and I would usually be drinking (nothing heavy, just social drinking), and every time Kristi saw that, she told us flat out we were all going to hell for drinking. (I learned she did that every time my friends would be drinking in the apartment)


Kristi treated us, especially me, like lepers the entire time I was there.


My last afternoon there, a group of us were in my friends' apartment, and since it was a bit of a chilly fall day, we figured hot cocoa was the way to go, especially when I was making Peppermint Patties (hot chocolate with peppermint schnapps).  Kristi comes back, sees a bunch of us gathered in the kitchen, and before she could make some comment, I offered to make her mug of cocoa.  She was a little surprised, but accepted, and went to her room to drop off her stuff.  The water was still hot, so by the time she came back, her mug was ready.


Kristi:  Mmmm!  Mint cocoa!  Nice!

Me:  Its not too much is it?  /reaches into the cupboard behind me, pulls out the bottle of schnapps and pours a little more into my mug/  Sometimes I put too little in, or too much.


Kristi just STARED at the schnapps bottle and promptly put her mug down and walked away.  We heard no more snide ""you need Jesus""  remarks the rest of the day.


The debate never happened either.


I later heard Kristi stopped giving my friends grief about drinking in the apartment after that.


And oh, I never did put schnapps in her mug...it was legitimately mint cocoa, straight from a powdered mix.  (Poor college students, of course we were using the powdered mix!)"

77k9on,0,2017-10-20,Will my internship offer get revoked???? HEEELPPPP,putooelquelolea,CalPoly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CalPoly/comments/77k9on/will_my_internship_offer_get_revoked_heeelpppp/,"Hi all,

I'm 2nd year EE and I am going to fail my CPE 202 class this quarter. The problem is, I got a return offer for my software engineering internship this upcoming summer with a big tech company (which I already accepted). My current cumulative GPA is a 3.60 and I shouldn't have an issue with F included to keep it over a 3.0. I'm freaking out because it's an F in a course related to my internship and I don't know what HR will do with my offer once they ask for transcripts. I am well connected at this company and left with a good review hence my return offer but still HEEELLLPPP "
77kt7d,0,2017-10-20,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/77kt7d/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
77m4l6,0,2017-10-20,Question about tech scene,alazysurfer,Charleston,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charleston/comments/77m4l6/question_about_tech_scene/,I'm currently a senior at a school here in Charleston is there any place where I can get a internship with a tech startup what website do I need to go to find internships?
77m7bt,74,2017-10-20,"How QTUM Foundation lost my 48,000 tokens. And didn’t care.",skanny999,Qtum,https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/77m7bt/how_qtum_foundation_lost_my_48000_tokens_and/,"It all started just over a month ago when I was caught up in the Chinese exchanges’ closure with my tokens in ICO365.

I had followed QTUM with interest for a while and I was very excited about the project, so much that when the ICO came I decided to invest a good amount on it, buying 48,224 tokens from ICO365, equal to almost 0.1% of the total ICO offering. The main reason I invested so much in it was the quality of the team behind the project: a quality team for a quality project, I thought. Well, I would eventually change my mind about that.

Around the beginning of September I tried to withdraw my tokens to get ready for the long awaited swap with the launch of Ignition, but when I contacted ICO365 about that I was given the first bad news: no withdraw was allowed until the Chinese situation with the exchanges was clear. Of course I was a bit nervous but trusted that it was only going to be a temporary itch, something that would be sorted very soon. Unfortunately if only got worse. 

After a few days of me chasing them, ICO365 communicated me that the tokens ad been returned to the QTUM Foundation and in order to receive them I had to deal directly with them. After an initial panic and some online research I found this:

https://medium.com/@Qtum/qtum-community-development-updates-september-18-31970934b7d3

the famous development update where they were clarifying the timing of the swap 
&gt;""The Qtum team currently holds all of the main network tokens until the swap happens on October 4th, 2017 (6pm PST)” 
- and the part I was more interested about - 
&gt;""A quick reminder to withdraw your Qtum ERC20 tokens from Yunbi.com, and if you have tokens that were not retrieved from ICO365, please e-mail swap@qtum.org &gt;and we will get back to you within 1–2 weeks. ""- .

I sent my first email to swap@qtum.org on the 19th september, asking for clarification. I didn’t expect them to respond straight away, as they made clear that it would take time, but when 10 days past without any news I started getting worried again. 

I sent them another email on the 29th asking for any more news and what details they needed from me. I got no answer.

On the 2nd of October I sent them a new email, with my ICO365 details, email, username balance and my Bittrex erc20 address, so that they could send them straight there it would be swapped straight away. For the third time no answer. 
We were getting closer and closer to the swap date, and no one was paying any attention to any of my emails. 
Of course at QTUM they were very busy with the launch of Ignition, still it had been over 2 weeks and we were not talking peanuts really. We were talking about 48224 tokens, now worth more that an average property, but still no answer. 

I decided to let the swap period pass so they could sort their things out, but more and more worried by their complete silence. 

On the 9th of October, when the swap was supposed to had been completed for 5 days, I sent another email with the details from the previous one, specifying that the erc20 address was before the swap, and adding the new QTUM address from Bittrex. At this point I was emailing not only swap@qtum.org, but also foundation@qtum.org, hoping for anyone to answer, or at least to acknowledge that someone was looking into it. 

Finally, on the 10th of October I received an answer from foundation@qtum.org. 

It simply read:

&gt;tokens are sent
&gt;https://etherscan.io/tx/0x011c6d4be72386a5b0082e606172e780fe4d6f93336c8bae9d448a0d9779a1cb


Nothing more, not a note, nothing about our previous emails. Not even a greeting, nothing. But even worse, it was an ERC20 transaction. On the 10th of October. After the swap. 

I panicked straight away, they had sent the tokens to the Bittrex ERC20 address I gave them from the old email, despite the deadline of the swap having being a week before. Why would they do that?
First thing I did was to check my Bittrex account, but there was no trace of them there. I contacted Bittrex support straight away, which, contrary to QTUM,  responded  promptly, unfortunately with bad news:

&gt;Hi
&gt;They sent it to the wrong address. We won't recover it since it was sent on the 4th after our wallets turned off.  You contact them about this problem.

Now I was gobsmacked and, even worse, seriously worries! 
It had already been surreal to receive a 2 line answer from QTUM after all the emails I sent them, how was I going to sort this out? 

In the meantime I received an email from swap@qtum.org which just said: 

&gt;sorry, we cannot send anything to you because we didn't receive any of your information from ICO365 office. please check with ICO365 first.

I didn’t know if I was supposed to laugh or cry. Who was I dealing with? Two email answering my request with opposite responses, both of which didn’t make any sense. 
More and more worried. 

I contacted them again forwarding the Bittrex email asking why they had sent the tokens to an ERC20 address after the deadline that THEY had set up and communicated in their blog, and how we could solve this situation. 
This time the answer was prompt, but their style was the one I was getting used to:

&gt;we just checked again, we sent the tokens to the ERC20 address  0xfd56adb0d3db185afc59c75138b45bde292e8a28 you gave us. and here is the record. you can &gt;check again

I emailed them again and again, pointing out that I cave them the QTUM address, and the ERC20 was before the swap, but there was only silence from their side after that. That was it. 

Now, the current value of the tokens easily surpasses half million dollars, currently reaching almost 600k, and I want to make clear that I’m not millionaire and for me it’s a life-changing situation.
But believe it or not what makes me almost as mad as the money loss is QTUM Foundation behaviour. 

I believe in them, in their project and in their team and I invested in them a fair amount before the ICO craze that hit the blockchain, how could this happen?

I can’t think of any decent company that was dismissing their misplacing of over 120 BTC worth of tokens in a single line. 
I can’t thing of any decent company that would ignore one of their investor’s requests of clarification over a half million dollar transaction which disappeared. 
Nor I can’t think of any decent company with such a combination of arrogance and incompetence blended in a mix of disregard for their investors. 

Is this what the crypto idea of business is? Are these the companies we think will create the future? Incompetent,  arrogant, complacent and, almost more scarily, dishonest? 

What I almost hope is that all this business was dealt by an intern who didn’t have a clue of what he/she was doing nor any english, it’s the only explanation I can think of for the rude responses and the daft actions. My hope would be for someone from QTUM to come forward and offered to take some interest on what has happened, showing some sort of professionalism that would be expected from a billion dollar company. 
Half a million of which they seem to have taken from me for good. 

**-----  UPDATE  -----**

**Final welcome update. All tokens were sent to me yesterday (I could check only now) as I was promised by Patrick. As you can guess it's a HUGE burden off my stomach, and I would like to thank both the community for their support and the team for a prompt help. At the end I think it was just some admin cockup (even though a costly one) and once the team was (eventually) aware of it, they jumped in straight away and solved it. I'd like to thank Patrick Dai for the personal interest he took and, for more than obvious reason, I hope this project can keep going the pace it is. I'm a happy man.
Thank all of you again!**

77mf4a,3,2017-10-20,Anyone here trying to transfer to Georgia Tech? The CS curriculum here is a joke.,1ATLBOY,GaState,https://www.reddit.com/r/GaState/comments/77mf4a/anyone_here_trying_to_transfer_to_georgia_tech/,"The classes are not challenging and most of the professors here just brush off on going deeper into the topics. When I asked them about that concern, they just make a poor excuse like “don’t worry about it, you’re just an undergrad” or get annoyed that I even asked the question.

I asked a couple of my GT friends about their curriculum and their assignments are seriously what college assignments should be. CS assignments at GSU seem like a really dumbed down version to make sure everyone pass.

For example, our assignments on recursion don’t talk about complexity analysis and concepts. The assignments are piss poor like “do a fibonacci sequence on recursion.” Which takes like 10 minutes to do and the homework is due for a week. It’s also really sad because most students here struggle even on basic fundamental concepts. They take at least 5 minutes to write a correct for-loop and most of the time, they can’t even use it correctly. They don’t really understand the concept or implementation behind it. They just know it from rote memorization. Equivalently, this is like asking a Chemistry major what an atomic number is and where is it located on the periodic table of elements.

This is a concern because if our students don’t even know the fundamentals, how are they expected to succeed after graduation or in internship interviews? I talked to some GSU alumni and they talk about how companies skew more on hiring Georgia Tech students than GSU students. They said some companies pay GSU students in the lowest bracket due to their poor quality based on experience.

I just don’t like how the education is set up here. I feel like I’m in a daycare. Anyone here transferring to Georgia Tech? What are your reasons?"
77mfpi,39,2017-10-20,Anyone wants to ask questions about Chinese stocks?,ChicGen,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/77mfpi/anyone_wants_to_ask_questions_about_chinese_stocks/,"I'm a Chinese student living in the United States. Occasionally, I trade. If anyone is interested in asking about the Chinese company such as Weibo, MoMo, JD, Baidu, Baba, I'm happy to answer them. 

Personally, I hold stocks in JD, and am thinking about buying more Baba. 

Thoughts on the mentioned companies:

Weibo: It's no doubt the biggest and most influential social media in China. I use it everyday, and saw how it grew up in the past few years. But the censorship is getting more and more strict on Weibo, many of my friends' Weibo accounts were deleted because they said negative things about the government. 

MoMo: Dying company. It was a thing few years ago, but now it is literally just surviving not growing. No one I know use MoMo any more. And MoMo now has a reputation as a hook-up app. 

JD: Growing company. The CEO actually got attention for marrying a beautiful and famous 22-year-old girl (who happened to be my schoolmate). After marrying her, the CEO has put more resources and money in investing in fashion industry, which is one of the fastest growing industries in China. Btw, the price of JD at this point is definitely a buy-in price.

Baidu: China's google. Yes, people use it everyday. But why? Because google is banned in China. Baidu has a reputation for making money on putting on fake medical advertisements. Many desperate patients and family members believe in Baidu and went to those fraud hospitals and lost money and got no effective treatment at all. I won't invest in it because of my ethical concerns. But yeah, everyone use Baidu and I see its potential in the capitalistic play. 

Baba: Imagine how important Amazon is to Americans, multiple it by 100, that's Baba in China. We buy everything on Taobao, we pay other people using Baba's paying tools, we borrow money from Baba...... It is the company that everyone uses in their daily life.

As you know, English is not my first language, so I may have some typos. Thank you for reading them. If anyone has any questions about other Chinese companies, I'm happy to answer them.

10/21 updates 

1. I appreciate you people are interested in Chinese companies, and I'm happy to answer your questions. I am a full-time graduate school student with two internships, so I can't answer questions right away. I will try my best to answer your questions asap.

2. Please don't be an asshole if you realize I'm not an expert. Because I'm not. I have degrees in anthropology and history instead of economics. I just want to share my thoughts about some Chinese companies I am familiar with. I am not giving advice, but if you think I am, and you think my advice is ""awful"", you could just leave. There is no need to be a pathetic hater online when you could have a real life. 

3. I know most people here are men, but please don't assume I'm a ""he"" and refer me as a ""he"". I'm not. I'm a young woman interested in stock markets. I am kind of offended  to see some people assume only men would talk about stocks. Thank you. 

10/23 update:

This is becoming no fun for me. I get it there are many haters and losers around online, but I don't think I deserve the bullshit some people gave me when I'm doing this for free. Like I said, I'm not an expert, and I'm new to the market myself. I'm here just to provide some insights I know about Chinese companies as a Chinese. For example, some people confuse Aliexpress with Taobao, and claiming they would never invest in Baba again. I think I could help people with those confusions. You could believe my words, you could despise it, but you don't get a chance to be a rude asshole around me. I'm gonna bite back if you behave like a troll. 

Again, I understand many people here are men, and I'm not gonna be mad with everyone who gets my gender wrong. I'm simply asking you to think about why some people have this assumption that only men would talk about stocks. Why not women? Why couldn't women be offended under such circumstances? What can we do to make the finance world a better and more welcoming place for women? 

I'm not saying everyone who assume I'm a ""sir"" or a ""he"" is  a sexist. But if you called me ""sir"", I point it out, and you started to yell around that my ""gender assuming theory"" is bullshit. Then it made you a sexist. An insensitive and misogynistic sexist. 

Shoot me questions, not hatred, thank you."

To be honest, if I could start all over again as a freshman (and not have to worry about lost time, money, internship experience, etc.) I would pursue a degree in elementary education but to teach at the elementary level, would it be possible to get a masters in education after my CS BS to supplement?

77n4vy,1,2017-10-20,50+ Common sense fixes for America,SaigonSurfer,socialchange,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialchange/comments/77n4vy/50_common_sense_fixes_for_america/,"Over 50 common sense plans to correct the majority of America's woes...

Over the years, I have seen the very good America has over all other countries.  President Ronald Reagan once called us ""The shining city on the hill"".  Unfortunately, there are certain things which have gone wrong in our country over the years.  Following are what I believe needs to be done to correct the vast majority of America's major issues.  Many people will disagree with one or more points but I really think the majority of people will agree with most of the points.

1.  Outlaw all future sales to civilians of handguns, assault weapons and full auto military weapons and all ammo for those items.  Anybody selling or providing those items to civilians will receive 20 years in prison.  Hunting rifles and shotguns are the only guns any civilian needs to own.  For people who worry about home protection or protecting their business, let me tell you, any criminal who either looks down the barrel of a shotgun or hears a shell being racked into a shotgun by the slide will run in terror.  Anyone currentlly in ownership of handguns, assault weapons or automatic military rifles will only be allowed to carry them in their homes or use them at a licensed gun range.  Any such previous ownership must be licensed.  Any felons or people who have been designated to have dangerous mental diseases will have all guns taken away from them.  Anybody who knowingly supplies guns to known felons will receive life in prison.  In 2008, the U.S. had over 12 thousand firearm-related homicides. All of Japan experienced only 11, fewer than were killed at the Aurora shooting alone. And that was a big year: 2006 saw an astounding two, and when that number jumped to 22 in 2007, it became a national scandal. By comparison, also in 2008, 587 Americans were killed just by guns that had discharged accidentally.

2.  Anybody convicted going forward of first degree murder will receive the death penalty.  Anybody receiving the death penalty going forward will be mandatorily executed within 2 years.  Any priest convicted of rape or child molestation will receive life in prison regardless of what the Vatican has to say or how much they promise to pay the victim/s.  

3.  Anybody convicted of selling any illegal drugs stronger than marijuana in America will receive life in prison without parole.

4.  Anybody caught coming into America with illegal drugs of any sort will receive the death penalty except in the case of visiting dignitaries.  That is listed later.

5.  NASA will be severely cut back.  There is no reason to be looking for planets in other solar systems or galaxies nor is there a reason to plan manned missions to Mars or anywhere else.  The billions saved will go to beefing up child protection services, testing the tens of thousands of untested rape kits across the country and patrolling the Southern border of the country.  No further American astronauts will be hired or put into orbit unless they are maintaining government satellites or other essential projects.  Maintenance on satellites, orbital telescopes, the ISS or other objects in space will be open to bidding by publicly held companies.

6.  Anyone convicted of forcible rape or any form of child molestation will get life in prison without parole. 

7.  Any person, organization or state which refuses to accept laws based on their religious beliefs will NOT be penalized as long as the laws they are refusing to accept are commonly held to be immoral or illegal or unConstitutional.

8.  No special interest group contributions to Senators or Congressman will be accepted unless that person is running for President.

9.  Any policeman or other law enforcement officers who target people purely based on their color or religion or other wise without any real evidence will be immediately fired and will never hold another job in law enforcement.  There are some blacks in Anerica who have never committed a crime yet have been pulled over by police over 70 times just because of their color.  Along the same vein, nobody will be arrested or tried for a crime unless their is absolute proof they did the crime.  We have an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 innocent people convicted of crimes every year.  It has to stop.

10. Anybody convicted of a major crime will have their dna and fingerprints taken and put in a database if this is not already being done.

11.  Anybody immigrating to America will automatically have their dna and fingerprints taken and put in a database.  Extreme background checks will be done on anybody immigrating to America.

12. No negotiations will be conducted with terrorists even if they kidnap people.  Instead conventional weapons and possibly nuclear will be used on any terrorist stronghold.  No more boots on the ground in the Middle East.  If someone attacks us , they will be utterly destroyed.

13.  Any country found to be hosting hackers who attack government organizations or public institutions in America will be given one week to prosecute the hackers.  If that has not happened after a week, a US strike team will go in an take out the hackers and the building where the hackers were based.

14.  Any item manufactured outside America and being shipped into America will have a 50% tax levied against it.  This will not include cars or trucks from Asia or Europe.  As long as America continues to make substandard automobiles, outside vehicles will be allowed into America.

15. Roe vs Wade will be immediately overturned.  Abortions in America will be outlawed except in the case of pregnancies due to rape or if the birth will endanger the mother.  Any woman or girl who accuses a man of rape so they can have an abortion and it is proven the man did not rape her will automatically receive 10 years in prison without parole.  There have been over 50 million abortions in America since abortion was legalized.  How many Einsteins, Beethovens, Martin Luther Kings, Ronald Reagans, Mother Theresas or others who would have great contributed to the world have been murdered over the years by abortion?  The pro-abortionists try to say that ""they have the right to their own bodies"". Well, if they go by that argument, then they also have the right to inject cocaine, heroin, meth and any other deadly drug in their bodies and get away with it. It is just as deadly, but only for the mother. Abortion murders the baby, while injecting drugs into the body is pretty much the same as committing suicide. Suicide and murder are both illegal in America. If you are going to justify having the right to do anything to your body, then you have to take it the extra step and agree with the above.

16. Anybody who is convicted of 3 dui's or more will automatically lose their license for 10 years.  If they are caught driving during that time, they will be imprisoned for 10 years.

17.  Anybody who commits vehicular homicide while under the influence of illegal drugs will receive the death penalty.

18. The manufacture and giving of lethal injections will be taken over by the government.

19.  Anybody currently in  prison who has been convicted of first degree murder in the case of 2 or more people, convicted of raping 2 or more people in the first degree or molesting 2 or more children will be put to death.  

20. Anybody committing a hate crime which causes personal harm will receive an automatic 10 years in prison if the injury is not serious.  If the injury is serious or impairs the victim, the perpetrator will receive life in prison without parole.  If the crime causes property damage they will receive 5-10 years in prison.

21. Anybody found guilty of arson which causes more than $10,000 worth of damage or if they have been found guilty of committing more than 1 fire in different structures or the same structure at different times will receive 20 years in prison.

22. Anybody who disobeys a restraining order will get an automatic 5 years in prison. If they disobey the restraining order and cause personal damage they will get an automatic 10 years in prison.  If they cause bodily harm they will be imprisoned for 25 years.

23.  Anybody who accuses someone of rape and it is found they knew that person did not rape them will receive 25 years in  prison.

24. Anybody who accuses someone of rape whether in the military, on college campuses or on the job or elsewhere will be taken seriously and the charge will be investigated fully.

25. Any law enforcement officer who protects a fellow officer or other law enforcement employee who commits a major crime will be automatically fired and barred from ever working in law enforcement.

26. There are programs in several large cities which train minorities on how to dress for success, interview, write resumes, use computers and teach them how to be on time every day.  These programs also give GED quizzes and exams and in some cases put the graduates of the program in college.  These programs for the most part are paid for by businesses, churches and personal donations.  Such programs will be implemented in every major city in America where there are large amounts of unemployed minorities.  These programs also put the graduates in businesses as unpaid interns to allow them to learn the business and allow management to see if they want to hire the person.

27. Electric car manufacturing will be highly encouraged.  No extravagant taxes will be levied against new electric cars making them out of reach for normal citizens.  The only reason why cars like Tesla are so expensive is because the oil companies have paid Congressman or Senators to highly increase the costs of such cars.

28. Bullying in schools will be met with zero tolerance.  Anybody who is found to be bullying others will have a meeting with administration and that person's parents.  Any other instances will be met with 2 weeks mandatory suspension.  If the bullying persists, the troublemaker will be expelled.

29. All synthetic drugs will be outlawed if they make you high or otherwise effect you unless they are specifically manufactured to fix some particular illness.  Too many people are dying due to overdosing on synthetic marijuana.  As fast as the new synthetics are outlawed, new ones are made to get around the laws so all synthetics will be banned.

30. Diplomatic immunity will be done away with in the case of anything being brought into the country not being searched.  Regardless of who the visiting dignitary is, all their possessions will be searched for illegal drugs or weapons.  If they are found to be carrying such things, they will not be allowed in the country and will be banned from ever coming in again.

31. All sugar and salt sold/used in America will have an automatic $5.00 tax levied against each pound sold. Along the same lines, anyone who is obese from over-eating will have 10 years to get to a healthy weight or insurance will cease to cover any/all weight caused illnesses or accidents. The only reason why such food is allowed in these modern times is because special interest groups in the fast food industry and other food industries have paid high dollars to politicians to make sure their foods will continue to be served to everybody.

32. Anybody using a deadly weapon while committing a felony will get automatic life in prison.

33. Anybody convicted of trafficking children under 18 will be treated the same as if they had performed child molestation, therefore they will receive life in prison. 

34. Any adult convicted of arranging to meet an underage child for sex without actually having sex (such as in a sting)will receive twenty years in prison.

35. Anybody convicted of phone scamming will receive 10 years in prison for the first offense and 30 years for the second.

36. Workers in non-union companies will not in any way be penalized for bringing in unions to their company.  The company will neither threaten to relocate if unions are brought in nor will they in fact relocate to another place that does not have unions.  In the South, there are a number of companies who routinely threaten to relocate if workers bring in unions.  On the flip side, any company that is unionized will not protect slacker employees or employees who routinely break rules.  In the South, non-union companies overwork their employees and underpay them in comparison to other facilities elsewhere.
Any company which does in fact penalize employees or relocates to avoid unions will have all earnings confiscated by the company and the company will be put in government control.  

37. Any teenager convicted of making bomb threats or terroristic threats will receive an automatic 20 years in prison.  Any adult convicted of same will receive life in prison.

38. No music or music videos promoting violence will be allowed.  There is not one logical excuse for performing such music.  Anyone performing such music in public will be convicted of either hate crimes or terroristic threats and will be imprisoned under such guidelines.

39. All vitamin supplements and beauty products must prove that their products do what they say they do or they will not be allowed to sell.  The FDA will oversee these products.
 
40. All charities must prove that the vast majority of donations goes to the people they are supposed to help.  If this is not the case, the charity will be closed.  Case in point is Wounded Warrior Project which has been proven to provide very little to wounded vets.  the overwhelming majority of funds given to this cause goes into either the pockets of employees or special projects benefitting the employees of the charity.

41. The wealthy will be taxed commiserate with their earnings.  No longer will the middle class be taxed more than the wealthy.  Also, the wealthy will no longer be allowed to hide money in off-shore accounts or in European banks to avoid taxing.  They will either bring that money back into the US or else that money will be forfeited.

42. Women and minority workers will receive the same wages for their job as white men.  Any administrator found discriminating based on sex or race will be fired and will not be allowed to ever work in a position where they make decisions on hiring or wages again.

43. Anyone found using unnecessary water in drought-ridden sections of the country such as watering their lawns or washing their vehicles or filling a pool will be fined $1,000,000 for each violation.  Look at California where the wealthy get away with such violations without being held accountable.

44. Any political commercials must be based entirely on fact.  Exaggerating the issue or out and out lying about a political competitor will not be allowed.

45. All pornograpy viewable over the internet whether videos or photos will only be allowed if paid for with a credit card.  There is no reason why children should be able to freely access porn on the internet.  Any person or corporation found allowing free access to porn will be fined $100,000 for each offense.

46. Any company which threatens to do mass layoffs or outsource a large amount of it's workforce will be studied.  If upper management is found to be earning more than $10,000,000, the overage will be put back into the company so as to keep the employees at the company or else the managers behind the layoffs will lose their jobs as well as their earnings for that year and 5 years previous.  There will be no exceptions.

47. All highways going into Mexico will be barred.  To go between the two countries, one must either fly or take a ship or boat.

48. Anybody being tried for a felony case who is also found guilty of intimidating witnesses will be sentenced to life in prison without parole.

49. Any adult found providing alcohol to underage children will be imprisoned for 1 year or longer for each offense.

50. Any adult who cyberbullies a child to the point where that child commits suicide will be charged with 1st degree manslaughter. There have been a number of such cases down through the years.

51. No defense attorney will be able to antagonize any woman reporting rape.  The attorney will not in any way, shape or form be able to treat the reporting rape victim harshly UNLESS there is considerable proof they may have falsely reported.

52. Unless a person has a warrant for their arrest or else already has been arrested, the press/law enforcement can in no way, shape or form release that person’s name to the public as a person of interest or suspect.  They also cannot say anything negative about the person nor can they say whether the person is cooperating with law enforcement.  The words, “Innocent until proven guilty” seem to have fallen by the wayside in America!

53. There will no longer be a statute of limitations for rape or molestation. If the evidence is obvious, you will be convicted no matter how many years after the fact or who you are. 

54. Any woman or child accusing another of rape will be able to testify to one person in secret but on camera and then that testimony played for the courtroom.  Too many women and children are unable to testify in open court because they are either traumatized or afraid of the rapist.  Far too many rapists are getting off with light sentences or getting off all together because their victims will not testify in open court.

55. It is extremely commendable and laudable that women want to serve their country in the military.  Unfortunately, evil things happen when you take men away from all sex for months but have them train with women on a day to day basis.  Women recruits should be housed/trained completely separate from the men. The VAST majority of sexual assaults in the military occur during training.  This can be entirely stopped simply by having the men and women absolutely separate during training.

56. Anyone receiving any form of Government assistance must pass a drug test every six months.

57. Anyone receiving any form of Government assistance, who is not working full time, must work in their community on set tasks, such as cleaning certain stretches of the highway, taking care of their local park, planting trees, etc.

58. Stop all incoming shipments of ANY kind from China until they take care of the North Korea problem and cease ALL shipments of drugs coming from China. 

59. No more workers from out of the country, particularly India, will be brought in to take US workers jobs. 

Instead of enacting harsher penalties for violent criminals in America, WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE PENALTIES! We did away with public hanging and the electric chair.  When we did away with those penalties, violent crime went up greatly.  So we started injecting criminals with a liquid which would peacefully put them to sleep for ever.  REALLY!? That's going to deter violent criminals?  Then, the liberals did away with even that, saying it was CRUEL to criminals.  Look where our crime rate in America is now.  Evil only understands harsh penalties.  You have to treat someone who is evil worse than they treated you.  In the 1970's, terrorists were hijacking Israeli jets.  Then terrorists hijacked an Israeli jet with a lot of people onboard and what did Israel do?  They blew the jet out of the sky!  No more hijackings since then!  When 9/11 occurred, we should have eradicated the governnments who supported those terrorists but instead we killed a few people, enacted a few sanctions and tried talking to them! Evil people only laugh at that kind of reaction.  Remember what Sean Connery's character said in the movie, The Untouchables: They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue.

You have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life. – Winston Churchill

Im an intern at a multi media company and there works a girl  that I really like. She is different then other girls I know and I like that. The first day we met was like we knew each other for years.

So I found the courage to ask her number (So now I only need to ask her). The next time I see here (Might be next week), I will ask her number.

It might not be allot to ask but its something I suppose!

I will keep you up to date if you want.

Just to be clear, the latest document shown here does NOT void Todd's Non-Competition Clause or his Non-Solicitation Clause.

It's simply a request for Summary Judgement on the two clauses, which is essentially judgement on a case without a full trial. Todd and his attorney are essentially arguing that the law is so clearly in his favor in regard to these specific parts of his contract, so much so that there is no need for a trial. However, there is no signature on the document, so as of right now, all this is is a request.

Also Non-Competition Clauses and Non-Solicitation Clauses are enforceable in certain circumstances, as long as they are within a reasonable amount of time and distance. Non-Competition Clauses specifically usually range 12-18 months, 24 months absolute maximum and they must be restricted to a specific, reasonable distance. For instance, if you work in Miami for a company as an architect and sign a Non-Competition Clause to not work for another Architecture firm in Miami for 18 months, that is likely going to be enforced.

However, 5 years is WAY outside that time range and ""Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Sydney,Melbourne, Toronto, Montreal, and London"" as well as any PUA related website on the internet is extremely far reaching. The Non-Competition Clause will almost certainly be made void because of how ridiculously impossible it makes it for Todd to make a living teaching pickup.

Non-Solicitation Clauses are a bit trickier because they do not directly impact Todd's ability to make a living, it simply means he can't hire people who worked for RSD. However, given the 5 year time frame, who know's what will happen with that.

TLDR: This is just a request, by Todd and his attorney, to void the Non-Competition Clause and Non-Solicitation Clause of Todd's contract. As far as we know though, they are NOT yet currently void. Although the Non-Competition Clause likely will be at the very least.

Alex just commented on the situation

Todd Vandehey is such a great guy and gives a fuck about his staff and clients. Papa Nick Kho is an awful manipulative careless trust fund kid. Tyler would be brilliant without Nick. Is sad to see nick ruin it for everyone. RSD would be great without Nick Papa Kho

Here's the latest update. A lot of it sounds retardish because I types this out pretty fast. But I put it up anyway. I'll proofread later. 

The biggest news: Todd is suing RSD

documents so far:

https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/22296890/VanDeHey_v_Real_Social_Dynamics,_Inc_et_al

https://dockets.justia.com/docket/nevada/nvdce/2:2017cv02230/125028

https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5535087809437230282&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=400006

https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2459903279476505991&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,29

I'm not a legal expert but someone posted this summary 
&gt;So Todd is suing for 3 things. 1: He's claiming that the non-competition clause in his contract is illegal. 2: He's claiming someone illegally accessed his personal email. 3: He's claiming someone stole money from his PayPal account. If you put those three claims together, the picture it paints (and this is pure speculation) is that Todd taught someone outside of the RSD framework, at which point someone at RSD or on behalf of RSD hacked Todd's paypal to take the money they thought they were owed and then proceeded to fire Todd for breach of contract. Again though, this is pure speculation, but that's what this motion for discovery is leading me to believe.

This sounds like the time Tyler (Owen Cook) used a key logger to hack into Neil Strausses email, banks accounts, etc. 

It also seems like these Reddit threads are part of the case. If you look at the first link, and scroll down it says ' Exhibit H - Reddit Thread,' [just got a confirmation that it is the thread I posted]

I don't have a PACER account, but maybe my threads are the ones that are being referred to. 

It looks like The non compete clause was ruled as void a week ago

If anyone has a pacer account that they can use to download documents (ask any friends you have that work in legal). I'm very curious if our thread is the one being referred to.

This is the epic response all the RSD shills were talking about. And Papa has the nerve to accuse Todd of stealing money from RSD, when it was the other way around.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpnL1i1I4cI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=49m5s

Papa finally admits he's the one who terminated Todd. Slap in the face to all the RSD people who tried to make it seem that they had a mutual break up, or Todd left on his own. https://youtu.be/Lj3enlrICXE?t=4m24s


-----

Tyler shit talking on Todd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpwTmbd00VY

Some things to note: What Tyler edited out is that before he the video starts, he specifically mentioned that this is response to the Todd situation. Furthermore, this was a freetour that Todd was scheduled to speak at before his separation. Colorado (the location of this freetour) is where Todd grew up. 

Tyler is doing some very high order manipulation in this video, which is probably going to be unnoticed by most people but I'll explain. First some clarification of facts that Owen Cook in stated or implied. 

-Tyler trained Todd for 10 years. 

Incorrect. Todd was there from the very begging, and at the as mentioned in the book The Game and by Tyler's own admission, his pickup and bootcamp skills sucked. Todd and Tyler and the rest developed their bootcamp skills together. It wasn't Tyler teaching Todd. 

-Tyler/Papa created a big 'machine' that helped Todd.

Incorrect. Todd joined RSD in 2012, when RSD was still heavily struggling (Owen's own words). Todd had steady finance job, and he gave that up to help RSD. **It was actually Todd making the sacrifice to help RSD in RSD's time in need, not the other way around**. RSD didn't have a 'machine' until at least 2014 (again, something Tyler himself has mentioned in the past). 

-Anyone who gets put into this machine becomes a millionaire for life

Nope. Alex is not a millionaire. Brad didn't become a millionaire until after he left and found success with 3Impact. 

In fact, It's possible Todd would have made more money if he stayed in finance rather than join RSD. Julien, Max, Madison, Jeffy, Luke, and Alex were all broke and kinda failing at life before they joined RSD, but Todd wasn't. He was one semester away from getting a Mechanical Engineering degree at a top university before he joined project hollywood. He has a very strong analytical mind. He worked in Hedgefunds, and had a career in finance before he quit to join RSD. 

-Once you make them famous, you can't make them unfamous. 

That goes both ways. Todd can't go back to a high paying finance or engineering career now. He's stuck with being a pickup teacher, which most people don't want to do as they get into their 40s unless you're Ozzie or Jeffy. Todd spent his prime career years (late twenties to early thirties) on RSD. He's in mid thirties now. No way he can go back. But Tyler can't even realize this. To him, he's just a victim of Todd. He is blind to Todd's sacrifices. 

Which sucks because Tyler and Papa promised him a lot (much higher pay percentages) in order to get Todd to join them. Todd made his sacrifices, and then he got FUCKED OVER. 

Now for the manipulation Tyler is doing in the video. 

You may not be noticing it, but what Tyler is doing is going off an assumption that Todd is the evil one, but at same time, talking his side when it comes to the money issue. 

It's very hard to notice, because in the video, Tyler technically is taking Todd's side on the money issue. And it does it so well. He does it so well, that you feel he believes it's downright retarded not to give Todd what he wants. He uses high vibration/low vibrations, opportunity cost, higher paradigms. 

He used the Eban Pagen analogy to imply that Todd was screwing over RSD. But Tyler should let it happen because overall it would be better for RSD. Again, it seems that Tyler is taking Todd's side, but his argument is based on the implication of Todd being the selfish one. Despite Todd being the one who got massively fucked over by RSD. 

Tyler is inducing something like a Jesus complex onto himself. That Todd is being so bad to him, but Tyler is preaching to let him do it. 

https://youtu.be/BpwTmbd00VY?t=1h21m10s

Here Tyler is implying that 'he put 3 million dollars' in Todd's pocket, said 'I trust you'. He imparted some amazing gift onto Todd. And Todd said 'I got 3 million dollars, suck my Cock'. (side note, Tyler's talk about the 'business guy' afterwards is most definitely directed to my description of Papa). That Todd made him look dumb. Then Tyler talks about all the time he puts into training his new instructors. Again, RSD trained Brad, Alex, Max, Julien, and Madison. Jeffy, Tyler, and Todd all learned their instructing skills concurrently. It was Todd who trusted Tyler and Papa with verbal agreements that were broken, in order to help RSD while they were struggling, in the process sacrificing the most important prime career years. It was Todd who put thousands of hours into RSD's machine. 

Again, Tyler talks about letting Todd do that to be the best option, both in terms of 'high vibration', and business returns. But look at the assumption he's basing this on: Todd is being the selfish one. 

What Tyler NEVER mentioned in the entire video is everything Todd did for RSD. Which is A LOT. He has 120k subscribers on his youtube channel at the time it was deleted. He built the inner circle system which massivily beneifits RSD. He took the initiative to create the Inner Circle youtube videos which induced a lot of the initial people to join the inner circle facebook groups. He worked many 80 hour weeks. He went through hell getting Vegas Immersion started. That program actually took a ton of work to get started. 

He also has no appreciation for Alex. During the time Alex was in RSD, RSD's main income source was bootcamps. Tyler/Jeffy/Todd have been teaching bootcamps since 2002, and they have taught A LOT of bootcamps. Alex started teaching bootcamps since 2008, and by 2012 he had taught more bootcamps than any other instructor. That was his tag line, he has more hours teaching bootcamps infield than any other instructor. And the other instructors confirmed it. So to teach more bootcamps than Tyler, whose been teaching bootcamps since 2002, catch up and beat him in a 4 year period, he had to teach A LOT OF FUCKING BOOTCAMPS. If you looked at the bootcamp calendar from 2009-2014, the vast majority of them were instructed by Alex. Dude was fucking busy, and made RSD a SHIT TON of money. 

Yet, they were treating him like shit (if you saw his videos on why he left RSD). Yet before those videos were released, whenever his employees asked Tyler or Papa why Alex left, they all said the same thing: ""Because Alex is fucking crazy"". When Alex released the video, Tyler's response in one of the freetour videos was 'oh great, one of my old instructors hates me'. 

Also, Julien wrote a response (now deleted) that Eren Social responded to https://i.gyazo.com/1ac176b9c4cb5d5ec878396bfdfa183e.png.

Tyler and Papa have absolutely no appreciation or gratitude for all the money and brand expanding Todd and Alex did for RSD. None at all. And as you can all see from his Colorado free tour videos, he feels that it's actually Todd and Alex that have no appreciation for everything Tyler did for them.

Tyler talks a lot about appreciation and gratitude, but has no for everything Todd did for RSD. No appreciation for sacrafices his prime career years. No appreciation for the thousands of hours he put into RSD, when RSD was struggling.

Todd's new facebook

https://www.facebook.com/todd.vandehey.50

He put up a video. He says he's working on something huge. 

-----

RSD took down all of Todds products, and did not respond to calls and emails for two weeks before finally providing the files via dropbox. For a while, it looked like RSD was going to just rip off RSD customers just to further hurt Todd. There was a time when people would call into customer support, and they were amped and ready to sell a bootcamp or product, and as soon as they asked what is happening with Todd's products (Women, VU, Daygame, etc.) all of a sudden all their people were busy and they would have to call back. 

I guess it's good that they eventually gave the files via dropbox. But wouldn't it be nice if they were a company that didn't need a ton of people complaining just to do the bare minimum of decency?

Vegas Immersion 

Other people have come forward to confirm what I have previously reported on Vegas Immersion

https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/6rhaos/review_rsd_las_vegas_immersionbootcamp_with_rsd/

Highlights:

&gt;ut do not learn that model from Luke. Luke is one of the most unorganized guys i met in my life... His talk is also very unorganized. During the pulling training, he spent more than 20 minutes talking about different rappers and rap lyrics. Then, he spent another 10+ minutes talking about how some hot girls sleep with their teachers to get better grades. Then, he talked about another topic which was not related to game at all. All of these are good information, but none of which help his students improve. I think he talked about total of ~20 minutes related to pulling in pulling training. Rest of his talk that night was waste of time and money. He still drops useful information here and there. But 3 hours long training from Luke only contains around 45-60 minutes of information related to game most of time. He gets lost a lot during any talk. Unfortunately, I can not bring myself to believe that he takes teaching PUA seriously. Basically, in my opinion, Luke learned from the best, studied with the best, but he is not interested in teaching the next generation. He sees PUA only as means to make money.

.


&gt;Another point is that, Luke over promises and never delivers and he has no problem lying to people. For example, I heard that few people asked him if he goes to in field with students. He replied yes. In reality, he never goes to in field. In my 3 months in immersion, I have never seen him help any immersion student in field.

.


&gt;Another example is that, on multiple platforms he says he will take all of Immersion students to X event because he always does. This is a world famous event. I think I heard Luke talk about this event at least 8-10 times on multiple platforms (during immersion, on youtube, on his social circle video, in person, on snapchat, etc). The VIP tickets for the event is 600$ per person. So, I was looking forward to getting into the event thanks to Luke. During the week of the event, he suddenly stops answering all of the texts about the event from all of the students. But, he still posted about the event on his snapchat. So, he does not take immersion students to said event, yet he brags about taking all immersion students to said event on every platform. Luke promising things and suddenly stop answering texts is extremely common.

.



&gt;Another example is the video on Immersion web-page. Luke claims that he will take immersion students to private parties, private events, etc... This is a false advertisement. In my 3 months in immersion, I never saw Luke invite immersion students anywhere. I worked with 7 instructors total in my life. Honestly, Luke promised the most and delivered the least among any instructor I worked with. In my opinion, you should be extremely careful believing the things he says. There is a very high chance he will not follow.

.



&gt; Luke is not involved with any other part of immersion. As long as the immersion is concerned, these 2 nights of training is his only involvement. He sometimes misses those here and there as well.

.



&gt;Luke never comes to infields. In my 3 months in Immersion, I think I saw Luke infield twice. Even when he was in the same club, he did not observe or give feed-back to students. He was just hanging out with his friends at VIP area, to which the students are not invited. Luke does not run demo sets as well. So, you will never see him gaming or learn from him in person. This was a big let down for me. This was the first time I worked with an instructor and never saw him run any demo sets, give feedback, or join infield at all.
So, In field training of immersion is solely run by the coaches. Senior coaches do not come to in field often. So in field is mostly run by junior coaches.


.



&gt;You can do private training with Luke. It is 400$ per hour with minimum of 2 hours a night (minimum 800$ or 1600$ for the full night). I strongly suggest you NOT to do it. Unfortunately, my coaching with Luke was the worst training I had. This is why I decided to quit it after the 1st month instead of going the full 6-8 months of training. He did an extremely bad job of giving me suggestions or feed-back. He did not run any demo sets during private coaching neither.

.



&gt; So I got no feedback during in field and I got no notes after our training. Basically, after spending 8 hours of private training (and a lot of money) with Luke, I still have no idea what I should do differently since he gave me no feedback even after observing me in many sets.

.



&gt;He only showed up at 2 out of 4 of our scheduled training. At other times, he did not answer any texts or got back to me. But, he randomly texts his clients and asks them to do 1on1 the same night. So he will not show up to a training you scheduled a week ago. But, he will randomly hit you up and ask to do training.



Another person reached out to me with this message

&gt;friend forwarded me your link for todd. luke fucked immersion. he paid less to coaches. he had hard time finding coaches. he only hires inexperienced coaches. immersion coaches today make less money than todd coache. luke goes to DJ booth take pictures post to inner circle. he said he was in the DJ booth because he used the line he tought at immersion. fucking lier. his friend run a modeling company had table for dj boots invited luke. most things he said are lies. manstion is 26 minutes from strip. it is at the end of vegas close to mountins. luke tells teh location of manstion after student comes to vegas. many students complained to luke. only coaches pull there. coaches pull 4 girls take video send video to inner circle with 4 girls. party way coaches 10 students 4 girls. 8 students did not get laid. this happens 2 times month nomore. luke doesnt live in manstion. 2 coachs live there. they have day jobs. no game talk dring day. 1 photoshoot at manstion in 1 year. luke keeps posting same pictures. luke can't do cold aproach or table game. his friend owns modeling copmpany in vegas. locals invite luke to table because they like his friend.

More Vegas Immersion 

Another person pointed out that right after Luke joined, they did't tell anyone. They still advertised it as Todd joining Immersion. Then surprised them right before they leave for Vegas. 

https://web.archive.org/web/20171020143730/https://www.rsdnation.com/node/589311

https://web.archive.org/web/20151201020555/http://www.rsdnation.com:80/node/589311?page=4

On page 5 one of the vegas immersion employees actually tries to slander the guy for mentioning that they were still advertising Todd when it was Luke who was the official instructor. 

One more thing. Despite the blood, sweat, and tears Todd put into making the masterpiece that was his Vegas Immersion. Despite Luke taking all that hard work and shitting it down the toilet. Fucking RSD Tyler had the audacity to shit talk on Todd's Immersion and uptalk Luke's Immersion 

In Tyler's words (on page 2 of above): ""This is an upgrade not a downgrade. It's currently a better program.Todd is da man and one of my closest longtime friends, but Luke is far more involved in the immersion program since it's all he does, whereas Todd had many projects going at the same time. He's a veteran teacher of the game like Todd, and also hooked up in Vegas on a very high level (he's Michael Sartain's best friend) and has taught pickup for years independently - he just didn't have a YT channel but succeeded via word of mouth.""

Btw, the 2nd part of Tyler's statement is false. Luke had a failed pickup company. The company failed several years before he joined RSD. He was not doing any pickup business for years before joining RSD. 

But besides the point. RSD who was still advertising Todd doing Immersion when Todd had long left was one of the many many many problems Todd had with RSD during his time there. He didn't want his name being associated with the piece of shit program Immersion turned into. 

-----

There have been countless people who requested for us to go private. We're never going private.

There are already private versions of this site. It's just that RSD sends their shills to infiltrate and take down the links. So they are very strict on who they let in.

But RSD will never take us down, because we can retaliate in a huge way. See Spiderfan's conversation with Julien Blanc. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/PickUpTorrents/comments/50cj22/attn_julien_blanc_is_at_it_again_sending/?st=j8tt8nt2&amp;sh=5351c1ee

The background for this, is that he used to doxx people for torrenting 10Game. Btw, the whole drinking while in his room alone comment, is something he actually did. Spiderfan knows Julien's old roommates, and that's actually how he used to cope with the Sexual assault scandel (we use that term, not the Orwellian 'media scandel' Tyler came up with, as if it's the media who sexually assaulted those women and taught their audience to do so).

Julien gives a shitty bootcamp. People find out, and Julien Slander's guy who mentioned it. The highlights are on page 1,

Btw, you can tell that this guy is an intelligence and diligent person. He's eager to find out what his blind spots, are , and implement feedback with no ego. He basically every bootcamp instructor's dream student. A student that Julien took 2000k of his money and gave him basically no value in return. 

Some highlights 

&gt;I have his email yes, I'll contact him about it. He was alright during the bootcamp but his advice only came down to ""you're already doing everything right/ I would do game exactly like you do"" he never really gave solid advice. I didn't really like it but I just thought it was OK at the time because I decided to fully trust the program.

&gt;During the night out he didn't say much, he also didnt do approaches himself. He did give general feedback on defriefs.

&gt;I can't recall how long the defriefs were, I think like 30-45 minutes

&gt;Yeah I didn't have a huge transformation at all. But I figured that was maybe normal, or perhaps just my fault. In hindsight I just saw the bootcamp as an additional experiment to try on my path ""to fuck a girl (lol)"", so when I didn't help me, I just thought ""oh well, moving on"". The period after the bootcamp was one of my most intense phases of going out, I went out pretty hard for 4 nights a week a couple months straight , but I will admit that for the past couple 2-3 months I have stopped going out a lot (probably once a week), because when results don't come, it does a get a bit discouraging after a while.



Then Julien answers at the end. He slandars his bootcamp student by saying he never emailed him. He did multiple times. In fact, he messaged him on multiple platforms. He hit him up on whatsapp, and he say that Julien saw his messages and never replied. He only sent out an email after he slandered him on RSDNation. In the email, he gave some basic 'don't be needy advice', and then told him 'stop spreading lies about him online'. Everything he said was true, and it was Julien was the one who lied. 

Julien: ""I've also NEVER received any emails from you since the Bootcamp... So if you'd like to discuss this in further depth, HIT ME UP MAN! I tell EVERY Bootcamp student that they can email me anytime after the program with ANY questions, and if they do, I ALWAYS answer... So, email me! ;)

Fucking bullshit. Julien likes to manipulate his bootcamp students like how he used to manipulate women.

With all the Harvey Weinstein in the news, how about we talk about Real Social Dynamics long history with rape and sexual assault. 

RSD's notions on entitlement of sex comes from the 50s or some of the cultures in some of the current 3rd world countries (reference https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/77hdo6/man_found_not_guilty_of_sexually_assaulting_his/ )

Here's a blog post which talks about an old RSD thread where Jeffy condones using physical force to coerce girls into having sex. 

http://aaronsleazy.blogspot.com/2011/03/rsd-cool-with-date-rape.html

https://web.archive.org/web/20171020152503/http://aaronsleazy.blogspot.com/2011/03/rsd-cool-with-date-rape.html

If you didn't already know, Owen Cook bragged about raping a stripper http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2839028/Boss-vile-American-Pick-Artist-Julien-Blanc-facing-UK-ban-bragged-raping-stripper-totally-not-mood.html

I was on the RSDNation forum when it happened and Tyler offered the excuse this was just a situation where a couple doesn't want to have sex but they try to have sex anyway even if they are not in the mood. There is no archive of it, but that's the best of my paraphrase. 

But as you can see from the video, it's much more disturbing than that. Tyler view is that Men are entitled to sex and it's normal to use force to get it. 

You can see the notions of Tyler attitude towards using force for sex in one of his earliest articles on cavemanning. 

https://web.archive.org/web/20171020153721/http://rsdwiki.com/index.php?title=Cavemaning%2C_Kino%2C_%26_Body_Language

&gt;You see this in John Wayne movies, where the girl is freaking out, and he pins her to the wall and starts kissing her. She struggles and struggles, and then let's go and just falls in love with him again and everything is FINE. haaa, those motherfuckers KNEW how to interact with women on an emotional level back then, before the women's movement came in and fucked us all up.

Finally, here's a video which takes a book out of Donald Trump's play book, and forcibly kisses an engaged women. Twice, the 2nd time he picked her up and pins her to the wall, and continues to force himself on her while she keeps repeating 'no' and tries her best to push his face away with her arms.

btw, Tyler's creeping out a woman in the background.

Video of RSD Max shit talking Todd 

https://youtu.be/YsLQpf6QcEc?t=8s

I recommend watching to first 15 seconds of this video before hand to really let the context sink in

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5jdoaag_x0 

----

So now Papa, Jeffy, Max, and now Tyler have shit talked on Todd. Despite Todd getting massivly screwed over by RSD, despite RSD overall benifiting massivly from Todd (even though his immersion program may have out competed other instructors' bootcamps), despite RSD going after Todd legally (they know their legal claims are bogus because of State's non-complete clause laws, but Todd still has to lawyer up and spend a significant amount of time/money/stress , things he is very short on with a baby on the way), despite the ordering several hundred interns going around the internet shit-talking todd (many of which on in this thread, masquerading as people pretending to be former students or 'just asking questions') ) despite all the SHIT talking Jeffy, Max, Papa, and Now Tyler (even dedicated a masterfully crafted 2 hour free tour to make Todd look bad) has done on Todd . . .Todd has NEVER talked shit about RSD.

Despite all this, he has NEVER said anything bad about RSD. Todd has every right through. Every fucking right. He's been screwed over so badly, RSD benifited so much, yet they're the one's unleashing the propaganda machines, and Todd is staying silent. That's because, Todd is already gone, already home https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfIoxjOtbwA

Well, I guess not totally since Todd is taking RSD to court now ;)


----

Todd's instagram is down

https://www.instagram.com/toddvalentineofficial/?hl=en

----

Fun fact, Todd may have been RSD's most effective instructor, just from hearing from people who have taken bootcamps from different instructors. Todd seems to have the most impressive transformations. 

Max has some decent reviews, but the transformations he produced were never too huge. He was a hard worker, and at times spent the most amount of times with the students. But he's been goofing of a bit more now that he has the fame that came with the Natural. 

Julien has the best demonstrations, and at times has some very good transformations. But as seen as above, he's gotten lazy. He also hates a lot of the students he works with, and a lot times is a dick to them for no reason, as seen above. Even with smart hard working students he gives them a bad experience, just for fun. In a similar manner of how he used to manipulate women. 

Jeffy is fucking lazy. Can't really guage his proficiency anymore. 

Derek's bootcamp experience is very different. Even tho his also costs 2k, it's a short bootcamp as in it's 2 days instead of 3. Some people get a lot out of his bootcamp. Others don't get anything at all. Sometimes he hates his students if they are of low intelligence. 

Tyler actually has the strongest ability to induce transformation at out all of them. But he only attends his bootcamp for a fraction of the time. It's mostly Tyler's assistant who handles his bootcamp, and Tyler makes an appearance. He also has up to 9 students taking his bootcamp (even though the official limit is 3, he says his assistants count as RSD instructors ). 

Madison is very hard working and actually cares a lot about his students. But his transformation induction abilities are not close to Todd or Tyler. Though he is fantastic with newbies and hardcases. 

Todd seems to be overall the best. His transformation ability is a notch below Tyler's , about same as Julien, but he always works hard and has great empathy with his students. Check out this video of Todd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsAKEZCG7FM

----

Btw, if anyone is reading this. I think we should have Tyler practice the gratitude and appreciation he always preaching about. Leave some sort of comment on his youtube videos or instagram. Something like, 'thank Todd for all his sacrifices', 'it's called thank you', 'say thanks'. Hopefully something more clever.

Bonus: 

Todd before RSD

I'll be majoring in MIS at the school of management. I have a few general NJIT questions, and a few SOM specific questions. I'll start with the general questions.

1. Is the surrounding area generally safe? I know I shouldn't wander the streets of downtown newark at 2 AM, but do you ever feel worried under normal circumstances?

2. How's the campus itself? Food, classrooms, libraries, etc.?

Now for the SOM specific questions.

1. How's the on-campus recruitment? Are there a lot of career fairs and other ways to get internships and get to speak to recruiters?

2. How's the quality of the upper level courses? Do you like the professors, and do you feel like it's a quality education?

3. Do any of the courses require public speaking? This isn't a big deal, I'm just curious because I honestly don't like public speaking and am just wondering if it's a big part of the upper level business/IT courses at NJIT.

Thanks everyone, really appreciate any feedback."

I was on the bus back today from my internship as I always do on Thursdays and Fridays. Midway through the bus ride a man who had told me ""Bless you"" when I sneezed noticed that I had a smart phone so he asked if I can look up for him what bus he should take to get to a specific city. I told him the street to get off on and which other bus to get on in order for him to get to where he needed to be. 

After this followed a small conversation between us throughout my bus ride back. He seemed nice and was able to engage in conversation, so it felt normal. 

It was when I notified him that his bus stop was just a few streets away that I started to feel uncomfortable. When I told him about his stop, he said, ""Oh, no worries. I'll most likely just go to X city instead"". X city happens to be the city I live in, since I mentioned in our conversation which school I go to, which is in the same city I live in. He had no previous intention to come to X city before. He was supposed to go to a completely different city up north. 

Once my stop was near, I grabbed hold of my bag very tightly and tried to not be rude and said goodbye to him as I got off. I got off that bus quick and just immediately directed myself back to my apartment. I look back, and he's following me. I take drastic turns around the streets to make sure I wasn't just out of my mind, and I look back again, and he's there behind me. 

I ran as fast as I could and managed to slip into a Halloween costume store near where I lived and just roamed around the back while looking at the entrance, hoping he wasnt in there. 

Fortunately he wasnt there. He probably lost sight of me. I still lingered in there for a while and was shaking, made small talk with the woman cashier and left. I made it just a block from there and just couldn't move anymore. I was just so sad scared, I was shaking so bad and I wanted to cry. I then called one of my roommates asking if she could come get me and have us walk back because of what just happened. She said, ""We're coming right now. We care."" Three of my roommates immediately arrived to where I was, and that's when I just broke down crying. We made it back safely.

Roommates, thank you. Thank you for getting my call and thank you for dropping everyone and coming for me. And... Thank you for caring. Its been a while since I've felt this afraid and powerless, and just having support in this way made me calm down and feel so much better. "

We’ve only ever dated each other.


We’ve had ups and downs but nothing too crazy. In august everything seemed amazing. We were doing internships in the same city and living together in 1 room.
In September we moved back to school (We have an apartment together here too but separate bedrooms) and everything did a 180.


He got very distant. I got very clingy and anxious. I’m dealing with daily anxiety attacks right now and just not having a fun time. Normaly school is always really hard and rocky for me and I can lean on him a bit for support but now it’s like the relationship is rocky too and I’m on my own. Maybe that’s a good thing. I’m too codependent. He's also very stressed and focused on school this term.



We’re both so busy right now with midterms that we can’t really work on our relationship. But last week we went on a walk and he told me that he’s been having thoughts that he would be happier outside of the relationship. I’m glad that he could be honest and open with me cause he doesn’t share feelings that often but it hurts. He said he feels guilty being so attached when he’s thinking about ending it. But at the same time he doesn’t want to break up…



So here I am, trying (and failing) to push these issues away so that I can focus on school but it’s so hard when I come home and see him at night and pretend everything is fine. :(
I feel like he’s just waiting for a good time to pull the trigger. We’re also going to be living together at least until May when the school year ends. I love him and don’t want to give up on this but it’s not my decision. Not sure how to deal with it.


Also I’m going to see a doctor about my mental health issues on Monday and start going to a therapist when I figure out how to get it covered by insurance.  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Bf said he gets thoughts that he'd be happier outside of the relationship. I want to fix things eventually but need to focus on school now."

I currently go to school in Denmark, while he goes to school in Norway, but part of my program involves a 9 week internship in lieu of taking classes, and I have just received confirmation that I have been placed with a company in the same city as my boyfriend, meaning I can live with him while I do my internship.  I am just over the moon, because in the next three months, we'll be able to spend our first Christmas and first New Years together, followed shortly by our 4-year anniversary!

I know it isn't a permanent victory and that in February I'll have to come back home and be apart from him again, but this is gonna be the longest time we've spent together as a couple since before our LDR started almost 3 and a half years ago.  And this will be the first time our visits involve a normal schedule, as we'll both be working/going to school.  So in that sense, this is our first real dry-run to living together for real and I just can't wait.

The fact that I'm gonna be living with the man I love, paired with my internship, which is gonna be something that I love doing, means the next three months are gonna be great.  We've come such a long way from living on different continents only seeing each other once every 7 months, it's hard to believe sometimes!

I just wanted to share this little piece of success with y'all, as reading this subreddit has really helped me deal with loneliness for the last few years, and reading about all y'all's successes always helped me think forward to when I'd be seeing him again.  I hope my happiness helps all of you just like y'all's has helped me!"

-----

Feathers, a locket and the warmth of the sun. These are all things I've known; things that play in the brief vignettes that flash as my eyes droop. I feel the temperate Autumn breeze sweep in through the open window and turn my gaze to my weeping family. My children are all here: William, Veronica, Eiliff and all the little grandchildren too. Some of them are too small to understand what's really going on, so all I can leave them with is a smile. Switzerland is nice in October, and the staff here seem to understand the importance of leaving with dignity. 

I feel my grip loosening. This is it.

 Veronica lets out a choked sob, and I grip her hand one last time. Don't be sad because it's over, I want to tell her, Just be happy that it all happened, and all so well. 
The curtains inside my mind draw closed, and there's nothing for a moment. Then, I'm falling. The light above me grows smaller and smaller. I feel the remnants of my concrete mind dissolve, leaving me in twisting primal fear. Faces of the dead and buried swirl around me, but I can't think about it.
 
There's nothing. Nothing at all, just a terrible absence.

Then I'm on my feet, and it hurts like hell.

“Welcome to the underworld.”

There's... something in front of me. It's formless, ever shifting, like those artist's impressions of 4D cubes. Tesseracts? Every time I focus on a facet I get a distinct feeling of terror. I avert my eyes.

*Hell?*

“Yup.”

*That doesn't make any sense.*

“Very perceptive of you.”

*Thanks.*

“No problem. I'm Lucifer, or Satan, or Hades; whatever you want to call me.”

*Ok. Am I speaking at the moment?*

“No, not really. Things are a little more... elegant down here.”

*Oh. Is this one of those you already know what I'm going to say, going to do type scenarios?*

“Eh...” A pair of demonic shoulders rises from the formless void and shrug. “Comme ci, comme ça. Freedom of thought is a little more complex than that.”

*That's kind of cool. Can I have some shoes? This brimstone is a little taxing on the soles.*

“First, nice pun. Look down.”	

I look. I don't have any feet.

*I don't have any feet.*

“A+. You don't have any eyes, either.”

*Then how am I seeing?*

“You're not, really. You're just... here. That's the best way I can explain it to you.”

*That's annoyingly cryptic.*

The demon shoulders shrug again, then disappear. “We're all very Neil Gaiman down here.”

*So there's a pantheon of gods from all the religions vying for power and influence over the mortal world?*

“More or less. Those that don't use their power to give themselves eternally changing, unceasing pleasure for all eternity.”

*Can I get a hit of that?*

“Afraid not. Anyways...” The formless void conjures up a yellow legal pad and a flamboyantly awful red pen. Flitting around on tiny red wings, it makes a few notes.

“I'm sure you've realised, by now, that a mistake has been made. You're more of a good person than a bad, and that charity you ran? Real mix up here, but I can't send you upstairs just yet.”

*Why's that?*

“Eh, politics. Janus set up this annoyingly bureaucratic system for transfers, and once he got Mercury on board... Just a pain in the ass.”

*So, Hell for the time being?*

“Yep.” The pen jots down a couple more notes, then disappears in a puff of black smoke. A page from the legal pad tears itself off, floats over to me and folds itself up. “I need to get going, but if anyone gives you trouble, show them this.”
I will the paper to unfold, and printed in pulsing, blood red script are the words:

**PROPERTY OF LUCIFER/SATAN/HADES: NE TOUCHE PAS S.V.P**

*...French?*

“Hell is kind of like Quebec.”

*...Ok?*

A pair of arms appear from the cloud and impatiently tap a melting watch.

“I'm off. I'll come check in with you in a couple of days. Until then, stay out of trouble and enjoy the attractions. Stay out of Spanish town.”

The tesseract disappeared in a roaring, unholy conflagration, revealing the view behind it.

*Is that a fucking Tim Horton's?*

-----

Sitting on a bench outside the Tim Horton's, I try to will myself a mouth to sip at the boiling coffee. So far, I've conjured a vaguely humanoid, featureless shape that I've been using to awkwardly perambulate about. I manage a crude beak like appendage and the grins of the little demon marshmellows bobbing in my drink seem ever crueler. My beak begins to scream and I will it back away to the howling void.

Hell. Huh.

I take a look around. Dotted throughout the hellscape was the occasional building, cracked and crumbling with screams, fire or both coming from within. Lamp posts from every era, and obviously some from those to come, lit the space with an eerie off yellow light. Lumbering shapes whirled their tentacles around on the foggy horizon. In the distance, barking.

*Cerberus?*


“At the vet.”

I'd say I was startled, but emotion was strangely distant down here. Sitting adjacent to my... shape was a pop-punky looking demon. With an arrowhead tail and red, flesh covered horns he would have been the image of the Hollywood demon, save the piercings, drainpipe jeans and emo hair. No shirt, though. I could see the top of an iPod classic poking out of his jeans as he nibbled on a Tim Horton's Bagel B.E.L.T.®. 

*Are you my chaperone?*

“For the time being.” He waved his hand in front of his face and panted. “Ah, ah, hot!” 

I try my best to summon a look of derision. A few feet in front of me, the brimstone molds itself into the shape of a brow wracked in fear. It grows a mouth and screams.

“Think of me...” He smacks his lips with the last remnants of the delicious pastry. “...more of as an intern. You just happen to be my current venture.”

Ah, of course.

*Whose kid are you*

He looks irritated that I've figured it out. “Demeter's son, from her first marriage.”

*Does she live here too?*

“She visits sometimes.” His eyes glitter with a far off look. “Even though the big guy stopped calling himself Hades a few millenia ago he still keeps Persephone around. I spend weekends with my mum up on the surface, though. In the week I'm here at this shitty internship.”

*Your 'mum'? I'm not sure if the concept of American exists down here, but you're no Brit.*

His face turns an even darker shade of red, brow screwing up with what is unmistakably teenage angst. He mumbles something under his breath.

What?

“Nothing!” 

I try to conjure up 'annoyed', but the bench grows an oversized tongue instead. The Punk demon eyed it nervously. 

I have no mouth, yet I must sigh.

*Ok, dude. I'd rather like to make my few days in Hell as pleasant as possible, despite the obvious contradiction there. Truce?*

He eyes me suspiciously for a beat, then nods. “Truce.”

A moment of awkward silent passes. 

*So who's Cerberus' veterinarian?*

“Genghis Khan.”

*No shit?*

“No shit. Turns out that beneath the love for raping, pillaging, looting, etcetera, he had an even deeper love for puppies.”

*Including gigantic three headed hellhounds?*

“Especially gigantic three headed hellhounds.”

I turn and look out at the glowing Hellscape.

*Huh. Hell.*

Basically, I am currently completing an internship where I am developing an app on my brother's 2011 MacBook Pro because I don't have a Mac. xCode has become quite slow when using the storyboard and I experience stalling that can go for up to 10 seconds at a time. I want a quick stop-gap solution to avoid this problem until I am finished.

Anyway, I was thinking of using Hackintosh on my windows laptop to develop instead, in the hope that it will be faster. I also want to be able to dual boot both windows and mac on my laptop. It has two HDDs so I am hoping I can have one OS on each.

My Laptop specs are as follows:

**Laptop Model**: Asus N56VZ (Purchased 2012)

**Motherboard Model**: N65VZ (ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.)

**CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3610QM CPU @ 2.30GHz, 2301 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)

**GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M (2GB DDR3)

**RAM**: 16GB

**HDD**: 2x500GB

**OS**: Windows 7 64-bit

Hopefully I have put in the right specs, let me know if something is off.

So with all that, can anyone provide advice/insight into my situation? I want to dual boot so I can still use windows for other projects. Lastly, if it is possible to dual boot using both HDDs, what would the process be in restoring the HDD so it can be used for windows again? I will want to clear Hackintosh when I am finished.

Thank you."
77ut9l,8,2017-10-21,Haven't seen my ex in 10 years and been dreaming about him a lot. Missing his sister as well who stopped talking to me 12 years ago.,whatisgoingonx,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/77ut9l/havent_seen_my_ex_in_10_years_and_been_dreaming/,"I don't even know where to start. This is gonna be LONG so bear with me.

When I was in 5th grade (I was 10) I met this girl, Emma (she was in my grade), and we became instant best friends. She's a year older than me because I skipped a grade. She had a younger brother, Logan. Logan was one grade below us and my age. We used to hang out at her house all the time and Logan was nothing but her annoying little bother who always wanted to get in our business. 

We had frequent sleepovers. We were truly inseparable and were always in the same group of friends. When we were sophomores in high school Emma started hanging out with different people from our usual old friends group. She started going out to parties and drinking and I was not into that. We were still friends but she knew I disapproved of the drinking so she started keeping a lot of things from me, but we were still best friends and I went over her house a lot. I started hanging out with her brother Logan and his friends soon became my friends (remember I'm his age). 

In our senior year of high school Emma and I drifted. Even though we were still in the same classes, saw each other every day and had many friends in common, we just weren't into the same stuff anymore. I became really close with this new girl Ruby and Emma got jealous. She was friends with Ruby as well but me and Ruby were like the same person. Emma kept a lot of things from me, like losing her virginity to this guy I hated, Gavin. He was a jerk to her and they started going steady and that's when we stopped hanging out together.

Ruby and I became increasingly close to Logan, we hung out all the time. Emma hated seeing us together and got closer and closer to Gavin. Around the end of our Senior year I didn't even know what was going on in Emma's life anymore. I knew life at home was rough for her because of her alcoholic and abusive father. Her father had always been an asshole but things got a lot worse in our senior year. I knew that because Logan told me and I witnessed a lot of his abuse when I went over. He was the worst, honestly. 

I did feel sad and frustrated because of how far apart Emma and I grew but I honestly didn't know how to fix things. I had Ruby, I had Logan, I had other good friends, Emma didn't seem to care about me anymore, I had to study for my college exams, I didn't pay much attention to Emma. I missed her friendship a lot but she really was a person I didn't even recognize anymore.

Last week of high school, the day before our college entrance exams. We were in class and she gets a call so she left. Her father passed away from a heart attack. I was home when I got the news. I was 15, I had never met anymore who had died before, I had never been in that situation. I called her, she told me she was okay, she told me she was relieved he was gone and that she was finally free. I asked her if she wanted me to come over and she said I didn't have to, I should sleep and focus on my exam the next morning. I believed her. 

The funeral happened as I took my college entrance exam. She missed the exams, obviously. After the exams I went over, we watched a movie, we didn't talk much. I didn't sleep over, another friend was staying with her. 

A month later I started hooking up with Logan. We were watching a movie and he kissed me. I was taken aback but I responded to the kiss. We fooled around and I went home. We didn't talk about it and pretended nothing happened. We always hung out in a group and it wasn't weird between us. But after the first time he kissed me, we would hook up every time we were alone. It was our little dirty secret. None of our friends knew. I didn't tell Ruby because I thought she would feel weirded out. 

Emma and I were barely speaking, not because we got into a fight or something but just because. She was always moody even though life at her house got a lot better after her father passed away. The family came into some money and her mother and Logan looked so much happier and healthier. The atmosphere at her house was better than ever, everyone had noticed it. I didn't think her behavior had anything to do with her father passing away and I just ignored her, really, she did the same to me. We said hi and were friendly but not really friends anymore.

One day Logan and I had sex. We were both virgins and it was really great. Something out of a movie and I even orgasmed on my first time. It didn't hurt, it was just perfect. We were in love but we didn't talk about it. We were exclusive and we didn't talk about it either. It was as if our relationship was forbidden and we still acted as just friends in front of everyone else. This went on for maybe five months. 

He was in his senior year of high school and I started college. I didn't move away for college because I got into a great school in my hometown. Emma had to take one extra year because she missed her college exams. Ruby got married to her boyfriend and didn't go to college that year. Some of our friends went away to college but my biggest friend group at that point was Logan's friends. No one knew anything was going on between us. 

One day he told me he loved me and wanted us to be bf and gf. I was terrified of how our friends were going to see our relationship. Honestly, nobody had a clue. We started dating and only told one friend, Alice. Alice was really supportive because she had been shipping us forever. She was over the moon about it and she started hanging out with us a lot. We started telling people and everyone was okay with us dating. Everyone but Emma. She simply stopped talking to me and to Logan. She wouldn't look us in the face. Some of our common friends went over to her side and stopped talking to me as well. It was the great fucking apartheid. 

I was in college. I met new people, I made great friends and they all got along with Logan. His senior year was over, most of his friends moved away for college and he started hanging out with my friends from college. We became a really tight gang of 8 college kids who just wanted to have fun and enjoy life. We went out every weekend, we were always together. Logan was still living home because he had to take his college exams again. 

Emma got into the same school I was going to. She would pass me in the halls and still wouldn't look me in the face. I stopped going over her house (she and Logan still lived together) for a while hoping for things to cool off. They never did. She went away to a different school. Logan went away for school as well but we kept a LDR. 

Logan and I had really the best relationship. We were best friends, we talked about every thing you could possibly imagine. We laughed a lot together. We liked the same music, the same shows, the same movies, the same people, we had the same views about life. He went away to college and started hanging out with people I didn't really have much in common with but I tried my best to like them. We visited each other at least once a month, I became friends with his friends. Everything was fine.

Emma was the bump on the road to us. She loathed me. She told him to pick either me or her. They stopped talking. I hated that I was in between two siblings but he assured me her ultimatum had nothing to do with me and more to do with whatever was going on in her life at the moment. I don't know what Emma told their mom but I noticed she wasn't a big fan of my relationship with Logan either. That took a big toll on us. Also, sophomore year of college got him really busy. 

We got internships and didn't have any free time. We started talking less, seeing each other less. Emma still hated me. Things were just not the same anymore, we had grown apart. We both wanted to end the relationship but we didn't know how. We talked and decided it was best to go our separate ways.

We couldn't. We missed each other too much. We weren't exclusive anymore but we still would hook up whenever we met. He lived in a big city and once I ran into him. On a bus. In a route he never took. It was the weirdest damn thing and feeling. We hooked up. We couldn't see each other and not jump each other's bones. All of this back and forth was very emotionally distressing for me. It eventually became too much and I realized it was keeping me from moving on. I decided we shouldn't see each other again. I told him we couldn't be friends, I didn't want any part of his life. He agreed. It just hurt too much not to be together. We had sex one last time, we kissed each other goodbye. This was in 2007.

We never saw each other again. 

I started dating again, nothing really serious. I was enjoying my college experience. REALLY ENJOYING IT. Having a lot of sex, drinking, doing drugs, the typical college life. I never really had a serious boyfriend/girlfriend again. I ALWAYS missed my relationship with Logan because we we the best of friends. I don't think I ever got over him. I graduated in 2009 and moved to a different country in 2010. I went to see this live show of a band Logan and I loved. They played our song. I was drunk. I had his phone number memorized. I had no idea if it still was his number but I anonymously texted him. I didn't send a number to let him reply. I told him I was in a really good place and I was very happy and I was seeing our band playing our song live and it made me think of him. I told him I loved him and I would always love him and wished him a happy life. I don't know if he got the text. It was the last time I ever tried any contact. 

I moved back home in 2012. I got into a happy, healthy committed relationship ever since. I reconnected with Alice and Ruby. I'm still friends with my college friend group (who were also Logan's friends). Ever since Logan and I broke up for good, he vanished from the face of the earth. None of my friends have seen or heard of him. He's not on facebook, he's not on twitter, he's not on instagram. I looked. My friends looked. I follow some people from my high school life on social media who are still friends with Emma. I see her in pictures sometimes. I know she's on facebook and instagram. But nobody I know has ever seen or heard about Logan again.

A year after we broke up a friend of his told me he got really weird and closed off. Two years ago a girl Alice knows who was friends with Logan told Alice he was dating a guy. I am dating a woman so nothing weird here, really. That was really the only thing I ever heard about him. 

The reason I'm writing all of this is because for the past two weeks I've been dreaming about Logan every single day. Sometimes we have sex, sometimes we just talk, sometimes I just see him passing by. I don't know what these dreams mean, they really confused me and made me wonder about him. I wish I knew what he was up to. We were such good friends and I miss that friendship, I do. I have no idea how I would feel seeing him again. I love my girlfriend, but I do wonder about him sometimes. These dreams are fucking me up.

Emma and Logan's mom is on facebook. She's friends with my mom. I could ask her for Logan's contact info. I don't know if I should tho. Would it be wise to open that door again? I'm not looking for anything romantic. I think I just want closure. I don't even know. Did we have closure? What the hell is going on here?

I also miss Emma. A lot. I've always missed her. I dream about her all the time. Like, maybe once a month. I always have but never thought much about it.  Looking back at our life events as a grown woman, I realize the day her father passed away defined the rest of our lives. I should have known better and been there for her. Maybe we would still be friends. Sometimes I feel like messaging her on facebook and telling her how sorry I am we drifted apart. I want her to know I miss her as a friend and as a person and I want her to know how important she was in my life and how much I loved her. And I guess I still do. I don't know if that would be appropriate. Would it?

Should I contact Emma? What do these dreams mean? "

In my last internship, our company issued a 24 hour web token from the backend for the app, which the app stored, and returned to authorize API calls. However, the user got logged out every 24 hours. How do apps like Facebook, Google+, etc. handle persistent authentication? I have watched a couple of node js tutorials about generating persistent sessions and auth cookies, but as far as I can tell that seems to be for just web pages and not mobile apps."

This is gonna be LONG so bear with me.

When I was in 5th grade (I was 10) I met this girl, Emma (she was in my grade), and we became instant best friends. She's a year older than me because I skipped a grade. She had a younger brother, Logan. Logan was one grade below us and my age. We used to hang out at her house all the time and Logan was nothing but her annoying little bother who always wanted to get in our business.

We had frequent sleepovers. We were truly inseparable and were always in the same group of friends. When we were sophomores in high school Emma started hanging out with different people from our usual old friends group. She started going out to parties and drinking and I was not into that. We were still friends but she knew I disapproved of the drinking so she started keeping a lot of things from me, but we were still best friends and I went over her house a lot. I started hanging out with her brother Logan and his friends soon became my friends (remember I'm his age).

In our senior year of high school Emma and I drifted. Even though we were still in the same classes, saw each other every day and had many friends in common, we just weren't into the same stuff anymore. I became really close with this new girl Ruby and Emma got jealous. She was friends with Ruby as well but me and Ruby were like the same person. Emma kept a lot of things from me, like losing her virginity to this guy I hated, Gavin. He was a jerk to her and they started going steady and that's when we stopped hanging out together.

Ruby and I became increasingly close to Logan, we hung out all the time. Emma hated seeing us together and got closer and closer to Gavin. Around the end of our Senior year I didn't even know what was going on in Emma's life anymore. I knew life at home was rough for her because of her alcoholic and abusive father. Her father had always been an asshole but things got a lot worse in our senior year. I knew that because Logan told me and I witnessed a lot of his abuse when I went over. He was the worst, honestly.

I did feel sad and frustrated because of how far apart Emma and I grew but I honestly didn't know how to fix things.

77vlqa,71,2017-10-21,I met up with Joe again... at the bar. [FM],slyglass,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/77vlqa/i_met_up_with_joe_again_at_the_bar_fm/,"Okay. I hope you guys remember me. If not, I posted about a little thing that happened to me on my last day on my internship. It's in my post history still.

A bunch of you kept telling me to text Joe and send him something sexy. I tried. I really tried. I dressed up all sexy and touched myself so many times (taking pictures each time) and was trying to work up the nerve to send them. But I didn't, because I'm super shy and always tried to send them AFTER cumming... probably should have just hit send while I was really horny and not thinking straight. 

I'm sure a fucking contradiction, because typing this all up and showing it to you guys seems so much easier and ALSO gets me going. But then again, you don't know me or know what I look like... you'd probably think I was an innoncent sweet shy girl if we met :)

But we come to last night, and I get a text from Joe:

""How's the freedom? Are you keeping busy?""

I texted back, ""It's terrible! I need something to keep me occupied or I just end up lying in bed all day.""

We texted back and forth a bit. Mostly just teasing and flirting, nothing overtly sexual. It got me really wet, because I kept thinking back to the stock room. 

Finally, he sends me this: ""We're heading out to ---pub--- tonight for drinks to celebrate at 7. Be there.""

My panties are soaked at this point. I know I'm getting fucked tonight. I thought about getting myself off right there, even started running my hands over my body. But I had to stop. I wanted to be pent up and horny for tonight. It would make the sex so much better.

I get to the bar at around 7:30. I made myself up as sexy as I could, without going overboard. There were other work people going to be there and I didn't want to come off like a slut. So, cute and well dressed on top, sexy outfit underneath.

Joe is there with some others. There's a spot on the bench next to him. I have no idea if that worked out because he said something, or whatever, but I was glad for it. The way the place is setup was that there was a long table with a bench on one side and chairs on the other — I sat on the edge of one side of the bench at the corner.

Everyone was really friendly and welcoming, which was great. I mean, I had known them all summer but still... just the intern girl.

Joe was really charming as usual. He bought me a drink without asking me (I was in the bathroom when the waitress came around) and that really turned me on. 

The night continued on like that, and people started filtering out. At one point, Joe put his hand on my leg and just left it there. And then, in a really slow and excrutiating way, he began to slide it up my thigh. Nobody could see because of how ridiculously big these tables were at the bar (seriously, I don't think larger people could have fit in against the bench.) 

He kept sliding up. I was squirming around. Trying to get his hand to move faster. I don't think I would have been like this if I wasn't a bit drunk, and really really fucking horny. But I was both those things.

He finally slid his hand up my skirt. It wasn't super short or anything, so it was a bit awkward. But he had his hand right next to my lips and he was fucking tickling me. It felt sooooo good.

Joe whispered to me, ""go to the bathroom and take your panties off. Taste yourself. Then give them to me.""

I nodded. Couldn't really speak anyways. I went to the bathroom, hiked up my skirt, slid down my leggings and pulled off my black panties. I had soaked them. You could really make out the wetness. I'm pretty sure he pulled the move out of Fifty Shades but I really didn't / don't care. It still got me going. I slid a finger into myself and then licked it. I was soooo sooo horny guys.

I went back and discretely handed him my panties. He went back to a hand on my leg. The night went on, we were both a bit drunk.

""I'm getting an uber."" He said. No choice, just telling me what was going to happen. Not that I had a problem.

Goodbyes were a bit awkward, because everyone knew what was happening. Well, the three people left when we left. But they were all friends, and didn't call us out on it. Just said 'see ya' and that was it.

So there we are, in the back of some dudes car. He's got his hand on my inner thigh and kept rubbing my lips. My skirt is hiked up but I'm behind the driver so he can't see. Joe is sitting in the middle.

We get to Joe's place. Step inside and he throws me against the wall. I'm throbbing wet at this point. He grabs my hands and raises them up above my head and holds them there with one hand. With the other, he starts rubbing my clit. 

I remember mumbling something about getting close. He still was holding my hands and kissing my neck. ""I want you to be a good girl and fucking cum for me, Andrea.""

That's the exact quote, which I remember semi-vividly, since I came on his hand right then and there. It was magnificent. He brought up his fingers and made me lick them clean.

I began stripping him. Taking off his blazer, and then unbuttoning his shirt. Undoing his belt. Sliding down his pants. His cock was already hard. I pulled it out and gripped it with one hand. Licked the tip with my tongue. Took him into my mouth and began blowing him. He was grunting with pleasure.

He grabbed my shoulders and pulled me up. I could taste his precum, and I think he was close. He lifted me by the ass and carried me into his bedroom. I could feel his dick press against my lips the entire way, but never getting inside me. I wanted it so badly.

He threw me on the bed.

""You're a bad girl, Andrea. You need to be punished.""

""Punish me then.""

He pulled off the rest of my clothes, except my skirt. My shirt and bra got thrown across the room. Then he threw me down on my back and held my hands. Reached down to the bottom of the bed and pulled out handcuffs. They were tethered to the bed or something. He cuffed me.

This was some straight up 50 shades stuff, and it REALLY got me wet. Again.

He began teasing me. Licking me, biting me, kissing me. All over. Especially the neck and collarbone, which I really like. He pinched my nipples and twisted them. Keep going down. Went to my thighs, and then began licking upwards... 

""Beg me,"" he said.

""Please. Please fuck me."" I don't even really remember saying that, but I'm pretty sure I did.

He kept teasing. Never quite licking my lips or clit. I just kept repeating that I wanted him to fuck me.

When he finally did, he started so fucking slow. Sliding all the way in.... and then back out... back in... It was really really feeling good, but I wanted him to fuck me hard and fast. I think I said so. Because he started thrusting faster and faster. Slid a hand up to my tits and then my neck. He tightened. Whispered in my ear that I was a dirty little slut. As he was fucking, he was doing it in a way that his abdomen or something was rubbing up against me clit. I came again at that point, telling him over and over that I was his dirty little girl.

He pulled out and came all over my face. I was still handcuffed to the bed. I licked up whatever I could as he untied me. Then he helped me clean up. We showered together and I blew him in the shower. He came down my throat.

After that we passed out in the bed and the next morning was only slightly awkward over coffee and breakfast and now we're here at today, Saturday. I'm pretty sleepy and a bit hungover but very, very, satisfied."

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 2.

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid. This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."

77wuuh,5,2017-10-21,Leaving my school: How to tell children? (Age 5/6) other iffy questions,blackkitteycat,ECEProfessionals,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECEProfessionals/comments/77wuuh/leaving_my_school_how_to_tell_children_age_56/,"Hi, I work as an assistant kindergarten teacher at a private daycare. My job title is assistant, but I am their sole teacher from 12 PM to 6:30 PM everyday. I have the same duties as a lead, but since i'm not certified I don't have the job title.


Basically, I will be leaving my school in March. I am currently a sophomore in college and will be transferring colleges across the country. I also got an amazing internship in my field of study(marine biology) that pays double what i'm making now, which is why i'm leaving in March. 


I have a few issues I would appreciate your advice on...

1. First off, how would I tell my students? How soon should I tell them? 

2. To bounce off of that, does anyone know of any good picture books that deal with change? We have a 20 minute circle time after lunch and I was going to tell them then. I think a book would be a good way to ease into the subject.


3. Does anyone have any ideas for creating something I can bring to my new apartment? My original idea was to take a picture of all of us and have all the students sign and hang it up, but I would have to get written permission from all the parents to take a picture and keep it. Does anyone have any similar ideas? 


4. This is my big question. I have my apartment rented starting on March 1st. I wasn't planning on leaving until around March 17th, because I start my internship the 20th. However, the more I think about it, the more I want to leave earlier just so I can get used to the area, meet up with some friends that live nearby, and just get settled in before starting my full time internship.

So my new plan was to leave March 10th. However, my school has their spring break from March 12th - 16th. They run a full day camp and it's always been super chaotic and short staffed. I would feel awful leaving them without a teacher for this. I also don't want it to be seen as me bailing right before the camp starts. My supervisor and director know i'm planning on leaving sometime in the spring, but we haven't discussed any official dates with each other. 


If anyone has any advice for these situations, it's much appreciated!!"

I applied to the Engineering program specifically the Computer Engineering program. I also applied at Purdue but would rather attend IUPUI because I prefer IUPUI's campus and location to Purdue's. How is the computer engineering program at IUPUI? How is the job placement here and the chance of landing an internship? I would be entering with a bunch of AP and dual credits (in-state) so it would be possible to finish within four years or shorter? THANKS

*Rick sat in his office looking over the newly acquired tape, the only hint of what it was being a label that read “Deltaflop-Q” in a rather unremarkable black lettering.That was all he really had to go off from the case, no hint to what was on the tape, no artwork on the label, not even the format of the tape was any help. As far as he could find, “Deltaflop-Q” was some sort of home video format that bombed harder than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. It was produced for only two weeks in the 70s before being discontinued; the only majorly released publication on the format being a special episode of some sort of Sesame Street knock off. Worse yet, he couldn’t even find a system to play the tape on. Stardust Video had all of theirs either stolen or rented out so they couldn’t spare any.*

 *Rick sat back in his chair, he needed to stop and take some time to think this through. He scrambled through his desk drawer for a pack of cigarettes, a smoke here and there tended to help. There just had to be more, this couldn’t be as dead of an end as it seemed. Then, suddenly, it hit him. That’s it! If some of the playback devices were rented out then surely Stardust Video would have records of who rented them! Whipping out his phone, Rick called down to the video store requesting that Charlie email him a list of all the rentals of Deltaflop players in the past week. About 20 minutes later, Rick had a comprehensive list of everyone who had rented a Deltaflop player printed out. He sat down, lighting a cigarette and pouring himself a drink, before looking through the list of potential suspects.*

*Most of the list turned out to be impossible to track, from the looks of it most people wanted to have their interns run errands for them rather than getting the player themselves. But it wasn’t completely fruitless; in all the intern ID numbers a few names peppered the list that could help him crack this case wide open.*

 *John Abelmann, one of Sector 9’s directors, had rented out a player in the past week along with a rather unsavory video to accompany it.*

*Gary Ham. one of the facility’s radio operator’s and self proclaimed ladies man. He’d rented out a player and a copy of “Guitar made easy”. Guess after playing other people’s work for so long Gary wanted to make some of his own.*

*Andrea Boorstin. One of the facility’s many janitors, she had rented out solely a player and no accompanying tapes. That was more than a little odd.*

*Connor Millet. An engineer in Sector 11, Connor had rented out two Deltaflop players. Maybe he was trying to make his own or maybe he just wanted to watch two movies on two separate televisions.*


*Last, but certainly not least, was Dave Dunbar. A part time volunteer at the infirmary and a full time creep if he was even half as weird as Izzy said he was. He’d rented out a Deltaflop player and too many tapes to even list. He was certainly high on the list.*

*After looking over each suspect he quickly took the time to whip up a profile for each of them, pinning the profiles to a bulletin board. This seemed like more than was possible in a day for just him and Danny. Maybe taking Charlie’s advice on getting some more people to help wouldn’t be the worst idea. Though could he really trust a bunch of random people from the halls to do a detective’s work? After mulling over the decision for a bit he came to the wise conclusion of “fuck it” and decided it couldn’t hurt too much to get some civvies on the case.* 

*With that he gathered up all the suspect profiles and made his way to the nearest announcement booth.*

*The intercom clicked on.*

“Attention all personnel, have you’ve ever had any desire to be a detective or at least help one do his job **and** get paid for it? Well today is your lucky day. Just come on down to Sector Five, office A113 and you can learn about how you can lend a hand to crack open a major case. We’re paying one thousand credits to those that show up and can provide crucial assistance. Thank you for your attention.”
*There. If the thought of justice didn’t bring people in, then the promise of cold hard cash surely would.*


((For anyone following this arc, I'm sorry it took this long to get a second part out. A lot of stuff for work and school came up and those took priority.))"
77yb29,1,2017-10-22,Big 4 internship (winter) vs big 4 internship (summer),PINKMONKEY37,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/77yb29/big_4_internship_winter_vs_big_4_internship_summer/,"I have a bit of a conundrum: 

Big 4 offered me a winter tax internship, acceptance due in 2 weeks.

ANOTHER BIG 4 (!) offered 3rd office visit/interview (tax summer internship) at another location (big midwest region) interview in 3 weeks. 

Questions:

How can I take advantage of this without hurting my prospects w/ both big 4 in the future?

Can I do the first with no acceptance of a ft offer in case one is offered?

Second internship: do I tell them about the first if asked in the interview, how do I approach trying to do both without burning bridges?

Should I talk to my career counselor about this? It feels like this may be looked down upon and they may be the gatekeeper with the school in mind more than the students... 

All questions contingent on 3rd interview going well, which I hope does, but what do I do until then? My thought is to ask for a 2 week extension on first offer..."
77yr9c,5,2017-10-22,"Six months ago I moved across the country for a job. I hate the job, the city and I want to leave.",Heyhowareya123,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/77yr9c/six_months_ago_i_moved_across_the_country_for_a/,"I'll try to make this short but basically I finished grad school and started applying to jobs. I signed on the first thing I was offered and my SO and I packed our bags. She has a bachelor's and has been in an out of precarious employment while I work an ok-salaried job in my field.

My job is 85% writing emails and dealing with whiney people. It honestly isn't too terrible but I think it's mostly tolerable because it isn't too stressful.

I had lived in this city once before and had a bad experience, so I was hesitant to move back here. I did so because my SO has family here. Basically I've completely lost contact with all my friends. I had a great social circle where I was living before.

I have one friend who happens to live here who I'd been hanging out with quite a bit. I'd also met some of his friends through him. I realized I was always the one initiating and so I stopped texting him so much and I don't see him much anymore.

For a while I didn't vibe very well with my coworkers - they're all super gregarious, loud and extroverted and so I often felt out of place. I tried my best to find common ground and I'd thought I was doing ok. I'd also been spending a bit of time with some friends who were here over the summer for internships.

Anyway, the other day at lunch we started talking about dressing up for halloween and one of my coworkers asked what I wanted to be. My other coworker interjected saying ""don't you have to actually go and do something to dress up for Halloween?"". It created this super awkward silence and another coworker said ""well you can dress up for Halloween with your cat.."" Obviously the implication was that I don't have any friends and that I'm a loser. I was kind of hurt by this since I'd thought this coworker as a potential friend and I'd seen him outside of work a few times. Anyway since then I've felt pretty uncomfortable at work and I've kind of resigned caring about this job.'

My SO's family wants to see us constantly and it's not good for my mental health, and I'm finding being the ""supporter"" in the the relationship stressful. I don't care for the job and I just feel uncomfortable around my coworkers who I guess see me as a loser. If I quit the job my resume will look terrible and I'll also have to deal with the mess from the lease I'm stuck in. I also have no jobs lined up back home. At the same time, my mental health is really deteriorating here.

TL;DR Moved across the country for a job, I don't get along with my coworkers, have no friends, feel lonely, and basically hate my life"

I will soon have an interview that includes an Excel skill-gauging segment. It's only for an internship and I was explicitly told that there is no pressure as it will simply evaluate my familiarity with the software. 


But I'm curious - for those of you that were asked about Excel skills, what were you tested on? I can imagine that matching, vlookups, indexes, pivot tables, sort&amp;filter, VBA etc. are highly important."

780t1k,31,2017-10-22,A few takeaways from Childbirth Class,Oneperfectdayx,January2018Bumpers,https://www.reddit.com/r/January2018Bumpers/comments/780t1k/a_few_takeaways_from_childbirth_class/,"So we had our 8-hour childbirth class yesterday. The hospital I'm delivering at only offers it once a month (at the end of the month) and with the holidays coming up I wanted to go ahead and get it done. We have our breastfeeding class on Tuesday. 

After recovering from the shock of the videos (so many 1980's pubic bushes) there was some really helpful information!

Visitors/People in the room: The hospital has a policy that only 3 people can be in the room during labor/delivery, and 1 if you have a c-section. They then only allow 4 people *at a time* to visit mom/baby. I didn't see a problem with this set-up but one girl started CRYING when she heard only 3 people could be in the room for delivery (I'm sorry, but after watching those videos who in the world do you want in there watching that!?!!) so the nurse went into better detail. Basically she said that with the size of the room combined with the NECESSARY people in there it becomes a nightmare to have more than 3. She explained that there will be the doctor, the nurse, 1-2 scrub nurses running in-and-out, potentially the anesthesiologist. If there's any risk involved then the NICU will send a doctor and 2 nurses.  Not to mention if you give the ok for an intern, resident, or shadow. I never intended to have anyone else but my husband in there and my family agrees, but I think after hearing that explanation I'm better equipped to handle a confrontation should it occur. Hopefully some of you dealing with MILs can use that information!
The nurse also said that they will 100% stand behind mom, so if they have to tell someone that it's 'policy' that no one else is in the room (or whatever demands you have, even if it's not policy) they will. This may be something to talk to your doctor/nurse beforehand so they can shut it down quickly if any family members try to push through!

Birth Plan: There has been so much discussion on this, and I've had the mentality of 'whatever the doctor thinks is best for me and baby, and drugs'. But after the class I see why a birth plan of some kind is important, and how beneficial it can be to share the birth plan with your doctor. This helps understand more of how they do things and will prepare you a little more. For example, if your plan is no epidural it's a good idea to find out your doctor's take on epidurals and when their 'cut-off' time is for one. That way if you're at 8cm screaming for one and the doctor says 'none after 7cm' you'll be less likely to punch her in the face. 

They had us do an exercise with flash cards to come up with a mini birth plan. Moms went first and then dads went through and made any changes they had. This really allowed for an opportunity to discuss everything with my husband. Not only did it ensure we were on the same page, but for things that we didn't agree on (epidurals for example) I was able to make my case so if the time comes I think he'll be better equipped to fight for what I want, and no go blindly by what the doctors/nurses say. 

Basically what we did was pick a side of the flash card (like epidural/no epidural) and then we went through and ranked all the cards by importance. I will try to include a photo but the flash cards were;
Short Labor/Long Labor - Epidural/No Epidural - Episiotomy/No Episiotomy - Pain Medication/No Pain Medication - C-Section/No C-Section - Forcep or Vacuum/No Forceps or Vacuum - Walk during labor/Stay in bed during labor - IV/ No IV (basically do you want an IV drip providing liquids or would you prefer to be free of the IV line). Obviously the same principle can be applied to anything else you may want to add in your birth plan.

So for example I picked No C-Section but I ranked it lower than No forceps or vacuum so if the time comes I would prefer to go into a c-section than have the doctor use those tools to 'force' the baby out. 

If you're having trouble deciding on any of the options they gave us to think of the Benefits, Risks, Alternatives, and Intuition (what does your gut tell you) of each item. They also said to reevaluate these things during labor if something comes up, and don't be afraid to ask for time to think about it (they'll let you know if there is no time!). 

Epidural: Speaking of the epidural. We had a speaker come in from the hospital who walked us through the entire process and shed some light. First of all, he said the latest he can give an epidural is when the baby is crying. Basically it's never too late to get one (though if you wait too long it may not kick in before the baby is born). I thought this was important to note in case you have a doctor that doesn't mimic those sentiments.  He also said the ideal time to get one is between 5cm and 7cm. The overall thought was that there wasn't much science behind an epidural causing long labor (from him and the other teachers), obviously that is controversial but I thought it was interesting to point out. 

There was also a lot of information on pain management, the various drugs they use (so you can do some research),  risk factors, signs and symptoms to keep an eye on, what to pack in the labor bag etc. It all seemed pretty generic but if anyone has any specific questions/topics I'll be happy to let you know what was discussed and give you any resources I may have!

The nurse also directed us to americanpregnancy.org for more resources (and a downloadable birth plan)!

Whew, sorry that was so long!!

Edit: I'm in Midwest/South US. The hospital is a private, non-teaching Catholic hospital that is ""baby focused"" (what they called it). They don't have a nursery so baby stays in our room, they don't allow visitors in the first hour for bonding, and they delay cord cutting. "
78117p,56,2017-10-22,"Six months ago I moved across the country for a job. I hate the job, the city and I want to leave.",Heyhowareya123,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/78117p/six_months_ago_i_moved_across_the_country_for_a/,"I'll try to make this short but basically I finished grad school and started applying to jobs. I signed on the first thing I was offered and my SO and I packed our bags. She has a bachelor's and has been in an out of precarious employment while I work an ok-salaried job in my field.
My job is 85% writing emails and dealing with whiney people. It honestly isn't too terrible but I think it's mostly tolerable because it isn't too stressful.

I had lived in this city once before and had a bad experience, so I was hesitant to move back here. I did so because my SO has family here. Basically I've completely lost contact with all my friends. I had a great social circle where I was living before.

I have one friend who happens to live here who I'd been hanging out with quite a bit. I'd also met some of his friends through him. I realized I was always the one initiating and so I stopped texting him so much and I don't see him much anymore.

For a while I didn't vibe very well with my coworkers - they're all super gregarious, loud and extroverted and so I often felt out of place. I tried my best to find common ground and I'd thought I was doing ok. I'd also been spending a bit of time with some friends who were here over the summer for internships.

Anyway, the other day at lunch we started talking about dressing up for halloween and one of my coworkers asked what I wanted to be. My other coworker interjected saying ""don't you have to actually go and do something to dress up for Halloween?"". It created this super awkward silence and another coworker said ""well you can dress up for Halloween with your cat.."" Obviously the implication was that I don't have any friends and that I'm a loser. I was kind of hurt by this since I'd thought this coworker as a potential friend and I'd seen him outside of work a few times. Anyway since then I've felt pretty uncomfortable at work and I've kind of resigned caring about this job.'

My SO's family wants to see us constantly and it's not good for my mental health, and I'm finding being the ""supporter"" in the the relationship stressful. I don't care for the job and I just feel uncomfortable around my coworkers who I guess see me as a loser. If I quit the job my resume will look terrible and I'll also have to deal with the mess from the lease I'm stuck in. I also have no jobs lined up back home. At the same time, my mental health is really deteriorating here.

TL;DR Moved across the country for a job, I don't get along with my coworkers, have no friends, feel lonely, and basically hate my life"

I did an internship with them in their private wealth department, and most of my work since starting full time has been private wealth.

I was recently given the option to be staffed on one of 4 areas of their BTS department, as follows: 1) Private Wealth, 2) Investment Management, 3) Large Corporations, 4) Real Estate.

For the most part, I have found private wealth to be not as challenging as I would like, and was hoping to get some advice on which of the other 3 options I should choose that would provide for the most challenge/critical thinking, and the best exit opportunities come promotion to senior.

Does anyone have experience in these areas that could help me get a better idea of what I would be getting into?"
782tpb,4,2017-10-22,Share your opinions about the Swans!,Benowar1,swanseacity,https://www.reddit.com/r/swanseacity/comments/782tpb/share_your_opinions_about_the_swans/,"Hello everyone,

By posting and commenting on subs for football, I know that you have opinions for the entire footballing community. If you ever had a desire to put those ideas out to a wider audience, I have an opportunity you may be interested in.

Offside Football is a new website completely run by football fans who enjoy writing about their favorite teams as a hobby. The majority of writers, hailing from various countries, are Premier League or MLS fans. However, coverage of any team is welcome. Being on Swansea City's sub, I presume you have a passion for the Swans especially. After winning just two games so far, I know that you have an opinion to share with other Premier League and world football fans regarding Swansea's performance.

We write purely for enjoyment, and no one, not even the owner, receives any sort of payment. This is a fun way to bring our fandom for our respective teams to the next level, and it should not be taken as a full time journalism job. However, in the past, some of our writers have earned internship credits for their universities. Others have also received press passes for games at all levels, from local English non-league teams to the MLS.

Each piece has the potential to reach thousands of readers, depending on the topic. We go beyond typical match reviews and focus on in-depth analysis of issues and changes, which can be on the scale of individual players all the way up to FIFA and UEFA leadership.

If you are interested in this opportunity, you can message me directly. For an example of our writing, you can check out this link. We currently have no writers committed to Swansea. However, one of our Man City authors wrote up this brief on the Swans shirt sponsor Letou. http://www.off-side.co.uk/letou-swansea-citys-new-shirt-sponsor

Lastly, part of being a part of the football community means that we support local teams, and we are proud to sponsor and cover different non-league sides across England. We also have relationships with lower divisions in the US, including the NASL. All writers are encouraged to get involved with their local team and help support footballers of all levels.

Thank you for your time!"

You get all dolled up, hair up in a tight bun, thick-rimmed glasses, a tight well-cut suit jacket and pencil skirt perfectly designed to both show off your curves and present a professional faced, and then instead of working with any of the partners in the firm they stick you in a small room with some jumped up ganger with delusions of grandeur as a client and an absentee first-year lawyer as a supervisor. 

Sure they had done some, I pause in my internal rant to check through the list of potential charges, holy shit, okay all of the crimes, and running one of the largest gangs in the city was kind of cool in its own right, but really how am I supposed to make a good impression on my higher-ups if none of them are working on this case with me? Not that this is even a case, just the firm you have on retainer touching base about any potential litigation we may have to prepare for … and people wonder why lawyers are seen as the bad guys …

Just to look professional I skim through the papers in front of me again, shuffling them a little bit, before looking up at you, my blue eyes carefully considering your face across the desk.

“So what can we do for you today?” I’m pretty sure I got the right amount of chipper in my tone to hide some of the boredom but … you don’t look exactly fooled. 

_______________________________________________
So this idea is a little half-formed after an evening enjoying some retro gaming with Saint Rows 2 (is that old enough to be retro now?). The general idea is that a law student sort of riding out her summer internship meets the leader of one of the larger gangs in the city and they eventually corrupt her from prim and proper law student to tattooed gang slut.

I’m open to any kinks where I don’t have to be dominant, but the one I’m insisting on including is some kind of -ification or corruption (slutification, bimbofication, ect.). 

I’m also more than happy to flesh this out before starting or just jumping in. Special attention will be given to females or futa but I’m open for business to anyone this afternoon.

Anyway, hope to hear from you pervs soon,

7836yd,9,2017-10-22,"Wrote on Friday and Scored Better than I expected! Q168, V162",758759754,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/7836yd/wrote_on_friday_and_scored_better_than_i_expected/,"First off, big thanks to r/GRE, r/GradSchool, /r/GREhelp, and /r/gradadmissions. Great resources, suggestions, and community for me over the last few weeks. If you have any questions at all, let me know in a comment or PM! I'd love to give you all the help I can! I'm quickly writing this up while avoiding studying for a midterm but I may come back and update this later. I will be rewriting on November 20th, 2017.

Also, I will be **selling my Magoosh account** on November 20th which expires March 8th, 2018.

**My Background**

I come from a BSc Honors in Computing Science in Canada, looking to go into a Computer Science Master's program in the US. I'd never say I was a really math-y person, especially compared to some people in my department. Certainly better at math than most people, but soon as I see calculus, tons of Greek letters, etc. I get a little weary. Used to do lots of High School math contests and the material is similar, though I lost it over the years. I'd like to think I am a better writer than most people in my department, but any Arts student would probably get the better of me. 

**My Scores**

Test | Quantitative | Verbal
:-:|:-:|:-:
Magoosh GRE Online Practice Questions | 158-163 (75%) | 155-160 (68%)
2017-10-09 Magoosh Practice Test | 158 | N/A
2017-10-12 Magoosh Practice Test | 162 | N/A
2017-10-13 Magoosh Practice Test | N/A | 157
2017-10-15 ETS Power Prep Test #1 | 167 | 159
2017-10-17 Magoosh Practice Test | 165 | 161
**2017-10-20 GRE General Test** | 168 | 162

Here are all of my estimated and official scores from my various practice materials and the actual Exam. 

*  The Magoosh practices are just from their pool of quantitative and verbal questions. The practice exams draw from their regular question pool so it's just a timed, sectioned version of doing the questions on the front page. The practice tests were all estimating a bit low and that is what I read around the internet. My overall estimation from them was a bit low because I was getting more questions wrong a month ago and never reset, so my average got dragged down from where I'm at now.
* ETS Power Prep I did between classes one day. I never actually wrote the GRE start to finish until my exam day. That is something I did underestimate a bit. This did seem to give a fairly good estimate of my scores, especially quant.

**My Prep**

* Magoosh
  * Followed what most people on r/GRE do and bought Magoosh. I honestly believe that was the difference between doing well and terrible. It costs US$149 but that was worth every dollar and I hope to sell the account and get at least half back. If you're unsure where to start studying, get Magoosh. I would recommend them for SAT, etc and plan to buy one for my younger sister who is in High School. 
  * I'd say the big benefit is that the content was interactive. I hate textbooks and knew I wouldn't work through the 5lb Book. Paying for a tutor or class is also a complete waste. Magoosh would be as good, if not far better, way cheaper, and your own pace. I loved being able to [speed up the videos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html5-video-speed-control/ejdipbccipeloijefbkiakckfhdbgocg?hl=en), especially chapters I knew well or explanations that were too slow. 
  * Going through all the videos took way more time than I ever thought, especially if you actually try the examples, experiment, etc but I think that's what made it stick in my head. I used the notes feature at the end of videos and reviewed that before the exam. I really liked the end of video summaries but wish I could have JUST the summaries available to me to review, instead of having to click to the end of the video by hand. The [Magoosh Math Formula eBook](https://magoosh.com/gre/2016/gre-math-formula-ebook/#_ga=2.127023108.86354106.1506789947-1349196364.1504080674) was a good compromise. Printed it, and then when reviewing, added missing stuff from videos to the book by hand.
  * Used the Magoosh GMAT/GRE Math app on my phone quite a bit. Wish I had gone through it more when I had extra time between class or whatever, but it's good for reinforcing concepts on the go. Web app works too.
  * Started using their two vocabulary builder apps but preferred Vocabulary.com as I got closer to the exam. 
* Vocabulary.com GRE High Frequency Words
  * One of the Magoosh Verbal videos links to [their article about vocab studying](https://magoosh.com/gre/2016/gre-word-lists/). The short of it, use Magoosh's app or Vocabulary.com. Don't memorize word lists, make it interactive. If I had started earlier, I would have gotten better at using them naturally. Low on time, so I mostly just hit the [Vocabulary.com Practice](https://magoosh.com/gre/2016/gre-word-lists/). I started on the Magoosh one but didn't enjoy the app or content as much. Liked the Vocabulary.com explanations, ease of use, etc better. And I saw more of the Vocabulary.com words on the exam. It's also shorter and I knew I had little time, so I wanted to most concentrated list.
* ETS
  * When I purchased my exams, I also took all the free exams they offered. It may be worth it to pay for the other ones, but no point in purchasing until you exhaust the free ones. I had little prep time, but if you prepped 3+ months, you may benefit from this.

**Test Day**

I'll be honest, I broke like every rule of test day out there. I crammed a review in the night before. Took my notes to the exam center and sat in the hallway reviewing. Stayed up till 1AM night before. Didn't visit the center in advance. Never wrote a full practice exam until test day. 

Showed up about 30-45 minutes early. Thought we all had to start exactly at 12:30 but really I just had to start before that time. Check in process is weird. You have to hand copy a paragraph declaration you are you and not cheating. Ever time you go in and out, they check ankles, wrists, behind your glasses, pockets, and metal detector you. My place they provided like industrial ear muff covers for noise. Typical crappy Dell keyboard for the essay was nothing like my mechanical keyboard. Only got two pencils and a 7 sides of scrap paper. You could ask for more whenever but then you surrender the old pack. Worried I might need to sharpen pencil but was fine. 

Sounds dumb, but I noticed a score increase when I pre-divided my scrap paper for Quant sections. One line down the middle, 4 lines across, front and back for each section. I believe the reason is that I could easily go back to questions that I marked with a star or two stars or a squiggly depending on how they went. Also gave me room to work and not make copying mistakes. I got 3 Quants, so the one I did crappy on was probably experimental haha.

I'd say that on test day, those were the hardest questions I ever faced, more so for Quant. At home, on Magoosh or ETS, I would finish each section with 5 minutes to spare and only see 2-3 that made me second guess. On the real exam, I would have 2 left I hadn't started and 3 I was uncertain of and 5 minutes on the clock. Probably just the nerves and my lack of following the recommended prep may be the cause. I thought I did terrible (say 156Q and 152V) for this reason, but was happily surprised in the end.

AWA went really well compared to my practice. I only ever tried one each of Issue and Argument. Those sucked. I barely got down 250 words and were lacking in depth. Exam day it came together thankfully. I don't think it's worth it to ""study"" the hundreds of example questions and topics. But, you should write more and get comfortable with acting in that situation with pressure.

**Things I Wish I Knew Beforehand**

* Know Your 4 Schools for Test Day to Send for Free
  * At the end of the exam, you can either decline or accept the scores. You do not see the estimates unless you accept. After that, you have the option to send to 4 schools for free. I suppose you could not send to any at this point if you didn't do well and they'd never know. I cannot think of (nor did I find online) any reason to decline the scores. I had thought that I could pick my 4 free schools at home after in a few days. You need to pick right then and there.
  * Stemming off this, I had an idea of my schools but did not have their codes. You can search, but I did have trouble finding one of mine. I was the last person in the room still, and the test center guy was nice enough to let me go use my phone and Google it. Most schools were crystal clear. Others there would be 3+ entries and then after that you need to pick department code. 
  * This [school list](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_aidi_fellowships.pdf) and [this department](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/dept_major_field_codes.pdf) list may be of use, though check with your actual program. 

* 4+ Hours is Long!
  * I never wrote the whole thing straight. I'd break up the practice tests in between classes, etc. I finished my Argument Essay early and had to run to the bathroom. Knew it would effect my next sections. Opt'd for Caffeine + L-Theanine over coffee but still had to go.

* Book you Exam in Advance!
  * I had bought Magoosh back in September after promising I'd study over summer while I was on internship. Didn't happen. Then I delayed picking an exam date. When I had looked in September, the next few months had 4+ days/week available. No worries. Then I looked early October, over half were gone!
  * The weird part is that one time, everything in October disappeared. Then next day it was back. Very inconsistent. Pick an exam day at least a month in advance. Remember you need 21 days between rewrites and scores take up to 15 business days to send to a University. Some may take unofficial screenshots, but others won't.

783bw7,1,2017-10-22,[FxM] Japanese Mafia Romance,keitoishihara,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/783bw7/fxm_japanese_mafia_romance/,"Hi there! My name is Kate, and I'm seeking a specific roleplay. 

~Plot~

My OC works has just been hired in as an intern for a large corporation in Tokyo, Japan. She is struggling to pay rent, and barely has enough to feed herself. The CEO of the corporation (your OC), notices my OC's attitudes are changing, and she seems to be in a very rough situation. Your OC takes a liking to her, and decides to make a deal with my character: he will help her through all of her financial stress - so long as she agrees to become his 'pet'. Anything he desires, she must give him. Gradually, our characters grow on each other and begin to fall in love, though neither would like to admit it.

However, there's a giant secret that your character keeps. He is the boss of a well-known and feared mafia of Tokyo, creating a ring of underground crimes daily. Obviously, my character eventually gets forced into the violence, and it is then that our characters become close romantically, and your character begins protecting mine with his life. 

I will introduce my OC once you've messaged me, and I expect you to do the same. If you message me with just ""hey"", or ""rp"", you'll be blocked! Sorry! I also only expect experienced partners who know what they're doing. I ask that you play in 3rd person, paragraph form.

~Requirements/Rules~

1) Obviously, I ask that you be over 18. There will be many adult themes included in our writing.

2) I only want experienced partners, please -- someone who can write more than a paragraph.

3) Please be able to write in 3rd person, present tense.

4) Please have a detailed description of your muse (OC) ready to go.

5)Please also have a list of kinks and limits.

6) Lastly, please do not abandon the conversation without notice. I absolutely despise that. Of course, I'll understand emergencies.

We can further discuss storyline details (location, world building, etc.) once you've messaged me.

783w3v,19,2017-10-22,How do I ask my real life parent for money?,catwithaglasseye,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/783w3v/how_do_i_ask_my_real_life_parent_for_money/,"Hi internetparents,

Over this past weekend my laptop died. How do I ask my real dad for money? I think he’ll lend me money I just need a good strategy. 

Edit: wanted to add on. For further clarification just in case. 

Real dad has always been in my life. I live with him. He pays for my groceries and doesn’t charge me rent and pays for my textbooks under the condition I keep my job and keep good grades. (A’s and B’s this year + an internship). I am heavily burdened with needed a new computer and my credit is shit. So I would have to have help to be able to afford the computer I’d need. I need ideas to propose to him on how I’ll pay him back. I already looked into plasma donation and think I am eligible to donate and can make an additional 200/month that I would be willing to put towards the monthly payback fee for the laptop. But I need other proposal techniques too. The best ideas that will get him to help me. I know he has the money as well as the credit lines to help me but he is very much your typical dad “work for it to earn it yourself”. Not that I disagree with that. But if I’m going to ask him for roughly $1500 I need ideas on what else to add some umpf to my proposal. 

On top of donating plasma, I’ve also thought of: 

-offering him half my tax return. (Will probably equal about $300 I could give him as said half) 

-asking as an advance for any Christmas, birthday, or graduation gifts he would have spent on. (I have a Christmas birthday so two for one?) 

-will set up a payment schedule. As my hours at work fluculate I will be able to give him *at minimum* $70 a month. This would be the monthly finance rate Apple offers people with not shit credit. Obviously if I can donate plasma and other stuff I could give him more but that is the minimum. 

I just haven’t really had to ask him for a lot of money all at once before and I don’t know how to approach it. "

I graduated about 2 years ago and moved to San Antonio, eager to start my career in the non profit world. I have been trying to volunteer/intern with any and all non profits and I am getting quite the run around here. I don't know if its because I have a Master's in Public Administration, or if its just the town itself, but I can't seem to volunteer, and when I do, its in a position where I am not really utilized. An example of this was a non profit that was looking for a volunteer for admin support, and then when i called, said that i could stock the pantry :/.  I was told that with my MPA, I should be living and working in Austin and not San Antonio. Would it be better for me career wise to try to volunteer/intern/get a job in Austin?

But I'm wondering what the transition could look like as an internal move with a degree. I know a lot of people have trouble doing that but maybe it's cause they don't have degrees? I'm almost done with mine and I have some internship experience as well. Hopefully it won't be too hard for me to land a job outside of Apple but I'd really love to work at the corporate level.

There were a whole bunch of things leading up to it, but once I was out I didn’t withdraw from school for the semester and I desperately wish I had. I wasted time and money by then not leaving my room and failing all of my classes and just really mucking everything up. 

My summer was better, I had an internship in which I liked the job but hated my coworkers. I was still able to get up and go in the morning, though, I think I only had a few sick days. 

Now I’m back at school and I’m having panic attacks when I wake up again. They’re so bad that it’s all I can do to curl up and cry into my pillow, I am literally terrified of leaving my bed. This makes me terrified to sleep because I don’t want to wake up and not be able to leave. 

I’m on academic probation and I’m a senior, and I’m still allowed to walk with my grad class in May but would need to take an extra semester (next fall) to actually complete my degree. I’m in a language class that is unfortunately in the mornings and I’ve missed a lot of it because I can’t leave my room, and I’m definitely at he point where I’m going to fail it, which I only realized today that due to my probation will result in my loss of fin aid, and I currently have a full ride and can’t afford to not have the fin aid. 

I’m sorry this is so rambling I just feel like I’ve sunk too deep and nobody knows and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not suicidal, I just want to sit in a blank room by myself and sleep forever I hate how anxious I am all the time.

It's a miracle that I've been able to get this far in academics (Junior year) while knowing only the basics. I've been studying and studying, watching videos, taking notes, but I haven't been applying it. It's like I've learned how to build a bicycle but not how to ride one. I should  be applying for internships or doing hackathons or making side projects...but here I am, too scared to do anything but study slowly on my own. 


The worst part is I will be transferring to another university and the new one is more rigorous than the previous. I breezed by with As/Bs in Intro 1 and 2 and systems level programming somehow but I'm 99% sure that was pure luck and I got a lenient TA. I doubt I will be as lucky at my next university. So yes, I need to step it up...but I'm incredibly terrified man. 


I'm at the stage where I wish I had a mentor but I'm scared of people looking at my code and essentially calling it shit. I've never gone to the tutoring centor or asked my professor for help out of fear. And I'd rather be dead than ask my peers for input. Discord and subreddits are okay for help but I use it very sparcely (various reasons). It seems like my fear of being judged just keeps getting in the way of everything socially and academically. I've been trying to change that but I keep ending up back where I started. It's like this vicious cycle of self hate and uselessness. 


Sometimes I stay awake at night, at times like this, just thinking about how I'm making a bad choice by transferring, how I picked the wrong major, and how I'm going to end up flunking out of college or someshit. If that ever happened though, I'd seriously consider putting myself down. 


In the end, I usually hug my dog and it calms me down a bit. 


I think programming is really cool. But this anxious feeling makes it impossible to enjoy. Instead of being excited on working on something, I feel dread and fear that I won't be able to accomplish it. Somewhere deep inside I probably know that I'm not smart enough to be a software engineer. And everyone knows it too. And I know I'm not the sharpest person. And I'm not an ideal programmer...but I really want to be good at it. I'm really at a loss. Just...I don't know man. :("

Im currently persuing B.A in PolSci from a state university. I have a 3.9 GPA and so far love the field.

I started doing IT as a side job to get me through school and eventually rose to manager level making almost 90k at 22 years old. This is a job I have since left due to the extreme stressful environment and my want to focus in school.

My resume is obviously odd, given that I want to go down the PoliSci route, but have been involved in IT for almost 6 years now. 

What things can I do to strengthen my resume? Are congressional internships hard to get? Can I assist PHD students in their PoliSci research?

7883up,1,2017-10-23,(FR) I am about 22k€ in debt. I'm trying to pay them monthly but what's left isn't enough to live so I keep getting more loans. I need help to organize myself.,sego94,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7883up/fr_i_am_about_22k_in_debt_im_trying_to_pay_them/,"Hi !

I've been in debt since about 10 years (I'm now 29 years old). I've tried to pay them back as much as I could but as of now I realize I can't afford my lifestyle with what's left after my monthly fees. Is there anyone here who could help me budget things so that I can get clean as soon as possible ?

Here are all the info you might need (hopefully) :

1/ Monthly expenses :

* Rent : 635€
* Health insurance : 22,13€
* Internet bill : 17,88€
* Phone plan (including Spotify subscription) : 28€
* Car and home insurance : 98,83€
* Electronical devices insurance : 9,90€
* Gym membership: 29,90€
* Netflix subscription : 8€
* Autolib subscription (needed to rent a car in Paris) : 10€
* Electricity bill : 2€ (I have a discount through my work)
* Bank charges : 16,30€ (cost of my Visa Premier) (note : most of my loans have been contracted with this bank so I'm contractually forced to keep my main account into this bank until I pay my debts. I'm not forced to have a Visa Premier though but it's convenient since I travel a lot)
* IRS taxes : 375€ (I will probably have to pay the same amount or a bit more next year)
* Loan n°1 : 180€ (ends in September 2021)
* Loan n°2 : 100€ (ends in November 2022)
* Savings for traveling : 250€
* Emergency savings : 100€
* Company restaurant : about 100€
* Gas : about 50€
* Grocery : about 200€

2/ Other expenses :

I have subscribed to a program at work that transforms my intern years into a regular paid year so that these years contribute to my pension scheme. I have to pay 11 000€ for this but they still haven't claimed the money yet.

3/ Monthly income :

* Salary : 2300€

4/ Other income :

* Profit-sharing : 2000€, received in March each year (I usually deposit the whole thing into a company savings account because my company adds 70% to the amount each time I deposit. It is then blocked for 5 years).
* Target-based bonus : 2000€, received in April each year
* Workload-based bonus : 2000€, received in July each year
* 13th-month-bonus : 1150€, received in June and 1150€ received in December

5/ My current situation :

I sometimes use a corporate credit card to pay things in advance, the bill comes about 40 days after buying. Currently I'm waiting for 2 bills :

* 810€, due November, 1st
* 998€, due November 6th

Then my current situation :

* Main bank account at BNP Paribas : -120€
* Main bank account at Boursorama (used for savings for traveling) : +50€
* Emergency savings at BNP Paribas (interest rate : 0,75%) : +7000€
* Company savings (blocked for 5 years, no interests) : +6000€
* Other savings (used for the IRS taxes, interest rate : 0;75%) : +70€


Note :
I'm living in Paris (and intend to keep on living there for most of my life). I couldn't provide any estimation of my shopping and nights out related expenses because it obviously depends. But I can guess it would be around 500 or 600€ monthly. I'm willing to reduce these expenses to help my case but I know I won't be able to cut it out entirely...

In the end you can see that I'm unable to end the month in the green. Until now I also have always used my bonuses to pay my debts and I've almost never put it into my savings. I'd like to change that, get clean of my debts, and hopefully be able to live a more stable life (since I'm almost 30 and unable to move out, make life plans, etc).

Feel free to ask me anything you need to review my case ! And most of all, thank you so much for taking the time to read this and, hopefully, to give some needed advice !

Bye !"

MFA is a forum with the purpose of helping men dress better, develop a wardrobe, and improve their knowledge of fashion.

&amp;nbsp;

Posts have a natural life cycle: they rise, they plateu, they decline.

Eventually they get automatically locked, and can't be edited or updated at all. They also often end up lost to time within a subreddit or scattered around a confusing wiki. For a subreddit such as MFA that is based around resources, this becomes the problem we currently see with outdated sidebar posts containing broken links.

&amp;nbsp;

Thus, this guide will be made both in post form and added to a Google document. I will support both this post and the document with updates concurrently until the post is in decline. At which point I'll shift over to maintaining that post in the document exclusively.

And if it gets placed in the sidebar, I'll provide access to the mods.

So even if I become decrepit or homeless due to too many impulse purchases, the mods will be able to update them as needed.

#Step 1: Taking Inventory
A lot of people start off lost, knowing that they want to change the way they dress but not knowing **how**. The easiest way to find your footing is to affirm exactly where you are, then use that to have a clearer understanding of where you want to go.

&amp;nbsp;

This step is exactly what it sounds like, take inventory of everything you own. **Everything**. From your shirts to your socks, knowing what you have will allow you to move to the next step with improved focus.

&amp;nbsp;

How detailed you make your inventory is up to you, but the more detail you provide the easier things will be down the road.

&amp;nbsp;

To assist with this process, here is a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ntngQw7NGiWtNmBXOJGLSxfepC79EIFkh5y3DyPkt5s/edit#gid=0) created by /u/WebLlama a few years ago. I suggest reading the [entire post](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/2luv5o/wardrobe_assessment_i_built_a_spreadsheet_to_help/) because it's full of great information and is a good example of the kind of process this guide is meant to facilitate.

&amp;nbsp;

For example, it may be easier to write down that you have 20 shirts in your closet. But that provides a lot less useful information than noting that of those 20 shirts, 10 are t-shirts, 5 are long sleeve, and 5 are long-sleeve button downs. Then you can even go further and say that of those 10 t-shirts, 7 are graphic-tees and 3 are solid colors. So on and so forth until you have a list that is as detailed as you like.

&amp;nbsp;

The purpose of all this is that you can’t possibly know what you *need* unless you know what you *have*.

&amp;nbsp;

**note: you don’t actually have to write anything down, but I strongly suggest it.**

&amp;nbsp;

After taking inventory, the next thing to do is separate what you have into two categories: things you wear often and things you wear rarely. This segment is aimed towards “main” clothing, so shirts/pants/shoes. You can go further and do outerwear and underwear/socks if you’d like.

&amp;nbsp;

To provide a general idea, let’s say:
“often” = about 8 times a month (twice a week) and “rarely” = about 2 times a month (once every two weeks). Of course tweak this to suit the size of your wardrobe and account for mandatory clothes (uniforms, etc.)

&amp;nbsp;

Just remember that there is no discrimination here, but if it helps think of the “often” pile as being what you’d consider your “essentials”. If you had to pack for a week, what would you bring?

&amp;nbsp;

When you’re done, look at it and compare it to the list you made before. Feel free to create another list containing only the things in the “wear often” pile, it should help you get a comparison of how your wardrobe was made up.

&amp;nbsp;

When you’re done, it’s time for the next step.

---

#Step 2: Culling the Weak
If you were truly honest with yourself in Step 1, the “rarely wear” pile should be around half of what you own assuming you have an average sized wardrobe.

&amp;nbsp;

Now you need to get rid of it. Place the rarely worn items into a separate archive box in case you wish to go back to them later and reevaluate, or use them for something else down the line.

&amp;nbsp;

Removing those rarely used items does two things.

* The first is that it lets you know what you care about and what you don’t. Over time clothes build up because most people don’t sell/give away old items. This leaves you with pieces that are underused and only serve to take up space and give the illusion of having a full wardrobe. Taking inventory, splitting into categories, then removing these unused items lets you know what you really have.

* The second is that it gives you space, both literally and figuratively. When building your wardrobe back up it’s important to be conscious of the amount of clothes you acquire. The point is to satisfy your needs without accumulating an excess.

&amp;nbsp;

This step is arguably the most important because it is the **repeating** step. You’ll have to do this one again to remove the clothes that don’t fit your desired goal. And in the future when your goals change, you'll need to re-evaluate and adjust as necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

This will be elaborated upon later, but for now this is all you need to move on.

---

#Step 3: Asking the Right Questions
Now that you know what you have it’s time to figure out what you **need**.

&amp;nbsp;

The only way to get there is to ask the right questions. Here are some examples:

* What about my current clothes am I dissatisfied with?

* What about my current clothes am I satisfied with?

* What clothes are appropriate for my current position (in life)?

* How do I currently feel?

* At the end, how would I like to feel?

* Do I want to be simple and sharp, or make a statement/expressive.

&amp;nbsp;

And answers to these questions:

* I’m dissatisfied with the way my clothes fit on me. I also dislike that they are mostly dark colors like black and grey. They are out of touch, way behind the current trends.

* I’m satisfied with the types of clothes I wear. I like jeans, t-shirts, and simple shoes. I’d just like to have better options.

* I’m a college student so I’m mostly dressing for that environment. Though I’m looking to get an internship soon so some formal wear may be needed in the near future.

* I feel unsatisfied and a bit insecure.

* I’d like to feel clean, confident, and stylish.

* I just want to look good, keeping it simple and not doing too much. At least for now.

&amp;nbsp;

Once you’ve developed these questions and answered them, it’s time to make use of the first two steps and relate them to the answers you found.

---

#Step 4: Making a Plan
This is where the it all comes together.

&amp;nbsp;

By taking the information gained from the first three steps, it is now possible to start the process of finding the direction you’d like to go with what you wear.

&amp;nbsp;

To use the example from step 3, the goals that could  be developed could look something like this:

* Stick to t-shirts, jeans, and simple shoes.

* Incorporate more colors (lighter blues, reds, whites, etc)

* Keep the clothes simple, but stylish.

* College appropriate styles, keep it trendy

* One or two outfits for internship/office environment

&amp;nbsp;

Just like that there is **knowledge** and **direction**, the thing that most people come to MFA to look for.

&amp;nbsp;

Once these goals are set, go back and look at what was in your “often wear” pile. Has your feelings changed to anything in there? Do the items in there relate to the new goals you have set?

&amp;nbsp;

If not, consider redoing step 2 while keeping your goals in mind. This time try dividing them based on what fits within your goals and what detracts from them.

&amp;nbsp;

While you’re at it you should also start thinking of a budget. This will come into play later when you start to advance into actually buying clothes to achieve your goals.

&amp;nbsp;

Once you’re done, it’s time to finish up. 

---

#Step 5: Taking the Next Step
We’re finally here. Good job for sticking through, now let’s wrap it up.

&amp;nbsp;

To summarize where we’re at, you should now have the following:

* Knowledge of what clothes you wear most

* Knowledge of what questions to ask yourself moving forward

* A plan of what you want to accomplish/goals you wish to achieve

* (optional) A budget

&amp;nbsp;

All of this so far was meant to create a base level for you to work from. The next step is to further expand your knowledge with research.

&amp;nbsp;

Knowing **what you want** and knowing **what to buy** are two separate things, and as mentioned in the Contents section this guide is **not** a shopping list. There will be other resources for that.

&amp;nbsp;

**Use the search bar** on MFA, **participate** in the weekly threads, try and get as much information as possible and **always** relate it to the goals you have set.

&amp;nbsp;

If you’ve followed the steps within this guide well, then you should always be able to ask the right questions and receive quality answers. You should always know exactly what to search for and recognize when you’ve found what you’ve sought.

&amp;nbsp;

There will always be people willing to help you, and bringing a solid foundation is the best way to help yourself.

&amp;nbsp;

Happy hunting.

789pgu,37,2017-10-23,"[Kicker, 23.10.2017] Highlight story about Naby Keita: ""Genius and pushing his limits to the extreme""",stadiofriuli,LiverpoolFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/789pgu/kicker_23102017_highlight_story_about_naby_keita/,"We're all pretty sad at the moment, hence I thought I'll translate this article about our boy Naby for you guys, like I did with the Klopp interview in Kicker after the last season. We need a little cheering up right now. There will be some notes from myself here and there for an over all better understanding and will look like this (-text-)

Wall of text incoming. :-)

*Europe's top clubs we're after him, but in the end Liverpool got him. He's still a Leipzig player till the end of the season though and the one responsible to make Leipzig a better team and achieving their goals, this week two times against Bayern.*


Well, they're not particularly happy at Liverpool Leipzig is doing so well right now and Naby is getting back to his old form. Leipzig got world wide recognition for their respective wins against Dortmund away (3:2) and their first ever Champions League win against Porto, also 3:2, at home.


As the Daily Star is stating it will be quite hard for Liverpool now to bring Naby already in in January as Leipzig are achieving their season goals. 

So far Leipzig isn't aware of any interests from Klopps Liverpool side to get Naby already in January and it would be the least thing Ralf Rangnick is interested in. The deal that was made back in the summer was the best thing which ingenious Rangnick could have done with the like of Keita: RR: ""I'd have loved him to stay here for like 5 years, but that's just not possible for us. We've an internal salary cap and it's about 4.5 Million Euro and we couldn't handle that with the growing interest.""

RR: ""We simply can't pay players wages with two digits in the millions."" 

Liverpool could end up paying up to 70 Million Euros for Keita, therefore more than 20%, which his release clause of 55 Million Euros is.

Furthermore there'll be a friendly where Liverpool won't get any penny somewhen in between the next 3 years.

There are still 7 months left where Leipzig want to profit from Keitas class. RR: ""Naby is an extraordinary talented player, maybe the biggest talent with the age of 20 (back in the Salzburg days) I have ever worked together with in my whole professional career.""

His pace, his technique and his dribblings, he's the integral part of this squad, pushing also his team mates to higher levels. The fans love him for obvious reasons. His biggest assets are his work against the ball (like gegenpressing) and his talent to win duels. Many goals of Leizpig resulted out of a ball that was won back from Keita and he immediately switched from defense to attack. (pretty much our game plan and style.)

Sometimes he's pushing it to the limits and sometimes he's going to far. Like a month ago where he's shown a red card for his foul on Mönchengladbachs Christoph Kramer.

Or like last Saturday where his second challenge on Yarmolenko got him almost a second yellow and hence he's subbed at half time.

Keita will learn from that and everyone at the club is sure about that. He's still pretty young with just 22 years playing such a crucial position. He's the only player in Red Bull Leipzigs history that has grown quicker as the club itself, coming from the German Overliga straight into the Bundesliga and Champions League. 

This summer half of Europe we're after him, including Bayern. Talks with Bayern we're pretty far, but they didn't want to commit themselves with a pre contract like Liverpool. The Reds have the full risk on their side and have to pay the negotiated sum even when Keita will be injured by that time. 

This Wednesday and Saturday Keita will face Bayern two times in a row, the club that couldn't get him in the end. While playing for Red Bull Salzburg Keita faced Bayern and was playing brilliantly against them, but their common sense was a player who's is just tearing up a low league like the Austrians first is way under their level. 

Truly a misbelief as we know now and it was not just Bayern. Not many are aware that one of his biggest assets is to adapt to the next level faster than the most and he does it with class.

With the age of 18 Malik Kebe, who spotted him in first place, and is still his friend and father like figure tried to get him placed in Frances lower leagues, but Keita failed 3 times, because he looked too weak physically to them. 

But then FC Istres got him and first he's playing for their youth team, just a few weeks later he managed to start for the senior squad in Frances second league and immediately he's one of their best players and a starter form there on. 

Red Bull Salzburg, back then when Ralf Rangnick was in charge there with Gerard Houllier, scouted him for 5 weeks and knew he's a big talent to get with almost no risks but high reward. Inclusive add ons they got him for 1.7 Million Euros. He immediately worked out for Salzburg too. In his second season in Austria he was rewarded with the POTY award, therefore bigger clubs like Arsenal (lol), PSG or City tried to get him. 

Rangnick, now working for Red Bull Leipzig, gets Keita to stay and Keita transfers to Leipzig for like 15 Million Euros. (Red Bull intern)

With up to 70 Million Euros it's still a pretty good business for Leipzig. One of the main reasons Rangnick was fine with the pre contract in the end was to keep Keita happy, even when it's just for one more season. 

**Comparison between Naby and some other midfielders in the league.**

**Special on top**

*Interview with Christoph Freund, who's director of sports for RB Salzburg now, but is working for the club since 2006 already*

Ki: ""Mr. Freund did you expect Naby Keita to adapt to the German Bundesliga that fast?""

*Fr: ""We knew it from the very first second, that Naby will become a world class player soon if nothing extraordinary comes across. It's no suprise he can easily play on that level week in week out.""*

Ki: ""What makes Keita such a class player?""

*Fr: ""His anticipation. To get in the right spots at the right time, he's very quick in his thoughts and has an extraordinary football IQ. He always keeps his head up and therefore often is just quicker than his opponents. His one on ones are world class and his first touch just brilliant.""*

Ki: ""What's his deficits?""

*Fr: ""To focus not just what happens in front of him, but also behind him, defending wise. Keeping up concentration for full 90 minutes. But he already got much better at these things. Another topic is not making stupid fouls.""*

Ki: ""How's Keita in person, as a human?"" 

*Fr: ""He's pretty funny and an important personality in the dressing room, even when he's still pretty young. And you always can count on him. Always.""*

Ki: ""Is he mentally strong enough to cope with the hype around him?""

*Fr: ""Important is the right surrounding, like family and friends. There's definitely some potential to be worried about. He's pretty good-natured and got a star pretty fast. Many people now want to be friends with him. He's the last to say no. In the end it's a question if all people around him want the best for him though. In Salzburg we had no problems with that. (Maybe that's some hint for the whole topic with Rangnick and Keitas sorroundings, which ended in the village talk...)""*

Ki: ""Is he ready for England?""

*Fr: ""The way and kind of football, Jürgen Klopp is playing with Liverpool, high pressing and switching from defense to attack in one second, definitely suits Naby. He'll get an integral part there pretty fast.""*

Ki: ""Is Keita like Sadio Mane or Salzburgs defender Upamecano an example for the excellent scouting RB got?""

*Fr: ""We're pretty proud so many class talents and players were with us the last years. There are several players right now at Salzburg that could end up being as good as Keita and Mane. We won the UEFA Youth League last year for example.""*

I would be working full time and I'm a pretty quiet person in general. I've heard Airbnb would be a great option, but how likely will someone rent out their home for 12 weeks?

78aw2o,2,2017-10-23,"Me [17 M] and the girl i like [17 F], i dont know anymore and im really desperate for help..",Foxmagicwithcake,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/78aw2o/me_17_m_and_the_girl_i_like_17_f_i_dont_know/,"So basically we met at the training to become both volunteer firefighters and we even were in the same squad. We both liked each other, but for my part I wasnt really thinking about her bcs tbh i didnt really thought about her that much.
But in this july we met again at a summercamp, organised by the youth department of our VFDs and we became closer, like very much, but just on a friend level.


Then it started, we wrote us very very much everyday about literally anything. It also was spring break, so she travelled to her family in Italy and to Taize in France, and I made 2 internships at a foreign trade company and at a professional fire department. We had a lot to talk about. She sent me pics and i sent some from our adventures.
It all went well. I even asked her to come to me to watch a movie and she said yes, but nothing really happened. After that she wrote me that there would be some shooting stars on a friday night she wanted to watch, so i was like ""heeeyy wanna watch them together"", and to my surprise she said YES.
So i went to her place, a small town near a highway and we went for a walk and discussed about various things. Then we went back an prepared the air mattress, because she had a conservatory connected to her room from where we had an ideal view upon the sky.



 We layed down and started to wait, me and here were a little bit tired after our long walk, so we were already a bit sleepy. 1 important fact may be that it was really really cold so we were pretty close to each other and even looked kinda intense in the eyes of the other one. It was just super weird.
Then, the exact day after, a friend of mine and in went to a festival at her homwtown. So she was also there. The thing is that im going to a professional high school that`s 1 hour away from my hometown and she goes to a high school that is actually in my hometown. 

So we met and i kinda stuck to her the whole event, so i hang out with all of her friends from school, bcs the school is in my hometown i knew some of them, but nor really well. There was one specific moment that still confuses me... so the event began to end and we all chilled around one spot, then she leans on my shoulder (tired i guess) and one of her friends makes a heart symbol with her hands and makes like a signal question to her, if she (i guess) is in love with me or something. I acted like i did not see it, but she immediately stopped leaning and i just turned to her and missed her reaction. So idk


After that weekend i asked her for another meetup, and i respected that because she told me she doesnt wanna see anybody that weekend. Then the weekend began and i noticed from pics and voice messages she actually sent me , that she`s at like a little birthday party with like four of her friends and my best friend. It hurts. There is nothing between her and my friend, but i felt like unwanted and just bad. The day after that my friend told me that she acted at that party like she like me much, so i asked her if we wanna meet for that day and she said she stays with her statement. So after weeks after me asking her for meetups, bcs i just wanted to see her and stuff (yea kinda weird i know) were she declined most of the time, but in a chilled way, so that in the end we met like 3 times after that weekend.
Then, yesterday i asked her indirect( because im really shy) about when we will meet to clearly say to each other what we feel. She wrote me on Sankt Nimmerleinstag, wich is colloquial for a day that will never happen and described something like her dream wedding to me. So i asked her today, when we will acutally meet,and she wrote that she doesnt have time bcs she is about to write her pre finals, so i asked her if she could then write me it and she sent this:




Okay, no, it's all good, we're friends and that's good, I've only a few worries I can not share with you, but otherwise, everything is fine I like to be friends with you and i can talk well with you at least virtually in real we are just awkward and I am glad to know you And if I am annoyed, then because I have too much contact (overall propably) So it's real weird I know I like to go on people too but when it happens the other way .. meeh 😅😅 But well I hope it is all well and so and yes




We share so much interets and stuff Sometimes i think that she is like asexual?... idk sometimes i think she likes man and women, if you know what i mean So i think that she may has a crush on antoher person (idk if male or female) But she sent me so much irritating messenges and pictures (on Instagram) that i still dont know what to do
I think that i was like to ""open"" to her about myself and that i showed to much interest. But i never experienced feelings like this for someone before so... i just dont know
So that is my question... what should i do, did i miss something and just.... why, how and what next?
I really need help and advice
Thank you very much for your time if you read this and sorry for any english/grammar mistakes.


**TL;DR;** : We met, liked each other and wrote everyday for like 4 Months now, then we metm she gave me very mixed singals, i thinks she likes men and women, she told me that she doesnt wanna see anybody and went to a little party, i felt like a idiot, but we still had contact, i asked whats going on between us, she wrote me the text i included above and yeah idk, pls read the whole text :/ for specifics

Sincerly,

--------------------------------------

**XM** [October 2004](https://redd.it/6fq9sp) | [November 2004](https://redd.it/6shdi3)

--------------------------------------

* O&amp;A are thrilled because Larry the Cable Guy is the first ""A-Lister"" to come on the XM show

* Opie says his family is in the middle of a wrongful death lawsuit but keeps it vague and doesn't elaborate.

* The show continues to play not only Stephen lynch songs, but songs from his brother Drew Lynch, who is also trying to make it as a three-chord falsetto song parody singing pile of shit.

* [The first ever Cherry Darts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVDumR6E0lU) 

* Now 10 years into their partnership, O&amp;A decide to have some girls call in and do a few fake orgasms.

* [Jimmy's mom calls in, feels bad for Jimmy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIepVcZkSVs)

* Joel Steinberg, Hedda Nussbaum, Scott Peterson, Andrea Yates, Smith Children. That's about the gist of Jim Norton's comedic arsenal in December 2004.

* Ant says that Adam Ferrara dated Dawn Cumia way back in the day and had sex with her

* [Opie plows through, and there's no greggshells!](https://youtu.be/Jeyi8gORWHk?t=1h39m16s)

* Master Po gets mocked for his ""perhaps a bit more than that, Jim"" comment

* They discover the band People Haters and play [some](https://youtu.be/WD9yvG6hwUo) of their [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4RB3ER794Q0), hence the spawn of the show's inheritance of the term ""shitdick""

* Opie says that he was so poor as a child that he only got one haircut per year. 

* Ant is now paying for a woman to come over his house, cook food for him for the week, and put it in tupperware with instructions on how to reheat it.

* They interview a skinhead from the band People Haters and he sounds suspiciously like Ant circa 2017. It's interesting hearing Ant in 2004 debating the man's racism.

* One of the members of the newly coined O&amp;A Army hacked into the Tony Danza message board, causing Danza's people to have to shut down the board permanently. 

* Steve C and his clothing, which consist of black shirts with flame imprints, are constantly mocked.

* It is reported that Dick Clark had a stroke but intends to appear on his usual New Year's Rockin' Eve show.

* A great [segment](https://youtu.be/cdqndShBCkc?t=1h11m20s) in which O&amp;A&amp;J discuss how Vos was hurt by the harsh criticism he's been getting on the Wackbag message board. Vos went onto the message board to defend his recent O&amp;A appearances, and Opie tells him that he's just gotta learn to deal with the criticism. The clip also features a great moment when Anthony asks Opie to do a Vos impression and Opie says that although he does many “fine impressions on this show” he prefers not to do a Vos impression.

* Opie is mad that the staff doesn't have available one of the five tracks in his Top Five Worst Christmas Songs countdown break, which goes nowhere. 

* Needy Steve from Bayshore calls with an O-Zone midget sighting alert. 

* Jimmy is jealous because an intern from the show is hooking up with a prostitute/porn star that was a guest on the show and had asked Jim off the air for $1000 for sex.

* Anthony observes how people don't say ""excuse me"" anymore when they don't hear you, but rather they say ""wha happen?"" Opie, in this moment, decided that he would claim this crutch as his own and will likely continue to do it regularly for the rest of his life. Later on. a caller pronounces Washington as ""Worshington"" and Opie scoops this one up as well.

* Sex Bagel, whose nickname the boys are eager to replace, officially becomes The Hawk when [Erik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5yNSK4Mb8U) interrupts a live Fox 5 [broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhBz3gi3Myw) covering hawks living in the neighborhood. He wins a lot of respect from the show and is far from the whipping boy he would eventually become.

* Intern Than does standup, and it's actually not terrible.

* Tommy Chong is in studio, having just served nine months for getting caught with drug paraphernalia. He says he doesn’t smoke pot anymore, that he never smoked much, and that his stoner persona was just an act. 

* [A truly horrible Laci Peterson song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLC4Go9WZfA)

* WNEW personality Frankie Blue is mocked for being drunk on the air, and the boys laugh as their old station continues to tank in [ratings](https://www.google.com/amp/www.nydailynews.com/amp/archives/entertainment/o-pounce-tape-blue-airshift-article-1.601067)

* [First Annual Eggnog Drinking Contest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhmmzYbUY4k), with Pat from Moonachie making (I think) his first appearance in studio 

* O&amp;A announce that a station in Syracuse is going to re-broadcast some cleaner segments of O&amp;A on their terrestrial station for a few weeks, piloting the show’s first satellite-terrestrial crossover.

* The FoundryMusic website message board is annoying the boys  because the users are critiquing everything so much: Opie’s awful grammar, Anthony eating on mic, Ben Sparks laughing at everything.

* The show is picking up the frequency of “serious questions only” phone interviews with boring authors and sex therapists that are either good cop/bad cop or just the callers fucking with them. One of their funniest recurring bits.

* O&amp;A's pal ""Buzzy"" is actually Devin Ratray, who portrayed the older brother in Home Alone and would later appear in the film Nebraska.

* Most of the shows open with Gary Hoey playing heavy metal Christmas rejoiners which is pretty fawchhin heavy.

* [Jim Florentine and Club Soda Kenny did a bit for Inside the NFL that was absolutely atrocious](https://youtu.be/UEBQrkqsPDk)

* They do a rejoiner that’s ""Jingle Bells"" but each note played is actually a FART sound!

* Marion calls Lady Di a “fucked up lady” after visiting her house. While she was there, Lady Di called the cops on her boyfriend because her boyfriend hid her wine after she got too drunk. Lady Di calls in and cries on the air when the boys start yelling at her, but she insists that she will be looking for work soon.

78bq12,5,2017-10-23,"Me [22 M] with my gf [22 F] of 4 years, got an incredible job offer overseas. Gf planning to follow me. Not sure if I want that, or if I want to start over completely...",yobrothrowblow,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/78bq12/me_22_m_with_my_gf_22_f_of_4_years_got_an/,"I have been dating my gf since the very first week of freshman year of college. We are seniors now. We have had a good relationship so far with the exception of one breakup about a year ago. We have never lived together. Recent fights have me struggling a lot with the question of whether or not I want to spend the rest of my life with her (we really don't see eye to eye on a lot of important values like financial responsibility, family, roles of a partner in our lives, etc). I feel like I need to answer that question soon since there is a huge crossroads coming up for us.

Now I have been very successful in college and my career. I am graduating in May and have an incredible job lined up in another country. I interned there over the summer (without my gf) and had an amazing time. It was like the culmination of all my years of hard work lead up to the best summer of my life. But my gf wasn't a part of it. We missed each other a ton and kept things going long distance, but I know I wouldn't have had nearly that good of a time if she was there. This is mainly because I found the summer internship to be an exercise of my individuality. I had not felt that way since high school before we started dating, making my own friends and doing things on my terms without having to report to anyone. It was an absolute blast. 

My gf is in a low-employment major and has a retail job that looks like she's going to keep for at least a while after graduation. Due to this, she would follow me abroad and pick up whatever job she can get while we settle in. 

Now the crossroads: Take her with me and live together, and basically cement our lives together OR break up and start over anew. I can try my best to recreate the happy individual I found over the summer, focus on myself and my career, and leave her in the past as my 'college gf'.

If I take memories from my summer and insert my gf into them, it almost ruins them. I don't know if I can make equal but different memories with her a part of them, or if i will be miserable with her there since it is just not the same. 

The tough part is that right now she is under the impression that she is 100% a part of this. She is excited for the new city and the opportunity to leave our boring home state. In a way, I feel like I'm her only chance to get out and explore the world. I would feel evil taking that away from her and she would be beyond devastated. Maybe it's my fault for not managing expectations but I would basically end our relationship by implying I still wasn't sure if she was coming.

The thing is, if I take her with me then we will be in a strange place living together for the first time ever. This is a huge step in our relationship and a huge commitment. What if living together doesn't work? Then if we break up she's going to have to go right back home or be stranded far away. It is a lot to ask of her to uproot her entire life and start over abroad, and if things don't work out she will have a lot of pieces to pick up. I feel like it is unfair how much control I have over this situation... makes me feel guilt.

I am scared and stressed by the implications of this decision. This one moment basically decides what the rest of my life looks like (at least the foreseeable future). 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: GF is excited to move abroad with me for my new job. I am still deciding whether of not I should take her (which would most likely result in marriage), or start over completely in a new place. "

A bonus if it is something related to r/breeding r/impregPersonals

**Opportunistic**

Rick (a nearly underage boy ) watches you shiver craving for cock, his eyes look at your red lips and down at your cleavage as he realises he has a chance to fuck a much older girl, in fact this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unless he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load.
""Ok.."" he nods as you beg for him to fuck you raw...he drops his backpack and starts to unzip his shirt revealing a large bulge under his underpants. Before he continues you press ""STOP"" button on the lift.
Basically you are someone who is aware of his condition and either by pure need of cum or altruism reasons you take the opportunity of us being alone to make me unload a large period of time worh of cum. As it is a generous amount it would be life threatening to have it all done in one go, so you would plan to have me nut several times throughout the roleplay 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that the intern was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as her? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her

B.) taken off since it's not 18+appropriate

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.

I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** (none are deal breakers) are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks) coupled with thick girls, being corrupted/mind broken, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for *how you might look*: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/
*Things I would would like to see* r/girlsinyogapants r/seethroughleggings r/visiblepantyline r/cameltoe 


remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :). I also have kik if you prefer

78cdct,3,2017-10-23,Into a girl. Could use some advice.,Beren_and_Luthien,drunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/78cdct/into_a_girl_could_use_some_advice/,"Hey guys,

I'm really drunk right now, but I thought this would be a good opportunity to get something off my chest. So basically I'm really into this girl. She's just perfect. Asian, beautiful eyes, very small though haha, but I like that. I'm 6,4"" myself, but I don't want to give you the impression like I'm some muscular tall dude or anything. I'm just a skinny, kinda below average looking guy I think. 


But anyway, she's got a great personality and she's just stunning. Way out of my league. But for some reason we get along very well. Last year we've watched the fireworks together on New Year's Eve, best time of my life. This year we've had an internship at the same place and we got to know each other pretty well. We like the same shows, movies, hobby's etc.

The problem though is that I'm too afraid to ask her out. I'm not sure if she's into me and I don't want to bother her you know. So I myself don't really know how to approach her. I've never had that much luck regarding girls I gueeeesss. Or much experience with dating / asking out someone.

The thing I'm afraid of the most is that I'll ruin our friendship. I'd want nothing more than to keep contact with her, so maybe if I'll ask her out things would get weird. That'd be horrible. I'm not sure if she feels the same way about me as I do about her. I mean looks and attraction are an important thing I guess, not just how you get along. So you guys have any advice or just want to share your own problems?

Don't you love the feeling when you're drunk? All your worries disappear. It's getting kinda late here though. I'm from Europe so it's 3 AM. I'll read it in the morning when I'm sober again.

Have an awesome night. Cheers everyone."

78ckdb,2,2017-10-23,Am I on track?,uraptor,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/78ckdb/am_i_on_track/,"Hey guys,
Currently a sophomore right now and just a bit anxious about applying summer junior year. I see everyone talking about their stats and getting in vs. rejections and it makes me a tad worried I might not be on track or might be behind 😅. 
For EC's I currently have about 120 hours volunteering at a hospital, 40 at a clinic, 15 shadow hours w a plastic surgeon (family friend, I'm REALLY trying to find a GP or rural doc), 62 hrs research, and finally 80 non medical (I judge at debate tourneys). Im still volunteering w all these and plan on continuing them through senior yr. I don't plan on taking a gap year though. I see a bunch of people with like 500 or 800 hours of volunteering and I'm not sure I'll end up with that. I'm also planning on volunteering in Peru this winter (my family is Hispanic so I wanted to do something to help out in the area, and plan on going back after med school). Also planning on a research internship this summer. 
GPA wise I have a 4.0 and probably will continue to have one through this semester, but I expect it's gonna drop later (I've already taken orgo I and am taking orgo II, but I'm worried about adv. anatomy, genetics, and physics). 
So my question is, am I on track to be a competitive applicant? I realize since I haven't taken my MCAT and that it's still early in my college career it's hard to really figure that out, but in terms of volunteering am I behind?

Thanks so much for any responses!"

___________________________________________________
**IMPORTANT NOTES**

* Kickoff with Kurt Angle who says he wrote a new chapter in his story last night, but is ready to look forward to the Survivor Series. He explains that this year it will be champion vs champion, Alexa Bliss will face Nattalya, IC champion The Miz will face US champion Baron Corbin, Seth and Dean will face the Usos, and Brock Lesnar will face Jinder Mahal. He also explain there will be two 5 vs 5 elimination matches, one for the men and one for women. He ends by saying he wants to prove that Raw is the best show. The Miz, along with The Bar and Curtis Axel, come out to interrupt. Miz says he makes Raw what it is, and that Angle abused his power by inserting himself into the main event. He calls for Angle to step down from power immediately and surrounds the ring along with The Bar and Axel. The Shield's music hits and Dean and Seth make their way through the ring to Kurt's aid, causing the Miz to back away. Miz claims Dean and Seth are just trying to suck up and sold out to management, but assures that he still has a numbers advantage. Angle tells him not to be too sure and makes a 6 man tag for tonight, Miz and The Bar versus Seth, Dean, and AJ Styles who stuck around after last night. 
   
* After the first match Kane comes out as Seth, Dean, and AJ stand their ground in the ring. Kane is able to take them down quickly as Miz and the Bar come in to beat them down. 

* After commercial Kane explain his actions from last night. He says that he has heard all about Strowman's feats and how he was supposedly a monster among men. Kane said that he had to see Strowman for himself but only saw 380 pounds of garbage so he threw him in a garbage truck. In those moments he saw fear in Strowman's eyes, and that no matter what Kane will be Raw's only monster. With Braun gone, Kane demands competition, or else. Finn Balor comes out to accept his challenge. 

* Backstage Kurt Angle meets with Shane McMahon, whom he thanks for AJ Styles filling in the past two nights. Kurt asks for him full time which Shane denies, Angle understands and says he understands since Smackdown needs the talent. The two brag about their respective brands and wish each other luck going into Survivor Series.  

* Alexa Bliss comes out and says that last night she defeated the leader of the old folks home and wants to move onto Survivor Series, and Natalia. Alexa promises that she will prove that the Raw Women's championship is the dominant title. She also is tired of the disrespect from the crowd who will chant ""this is awesome"" at AJ and Finn for staring at eachother, while she got no response during the match of her career last night. Bliss proposes trying something, she will say a chant and the crowd will respond back like the sheep they are. She tries a ""you deserve it chant"" but the crowd quickly boos. As she demands further respect Mickie James comes out and quickly attacks Alexa, laying her out with a ddt. She then grabs the mic and says that Alexa deserved that.

* Sasha and Bayley meet with Angle backstage and give him props for what he did last night. Angle names the two of them the captains of Raw Women's Survivor Series match. Alicia barges in and demands to be made captain, so Kurt makes a triple threat match between the three of them for later tonight. 

* Elias comes out, gets some cheap heat from the Green Bay crowd, then complains about Jason Jordan's actions last night, but promises to do something special tonight. And uninterrupted musical performance, as long as the crowd can be respectful. He starts to play but gets some interference on his mic. After a number of technical problems he grabs the ring announcer's mic and promises to go to the back and beat up whichever technician was messing up. Jason Jordan comes out to stop Elias and the two have a match.  

* Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman come out to answer Jinder Mahal's challenge from Smackdown Live. Paul says it's funny how the entire crowd chants along when Heyman calls Brock undisputed, yet Jinder is challenging Brock despite barely surviving his past title defenses. Meanwhile Brock has destroyed some of the most legitimate challengers in Raw history. In this age of trash talking, where everyone tries to belittle their opponents, Paul is the king of trash talking, yet he does not run down any of his opponents since they are legitimate challengers to Brock. However when it comes to Jinder, he is nothing compared to Lesnar, not even a worthy pretender. Paul talks about the prestigious men who have held the WWE championship like Bruno, Hogan, Cena, and of course Brock, not Jinder who got the title as a consolation prize. Heyman makes it clear that this isn't because of loyalty to brands, since whichever brand Brock is on is the number one brand in the world. Heyman then recall's the last time a Smackdown live wrestler fought Brock, Randy Orton, Brock destroyed him to an extent that he had to be wheeled off. Paul says that the challenge is accepted by the undisputed champion in WWE, Brock Lesnar. 

* Backstage Kalisto says that he is disappointed that he lost to someone he doesn't respect last night and he will revoke his title rematch tomorrow night. But tonight he, along with four other cruiser weights will get a piece of Enzo in a ten man tag tonight. 

* Gulak reads a prepared statement on the behalf of Enzo who has lost his voice. He reads Enzo's catch phrases in a professional manner. Gulak brags about Enzo's win last night and has the entire team spell out Sawft.

* Kurt Angle comes out to announce Raw's men's team for Survivor series and is about to announce him when he is interupted by Shane O'Mac who makes his way through the crowd with Smackdown's roster. Shane steps into the ring, and just says under siege as Angle makes it to the back. Shane tells the Smackdown roster to go get Angle and they follow Angle to the back. The Smackdown roster make their way through the back and start mugging Titus O'neil and Apollo Crews once they run across them. Corbin beats up a hapless intern and they destroy the Raw interview set. As they make their way through the Smackdown women give chase to a few of the Raw women, as the guys continue through, taking out Goldust, Curtis Axel, and Curt Hawkins. In the locker rooms they beat down Matt Hardy and Jason Jordan and continue their rampage. Becky, Carmella, Nattie, and Tamina run into Alicia, Sasha, and Bayley and take them all down as the Smackdown roster continue to work their way through until they are ambushed by Rollins and Ambrose. However the advantage is short lived as the two are quickly overwhelmed by the numbers. Angle is found and dragged to see what has happened to his teammates from last night and they bring him back out to the stage. Shane motions the roster to bring him down to the ring where Shane tells him to bring his gold medal, the rest of the Raw roster, and to be ready to finish what just started, oh it's true, it's damn true.

78d68v,2,2017-10-23,Multiple research experiences?,diazonium101,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/78d68v/multiple_research_experiences/,"Note: I'll be applying for the upcoming cycle. 

Does anyone know (or have an idea of) how adcoms view multiple research experiences? Research is required for my major and I have ~400 hours split between 3 different positions/labs. I never really found a lab that fit me well so I only stayed at each position for less than a year. 

Additionally, I have another 400 hours (full-time for 10 weeks) as a summer research intern at a biopharm company. Will a lack of ""sustained"" research look bad or will it be okay as long as I can explain why?"
78d8sr,2,2017-10-23,"First time posting here, today is my 8th day without weed.",fooby420,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/78d8sr/first_time_posting_here_today_is_my_8th_day/,"Damn, this is hard. I seriously considered smoking today, after only 8 days of being off weed. I knew it would be difficult, but the cravings are REAL. I started smoking in High School, and I've been smoking nearly every day since. Unlike many of you, I plan on smoking after this break, and if it weren't for this damn drug test I need to take for a (potential) internship opportunity, I'd definitely be smoking right now. I'm not even sure if I'll be clean by the time I get tested.  
When I get out of class, I smoke weed. When I'm doing my homework, I smoke weed. Sober homework is so boring, but when I'm stoned, it's almost bearable. Completing these assignments takes such a toll on me when I'm not high. And its not like smoking weed has really done much harm to my life. I complete all my homework and earn really good grades in school that it's so difficult for me to be sober right now.   
Day 1 was hard, and every day following that got easier, but today, it sucks. I don't want to finish this homework and it would be so much less grueling to do it high. When I got the craving tonight, I started looking at those online THC calculators to see how much smoking right now would set me back, but then I realized I'm only 8 days sober, and that's nothing compared to the 40+ that I'll need to be in order to even think about being clean.  
In the process of looking around online, I stumbled upon /r/leaves. At this point I was still considering smoking tonight, but then, after looking at some of the posts here, even seeing how some of you are sober for even 90 days makes my effort seem pathetic. If I can't say sober for a drug test that would dictate my future career, than what does that say about myself?  
I'm not going to smoke tonight, or tomorrow, or the day after that, until I get tested for this job. But, I sure hope it's not for nothing. Typing all of this out has really made me stop and think about how stupid I was to think about smoking tonight. You guys are so strong for staying clean for so long, and if I was planning to quit for good, I don't think I would be strong enough to do it.  
I've been having dreams, though, so that's interesting. The past two nights, I smoked weed in my dreams, only to wake up revealed that I didn't break my streak. 
Weed hasn't really impacted my life substantially in a negative way, and for all intents and purposes, it's relatively harmless.  But, what I need to do is what I need to do. I just hope that somebody reading this shares the same pain that I'm feeling right now in staying sober. After visiting here I realized how little 8 days really is, but for me it feels so long! 

Thank you all for reading

EDIT: I just realized my type of temporary smoking cessation is not welcome here. Mods, do as you must, but typing this all out has definitely helped me out tonight. "
78dbzo,4,2017-10-24,"[Rant/Advice] Errors on my qualifying exam, possible politics, feeling lost",Failinggradstudent,academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/78dbzo/rantadvice_errors_on_my_qualifying_exam_possible/,"I was accepted into a prestigious PhD program, and I feared it might be hypercompetitive, so I did ask about retention rate when I toured. I was assured that every student was accepted because the department intended to fund and graduate them. There was no cut-off due to competition within a class of entering students for advisers/funding.  

Upon matriculation, I learned that usually about 50% of each incoming class is culled involuntarily. The quals have no set passing score, no grading rubric, and very few students pass on their first attempt (less than half of my entering class). On my final attempt, I studied from sunup to sundown for months. I’m confident, even now, that I knew the material. 

This year, though, there were several blatant typos on the exam I took (in my field this would gravely affect the question and solution), and I failed. I appealed on the basis that I made ~90% on the questions without typos, but the opinion of the department was that I should have figured out the intended question on context. Many other students had my same confusions, but received closer to ~100% on the rest of the questions, or managed to see past some of the typos. The (carefully worded) response I got on my appeal implies my master’s is in jeopardy if I fight them on this further. 

I know some programs have lower retention rates than others, but it’s especially upsetting they blatantly misled me about this when I toured. And this year felt especially political. 

Possible Politics:

1.) This year I chose to get a letter from disability services requesting additional time due to medication I take that can cause me to lose track of time. The other student who had additional time also failed (very likely a coincidence)

2.) Many of my score sheets were initially missing. Usually several professors grade the exam, but I only received one graded copy and only received the other two after asking incessantly for weeks to see them. There’s no comments on my exam either, only scores, which is highly unusual (in previous years there was always written commentary). I fear there is some covering up happening, and that the other graders failed to submit their feedback. 

3.) The one copy I received was graded by a professor who, for reasons I don’t understand, thinks very little of me. They also have strong opinions about things like disability accommodations. As a whole, the department seems to bear me no ill will (at worst a nonchalance), but they have a vested interest in keeping it a secret if there was only one grader. 

4.) My adviser is moving departments, and I'm early enough in my career that we could not complete our project remotely. He announced his leaving a little before my exam. 

My options: 

1.) Leave and say nothing. 

2.) I could speak discreetly to the Dean of Graduate Studies or maybe Office of Disability Services. I don’t want to escalate the issue at this time, but if this is a repeated pattern (especially for students with additional time), perhaps there should be some record of it for those who enroll after me. 

3.) There is one sympathetic professor who took my side when my appeal was brought up at a department meeting. I could speak with him.  He is close to retirement and has a reputation for playing no politics. I won't even mention the appeal, but if he has opinions he may bring them up on his own in the meeting. Beyond that, he could give some advice for departments I might want to apply to in the future.

The Immediate Future Plan:

Regardless, I get a master’s. 

I was fortunate to secure an internship a few summers ago at a very research-oriented industry position. I loved it there, and they really liked my work. When I told them my adviser was moving and that the new program isn’t a good fit, they offered to take me on and set me up on a path to a new program (many people in this company have PhD’s, close academic relationships, and they publish often). 

My adviser also said I have an open spot at his new department, even if I choose to take some time off for industry. He also offered to write me a letter for other programs if I choose. For various reasons, I’m leaning towards applying to other programs. 
I’m not sure how to navigate the fact I failed out of my first program due to quals. It won’t be blatant on my transcript, although it will be obvious I entered as a PhD student. I intend to say “I left because my adviser moved and no one else was a good fit. He entered a program that was also not a good fit.” That being said, I don’t intend to lie if asked specifically about quals. 


Overall, I’m not sure how things will look on the other side of the table applying to programs. Will publishing papers in the next year or so help? Is my only hope for a PhD to stick with the old adviser? Is there hope of overlooking my past if I meet potential advisers personally at conferences or through connections at the industry job?

Tl;dr: Department made an exam with typos. I failed it and they denied my appeal. Some shady things happened. Should I seek to put this on record (anonymously) with the university in case it’s a repeated pattern? Moving forward, what advice can you give to minimize the damage this does to my career if I want to continue in academia at another department?

78ft6p,11,2017-10-24,I seriously need help and I don't know where to turn,nolongnomore,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/78ft6p/i_seriously_need_help_and_i_dont_know_where_to/,"I posted in the general thread and I just had people telling me to get therapy (which I'm already doing) but I need actual academic and career advice or I'm going to explode. I'm in a really dark place and I could use some advice because I feel completely alone. I'm 20. Junior in college studying chemistry. I'm currently doing research in a lab and it's basically my own project, which is nice. I've wanted this, and I got it. But today was my first day at the facility running samples with this instrument (I've done a lot of similar work, but never with this) and I forgot my notes from last time and oh my god, did I get a ribbing. The head of the lab basically kept asking why I even came, or if I even cared, and I was seriously on the verge of crying the entire time. I fucked up, I know, but I felt so trapped and he literally wouldn't stop insulting me over it the whole 2 hours.


So there's that. I learned my lesson. But I just feel like I'm fucking up everything in my life right now. This is my third undergraduate research lab so far. The first ended up being a field I didn't enjoy, the second gave me no project or anything, just had me doing grunt work, and I'd already done a great project at an internship and I couldn't go back to doing nothing, plus I'd really like to have something to show for my work (or a presentation, or publication, or anything, like all my friends have), but it was a prestigious lab so I should have stuck around.... they also didn't give me hours and I was required to have hours for my credit. Like, I needed 15 hours and I got maybe 2 a week. I found another lab over the summer via networking, started in there, and I'm basically continuing the summer work now with a collaborator. And it's mine.


I've not published. I've had one internship, one which I got an offer to go back to and turned down because I'm the world's biggest dunce and I thought that it'd be a bad idea to stay in one place. Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. I seriously fucked up, and I don't know what to do there. I've applied to different jobs. I interviewed with a startup today and I don't know how that went, but they want someone year round and I can only do a summer gig because I'm working on a project right now. I want to work in industry, but I already let go of my only industry connection I had. I want to publish. I want to present my data at a conference. I want to be *good* and everyone around me is being good and I'm running out of time.


I feel agonized. I don't know how else to put it. If it were capable, I would legitimately beat myself up. Literally, that's how I feel. I have never hated myself this much in my entire life. I'm a B student (3.1 and rising, but probably not by much), my grades aren't even that good. I also have two Ws (one was because of a major switch, the other was death in the family... excuses, I know) and two retakes (new grade, which is good, but the bad grades, one which was failing, are still on there, just not in my GPA. But grad schools consider those and they'll fuck me). So grad school is out. I used to be good at so much. I started in the lab in high school and I was taking college courses and giving talks and I was on top of the world, but that version of me is dead.

Is my experience I have so far even worth anything if I don't have a paper/presentations? I'm hoping that this year is the year that I can actually at least *try* to publish and present my data at a conference/forum, because I'm literally the only person in my circle who hasn't done that despite working in a ton of labs (for nothing, as it turns out). I'm terrified that my degree will be worthless and that I'll never have a real, stable career.

3 years ago i went to this new school where i didn't know anyone. My class got along pretty well, no one was left alone. There were only 2 girls in our class, and (let's call her peach) was my soon-to-be gf. As the year went on, me and peach got along pretty well. 

I was 19 at the time as she was 17. We got along pretty well, we shared a lot of interests, movies, music, even video-games (which i find very rare in a girl). Some time passes, we get along even more and more and i started to develop feelings for her, so eventually asked her if she felt the same way for me. 

At the time she said she wasn't ready for a relationship (i later found out it was because of her family, but more on that later). This of course was hard for me but i wasn't ready to quit. We still kept talking and doing all the stuff that we did before, but not as much because of what had happened. 

1 Year passes and we are in the 11th grade. It was the same thing, i got the courage again to ask her but yet again i got the same type of response. At this moment i was ready to give up, as the next day me and peach didn't even talk. But the day after one of our classmates started giving me hints,""haven't you noticed something different peach's behavior?"" i responded ""of course not, we haven't talked since."" 

A day passes after this conversation and Peach was doing anything to get my attention, like the stuff we did when we started to know each other but even better. This gave the hint that she finally wanted to advance things forward and when i finally got again the courage to it, she accepted.


We were a great couple, we supported each other with our school work, we did a lot of activities we enjoyed, of course there was times we had some discussions and disagreements but soon after we ALWAYS solved everything. Our communication was very good in that part.


Some time passes, we finish high school, and now we were ready to do that ""big jump"" to the adult life. Here i talk a little about her family. Long story short her grandma had a heart attack, placing her in a situation where she would never recover and Peach and Peachs' Mom had to take care of her because the rest of the family couldn't give a flying fuck about her. This affected the time me and Peach could have together, and i decided to help in anyway i can like always did. This also affected Peach's life a lot, because she almost never had time for herself (she is just 19 for fucks sake), and this of course affected the time we could be together. 

Summer passes, we had great fun because when she could she always would hang out with me and our friends, but obviously Peach's Grandma would never get better.


Skipping to this month, i started to notice something different in the way she would text me, like all the affection was gone. I didn't let it affect me and said to myself it was because she was tired because of all the bullshit she has to deal. We couldn't see each other more than usual, which i found very odd but didn't make much deal out of it. I tried to ask her out sometimes when i knew she had spare time, and she would always give me an excuse to not to. 

Day 20 of this month as i type this, i came home from an Internship (that i'm currently doing) and texted her if she was alright or how was your day and stuff like that. I then asked her if she wanted me to go see her and she said she wanted to go take a walk. 

We meet, we haven't seen for a while so i kissed her hello and then tried to hug her, i noticed she took a step back like she didn't want to. So i hold her hand and ask ""how are you?"", she skipped that and said she had something very bad to tell me. 

At the time i was clear minded about our relationship and instinctively thought it was something about her grandma. But then she dropped the bomb. She said she didn't felt the affection she felt when we started dating, or any kind of attraction at all. I kept my head cool as i heard this, and said if something could be done. She replied that she needs this and it was not my fault, that it was her. She only told me that she had ""changed"", and ""just so you know that all this time, i was happy"".


At this point, i knew i couldn't do nothing to avoid this, so i asked ""what next?"", she said that we could still be friends. As i heard this, i couldn't contain my emotions anymore and just started crying, letting it all out. I tried to talk to her like this but the shock was so great that i couldn't even articulate at this point. She was just like how i was, but was still trying to hold her tears. After i finally could speak, i asked her if maybe in the future we could still have another chance, and she replied that only time will tell. 

As we calmed down a little, we came to a conclusion that we didn't have anything else to say to each other, even though when this is all over we would have a thousand things to say. We reached the part were we would part ways, and i made her promise me something: ""Don't stop living your life because of your family ok?"" and she replied, still trying not to cry: ""Yes, i promise i will"". 

I stick my hand out, has a signal to make her give me her hand. She does, holds me, and replies:""You're only making this harder than it is"". As i hold her hand lovingly for one last time, i look at her and say: ""I just wanted to know, that even after all this, i still love you like i always did."" 

I turn around, she does the too, i look back, and realize i will never see the love of my life again.

This is our story, and i keep wondering if there was something that i should have done better? i was always there when she needed, i helped here with her grandma a lot, and her grandma appreciated me. What happened to the ""i love you, and nothing will change that"" type of things that she used to tell me? Maybe someone could give me insight.

TLDR: GF suddenly breaks up with me after everything was going well."

I'm wondering if anyone knows of any companies that do internships or apprenticeships in IT. I graduated in 2014 in I.C.T and I'm currently working in a call center. I've had no luck whatsoever, I'm pretty sure it's down to lack of experience.

I'm stuck in a rut and want out of call centers and want to finally get a something going long term or something I can make a career out of. I'd be willing to work for nothing I'm that desperate. Does anyone have any friendly advice or know any where that offers any internships/apprenticeships. I'd greatly appreciate it. "
78h4s4,11,2017-10-24,Young Marriage Problems,theflyeman63,Marriage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/78h4s4/young_marriage_problems/,"Hi everyone,

This will be long bare with me, but I need insight.

I am at a lost in my Marriage. I am [21]M she is [20]F. Yes I know we are a young couple and have dated since High School when I was 16, she 15. We never really had much issues with our relationship it was perfect, we was that perfect couple. But after we married, it seems my wife has changed. 

Some background first. I am a college student in my senior year, I will be graduating in May 2018, looking to leave my hometown to expand my horizons and opportunities. I work as an Intern at a good company in town and make good money in a part-time position, its not a lot, but it gets us by I guess. My wife has been in and out of school not really sure what she wants to do, she expressed desire to be a stay at home mom, but Kids right no is crazy to me, I have to finish school and leave my hometown, she wants to leave town as well. So she doesn't work, but is now looking for a job understanding that we are struggling and need to prep for if we move out of state. 

So back to when the troubles started. Earlier this month my wife was acting very distant. She expressed to me she was always bored and that we were boring and don't do anything fun. I told her that I will do whatever she wants to do, gave her countless suggestions just to get out the house, we never had much money so we was a bit limited. She just shrugged at every suggestions. I said why don't we just do something, its better than nothing. Shrug again. This was a common problem that we went back and forth with. She expressed wanting a baby, again I told her I didn't want that now, and she knew beforehand I wanted to wait when we was a little older. She then said she wasn't sure about our relationship anymore, expressing she never been with many other people, we were opposites in a lot of ways (I'm willing to do whatever she wants to do in terms of activities though), and she never been with anyone else. We had a big argument and she apologized and said she wanted to be with me saying that is why she wanted to get married in the first place. Suffice to say though I was very angry with her though, feeling like she pushed the marriage, we been together for so long, so why is she feeling like this? 

She acted out of character that night smoking weed, which I don't agree with and she knows that. She came home and tried to have sex, her breath stunk from the weed and turned me off, I told her I didn't want to have sex. I was already upset with her from before with her doubting our marriage. She pushed the sex, and we had angry sex. I know I was wrong here, it was never my intention to hurt her, I never want to hurt her, but I was angry, I never get that angry before. But, throughout the sex she never told me to stop, so I kept going, plus to be frank she climaxed quite a lot. She was upset after stating she was hurt by the sex and said she was going to leave for the night. I protesting saying I was sorry, I didn't know I hurt you, please stay with me. She said she was going over a friends house, a male who lives a couple doors down. My thinking was if she wants to leave, she wants to leave, I messed up and pleaded with her to stay, but if she really wanted to stay she would of. 

Wrong.

The next morning she was even more angry that I even let her go over to another man's house and let her sleep there, saying I didn't try to stop her. What does she want me to do? Grab her? I already hurt her, I don't want to do it again. Go over to his house and bang on the door? Maybe I should of been more of a man, I see that now, I know I am a bit of a pushover. We talked it out and moved past the issues.

Yet another issues came up.

I was paranoid she slept with him or something that night, so I looked through her phone which I never do, mind you she always looks through my phone. I was honest with her and told her I look through it, expressing I feared she may have cheated, she just got angry with me again saying I betrayed her trust. Later that day we made up again.

Here again she brought up the baby situation saying that it will draw us together and give us a common goal, and she pointed out that when she has the baby we would have moved by then as it would be in the summer anyways. I pondered it, but still gave her a no. I tried to reach out to here every chance I could, she remained distant. We had a discussion and she said, what if I sleep with someone else just once? I gave her hard no's several times, but she kept bringing up the case. My thinking was she seemed like she wasn't even sure what she wanted anymore in a relationship, marriage, and hell even herself. I gave in and told her if she needs to get it out of her system whatever, I was at a lost and she kept beating the issue. I would be ok, I wanted her to be sure she wants to be with me, don't waste my time, what was all these years for? You wanting to get married for?

The next day, she instantly got to looking for a candidate. Shocked me that she was actually going to do it, but I said whatever. Later that night, she said to me it hurt her that I was even going to let her do that and hurt our marriage(mind you this is why I was saying no several times before I even said yes, after she pleaded her case). She also said she was hurt that I would rather let her sleep with someone else than give her a baby. We had another argument, but made up again.

Now here, I know I probably messed up again. We had unprotected sex. I thought maybe if i give her what she wanted, she wouldn't leave me? She would love me again? And I seen how much she was disappointed when I reached for the condom, this has been the close I have got to have sex with her in weeks, and our sex is always amazing. So we had unprotected sex, and honestly it was magical. But instant regret I felt, because what if the one time was all it took for her to get pregnant? (we don't know if she is yet, her period should be soon). I thought fuck it man, whatever happens we will face it together, we have to, but told her I don't want to have unprotected sex like that again. I know I caved, should of been more strong, but hell I want to have sex like that with her all time, but I just feel like I can't. I had to prove my love to her I felt by having sex like that. 

So after that she keep trying to have sex like that and would throw a fit if we didn't and basically shut me down and ignored me if it wasn't going to be like that again. I kept telling her that I would prefer we don't have a baby now, but if that one time is all it took, I'll still be happy and face whatever comes our way. She felt me not wanting a baby with her meant I didn't love her or want her, which is completely wrong and I have told her that. So this was the fight for the next few days, we seemed to have got past that.

Then,
My mother calls and ask if me and my wife want to go to this show at the theater. I know my wife really wanted to see this show. So I ask her if she wants to go, she seems indifferent and remembers she can't because she has a babysitting job that night (her attempts to bring in more money which I have told her I greatly appreciate). I told her dang that sucks, we can do something else I know you wanted to go to that, again she was indifferent. My moms calls back and says she is in the area and was going to visit my wife, I was at work. Before she heads over there she ask if my wife can go to the show, I say sadly no. She asks if I want to go? I say sure, let me run it by my wife. (Which I have been trying to run by plans with her) My mom gets to her first and tells her that I was going to the show. My wife was furious, and didn't want to or try to understand that I was trying to get to her first. She seemed fed up and said she was just done saying shit like this keeps happening and I keep messing up. Saying she is so close to leaving. I pleaded my case, I want to fight for this, I love her, but damn stuff has got hard. I am human. 

I told her that what I feel our issue is unmet expectations, saying that you have all these expectations of me that I am not aware of and when I don't meet them you get angry. So lets figure out what I need to do and whats expected of me. I thought this was a really good topic I brought up, she just shot it down saying that all she wants is common sense, and the stuff she wants is common sense and I should know, but the thing is I don't know. So that got us nowhere. 

We have dabbled in bible studies and really enjoyed them, so I suggested we study together again about marriage. She seems indifferent and calls me a hypocrite saying how can we study for one thing and not do another, claiming that the bible says that sex is not for selfish means and its purpose is to make babies. This just got me angry and I let it go. 

Things seem to have gotten better, so we try to have sex again, and it was the worst sex ever. From the get go she didn't seem that into it. The power went out during a storm, and our neighbor banged on our door to see if our power was out. We tried to get it started again, but yeah wasn't working. I became incredibly frustrated. I told her I felt like if we didn't have a baby she was going to leave me. She got really angry again.

Things seemed better for that night and the next day. I am willing to get past things, willing to be better and do what is needed and expected of me, but she brings up the same stuff again and isn't willing to forgive or get past it. She kept saying she wanted to leave this morning and I just stood there confused, exhausted, trying to understand, I know I messed up, I understood that and know what I need to do different and I have been trying to be better, but its like egg shells, I try to be honest and express my feelings and blow up. She left again this morning to go over to that friends house. Here i'm not sure does she want me to chase her and try to act like I care every time she leaves, like she said before? I should I just let her leave? Its damned if I do, damned if I don't. 

I ask her what is needed from me and expected and she just shrugs every time. I really am trying but I feel like she isn't and doesn't want to. Honestly I feel like all these issues revolves back to her being unsure of marriage in the first place, I feel like she feels she is trapped, scared of that actually commitment, regretful of the things she didn't get to do. That why she wants a baby so bad, to give our relationship relevance again. I just don't know what to do, I want to fight for this, I don't like to give up, but giving up is so easy for her and she does it quite a lot. When things get hard or someone wrongs her even once, she gives up on them and cuts them off. I pleaded with her that it wasn't always this bad and won't be, cause it never was before we can get past this if we let it. She shrugs again saying she wants to leave. Yet she seems to get over, then bring it up again. What is the solution? What do I need to do? I am at a total lost. I just feel that she is so unsure of herself and what she wants that our marriage will fail. 

TLDR;

Young couple in early 20s having issues. Relationship has been perfect until our marriage, we were high school lovers. Wife's been in and out of school, I am nearly finished with it. She doesn't work, I have a good internship and make barely enough to support us. Now she understands she must work, didn't before. Wife expressed she felt upset and unsure of marriage because she didn't get to experience multiple boyfriends, lovers, and is trapped in a marriage now, also says we are boring when we have been doing the say stuff we have been doing since we dated in high school. We move past this and wanting a baby pops in the conversation, I feel this is due to her being bored, searching for relevance in marriage, and giving it meaning. I'm not ready for baby I'm nearly finished with school and I need to move from my hometown, she wants to do the same. I mess up along the with all these issues by having angry sex (due to her saying she doubted our marriage and partaking in stuff I don't approve of) she was hurt by it, but didn't protest to it before or during knowing I was mad, unprotected sex (thinking if I give her what she wants the issues will go away despite me really wanting to, but not being ready, only one time though, her period should be soon, unless one time was all it took), saying she could sleep with someone else, but she is even mad I would let her do this instead of giving her a baby. (I adamantly told her no to this, but she kept pressing the issue, I said fuck it do what you need to do). I offer repairs and fixes to our issues through finding out what my duties as a husband should be, and hers as a wife and wanting to draw close to the bible with bible study again, she pretty much shuts all those suggestions down. We move past all these things, but the issues still remains about the baby. I feel this all revolves around her being unsure of herself, what she wants, and our marriage from the start of it. Unsure of what to do, or if my marriage is a lost cause. Thank you."

I just started my first adult job at a media specialization company as an intern. I thought I would be helping create content for big name companies but for right now, I'm just the coffee errand boy who puts together meeting agendas and refills the water cooler.

I'm 5'9 with a slim athletic physique, dirty blonde hair with blue eyes. My girlfriend is 5'3, black hair, brown eyes with a petite and cute figure. We've been together since college and moved in together in the city after we both got jobs here. It hasn't been easy, to put it simply. We have been arguing and fighting a lot recently and our love life has become a bit dull.

http://37.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mams4uMRWD1qf7cdjo1_1280.jpg

Our usual day consists of waking up in our small apartment, getting ready for work, watching Netflix or movies together, and then going to bed. I wish our lives were more exciting than this. I feel like we are starting to become a couple that doesn't do exciting or new things.

One day, I hear someone moving in across the hall into apartment 4E which has been empty for a couple of months. Later that night, I woke up suddenly to loud music and girls yelling and screaming. It was only Tuesday. After my girlfriend and I woke up several times throughout the night, she asks me angrily to tell whoever it is making that noise to keep it down. I angrily walk into the hall and bang on the door. Someone opens the door after a few seconds, the music gets louder, and my jaw almost hits the floor. A woman with bright highlighted blonde hair, smokey blue eyes surrounded by heavy eyeliner, thick juicy red lips, spray tanned dark skin, and humongous fake breasts barely held back by your bra and tank top. ""What's up?"" she says in a bored and playful way, blowing a large bubble with her bright pink gum. Her less attractive girlfriends still behind her giggle and then resume dancing and drinking. I pause for a moment, still in awe of your unbelievable figure.

https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/15043501_1077607605689537_1830411655922581504_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyMDYxNDA2MzYyOTIyNDIwOA%3D%3D.2.c

""Uh, it's three in the morning."" I say while trying to be serious and convey my point. ""Can you girls.. try to keep it down?"" I say while still eyeing you from head to toe. ""Sure thing, sexy. But next time you should come by and have fun with us."" You say playfully again. I reluctantly break eye contact and walk back to my room. I lay down next to my girlfriend and she asks tiredly, ""Who was that?"" ""Just some girls?"" I lie. The truth is, you're not just some girl. You're the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on, and the new sex symbol that just moved in across the hall.

The next few weeks turn out to be pretty difficult. I can't stop thinking about your body, flirtatious personality and my boring love life. Every time I see you in the hallway or elevator you throw me a wink or stretch showing off your body wrapped in your tiny inappropriate clothes. I start to think less and less about my girlfriend and think more and more about you. These days I seem to find any excuse to stop by your apartment or catch a glimpse of you as you head out with your girlfriends to have fun in the city. I just can't stop thinking about you..

Hey there and thanks for reading. The kinks I want to explore in this prompt are cheating, betrayal, hesitation, bimbofication, public sex, caught cheating, and corruption.

If you want to roleplay, I would like to discuss the character you will be playing a bit. Would you her to be a stripper, exotic dancer, or even a street walking whore? Do you take joy in helping break my girlfriends heart? Will you stop at nothing until I'm your play thing and I do everything you ask?

Let me know if you add anything or have any other ideas for the prompt. Looking forward to hearing from you :)"
78i360,3,2017-10-24,"4.0 student, to weed smoking, to loosing my friends, to going brok",kponthebeat,Weed_Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Weed_Drugs/comments/78i360/40_student_to_weed_smoking_to_loosing_my_friends/,"I am currently enrolled in my final semester of my undergrad. The past year and half to two years have completely changed who I am, and before I say the things im about to, do your best to not judge. 

There I was completing my freshmen year with a 4.0, and had even captured an internship that following summer (which was quite impressive as a freshmen). All of the problems which I am dealing with currently cant be derived from one specific cause, but of a mix of factors. One of the biggest factors is that my family was broke, or broker than that of my friends. I have an older brother who is quite successful, but he basically supports the entire fam. However, both of my parents were labor worker, and my mother has recently stopped working due to her inability to move around. pops work at a convenience store. I never really had problems with my family, up until I started my heavy use of weed, which dragged me very far from social norms. I should also mention, my family, including my brother, are very very religious. 

I have started smoking weed in high school, and it was just to chill and kick back with the bois. This was not the case starting my spring sophomore semester. long story short, I met a couple of people, who i no longer chill with, and I started smoking heavy. Mind you, this was a kid who smoked 1, max 2 blunts every week with at least 1-2 other friends, now turned into smoking a blunt alone every single day of that semester. In a matter of time, I was hooked. a part of that was because my parents were too strict, and wouldnt really allow me to do shit (being 19 years old and not going outside the house after 839-9). As a result, I smoked a blunt before I had to be home everyday, in order to dull my emotions from parents. I should also mention I was not allowed to dorm anywhere, because simply my parents could not afford it (both of my parents are illegal immigrants so brother and I did not receive financial aid). I also drank alot, and whenever my friends would invite me somewhere, appropriate with the time I had to be home, I just got shit faced, because I knew I wouldnt get a chance to enjoy again. This is legit guys, my parents were very uptight, culturally, religiously, and in almost 70% of my lifestyle. They often compared my brother, religious, graduate in college with a striving job (pays him little more than 40,000, but that was alot from a family which came from very little wealth), and even now has found a perfect girl for him. The following summer, I continued to abuse alcohol, and the rate at which I was smoking weed sky rocketd even higher. same story in the fall. At this point, I was working as a teller (Making $14 @ 25-30 hrs a week). 

Money: a big part of where I am currently. Throughout college i was a tutor, and the minimal money I earned ($250-$400 a paycheck) I gave to my brother because he was basically paying for my tuition, and legit all the bills, while my pops and moms combined to pay the rent of the apartment we were staying at. From the very start, I had no money to myself, to do anything. in the summer of 16 throughout the fall I had worked as a teller ($14@ 25-30 hours). The pay was decent, but again I gave nearly 90% of all of that money earned towards my tuition, and car insurance. As a result, I start stealing from the bank I used to work at, just to support my weed use, and occasionally have some money to enjoy with friends. It was not right to any extent, but i was just so fucking tired of being left out of trips, bar nights, and literally anything enjoyable. I was soon terminated from the position, which led me to having no job by the Christmas of 2016. From the start of everything, my brother had given me his credit card to use for gas, and other necessities, and if i had used it anywhere else, he would get an alert, and in a matter of moments he would be on my ass about how we dont have money. most of the times I was forced to hand over all my spendings to big brother so that it would  help him pay for bills, but man what the fuck was I supposed to do: I had no fucking cash. 
Even after i got terminated, I somehow found weed. 
I am currently in my last semester, and god have i been working hard to find a job, but recruits either hire someone else for their experince, or for the fact I am not a US citizen. I have stopped smoking for couple of days, because im completely broke. One of my best friends has agood job, buys whatever the fuck he wants, and his parents dont give a shit if he drinks. Everything has led me to the all time low right now. 

fucking blows not seeing friends, or flaking plans because I have no money. I havent shopped for clothes for over a year, and my newest pairs of kicks feature from Walmart. 

I know the position I am in right now, and something is bound to come my way, although sometimes I loose hope.

78iqs8,3,2017-10-24,Brought up OCD to my counselor for the first time today,catonaswivelchair,OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/78iqs8/brought_up_ocd_to_my_counselor_for_the_first_time/,"So after much fear, anxiety, and hesitation I brought up my OCD to my counselor for the first time today. I just go to counseling at my university and I always have the interns. It takes me awhile to get comfortable with them before I delve into what's truly bothering me. OCD is the main reason I came back to counseling after being gone for 9 months. I just came to realize last year that I have OCD after many years of not knowing how to explain my experiences. I brought this up to my intern counselor at my previous university but because they were always booking a month out and overwhelmed, the only time I got to mention it, it was our last session together since I was graduating. 

There is no doubt in my mind that I have OCD. I have intrusive thoughts and the weird little routines I have to do everyday. It's not a debate. But I know they're always skeptic of people like I KNOW I have this. I printed off a list of symptoms I have so I wouldn't have to painstakingly explain each symptom on my own. I'm not sure if she appreciated it or not. I don't know exactly what I expected her reaction to be. But it was was more like okay. So what do you want to do about it? Why did you want to bring it up? And I guess for me it's like...I want to talk about it here cause I have no one else to talk about it to. I want validation, I want coping strategies, but above all I just want to confide in someone.

In all honestly she's not the best counselor I've had. I still like her though. But I'm not necessarily a goal oriented person. I am, but I'm not. I don't know what my goals are at this point. I just need to put it out there. I've been in denial of having OCD and I don't want to live with that denial any longer.

It was poorly developed and I was left alone with nothing to do for days on end. I had one friend there, but he was just as depressed as me and when we got stressed we drifted apart. 

I have osteoarthritis throughout my body, burst lumbar discs, and daily issues with pain, cramps, and muscle spasms. My closest friend is my ex, and we broke up after our mental issues and my pain drove us apart.

I spend most days hoping the pain will go away just long enough to at least get something done. Whether it's attempting a load of laundry or trying to go to the gas station for some tea and small talk, anything has been a huge accomplishment.

I vividly remember each disc bursting, and it was followed by months of not being able to walk. I lost my job at the time (can't do custodial work if you can't stand for 5 minutes) and spent the summer broke and loathing life.

Right now feels a lot like that. I'm running out of money. Every job interview has been so close but I don't get it in the end. I've got another one tomorrow, but I've been feeling so sick. All of my joints are aching, and I certainly don't feel up to trying to sell myself as a great employee in this mindset.

All I can do is put on that smile and act confident. Fingers crossed it goes well, and that things start to get a little better soon.

78jiv3,18,2017-10-24,Last week has been good for me!,Kittymahri,FFRecordKeeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/78jiv3/last_week_has_been_good_for_me/,"I've had a lot to deal with, in game and in real life, but I've managed to be productive with both. (Though it does mean my next EX Modes post will be delayed a bit more.)

The Renewal Dungeons gave a certain sense of satisfaction, not just for unlocking a few Core Record Materia as I nearly close the gap, but also for some revenge. Specifically, the last event where I was not able to beat the Ultimate Dungeon was the FFX Window to the Past; I had enjoyed that they managed to turn a series of cutscene backstory into a full event but was sad that I couldn't complete it. Well, I can hear Jecht now, saying ""You're late."" It's true that by now I've already beaten tougher versions of Yunalesca and Braska's Final Aeon, but leaving some business unfinished would feel like such a sin.

But there's a lot more that I'm more proud of than some powercreeped events:

# FFII stuff

For months, I had been planning pulls on the current banners because I have only one, maybe two, good Soul Breaks in this realm. Yes, that one important one is Meteor XVI, but I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to beat the D200 Torment Cid Mission with just that (and maybe Hand of the Emperor) - it was hard to keep everyone hasted, buffed, and healed while producing enough damage output.

But a few things deterred me from actually doing a pull. First, the redundancy of this banner with similar things in other realms, when people are saying the meta is shifting away from realm synergy. Second, in beating the full event without any new toys, just upgraded abilities. Third, Magicites now exist to fill some gaps; Enkidu is godsend for a Torment like this one, and the elemental dampener plus resistance boon passives can help with merely surviving.

So, without further ado:

|Hero|Ability 1|Ability 2|RM|LD(+++)|SB|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
|Maria, 94|Ruinga R4|Meltdown R2|Devotion||Meteor XVI|
|Leon, 75|Draw Fire R5|Magic Break R4|Masterful Mercenary||Hand of the Emperor|
|Gordon, 78|Wrath R4|Entrust R2|Ace Striker|||
|Emperor, 76|Faith R4|Curaga R5|Royal Benediction||Veil of Protection|
|Minwu, 74|Shellga R3|Curaja R5|Pulse Kindness||Mass Mending| 

RW: Sentinel's Grimoire

Magicite: Enkidu

&amp;nbsp;

The key is that by not relying on Haste or extra heals, Gordon is now free to Entrust to Maria, who can spam her BSB entry. This can quickly get rid of the Thunder Gigas who has the most dangerous attacks, and safely take out the Ice Gigas who would counter everything else.

A few miscellany: Gordon doesn't need to equip a weapon. In fact, this lowers his accuracy, and if he ever attacks Leon, he might miss and the Masterful Mercenary RM's counter can still activate. Quite neat, so Gordon can build SB and Leon can heal. Also, some of the trash rounds have dangerous magical attacks, which is why Shellga is more important than Protectga here, and why Leon should expend a couple uses of Magic Break if necessary. In these rounds, Maria should use her spells to deal with the enemies as quickly as possible. In safer rounds, Maria and Gordon can attack Leon while Emperor and Minwu can auto-heal. The shared Protectga is probably necessary, the shared Medica probably isn't, and Hand of the Emperor might not be since it's only for a stacking DEF buff.

# First sub-30: Holy Mages vs Shadow Dragon

This is one that's quite important to me, because of how much I've invested. All the videos I've seen involved some Overstrikes, especially Cid Raines's, and I didn't have the ones that everyone seemed to be using. I had already invested a lot in chasing Hope relics, and Legend Diving Cid Raines after not getting anything dive-worthy during the fest. And what's more, I had invested even more. Thanks to the ""DeNA Intern"", I had a second choice on the Crystal Tower Select, and had no idea what to choose. I read some comments about how Sarah's Burst was good for Magicites because of her Bard access, and I took a gamble on that despite my second thoughts. Did I really need yet another holy-boosting robe? Did I really need another healing Burst after having so many, especially for a rare realm? Did I want to commit to unlocking Allegro Con Moto for her, despite the uncertainty of the BRA BRA events (thankfully that's no issue anymore) when access to Allegro Con Moto would be extremely limited and when there were so few Bard skills? Well, it paid off.

|Hero|Ability 1|Ability 2|RM|LD(+++)|SB|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
|Cid Raines, 99|Memento Mori R1||Witch's Cackle|LM1+LM2|Metamorphose|
|Hope, 99|Shellga R3|Alexander R5|Scholar's Boon||Divine Judgment, Explosive Fist, Last Resort|
|Sarah, 76|Allegro Con Moto R1|Curaja R5|Gathering Storm||Age-Old Hymn|
|Faris, 99|Wrath R4|Entrust R2|Mako Might|||
|Onion Knight, 99|Faith R4||Dr. Mog's Teachings||Vessel of Fate| 

RW: Fabula Guardian

Magicite: Mist Dragon

&amp;nbsp;

It was a very tight 0:29.42 the first time I did it, with some help from RNG, but after leveling a Kirin Magicite for its Empower Holy passive, it shaves enough time for a comfortable margin of error.

There's definitely not enough initial DPS to skip the first Black Fang, so the key is to control who gets sacrificed. Onion Knight is the least useful after he brings his initial buffs (Haste and ATK/MAG +30% to the party, Faith on Hope; some substitutes are acceptable like Serah with Endless Blessings or Rikku with Hyper Mighty G). Thus on the first turn, Cid Raines should aim a Memento Mori at Onion Knight, after Sarah summons Elara and Hope casts Shellga. Onion Knight needs to be equipped with just enough RES to survive but not too much, to ensure that he has the lowest HP%.

Faris was chosen as the Entruster because of her high SPD and HP stats. Better alternatives are Shelke or Morrow with LM2 (no ETA) or Ramza with LMR, but it turns out not to be necessary. Faris needs to Entrust to Cid Raines (so he can activate his BSB), then Wrath once and Entrust to Hope (so he can activate his BSB1), then Wrath twice and Entrust to Hope again.

Hope's Soul Breaks are interesting. The Overstrike, which I lack, is more than twice as strong on entry as anything else. However, due to the damage cap, the BSB2 is capable of 9999x6, and the SSB is capable of 9999x8, though in practice, I've gotten closer to 8500x8. The SSB has the next highest multiplier after the OSB, but for some reason it has a cast time of 3.0 seconds instead of 2.5 seconds like the others. The BSB1 is important for the En-Holy, but it has a lower multiplier and is limited to four hits. The BSB2 gives a self-buff, and while this pushes things to over the buff soft cap, it's faster than the SSB (which should just be a finisher). In any case, Allegro Con Moto is necessary to ensure that all these stay within the time frame.

Surprisingly, Sarah's BSB gets so little use; it may be activated towards the end of some runs. And it might not be necessary if she equips Curada. But it's still good to have for some clutch runs (just make sure it's cast before the 25-second mark so she can take advantage of Thunder God Mode).

A few other details: Cid Raines is equipped with a holy-boosting staff and a holy-boosting robe, both combined (partly or reforged) - this makes his fully buffed BSB entry approach 9999x8, so it's almost as good as having his OSB. Paladin Cecil's Level 99 RM is technically better for Cid Raines due to how Materia interact, but I don't have that. Hope is equipped with his holy-boosting bracer and a natural 6\* rod for the stats. Everyone except Sarah has completed their 4\* Dives. Dark Resistance accessories are favored; Sarah gets the Major Resist. Sub-Magicites include Enkidu and Kirin for the offense boons, plus Hydra and Sand Worm for the defense boons.

 Now let’s get to the crack team of people working on our disability cases. Least in the California/Nevada side. So before my first denial, my case was apparently tossed back and forth between an office in my current home state of Nevada, and my birth state of California. This made it difficult to contact them. In fact, even when they kept sending me letters to contact them, they never answered the phone nor returned my calls when I left a message with my claims handler. I kind of wish I was back in that lovely back and forth. At least I wouldn’t be concerned they are gaslighting me.


 Throughout this process I am trying to send them blood tests (as this is a blood disease technically, so the proof is in jittery intern needle pricks), pictures showing my swollen hand held up next to my non swollen hand, document after document that they sent me constantly badgering me for my day to day activities of not stressing out about my day to day activities (which eventually lead to a chart explaining my disorder as they clearly were not getting how being allergic to stress is at all an issue in the job market, and how going to college to get a degree for a less stressful job is shockingly counter-intuitive), and some other important medical documents. That was a year ago. I found out a couple months ago they never got those documents. Remember that, as this part of the story happened a year or more ago.


 Eventually, I get notice I need to go to a doctor and a shrink for my physical and medical evaluation. The ones they picked out and asked me to go to, mind you. This is also something you should remember.


 As I still couldn’t get a hold of my claims handler at this time and being naive and innocent to the idea they may be actively fucking with me, I brought every bit of proof I wanted them to have and ask them to send it to them. As I imagined the doctors would have a quick, foolproof method of getting in contact with Social security and giving them all these papers. They do this all the time after all.


 Now that you are back from the surgical procedures your insurance won’t cover from busting your gut laughing at the poor sweet innocence in that thought, I am sure you will be not at all surprised that, a year later, I found out they never got those files. Remember how I told you to remember those previous bits? Well, sadly we ain’ done with this chapter of the future explanations of why I have an aneurysm, so continue remembering and lump this lunacy in with it. The doctor didn’t even make note of me giving them those files. Not surprising. She did nothing to help her figure out my disability and instead had me do stretches meant for a back problem and limb issues. I wasn’t swelling at that time. I had pictures showing me swollen, showed them to the doc myself. NO mention in the notes though. How strange.


 So, after what felt like an eternity I got my first denial letter. Back in October 2016. I almost felt like framing the damned thing, as strangely enough spite seems to be the main thing that keeps me functioning these days. The reason in this denial letter is 1) they didn’t see me having it for longer than a year. As I have had it for 27 years and had it plaguing my life for 11, I think I ruined my eyesight in one eye a little from the frequency it twitched. PRactically heard the click of an ancient movie camera. The second reason was 2) because they didn’t see it affecting my ability to work. Which after a long line of being fired, fucked with, or ignored about my disorder until forced to quit due to pain and danger to my health… As I was still working with the assumption they had the papers I had all but sent a herd of owls to get to them. I might even be subjected to finding stamps (Of the licking and mailing variety)! Surely the email had sent it to them, but shockingly no.


 So I get a lawyer. Correction, I try to. After countless calls that end in a ‘we’re booked up’, ‘we can’t take your case’, and one getting me to stop going to community college (graphic design at the time. I was swollen almost 24/7.. Better than culinary, computer science, and engineering before that! But nah. Clearly fine to work) because “no lawyer would take you as it is considered work’. No one fires me from school. Any job I could actually get? Not as lenient I am afraid. Not to the guy in his twenties who smokes pot, is hyperactive, and has this weird allergy to stress. I am sure EVERYONE fucking believes me when I say that. Can you sense the sarcasm? CAN YOU READ THE AGITATION AND PAST EXPERIENCES IN THE SUBTEXT? Well, now you do whether you wanted to or not. Quite stressful really.


 Finally, someone agrees to help me, even files the appeal for me same day I meet them. You think this is where the triumphant trumpets would play. Nah. Turns out after seeming like he would be helpful, getting me to have my doctors and such fill out paperwork, get more blood tests to prove I STILL have the damned thing, blah blah, all of which were sent to him. (-sigh- Remember that) to send to the main office. Suddenly, I get a call from my claims handler! Losing the bet with myself that it was a cardboard cut out in an office chair with a voice recorder taped behind it, I got a physical being for once.


 Turns out they had been trying to contact my ‘lawyer’ for the past few days and they weren’t answering. I tried to call them, still not answering. Weeks go by and we still can’t get ahold of him nor can I get a hold of the tiki god that has apparently cursed my bloodline for dishonoring their totem. Claims handler, in an eye-twitchingly HILARIOUS turn of events, is actually answering my calls now. Sadly, my lawyer still isn’t. Minus answering my voicemail complaining about all this with an ‘I’ll get right on it’ voice mail.


 Also, this is when I learned they don’t have any of my blood tests, files, or pictures. The ones I have been sending them, been giving to lawyers and doctors they sent me too, is not in their files at all.


 As well, in order to fire my lawyer in the case of being unable to get them to pick up your calls, you apparently need to write a handwritten, signed note. Then mail it to them. Which I did, folded over the countless things they should have had ages ago.


 Week later? They have those files, nothing about that handwritten note that was literally folded around these things. Whatever, clearly, they just haven’t processed it. I never found out what happened to this magic letter and then I am left to wait after I ask if there is anything they need, and I go on the hunt for a new lawyer. Turns out, since the previous one didn’t send me a withdrawal letter, lawyers won’t help me! Cause that one might still get my money. Seems like quite the legal issue! If only there were a professional whose career it was to help people when a crooked fucker preys on the disability cases. I’ll tell you when I figure out what the name of that profession is, but to finish up this lawyer tidbit, with a bunch of letters out I still haven’t gotten a response back. I have gotten too mentally exhausted to explain this over and over.


 They got a shorter, cliffnotes rant. This one is more cathartic than anything. As well, in the very least if I die from my throat swelling up, brain swelling up, dehydration from gastrointestinal tract swelling up, or something to that effect then the likely cause is at least known to any willing to read me complain.


 We are getting to the end, as only a couple more hiccups have caused me headaches. That come to memory. I call my claims handler see where my case is at. While my Dad is trying to help me (which Social Security even asked me why my Dad just can’t support me for the rest of my life. Casual and flat tone too. Pricks.) with my medical costs, giving me a place to live, ect, I don’t like burdening him. I have seen plenty of posts bout a similar plight, so I am sure you can gather.


 So I pestered them. My claims handler said my claim had progressed, but she didn’t know to what point and I needed to call the main social security office in my city for more information… So I really don’t know what that person’s job description is, but she ain’ handling my case well as she implies. SO, I do just that. After waiting 45 minutes for what has my vote as the most obnoxiously repetitive hold system I have ever been put through, I get told that it is in the ‘identification phase’, that they are having trouble verifying something, and that I am not allowed to know what that thing is. I never found out, but they repeated this when i tried to ask more questions, and as I got annoyed that I was apparently not allowed to know about my own claim, I was abruptly hung up on.


 The week later, I get my denial letter. Claiming that while my disorder does hinder me, I can and I quote from the letter, “We have determined that you can adjust to other work”. Eventually, I am able to get a new lawyer, who I have had for a few months. After being told that it was never in their policy to have a handwritten note sent. (Well fuck, who was phone then?!) and that they had no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned being in the ‘identification phase’ I was able to convince them to help me. They even managed, after much struggle, to get my old lawyer dropped! Sad thing is they haven’t sped matter up. Even after more photos and proof and blood tests. Even as my stomach acid rots my teeth to the point I can hardly eat anything harder than bread or a baked potato without having to fight through pain. Doesn’t stop me, because I am forced to deal with pain so I might as well agonize my way through something delicious.


 I am on year three. I am still waiting. I still get little if any word from SSI or my lawyers without pestering them, and even then it is a stretch. Months tick by, and I am forced to find out that the fairy tale about the government that cares, the sect of it that is made just to help those unable to make it is nothing more than a fantasy. Next to Santa and the Easter Bunny lies Uncle Sam."

I noticed he was super greedy with lots of things. He would invite me to dinners and we would split the bill. He never bought anything for me to eat and whenever I visited I would also grab a few things to eat from a local retail store. He bought me jacket for $70 and told me he was generous. (My ex spent 10 k for a vacation in Europe and he never brought it up). He also told me to be career with a mug he brought from Europe, so I started using a different one. He was lending me his Harry Potter book and told me to be careful because he said they no longer make them ( you can buy those for $10 on eBay). I was cold and he was going to lend me one of his scarves, but he said: pleas, please,please, don't forget to return. I refused to take it. I asked him to buy several potatoes and onions when he was food shopping, so he asked if i need 2 onions and 2 potatoes. I was sarcastic and said, bring one onion and one potato. He said ok. At that point I told him not to sweat over and not to buy anything at all. Which he did. Couple of times when I was brushing my teeth and he water was running, he came and turned off the water. He said I was wasting. He would get angry if I ran the tap water too long because I wanted to drink cold water and not warm. He didn't supply with me any drinks. But he expects me to see in his place 2-3 times a week. When I go, I take out all the trash in the house and do his dishes. One time I cleaned his whole bathroom and kitchen because I don't like when there is a mess. Yesterday I told him we were brought up differently and this relationship wouldn't work out in the long run. I food shopped and he was with me. When we came to his place, I assumed he would want to talk. But he didn't say anything. I spent about 20 min there not knowing what to do, and decided to leave at night. He lives in one town and I live in another. I would have to take a bus and two trains and also walk to get home. He said both and didn't stop me when I was leaving. He apologized for making me feel unwanted and he told me he never hosted parties in his place and didn't know how to take care of others. He didn't call or message. I know he mentioned he had Aspergers disease and I don't know what is it or how it affects. Other than these, he is sweet and caring, goes with me everywhere. Works full time and does part time masters degree, plus one day internship. I don't know what to do, am I asking too much? Should I message him or give him a week? I still have his key and some of my stuff in his place. 

tl;dr, I initiated the break up and the guy doesn't care whether I'm there or leaving. Didn't message or call. Don't know what to do 
--------------------------------
Edit: 

I thank everyone for your time and comments, even though some of you were really harsh. When he told me he had AS, I looked into it and didn't believe he was diagnosed because he was perfect and normal. Now I did a thorough research and I understand where the issue is coming from. Some suggested to run away from Aspies while others suggested that you can have very good romantic, peaceful life with them. My bad, he doesn't get sarcasm since he has highly male functioning brain. I love him very much and want to save the relationship but don't know how. If I'm right, he might have already moved on and I'm here still upset. As far as I know, he doesn't have any friends. I feel sorry for him. Other than that, he perfectly behaves as a normal person. I do want  a long term relationship with him, but I'm afraid as an Asperger he might change and stop loving me. I don't know what to do"

Both answers were correct from the interviewer's response. The 2nd round was where I had an issue. I told the interviewer that I can solve the problem inefficiently relatively easily and explained how. Then spent the next 20 minutes trying to figure out how to approach it in the most efficient way. I figured it out with 10minutes left and ended up giving a verbal explanation of the correct answer. The next round was HR which went really well. And the final round was with a large project manager and he seemed to really like me and my financial background aside from just the generic comp sci.

I was a sales intern working regular 9-5 hours and found that i would like to learn how to code so i can one day hopefully launch my own app or software. However that is a goal that i hope to accomplish a little later in my life but for now i would want to know how to code or sales purposes, as i have found that the leads i am given usually lead to a tech exert who tend to use very advance technological language. But of course first things first, i have to learn the basic language of coding. Now to my understanding there are recommended languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc. but I'm unsure of where to start. Personally i am willing to start with any of them but i was having a little trouble finding a reliable source that taught everything that there is to learn about the languages, which is why i am resorting to your help.

I have applied for TU Munich and received an admit. I have decent computer science background (3.7 GPA, 2 research-oriented internships, 2 years of work experience).


After my masters, I want to work and (permanently?) settle in a developed country. I have researched a bit and now am confused if Germany is the right option. I definitely love the idea of backpacking across the Schengen countries, the culture of munich, the work-life balance etc. But Quora and other online forums show contrasting opinions about the CS job market.


How are the CS career and job prospects in Germany? Please advice."
78m32y,9,2017-10-25,I'm incredibly lonely and feel like everyone's abandoning me.,calkitty,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/78m32y/im_incredibly_lonely_and_feel_like_everyones/,"I'm an upperclassman in college and outwardly seem to have everything together I guess—I have the internship of my dreams, go out a lot, have the rest of college set etc. My female friends are almost all in relationships or are in different professional/academic circumstances and don't have any free time, and I have no romantic prospects or even people I'm really interested in at the moment. I feel like I have to chase after people to have things to do and events to go to, and I'm tired of going clubbing with the same group of friends who are all dating each other, getting really drunk, sleeping with some guy, and not having any connection to look forward to.

I'm a very social person and it's killing me to not have anything to look forward to like this and especially to always have to initiate everything rather than anyone putting in the effort to spend time with me. For some reason I get along with guys a few years out of college a lot better, but I don't know how to even go about meeting people. Is there any way I can make this situation better?"
78m88e,7,2017-10-25,Not getting out of bed (me),Fiereddit,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/78m88e/not_getting_out_of_bed_me/,"The TL;DR would be: I can't get out of bed in the morning, help me. 

The long version:
I have a brain that won't shut down.  All day long, and unfortiunately, all night long, things are going around in my head.   

I'm 34, and currently I'm back in school.  I don't have a degree, didn't even finish school due to having a rough childhood.  I had the most shitty jobs, so I'm starting fresh as far as a career and education goes.  My head is pretty filled with things related to that: I need to make my assignment, I need to make copies of my presentation for the class, I need to fold iron wires (at least 10 to show our teacher I practiced making ross-fraser rings).  I need to refill my suitcase for internship.  I mustn't forget that I have an extra class on thursday evening.  I mustn't forget to write to diabetes federations to gather info for my thesis.  For which the presentation for the jury has moved from end of may, to mid-february, because my thesis subject would make a good addition the the classes that will be about diabetes.  That last bit makes my brain go in overdrive.

My head is also filled with kid-related stuff. One has a fieldtrip, and I wouldn't want, like last time, that he has to come home in the evening complaining about how I packed his normal books and pens for school, in stead of extra snacks and no books and sturdy shoes for the long walks.  My oldest son (authistic), went back to a regular school for the first time in 8 years, so it's not easy for him.  He needs help all the way.  My youngest son is already tired of school, and he's only 11.  He wants to move, play, talk, yell, anything but not sit down for 10 minutes to do his homework.  The oldest follows musiclessons (both music-note reading and guitarlessons), and ninjitsu.  Those are on tuesday 17:00-19:00, wednesday 18:30-20:00, friday 17:30-18:30 and sunday 9:00-11:00.  The youngest does ninjitsu as well, and choir practice, which is wednesday 13:00-15:00 and friday 18:00-20:00.  I bring them there and pick them up.  But I guess many here will recognize this.  Our house is also the hang-out, friends of my children are here all the time to hang.  Some of them are troubled kids, and I don't mind caring for them, but they also have a spot in my head.
  
When I graduate in june, I'll be starting my own business.  So I'm following seminars and classes about how to start up the business, and am starting to gather documents that will need to be filled in, to get a bit of a head start.  
  
Since I'm home more often, I also do the cleaning, cooking, dishes, laundry, ironing,..  I don't mind doing it, my husband has a fulltime job, I don't, but by the evening I'm just incredibly tired.  Quiet time starts around 21:30 in the evening.  I'll usually just mindlessly game a bit to give my head some rest.  And after that it's bedtime. 
  
I hate bedtime.  I never fall asleep just like that.  My husband's head hits his pillow and he's asleep.  I'm still wide awake at 3am, sometimes at 5am.  Alarm goes off at 7:15.  My husband and I have to get out of bed at the same time. 
 When the alarm goes off, I often don't even hear it, until my husband moves or pokes me, and I turn it off (snooze), so it'll go off again at 7:25, repeat above scenario (snooze), and when it' goes off the 3rd time, at 7:35 it's the time to really really get up.  I don't want to turn it off, until I'm properly awake, or I'll just slide back into careless slumber.  I keep my alarm going until I get up, and there is no danger of oversleeping.  
My husband on the other hand, does two things:   
-He refuses to get up as long as the alarm clock is going.  (his exact words)  
-When the alarm clock is turned off, he rolls back over and goes back to sleep.  
So this morning, I was quite sleep deprived and not ready to get up when the alarm went off for the third time.  My husband starts poking me, like with one finger in my back repeatedly to get me to shut down the alarm.  Which I don't want to do, because the day before, I did it his way: shutting down the alarm, because he will only get up when the alarm is off.  Result was that I fell back into slumber, and he rolled over and went back to sleep as well, so we overslept.  Waking up to a panicking authistic son who would much rather leave for school at 3am just so he would be very sure to be on time.  So this morning the bit of brain that was awake tought: no, we will not turn it off, because we will oversleep again.  So there was this struggle in my head: get up- no I'm to tired I was still awake at 4am- get up get up get up- nooo not yet, all the while my husband keeps poking my back.  My alarm went the full 5 minutes until it shut itself off. 
When my son was out the door, my husband raised his voice at me (he never does this), that he won't have it anymore that I leave the alarm clock on until someone is out of bed.  That it ruins his mood. That he won't get up until I shut down the alarm clock. 
  
I need something, or any advice on how to handle this.  We never argue.  But this thing is the first time ever, that he left for work with me just giving him quite a cold kiss, no hugs, no smiles.  Just: see you this evening.

78mey5,1,2017-10-25,Pray for me as I struggle with the sin of envy,hannaheunice,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/78mey5/pray_for_me_as_i_struggle_with_the_sin_of_envy/,"I've always suffered with low self-esteem and lack of confidence. However, I was also taught about Jesus and Christianity at a young age (through my mom, and my uncles were pastors). My relationship with God has been a roller coaster, but it's been better especially because my husband and I have been praying together more (something we hardly did when we were dating, only a few times). 

So I've always compared myself to others and never felt I stacked up or measured up. Sure I had those moments where I really felt God's love and presence and felt fearfully and wonderfully made by Him. But more often than that I've always felt inadequate. Being bullied a lot may have had to do with it, or having a really harsh mom (our relationship has been better though ever since I got married and moved out). I also have lupus and have dealt with bad flare ups between 2010-2014.

My husband's former co worker really grates on me, and yet I've never even met her before. Based on what I've seen on social media, she lives a ""perfect"" life. She is blonde and very thin, and was in a sorority in college. She's definitely not the type that would ever have been bullied! I'm Filipino and I have to work extra hard to stay thin, especially when I take a high dose of prednisone for my lupus and I gain a ton of weight (and it's impossible to lose it on prednisone). I've already struggled with my weight before taking prednisone to begin with, and it's one of the bigger things that affect my confidence. I'm back to being slimmer but I'll never be a size 00 like her. I know it sounds so shallow and petty, so forgive me because I need support and prayer. So she got married in 2014, and it really got to me because I was going through a tough time in my life with my lupus and not being to drive because I had seizures). And it feels like she loves to brag about how perfect her life is on Instagram. It hurt me because I was still in college at 24 due to health issues and my dads death, overweight, not driving and therefore couldn't work or intern because of the transportation issues. 

So it almost felt like she was rubbing that in my face even though we never met. My husband doesn't understand why I feel such animosity towards her. I guess everything she has was stuff I've always wanted, like marriage, a great career (she's a news producer and that pays pretty well) and being able to move to San Diego (which is where I've always wanted to live), already buying a house with her husband, them traveling a lot or having a ton of friends. I guess she represents everything I've wanted or wanted to be.

Eventually my husband did propose to me and we had a beautiful wedding, a fun honeymoon and we live in a small apartment with our 2 dogs. I couldn't be happier. I also just got a full-time job last month after a year of searching.

Long story short, husband showed me a photo of her announcing her pregnancy the other day. I hit the roof. Idk why it painfully affected me. We don't plan to have kids for another 4-5 years. Somewhere deep down I still want to have a child despite going through desiring a childfree phase. We're just not ready. And I know when the time comes when we plan to have children, I have to plan it with all of my doctors a year in advance and change my medications. I was filled with rage, envy and I started crying about it the next day during my lunch break. My husband and I have been talking about it because I kept saying ""She's had an easy life! She's never had to struggle!"" and he'd respond with ""How do you know? And what bearing does it have on your life?"" And he tells me that she's not this nasty person I imagine in my head. He's disappointed because he knows I'm better than the way I reacted about her pregnancy.

I don't understand why she triggers me so much. It would be easier to wallow in pity and think she is the b-word, but I know the more godly and mature way is to keep seeking Jesus and the Holy Spirit, asking to rebuke my feelings of envy. I just need prayers and help. It is hard to pray for rebuking and to be changed, but I still do it even when I'd rather feel sorry for myself. And I shouldn't because I know I am blessed in so many aspects of my life. Even though my mom is tough, she always reminds me to be thankful not just for everything but because having Jesus is more than enough. So I don't want to feel envious or bitter. Any practical and biblical advice (like some verses to help me) would be helpful. Forgive me for my attitude.

Tldr; husband's former co-worker really gets to me and has been for years, with her so-called perfect life."
78mowc,220,2017-10-25,[NeedAdvice] Now that I've graduated college I feel like I have no direction in life,directionthrowawai13,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/78mowc/needadvice_now_that_ive_graduated_college_i_feel/,"I'm 22 years old and in June I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Applied Physics. I originally wanted to major in Computer Science but my school has a competitive major system, and the only STEM field I was accepted into was the physics department. I applied for lots of jobs over the summer, lots of data analytics type roles and basically anything on indeed.com I seemed somewhat qualified for, but only got a few interviews, not even for very good jobs. Two months ago I ended up taking a job at Best Buy as a sales consultant in the computers department - basically I work a retail job selling computers and extended warranties at Best Buy.

All my life I just assumed I'd end up working in tech, since I'm from Silicon Valley and that's what everyone there does, but never put a ton of thought into what specifically. I've taken a decent number of CS classes, including upper-level ones like advanced algorithms and databases. I've enjoyed them, but to be honest I don't really have the attention span to be a programmer. I've tried to self teach myself in-demand languages like Node.js but I get so bored after an hour or two of staring at code. I liked my physics and math classes but they didn't really teach me any directly marketable skills. I could see coding being a part of my career or what I do, but definitely not straight coding 40 hours a week.

I don't know what to do to better my position in life. I obviously don't want to work at a damn Best Buy the rest of my life, but I really don't know where to go from here. I've thought about continuing my education in some kind of engineering field, but it seems so out of reach. I have a couple decent things on my resume but it certainly isn't amazing (an internship, helped a professor with some research, a hotel front desk job, etc.), and my undergrad GPA wasn't very good (graduated with a 3.16) so I don't think I'd get into any grad schools.

All my life I've been incredibly lazy. Even though I actually found my college classes rather interesting I was too lazy to actually work on my assignments or study more than a day or two in advance for tests. And my grades suffered for it. I'm now at a point where I want to change. But it's so hard when I feel like I have no goal, no idea how to get better. I've started losing weight and exercising, I keep my living space much cleaner than I used to, and I make a much better effort to contact and make plans with friends. But some nights I'll just get depressed that I'm working at Best Buy while my old friends get hired at amazing companies and just down a 6-pack of beer by myself to feel a little better. If you asked me what my dream job was, I wouldn't even know. I like math, audio engineering stuff, and video games.

How do I get disciplined to improve my life when I don't even know what the next step is? How do I figure out what I should be working towards right now to improve my life? My average day is work at Best Buy, go for a run, maybe hang out with some friends for a bit, then get depressed and browse reddit or play video games the rest of the night."

Everyone was drinking. Fun was had. When you heard one of the interns was a virgin, you decided to pay special attention to him for the night, and you even let him grope your bare breasts a little. it was all harmless fun.
But I was sober. I watched you flirt, and when you opened your blouse for the intern, I was close enough to snap a few pictures.
Months passed. You didn't even give a second thought to that night.

Then the email came. A picture of you, obviously enjoying the touch of a younger man, arching your back with your breasts exposed. You deleted it immediately.

Then one appeared on your phone, with a text message - ""You don't want your husband to see this, do you?""

You couldn't admit the truth to your husband - he's jealous and quick to react. He'd never understand. You maybe could have played it off if you told him right away, but it's been so long, there's no way this doesn't look like you've been covering it up.
It was time to play by my rules now. You reply simply; ""No.""

""Good. Do exactly as I say, and he never has to.""

This is a cheating, coercion, blackmail scene that will hopefully become long-term. I'd like things to develop slowly, degenerating into a spiral of D/s, light humiliation, public/exhib, maybe even a free use scenario, as you do whatever it takes to save your marriage.

If you're interested send a message with a little bit about who you are going to be playing (or even a pic), and we can discuss how the story will begin."

The school arranges this every year, companies just like us visits the school and show the studends what we do, who we are etc.

The studends will then have thier Internship for a couple of months and thats basicly why we're there. We're recruiting.

Most of the students we're looking for is .NET developers and Frontend developers. So any quiz/game involving code is perfectly fine.

What would you like?
Do you have any idéas?
Candy? A price for the winner of the game/quiz (if we have any).

Bring everything! :D

I stayed here summer, and winter breaks until I graduated in 2015. During my last summer break before I knew I’d be graduating I asked my boss to sit down and discuss what would happen upon graduation. We sat down and I was offered (verbally) the position of a CAD manager as our previous CAD manager had recently quit and I was a shoe in for the position. CAD is my passion and while I’m overly qualified for the position, I wanted it because I loved doing CAD. 

Fast forward to graduation, I come back to start officially full time and the previous CAD manager had been rehired. I became a detailer again, which is what I did as an intern just making more money. I was never spoken to about how I wouldn’t be getting that position any longer. But things at my job were chaotic, and this CAD manager was “digging us out of a hole.” So I waited a year before speaking up about it. After a year of no sign of new training, or anything, I emailed my boss and let him know how I felt wronged and very much wanted to do more in the position I was offered. He apologized and said there was only so much he could do because of how slow we, as a company, had been. But then suggested I start something new, which I did. It last about 5 months before I went back to intern duties. 

It’s now been two years since I stared full time and no sign of moving up, or getting even a hint of that position I was promised. I want to ask for a raise, as I haven’t gotten one since I began full time or even any performance reviews. But I also want to ask for a promotion, or if I will ever have the opportunity to move up in the company. I know there’s technically no position open for me to move up to which is why I worry about asking. The position I was supposed to have was taken. But I wonder if they would be willing to make a new position for me? Do you think that would be extremely unlikely? I don’t really want to stay if I will be remaining in my current position forever. But I do really like it here. "

78pnli,1,2017-10-25,[M4F] You Were Part of the Deal,dabernath1,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/78pnli/m4f_you_were_part_of_the_deal/,"The smile fades from your face as your father speaks. What he’s saying doesn’t make sense. The words all do, sure, but it’s the meaning of it. You now belong to someone else?

Minutes ago, he rushed in the door and began to tell you that someone was going to publish his novel. His eyes were bright with the news that someone was going to help him achieve his life goal! This mysterious benefactor is even willing to pay your father a living wage while he edits and polishes it, which means he doesn’t have to rely on the slowly thinning customer base of his store. As the years have gone on, you’ve seen less and less of your father as he let go of employees one by one that he couldn’t afford to keep on. The stress and exhaustion has him looking 10 years older than he is.

This amazing news had a catch though, a big one. The rich man had seen you, and was immediately taken. When he approached your father, he already knew a lot, and had the terms of the deal already lined up. You tell your father he can’t possibly take the deal, and that’s when his eyes fall to the floor.

“It’s already done,” he tells you, the excitement slipping from his voice, “I signed the papers.”

You protest, standing up and stomping your feet. This is illegal!

“The contract was very thorough,” he says as sweat forms on his brow, “you’re going to be an intern of sorts. This will give you the best education, and opportunities I never could.”

Tears form in his eyes as you beg him to take it back. You clutch at his sweater, and he takes your hands in his. You can feel now how much he’s shaking.

“If I do, he’ll take away my funding. And- and he owns the shop. If I back out, he could take it away,” he says. “Please, do it for me.”

A knock at the door makes both of you turn towards it. Your father stands up a little straighter and informs you that the driver is here for you, ready to take you to your new life. He wraps his arms around you, hugging you tight to him.

“I’ll come visit if he lets me. I love you,” he says, kissing you on the forehead. He steps back, and nods towards the door.

I am looking for someone for a long term roleplay. I am as into the plot and world building as I am the smut. We can discuss some details before hand, or you can jump right in to things. While there’s definite dubcon elements, I think there’s still a lot of room for fun and some lighthearted parts. Perhaps you take to the lifestyle instantly, or maybe you need a firmer guiding hand.

As for ages, we can discuss that or just both decide in the moment. I wouldn’t want you to be younger than 13, or me older than 50.

My kinks are oral, anal, teasing/edgeplay, partially/clothed sex, dom/sub, rough sex, age gaps, public/risk of getting caught, name calling, light pain, group (preferably FFM), and a lot more. If it’s not listed, I am likely still open to it.

My limits are gore, scat, beastiality, futa, and rape."
78q4th,27,2017-10-25,I think my mom might be using my student loans for personal use?,MomsSpaghettiGuy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/78q4th/i_think_my_mom_might_be_using_my_student_loans/,"Continuing off the title, I’m a sophomore in college coming from a middle class background and my family has been consistently terrible at managing money. This is amplified by the fact that my dad has suffered pay cuts and has struggled to find another job. Over summer, it got so bad that he started driving for Uber and had to borrow money that I made from my summer internship to pay bills. Also, my parents are in the process of divorcing (mainly driven by financial reasons) but are still living together because they can't afford two separate places and they’re on good terms. Naturally, their lifestyle has been pretty modest.

As for me, I'm currently a student living in the dorms of an in-state public university. Last year, after scholarship and need-based aid, my family took out about $10,000 in student loans which left around $8,000 on the table and we made it through the year. Altogether, my parents put forward under $2,000 of their own money toward my education last year. Coming into this year, I let my parents handle financial aid then went on to check a couple weeks ago and saw that my mom had taken out an abnormally high amount. After running some calculations, I saw that the total loan amount was $20,000, nearly double what we needed. I approached her about it and broke down the math then she said that it was what we had done last year. I'm not sure if she actually believed that or if she was just getting defensive or whatever, but she said that the interest on the loans didn't start accruing until later so I figured that there wouldn't be much harm in having the money out right now.

So I left back for college a bit over a month ago and just kinda put that behind me. I know that despite my parents' best intentions, their promises to pay back my student loans are empty and I'll be paying them back myself. I'm confident in my job prospects out of graduation so I’m not too worried. They're going through a lot, I got this.

Anyway, scene cuts to a couple days ago and I have lunch with my mom for the first time since I moved in. She suggests a rather upscale place and says not to worry about it because she's paying. She also dropped $400 for her and my sister to go see a show then realized that they missed the date so she dropped another $400 for the right tickets. Then she was talking about going out with her friends for drinks and such like she was doing it multiple times a week. I thought it was abnormal but didn't think too much into it.

It kinda dawned on me the next day that the lifestyle change almost perfectly coincided with the deposit of my student loans. I’m not exactly sure how each loan works but I know that at least around half of the $20,000 is in my parents’ name. I don’t know for sure if she is using my student loans for these purposes and she has been working full time, but I can’t imagine where else the money would be coming from because I know she hasn’t gotten a raise in at least the past year. Is this something that can happen with student loans? Should I approach her about this (and how)? Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: Just to clarify, there's absolutely no animosity between my parents and I. We're still a family.

Edit 2: It sounds like my mom is drawing from the Parent Plus loan pool which isn't in my name. Still not a good situation but at least it's not affecting my credit I don't think?

Edit 3: Appreciate all the responses, it's good to hear that this won't fall too heavily on me no matter what happens."
78qgmf,9,2017-10-25,Scientific Utopia: Would you want to live there?,Proxyminers,agnostic,https://www.reddit.com/r/agnostic/comments/78qgmf/scientific_utopia_would_you_want_to_live_there/,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here on this Reddit.


I have been wondering about the potential of a country that is dedicated to science as compared to countries that have religion as their core principles.  So I call this country a Scientific Utopia.  So what would be in a Scientific Utopia?  Here are a few things I was thinking in regards to this country, but may not be.  The idea is a country to is dedicated to Science.


1. Freedom of Belief: You are free to believe anything, with the requirement that you keep it internal and not external.  This is a form of freedom of religion, but you are not allowed to publicly mention your belief to promote or claim you view as an absolute.


2. Education: is directed towards technological advancements in all formats and industries.  While many will say this is in most 1st world nations, I disagree.  We know children are the best learners as compared to later years.  As a result, children would learn high level of math (calculus and higher) prior to leaving elementary education in addition to scientific basics (periodic table, natural sciences, basic biology, basic chemistry, and basic physics) and liberal studies (Language, writing, reading, physical education, etc.).  Middle and high school education will focus on the development of critical thinking, advanced scientific methods, and academia writing, and Medical (anatomy &amp; physiology) to name a few.  The short answer, the academia bar would be very high in this country and would cater to people based on preliminary tests and exams to place children and teenagers with mentors/teachers that would specialize in that style of learning as compared to a 1 style fits all that the U.S. and other 1st world nations implement (Yes I do know U.S. and others are starting to use different methods of learning; but I am thinking of a more advance measure to address the needs of the students to learn and not focus on GPA as a tool or measurement of knowledge)


3. Diplomas and Degrees: Upon leaving high school at the age of 16-17, a Diploma will be produced with the same level of an Associates degree in the U.S. (Germany has a similar system).  Bachelor degrees will be specific and last 2 years at 12 credit hours per semester.  The same system will be used for Master degrees.  PhD's will fall under a minimal of 3-6 years (based on which degree). **Bachelors: 48 credit hours; Masters: 48 credit hours, Doctorates: 72-144 credit hours.** Universities are required to have programs design to place people into Internships prior to obtaining a degree with organizations/companies to promote working experience for people.  (I notice the U.S. does not do such a system and we end up with people who have no connections out of college and results in people not obtaining positions in their field or worst case scenario is people end up in very low paid positions that undermine their education and knowledge.)


4. Society: Technology advancements would be the best outcome for this society.  In other words, tradition of the past would be historical literature to reflect to not make the same mistakes.  **Progression towards the future takes priority**


5. Government: Government would use a Tax system (flat tax).  Their would be a tier system that has 1 leader (PM/President), Representatives (2 people from each specialty in their field of science), and local leaders (mayor).  The system would be democratic with term limits.  Terms are defined as serving for 2 years.  A person will be allowed to be apart of each government position once per position.  Example, X person can be Mayor once, Representative once, and president once.  But cannot run for being mayor, representative, or president for more than one time.  So in practice, X person can be mayor, then a Representative, then President and will never be allowed to hold a seat again.  **In short, you get 1 shot at each government position period**  *Mayors: 2 terms, Representatives: 4 terms, PM/President: 4 terms.  Mayors are selected by their local city. Representatives are selected by their peers in their field (Requires a minimal Bachelors degree to be in this processes). PM/President is a national election.*


6. Political Parties and Limitations: Political parties are allowed and can only hold a seat in the government position (mayor, representative, president) once before taking a leave from the position for 1 term cycle.  Example, president is from X party.  X party cannot enter the president running for following presidential election cycle.  X party would have to wait 9 years to attempt to run for the president position.  This limitation is design for the mayor and president positions only.  This is to prevent a monopoly system or a 1 party system.




The purpose of this post is to ask if you would want to live in a society that focuses on Science principles and system."
78qq9o,51,2017-10-25,Jim and Sam Jocktober Report (10/25/17): Mary Jean and her pimp Lanie,bonniesretardsister,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/78qq9o/jim_and_sam_jocktober_report_102517_mary_jean_and/,"-They mention the ironically shitty intro music at the start of the show (yes, they're still doing that gag.) Sam has he just noticed the faggot who sings on it doesn't hit the notes. Jim: ""But it works."" Sam: ""I love it! I really love it!""

-Jim says he keeps getting tweets from people asking if he's ever seen anything he regularly did ""turn into a murder charge."" Sam says his example would be inviting friends over to watch WWE pay per views with him. Jim: ""I guess maybe when your friends walks in you push him and say 'HULKAMANIA!' or whatever it is you say. But imagine you did that, he fell on the couch and broke his neck. So then you'd be charged with murder, oh my goodness!"" Sam asks if this means he's one ""uncoordinated shove away from a murder charge."" Jim finally explains that this question was asked because he talked about throwing rocks at cars as a kid and now some kids have been charged with murder because they threw a rock at a car that caused a fatal accident. Jim remembers being in Edison, NJ on Fox RD throwing rocks at cars from a bridge when he was 9 years old. Jim tells more stories about throwing rocks and snowballs at cars. Sam asks if he ever ran off afraid with a friend and they had to ""suck each other off for comfort"". Jim says his friend Marvin wouldn't have done that with him. Jim says this continued until he was 13 ""back when I used to put toothpaste on my asshole because it burned."" Sam asks him to explain this. Jim: ""One day when I didn't wipe good enough my ass got red and itchy. So in Marvin's house, I went into his guest bathroom, and I found some Aquafresh toothpaste. I put it between my cheeks because I thought it would be cooling and refreshing. But it felt like someone lit my asshole on fire."" 

-Travis chimes in to say generations of boys will never change being destructive. Sam tells an incredibly boring story about fucking with a neighbor by messing up their mannequin display every morning. This segment is completely boring. Sam then tells Jim that his childhood stories remind him of the movie The Good Son. Jim: ""Yeah, I was always a little hellraiser."" This segment has been 10 minutes but feels much longer. We do get a reference to The Lordz, which is the only funny part, when Sam asks Jim if The Lordz offered protection to people on mischief night. But 15 minutes is it's still going on, back to boring kids stories. 

-Travis says Sam was the only kid who took D.A.R.E. seriously. Sam remembers how D.A.R.E. only gave out extra large t-shirts so the fat kids wouldn't feel bad. He also remembers he has a picture of him as a kid with a mullet wearing a tucked in D.A.R.E. shirt. Sam says he thinks it's hilarious when people who do drugs wear D.A.R.E. shirts ironically and laughs about it. Jim salvages this lame segment by asking Travis ""What did you think D.A.R.E. stood for? Dads Against Rapid Exits?"" Alright, that's the old Jimmy we used to love on the radio. But Sam immediately ruins the moment by telling a useless story about the time some Mexican kid stuck a thumbtack in his shoulder at school. He really is Opie Jr.

-They talk about Sean Penn being labeled a snitch for allegedly telling the feds he was going to interview El Chapo at his hideout. Jim congratulates Penn on meeting El Chapo and also fucking Mexican actress Kate del Castillo. Jim and Sam don't think Penn set him up. Sam brings the topic back to the kids throwing rocks at cars. Zzzzzzzzz.

-Fast forward 2 minutes. Now at a half hour of this same topic. Sam wonders if the kids were spit brothers that promised never to rat on each other. Jim busts the balls of the screener who spelled moped wrong for a caller who wanted to talk about kid pranks. Jim says ""It must be Mo Ped the babysitter."" This gets a brief Uncle Paul. Sam looks at the mugshots and asks why one guy is wearing the orange jumpsuit and the others aren't. Jim thinks it's because he's older and in adult prison, Sam thinks it's because ""when he threw rocks he liked to be nude, so they had to give him that to wear."" (Quite an Opieriffic line that Jim just ignores.) Sam gets another bomb by saying he hopes one of the suspects named Kyle Anger comes out of prison really religious and does good for the world so they can name him St. Anger. Jim simply says ""You went a long way for that."" This show is like the St. Anger of radio. Jim asks if he thinks they're all going to plead to something. Sam: ""Yeah, plead for their bottoms to be left alone (laughs at own joke."" Ugh. 35 minutes. Fast forward.

-42 minutes in they are now going to take calls about this boring shit. Justin says his father used to throw m80s at cars, then got beaten up for a week by his father. Some other faggot says he's thrown cinder-blocks at mail trucks, but Sam doesn't believe him. A lawyer calls in to give his opinion of the charges, blah blah blah.

-47 minutes in they're on a new topic: Jim's weight gain. He says he had a double order of chicken wings and a milk shake at the Cellar last night and loved it. They're informed somebody has Cinnabuns and Sam tells Travis to ""heat those motherlovers up!"" Jim says he's going to have one more milk shake tonight and then go back on his permanent diet. Travis says he should start his diet back on Monday. Jim accuses them of ""wanting to see me fattened back up."" Sam and Travis invite Jim to go to Shake Shack with them on Saturday. Jim turns them down. They offer going on Sunday and he just says ""You guys can go.""

-Sam asks Jim if he cleared up his credit card problems. He says he finally got a good customer service rep who took off some security issue so he could use the credit card more. 

-Jim's Uber complaints. Always riveting radio. Now featuring complaints about a Chinaman.

-They're informed that Anthony/Shitloaf is currently heating up the Cinnabuns. They keep asking staffers like Troy if they want one, then saying ""We can make an arrangement!"" I guess this is their Opieriffic catchphrase. 

-Sam busts Shitloaf's balls for suggesting a skit between some new faggot named Nikko (sp?) and Mary Jean, but not having an idea for what it should be. Shitloaf says it should be a trivia game between them where the loser has to give the winner a lapdance.

-Sam says he was looking through an old computer and found an interview from 2010 that he did with ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin. Sam says it's terrible, Jim asks him to bring it in for the show. Sam's main issue is that his voice sounds more nasally than it does currently. 

-They're alerted that Mary Jean is on the phone asking if she can come in tomorrow instead. Sam says to tell her no because they need her today and Jim will be taking tomorrow off. She says she just woke up, but Sam said she was scheduled to be here right now, so she needs to get an Uber and come in immediately. Mary's manager the fugly Lanie who scared everybody in the background of Podacast that time is there and also not happy that Mary is trying to blow them off. Sam tells Travis to tell her he wants her without make up in her pajamas. Of course the porn whore has to say she sleeps naked. Sam tells her to put on a robe in that case. Sam asks Jim if he thinks she's really going to come, Jim says ""At times I feel she is an irresponsible guest."" Sam says he thinks they should stop announcing that she's coming in in case she blows them off again. Sam also had a feeling she was going to be late again, so scheduled her for 9am but has stuff planned up until 10:30. I guess like stretching out a segment about kids being arrested that should have been 10 minutes tops into 47 fucking minutes. Jim says ""some people have a weird grasp of time, like they're always late."" Travis goes to fetch Lanie so they can interview her. Sam talks about how he can't believe someone would wake up for something they were scheduled for 10 minutes after they were supposed to be there. Jim says he fears doing that so bought an alarm clock that's as loud as a band.

-Lanie comes in. She says Mary knew she was supposed to be there at 9 because she asked Lanie to accompany her to the show. Lanie says Mary is good about making flights on time, but is awful at coming on time to appearances and possibly Ghetto Gaggers shoots or whatever that skanky bitch does for a living. Lanie says ""she was probably working late last night."" Jim says ""so was I, I was conductor of the laugh train"" (not in a Chip voice.) Sam tells some boring story and Jim gives another corny joke. I thought they had an hour and a half of prepared material? 

-They look at pictures of Mary Jean and Jimmy gets all horned up, pointing out her ""nice titties"" to remind us he's a heterosexual fellas. Lanie promises them Mary will make up being late to them ""by quickly whipping out her titties."" Sam calls Mary Jean ""very special"" and says he would never accept this behavior from other regular guests. Lanie says ""she really is hilarious and gorgeous."" Sam says she's one of his favorite Instagram follows. He invited her in today because she had a hilarious story about getting in a fight with an ex-boyfriend and some girls he wants her to tell on the air.

-Jim is getting anxious so asks that they give her a call to see if she's almost ready to come in yet. Mary says she's waiting for her Uber but thinks she can be in in 15 minutes. She said something about having to lick a guy's asshole as an apology. Jim says if she'd lick his asshole he'd get her an Uber any time she needs it. She appears to be in a good mood, so the three of them keep up the positive reinforcements to her by telling her how special she is, how great she is on the radio, and Sam asks her what she thinks it is about her that makes her so great. She thanks Sam and promises to lick everyone's asshole as an apology. Lanie asks if she was working late last night, she said she wasn't. She even went to bed early, but theorizes having the heat on last night made her extra sleepy so she didn't hear her alarm. 

-They tell Lanie that Nikko is a member of NAMBLA but wants her to represent him in a gay porn career. They then plan what kind of porn he could do. They think he could shave and do a porno where his black stepfather fucks him as punishment for looking at dicks at the locker room. Lanie represents a black guy named Mo ""The Monster"" Johnson that for the right price would possibly do the porno with Nikko. He usually does cuck movies and Jim says he looks like an African dictator. Jim starts writing porno lines for Nikko. One of the lines is ""Make me pregnant, daddy."" Sam wants Nikko to want his stepfather to impregnate his mouth. Jim wants him to say ""breed my white pussy, sir."" Nikko tells Lanie he does like older men and definitely likes black men. They pull up pictures of white guys getting gang banged by black guys and ask his opinion on them.

-A fire alarm is going off on their floor of the building. Sam asks people to make sure it's not an actual fire. Jim says the alarm reminds him of every relationship he's ever been in. Jim then does an impression of Dr. Steve saying Black Sabbath lyrics. Lanie tells them about a girl who does fart porn she told Dr. Steve about, and he said ""She should be my new best friend."" Jim imagines Dr. Steve asking her to fart in his face. The best line being ""Treat my face like a Woolworth's stool.""

-Sam wants to talk about 90 Day Fiance whores he's talked to.

-Lanie talks about a black porn star who financially dominates guys on the side who had someone from Sirius ask about her. Jim: ""Well, we know it wasn't Anthony. So was it Denny?""

-Lanie's husband was very disturbed by Mary Jean because he was at the Jim &amp; Sam live show in February when she got drunk and started a fight with some other whore. Jim &amp; Sam then roleplay how Nikko would come on to Lanie's husband.

-Lanie's husband was an actor on Sex &amp; the City, so they talk about that show. Jim asks if her husband has a big penis. (Spoiler: it's alright but not big.) Jim then asks Nikko if his favorite part of the ass are the cheeks or the asshole.

-Back to roleplaying the Nikko porno. Jim asks him if he has any sexual fantasies, but he says he's done them all. They ask Shitloaf to start writing everything for this porno down. He reads the line ""Lower that squat booty right on this creepy mustache, daddy"" very badly. Sam thinks there should be a porno improv group. Lanie asks him if he's ""a goldstar homosexual"", which means he's never fucked a woman. Nikko did fuck a woman, so he isn't. They change the line to ""squat down and put a little stink on my stache"" which everyone likes. 

-Sam says. ""Everyone is running on all cylinders today. Everyone is doing a great job.""

-Anthony is ready for his script to be read. ""Daddy, will you do push ups over my gold star mouth?""

-Jim is looking at porn and gets worked up again about all of the nice asses. Reminder: he's heterosexual, folks. ""OH MY FUCKING GOD! WHOSE ASS IS THAT! OH, THAT FAT RUMP!"" All. Man.

-They show Anthony pictures of Mary Jean's ass and ask if he'd eat it. He says yes. Jim asks if he'd eat her ass if she had the flu and just shit on herself, he says he'd think about it. Sam asks Anthony if he's jealous that Mary Jean has fucked ""former staffers"" (ie, not Jim), and Anthony says they were very lucky. Shitloaf hopes he can be as lucky one day. Sam suggests that Anthony ask Mary Jean out on a date this weekend.

-Somebody farts and they investigate who did it. Jim swears it wasn't him, so the suspect is Anthony. Mary is still stuck in traffic. There's a little over a half hour left in the show.

-They play bad sound drops and talk about which embarrassing lines turned into drops they hate the most.

-Jim talks about his hobby of watching drug cartel videos of beheadings.

-After the break Sam asks Jim if he watched the World Series last night. Jim: ""I could care less.""

-The new Harvey Weinstein story about the oral rape on the girl on her period is brought up. Even Jim is disturbed by the story. ""What a sexual monster."" He said he'd never give oral to a woman on her period even if they were in a relationship. Sam: ""These guys were OBSESSED with this sex stuff!"" Sam reminds us that he cannot understand any kind of addict because ""I have a totally different lifestyle"" of eating chicken tendies and watching men in speedos pretend to fight all night I guess. 

-Lanie turns the Weinstein talk into a plug for the XXXotica convention because Ron Jeremy had to cancel his appearance because he was mentioned by porn whores in the #metoo shit. Sam says he can't believe it because Jeremy had so many porn stars talk about what a great guy he is in the documentary made about him. Lanie thinks it's a generational thing, because millennial porn stars get angry about having their tits grabbed at conventions, whereas when she started managing in the 90s they'd just laugh it off. Lanie said she introduced a porn star to him and he just pulled her top down and licked her nipple. ""I didn't make a complaint against him, because I didn't think anyone would care. But I was embarrassed."" Jim hopes Ron realizes he has to change how he treats porn whores in 2017.

-They talk about some porn whore who says she was raped for real during a filming of a rape porn. No jokes, only Serious Jim talking about it.

-Mary Jean finally shows up with 28 minutes left on the show. She's excited and screaming. Mary: ""You look hot, Sam!"" Jim compliments her on how good she looks with no make up. Lanie asks if she ever had a bad experience with a porn actor, she said she once got so angry at one she threw her shoes at him. Jim asks if it was with George W. Bush, and Sam thanks him for making a joke from 10 years ago. Mary says what got her angry with the guy was he kept sticking his dick in her ass even though they'd previously agreed no anal. Mary: ""Back then I didn't have any asshole experience."" Sam: ""So you hadn't met Jim Norton yet. Hi-yoooo!"" Mary says all of this talk about assholes is making her horny. Sam tries to get her back on track for the story. Mary: ""He wouldn't cum, so I was in overtime. In porn you can only fuck my pussy 7 hours. Not, like, 9 hours."" 

-Lanie tells Mary she needs to make a sex tape with Sam because it would make some real money. ""Oh my god! I'd fuck him for free!""  Sam said if he fucked Mary and played with her tits he'd probably only last 4 or 5 pumps, so it would be a short porno. Mary says she'd go around the bedroom and find things to put in her ass to make up the time.

-Mary asks Sam if he likes anal sex. He says he's never done anal sex. She asks if he'd ever try it. ""I guess I would.....I don't really have anything against it."" She asks him about having sex in different rooms of his house besides the bedroom and he hasn't done that either. Mary: ""Well, please don't have sex in the bathroom because it's very dangerous. And I need you to live forever.""

-They ask her about having sex with Adrian (I forget what nickname he had since I don't care about these temp job shitdicks.) Mary said he had a great dick ""and his asshole was my faaaaaavvvveeee!!!"" She says ""I will never forget his wet little asshole. I got in seven fingers and we tried for 8."" Jim says this story is ""very sexy"", but that he knows she'd never be able to fit 8 fingers in his anus, but he would let her try it. Mary says she's really in the mood to lick some assholes. She licked the asshole of a tall man for the first time last weekend and says ""it was like being in a cave"" but ""coooooolllll!"" Mary says the best soap to use if you want her to lick your asshole is Dove.

-Sam: ""I visit your Instagram on the reg.""

-They talk about a fight Mary got in with her ex-boyfriend. She said they patched things up and she celebrated by licking his asshole, letting him pee in her mouth, and also peeing inside of her ass. She says he peed in her ass because she tried to drink his piss and she started gagging, so they improvised. Jim says he hasn't had any woman pee in his mouth in a very long time, but he would let Mary do it. ""I haven't done anything like that in a long time. I've gotten mellow with age. I've mellowed."" Mary says having a man urinate in your asshole will really make you laugh. Sam thinks an asshole that smells like ass, piss and cum must smell like a donkey. Mary said her ass didn't smell because she went ass to mouth with him immediately. ""I was like, 'WOW! My asshole tastes so good! No wonder everyone wants my ass!' I know that sounds so conceited, but I totally get it now. YUM!""

-Mary credits a talk she had with Jim after she made an ass out of herself at the J&amp;S live show to keeping her calmer, so she hasn't been in a fight with a woman since then. ""I see the world in a different way now. I'm trying to be an adult and not get myself into any legal trouble.""

-Jim says something Mary said reminds him of Cassius Clay, and she doesn't know who that is. Sam tells her she is the Muhammad Ali of anal sex and she's thrilled to be called that. Sam: ""I think you're getting pounded in the ass going 'I'm the greatest!'""

-Mary says some women with smelly assholes tried to stay at a boyfriend's house for a pizza party and she snapped and went over there. ""All three of them were hiding in the bathroom like chicken shit."" Or maybe they were cleaning their assholes to make her satisfied. ""I decided to just have them kicked out. Then I got to fuck. And you see that I'm the one wearing the pants here, and not you."" This is the story Sam really needed to have her on the show to tell. Mary says she was disgusted they were eating Domino's pizza for their pizza party because it's terrible pizza. ""How can you even suck dick when it smells like that cheese in here?""

-After the fight with the boyfriend: ""I told him to go take a shower and change the sheets. Then I had to cleanse his soul by looking at him. Then I ate his asshole.""

-They bring Shitloaf in to talk to her. After saying how much fun he always has with her, he asks her to lunch. She says she can't go because she's on a diet. Sam gets angry with him for being too forward to the asshole enthusiast. Anthony tells her he'll wait until she's off her diet because he'd love to take her out. Mary Jean tells him ""you'd rather have me on my diet because I won't get any shit on your dick."" Jim says she needs to write ""a dirty diet book."" 

-Mary tells Anthony if they go out she's going to want to punch his dick and asks if he thinks she's paying for the date. Some boring stuff about figure out a restaurant, blah blah blah. She becomes nicer to him when she finds out he's a producer and not an intern. They settle on a steakhouse, but then Shitloaf said he's going to need to check his bank account balance first. Jim gets angry with him because he spends a lot of money gambling on football but doesn't want to spent $200 on ""a hot porn star."" Mary then keeps saying ""Not just a hot porn star....meeeeeeeeeee!"" Mary gives him advice, saying ""You won't get a girl to open her legs for you just going to Olive Garden. And I guess you don't want to pee in my asshole."" Shitloaf tells her he'll definitely take her to Del Friscoes. Mary then tells him if the date goes good she wants to take a steak shit on his dick. Mary isn't just a porn whore, she also works at a beauty salon since asshole eating isn't paying the bills, so she says she'll call in late to go to the date with Anthony. Jim and Sam do a bit encouraging her to spend as much money as possible on the bill because they know Shitloaf is broke.

-Jim gives the two minute warning that the show is almost over, but Mary Jean promises to come back soon. She plugs some porn whore convention in Edison, NJ she'll be appearing at for three days (November 3-5 if you want to go to ask about assholes.) Jim says he may go to the convention one of those days.

-Mary Jean asks if she can fill in for Jim tomorrow. Sam says no because he wants to wait for her to come back when Jim is in to talk about the date with Shiftloaf. They work out that she can be back in Friday. Jim says he wants Mary to sleep over at his house Thursday night so he can be sure to get her up on time to make it to the show (and not fuck her.) They decide against it because they'd probably end up talking about the bit and Jim really wants to hear it on air first.

-Plugs and it's over."

If you can offer me any advice, I will forever be in your debt, and promise I will pay you back somehow. 

Let me start by saying that this isn't my first time losing weight. I am 5'5 298 pounds and 22 years old , female. Between high school and the middle of college I managed to lose 100 pounds putting me at 220 but got in a relationship 2 years ago and gained it all back. 

During my previous weight loss era's I generally found the best success with low carb, lots of grilled chicken and veggies. I also used to play rugby.

Two months ago I started dieting again by starting with portion control. I still ate bad food (high carb fast food frequently) but I would skip meals or eat smaller portions. I also didn't exercise much just tried to naturally move around more often. I managed to lose roughly 20 pounds by doing this. 

I was motivated by this and started going low carb again, I also smoke weed like the devil and currently have to force myself to eat probably because of it, I have eaten anywhere between 700-1200 calories a day, for the past month which I am absolutely sure of. I also typically stay below 30 carbs (never higher than 40) I also: 
- intern at a zoo 9-5 once per week (very rigorous non stop moving, heavy lifting) during this time I don't eat. 
- Work early mornings in food service 9 hours a week (standing for 4 hours at a time starting at 6am, constantly moving) 
- Elliptical and occasionally weight lifting 30 minutes 1-3 times a week.

By no means do I live an active lifestyle, but I break a sweat every day, some days more than others. This most recent summer I was extremely depressed and unable to leave the house for most of it, living an EXTREMELY sedentary lifestyle. My current life style is at least 4 times more active, and I also drink at least 60oz of water a day, often more.

So I'm doing all of this and CONSISTENTLY for the past month I have weighed between 295-298 pounds. 

Is keto not for me anymore? I am a grad student and my schedule is often busy I try to push myself out of my comfort zone by waking up early, putting my best food forward at work and keeping my best pace because I don't have a lot of time to go to the actual gym.

Please don't try and tell me I must be eating more than 1200 calories. I have barely been able to swallow half a chicken breast without feeling sick due to my depression, weed addiction and food related anxiety. 

Let me know if I can provide any more information, please help.

In terms of academics I'm passing with flying colours with an distinction average and am in an honour society. I have tried to do many things to make myself stand out such as volunteer work for non-profits and went on a full semester exchange. This week I plan on completing Google Certificates and hopefully that can be of little help.

Although when it comes to practical experience I can't seem to find how to start my career. I used to do influencer marketing back in high school as I ran a blog with 30K+ followers but over the past few years my blog has died as most people leave the platform when they mature a bit.

I'm looking to get into the tech side of marketing and have applied for about 30 internships with only 1 email back that hasn't lead to an interview. As well as this I've been cold e-mailing businesses, of all sizes if they are in need of an intern and that I'm available and willing.

Does anyone have advice on what more I can do to start?"

I am a senior in college pursuing a double major in finance and computer science. Long story short, I interned in software engineering at tech companies and on wall street and realized that I have limited passion in either and have been in it for the wrong reasons. I've been wanting to go the med school route for the two years, and have talked to many doctors and friends in med school about the pros and cons, and am strongly considering going to a one-year post-bacc to fulfill the pre-reqs. Looking for advice in the following areas:   
**-What are good post bacc's with one year linkage?** I don't want to lose more than one year before I go to med school.  
**-What things outside of GPA and MCAT should i focus on?**    
**-Any other advice you think I should know**    
A broad overview of my stats is as follows: 3.8 GPA Computer Science and Finance double major Mathematics minor at a top public school, officer in a machine learning club, internships in software engineering and in high finance. Mainly have taken computer science classes (data structures, computer architecture, etc.), mathematics classes (probability, multivariable calculus, statistical modeling, etc.), and business classes (investments, corporate finance, accounting). Unfortunately have not taken a bio or chem class since high school.

78tdpa,1,2017-10-26,"How to start my journey, mentally, and stick with it?",quirksnglasses,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/78tdpa/how_to_start_my_journey_mentally_and_stick_with_it/,"19F 5'3"" SW:147 CW:147 GW:125; Live in a big city and walk everywhere, but sit half-days during classes and internship.

So, for me, I've always been chubby. I've struggled with it for so long, and I clearly dislike it(It's to the point where I pretty much mention it daily). The problem is that I have some sort of emotional relationship with food- candy and yummy burritos genuinely make me happy and dieting genuinely makes me grumpy. Cooking is hard for me because I'm a full-time university student at a rigorous college, and I work part time at a law firm. My other problem is that I have a bad habit of eating out of boredom late hours of the night to cope with anxiety(OCD). 

The other problem is that I carry my weight alright, so I often rationalize to myself, in the moment, that I'm not *that* chubby or that I'm fine as is. 

It's as if every day I start off the day committed to eating clean and starting this journey, but by 7pm I fall off the band wagon and give up. Does anyone have any advice for me? I want to stick to it this time: I want to not weigh more than my boyfriend, I want to feel sexy, and I want to feel confident, again. I want to stop giving up, but I don't want to feel so sad about dieting..

Tl;dr - I binge eat foods late at night to cope with anxiety, and I have an emotional relationship with food. I need help forming a healthy relationship with food and sticking to my weight loss goal.

Edit: Also, if anyone has any meal ideas that you've found to be delicious but aids in weight loss, I am all ears!"

78toob,1,2017-10-26,How to build relationships with people in a professional environment?,shortbreadf,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/78toob/how_to_build_relationships_with_people_in_a/,"Two weeks ago I sent out an internship application. Over the next few days I felt this immense sense of dread when I had to check my email (and sometimes just put it off completely), and an immense sense of relief when there was no email back sitting in my inbox. I *wanted* the internship but at the same time I was stuck in this weird mentality of wanting and not wanting a response. 

They responded after a week, and I have an interview coming up soon. The interview makes me nervous for sure, but I'm now thinking too far ahead and feeling anxiety about ""what if I actually get this internship?"" Mostly, I feel like I don't know how to act around others--especially authority figures--in a professional environment.

Like, how do I achieve that middle ground between ""sucking up"" and coming off as ""standoffish""? How do I build relationships with others in a professional environment? I don't mean we necessarily have to be friends or all buddy-buddy, but just, what can I do to come across as more approachable/not stiff and cold? 

Observing others around me, it often seems like they get on well with their bosses/they're friendly with their bosses, but every time I talk to someone with authority (like a professor), I always feel too anxious to have a conversation that flows.... I often walk away from those conversations feeling like it could have been better....

I guess in short I'm really trying to say I feel like I'm unable to form any meaningful relationship with anyone in this kind of environment. Sure, I'm polite and I'll do my work...but no one really ""likes"" that person at work who does work but doesn't fit in with the rest of the office. It's usually just ambivalence, like you're not a bad or unpleasant person but you're also not really anyone memorable....

How do you guys deal in a professional environment? Or, any advice in general on what to do/how to open myself up/be less nervous around...basically everyone?"
78u347,21,2017-10-26,"I Never Thought I'd Quit, Never Considered Doing It, But I Did It Anyway. Here's a WOT Retrospective on Quitting and (some) Advice",AnArgumentativeBox,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/78u347/i_never_thought_id_quit_never_considered_doing_it/,"Well this is amusing... I never thought my first Reddit post would be about quitting video games. But after looking at this sub and considering the strange transition I've gone through, I felt compelled to finally break down and make an account. I'm not sure if my ""story"" is all that motivational or unique, but I wanted to share it anyway: 

I'm a 34 year old white male .NET programmer (web, desktop and looking to get into mobile). Since I was at least 3 I had been playing video games. They were, dare I say it, everything to me. However after the last year and a half, things began to change... 

It's odd... looking back at the transition. Prior to this year, I was still somewhat of a devoted gamer. I was regularly rotating through PC and PS4 games without giving much thought to what else I could be doing with my free time. However I was starting to show signs of burn out and maybe other things as well. I'm not sure what it was that was causing the increasing lack of interest. Also I had taken up a far worse pastime - alcohol. Also, maybe it was my job becoming increasingly more stressful (which is a topic for a different sub) and that was draining all my energy. But none the less, I was still a ""gamer"". I recall towards the end of last year I did my regular binge of buying a bunch of games on Steam during the winter sale, got a bunch of games for Christmas from friends and family and I recall the last game I played to the finish during my winter break (and actually enjoyed) was Final Fantasy 15. After that however... things suddenly began to change.

The first few months of this year were pretty bad. The drinking was at its worst. I gained a lot of weight from it (but thankfully I've lost all of it), I was making an ass out of myself in various places and I almost had a couple of times where I probably would have gone to jail. I guess I'm lucky that never happened. Somehow though, I stopped. I'm not sure what put a stop to it though... around March or April I suddenly quit drinking altogether, completely.  However this isn't a sub about overcoming alcoholism so let's get back to the topic on hand... 

During the course of the aforementioned months I became progressively less and less interested in games. The few times I tried to play one, I'd either get bored really fast or found myself distracted by other things that were either more or less important. I'd start ignoring my friends requests to hop online and play MMOs or other random online games. And even though it was bugging me, I couldn't bring myself to touch all the junk that I had accumulated for steam and/or my PS4.

Around June or July, I pretty much stopped playing games altogether. I touched one ONCE while I was on vacation in Texas at a friend's place, but that was about it.  Since then I haven't touched a single video game.  

I'm now looking back at my life... and I seriously do regret having been so addicted to games. I do still have fond memories of the good ones back on the SNES and PS1/2 eras (I feel like those were the best generations). But, there were a lot of times in my life where I should have cared more about the decisions I was making, but I was too distracted by the games I was playing.  

I let my game addiction distract me horribly throughout elementary/middle/high school. While I was a decent A-B student, I feel like I could have excelled if I had actually given a crap instead of being fixated on video games. 

I didn't screw up in college, but I took longer to graduate than most people because I wasted time a few semesters playing games instead of focusing on my studies or trying to get internships.  Even though I graduated with honors, I was at a disadvantage when looking for a job. I was too distracted by games to focus on the job hunt.  The economy was also really bad at that point and no one was hiring entry level IT people/whatever you want to call it. Fortunately I still had my high school/college job to fall back on, but... let's just say that was depressing.  So with those two things paired together... it took me 3 years after graduating to get my first real job.  Even though I excelled pretty fast and worked my way up from tech support to developer in about 1.5 years, I still think I could have done it faster if I hadn't been so fixated on gaming.  

And here I am now... I feel more serious about myself and what I want to do with myself.  I want to start working on spending my free time learning as much as I can about development (best practices, patterns, new languages, frameworks, the works) instead of wasting time on video games.  I want to eventually move onto a bigger and better company. Heck, I'm even debating that I could perhaps go solo, but I'm still kicking ideas around on that one. Either way,  I truly feel that my passion for being a programmer has been rekindled and I am now able to actually focus on my career. 

 I guess one of the things that made me get bored of the gaming life was that after a while, you feel like you've seen it all.  Some times I still see stuff that seems innovative or seemingly fun, but more often then not, a lot of the ""changes"" that have been going on in the gaming world feel either like just rehashed ideas with better graphics, regressive changes or there are other things that just flat out disgust me.  To elaborate: 

A) Many games that come out now do not focus on fun factor as much as the older ones did; I feel that is because due to technological advancements, developers do not feel as compelled to focus on enjoyment since they instead can compensate by featuring technological marvels.
B) The gaming ""industry"" landscape has changed for the far worse over the past 15-20 years. It feels like it has lost its innocence and its no longer about the players or the games themselves. 
C) Gaming as an entertainment medium has over-saturated the landscape. It has gone from being ""oh cool games are now being taken seriously"" to ""holy crap can't you find something else to talk about besides video games?!""

There's other... things but I digress, I really didn't come here to share a deep analysis on the state of video games. Ultimately though, as I said, it boils down to this: I don't like what's become of video games and I feel like I may have, for all intents and purposes, outgrown them. 

It feels weird having given them up. It really does. But it doesn't feel bad either. I guess the only thing that I don't like about it is that I probably can't get back the money I spent on Steam! But hey, it could always be worse. 

I may still play a game again some day, but I know it won't be for a while or to relapse. There are still a few series and/or companies that I am very fond of (I.E. Doom, Final Fantasy, Fallout - although 4 was a let down -, to name a couple). I'll look forward to revisiting those old friends some day, but in the mean time I've got a lot of other stuff to worry about. 


Anyway.... I guess if you had to take something away from this badly written nonsense: 

- Don't let games become your sole hobby as well as your primary escape from reality.  You'll run the risk of it seriously marring your potential in all other facets of life.

- If you find yourself playing too much, stop and consider... ""Have I seen this before? Do we already know how this show ends?"" That may be enough to get you to start considering that you've had your fill and you can either cut it off or downgrade it to a once in a while thing.

- Be careful not to ""replace"" gaming with another addiction. I'm not going to go into the facets of having an addictive personality.  Just let it be known that if you think you have one, and you can't fight it with will power, then perhaps you should seriously consider looking for outside help in any form that you can get. I've met people who got over addictions either on their own or through help. Everyone is different when it comes to battling their inner demons.

- Don't feel ""bad"" if you still end up playing a game again every once in a while. 

- Don't expect the healing process to take place over night.  It took me over a year. Depending on how long you've been a gamer, its may a while for your mind to shift away from the compulsion to play games when you have free time.

-------------------

The TLDR: I got bored with games and I managed to kick the habit. It was a long, somewhat unintentional process but I feel like it was one of the best things to happen to me.  What worked for me may not necessarily work for you (if you're looking for ways to quit), but regardless, know that it's possible. Once you've done it... well, you have one less thing in life holding you back.

Taking a gap year between high school and college gives you an opportunity to recharge your batteries. That’s why some of the best schools in the country, including Harvard and MIT, encourage admitted students to defer enrollment for a year.

Whether you work, volunteer, or travel the globe, taking time away from school could give you a fresh sense of purpose. According to the American Gap Year Association, 81 percent of “gappers” would recommend the experience.

Of course, there are also gap year disadvantages you should know about. Before committing, make sure to consider all the gap year pros and cons.


**4 common benefits of taking a gap year**

**1. Recharge after years of schooling**

Being a student comes with a lot of pressure. High school can get especially intense as you balance school work, clubs, sports, college applications, and the SAT. A gap year can be a refreshing break from academic demands.

“The pros of a gap year … come into focus after several years of intense pressure to get good grades and study hard in high school,” said traveler Maggie Hayes of Totally Teen Travel. “Taking a year off prior to college allows the gap year participant to relieve that intense pressure valve.”

Although some parents warn that a gap year can make you lose academic momentum, Art Corriveau, vice president at Education First, suggests the opposite is true.

“Recent studies show that gap students actually perform better in college, get better grades, and take on more leadership roles,” said Corriveau. “Strong evidence suggests that over 90 percent of gap students enroll in college the very next year.”
Rather than distracting you from your course, a gap year could re-energize your commitment to the classroom.

**2. Clarify your goals for school and work**

The cost of college has been steadily rising. According to College Board, one year at a private school costs $32,410. If you have no idea what you want to study, a gap year could give you much-needed time to clarify your goals before shelling out that kind of money.

“College is a big expense in both time and money, and sometimes a graduating senior just doesn’t know where they want to go and what they want to study, or if they’re ready for college at all,” said Jane Stine, managing director of Loop Abroad.

“In this case,” she continued, “a gap year can be a great way to refocus, recharge, and learn more about some educational paths and options.”

You might even find unexpected opportunities, like Josh Shephard of The Lost Passport did after taking time off both before and after college. “I explored Asia for nine months by motorcycle,” said Shephard. “At the end of the journey, I landed a job in the solar industry in Bangkok where I lived and worked for the next five years.”

Although Shephard wasn’t planning to live in Thailand, his experience led him to professional success. He’s now a project manager who builds solar farms and runs a travel blog on the side. “Neither of these would have been possible without [the] gap years I had taken,” he said.

By taking time to learn about majors and careers, you can gain a much stronger sense of direction.

**3. Save up money for college**

Although some students spend money during their gap year on travel programs, others take this time to work and save money. With the average Class of 2016 grad leaving college with $37,172 in debt, it could be a smart move to build up your savings first.

You might work in a restaurant or store, or you can offer freelance services online. Another option is to join a government program. City Year, for instance, is an Americorps program that places high school graduates in schools around the country. You’ll gain teaching experience, along with a monthly stipend.

By working and saving now, you won’t be so burdened by student loan debt later.

**4. Gain a new perspective on yourself and others**

Gap years come in different shapes and sizes, but they all offer the chance for you to learn more about the world and your role in it.

“Taking a gap year is a chance to step off the treadmill, leave your comfort zone, explore your values, and test your assumptions,” said Abby Falik, founder and CEO of Global Citizen Year. “It’s a chance to figure out what gets you out of bed when there’s no alarm clock, and to practice becoming your best self when you’re a world away from home.”

Falik traveled to South America, where she expanded her perspective on the world. “The year I spent outside the classroom, living and working in Brazil and Nicaragua, was the most formative part of my education,” she said. “I learned to speak to people in their own language, and to see the world — and our country — through their eyes.”

Corriveau echoes this idea. “Gap students grow more self-confident, self-reliant, and mature while they are away,” he said. “They become better independent thinkers, communicators, and problem-solvers with finely tuned cross-cultural awareness.”

Of course, you don’t need to travel to experience personal growth during your gap year. Whether you work, intern, or volunteer, your year off offers a chance to mature and broaden your horizons.

**4 potential gap year disadvantages**

Along with all the benefits, there are also gap year disadvantages to be aware of. These are a few possible downsides to taking time away from school.

**1. Extra planning is required**

Without careful planning, you might not get much out of taking a gap year. But designing a year of your life is challenging, especially if it’s the first time you’ve ever had this freedom. The stress of planning can be one of the major gap year disadvantages, especially if it falls at the same time you’re applying to colleges.

“In general, lack of planning is what causes a gap year to go from helpful to hurtful,” said Stine. “Doing your research, making a plan, and communicating with college admissions offices can help you ensure that your year off invigorates, recharges, and informs your educational path instead of derailing it.”

Stine warns students against spending the year lying around on their parents’ couch. “If you aren’t confident that you can keep yourself to a schedule and take on new challenges, but still want to take a gap year, you might look for an organized program that can help ensure you are held accountable and stick to your goals,” she said.

If you’re struggling to plan your gap year, a program could help you structure your time.

**2. Programs come with high costs**

Although programs can help with planning your gap year, they can also be pricey. Volunteer programs, for instance, are rarely free. They often cost thousands of dollars, especially if they involve international travel.

With college just around the corner, you might not have money for this additional expense. That being said, some scholarship organizations provide financial assistance for gap years. Grants and scholarships could help bring these experiences within reach.

**3. You might be totally on your own**

Although a gap year offers the chance for personal development, you might have growing pains along the way. Whether you work or travel, you’ll have to deal with the challenges of branching out on your own.

You might live away from friends and family for the first time. If you travel, you could get homesick as you struggle to adapt to a new culture. Plus, you might feel like you’re a year behind your peers who went straight from high school to college.

All these feelings are natural when making a big life transition, but that doesn’t mean they’re easy. Since a gap year is still an uncommon practice in the U.S., you might feel stress and uncertainty about your decision to take one.

**4. Getting financial aid could require more work**

More and more colleges allow admitted students to defer enrollment for a year. But you likely won’t carry over the same financial aid package. To get financial aid, you might have to submit the FAFSA again for the following year.

“Some scholarships may not allow you to take a gap year, and you’ll need to reapply for financial aid,” said career advisor Geoff Scott of CareerMetis.com. That being said, you might not have to worry about your financial aid package changing.

“Reapplying for financial aid won’t be an issue … as long as your financial situation hasn’t changed much from when you applied originally,” said Scott. “This would be a huge con if not for the fact it has minimal impact on most aspiring college students.”

Even though reapplying for financial aid might be a hassle, your financial aid package should look similar to the original, assuming your family’s financial picture hasn’t changed drastically.
Consider all the gap year pros and cons before deciding

Taking a gap year between high school and college has long been a popular practice in other countries, but in recent years, gap years have become more popular among American students.

Although we don’t know exactly how many students take time off, the American Gap Year Association noted a 294 percent increase in gap year fair attendance since 2010.

Students spend their gap years in a variety of ways, but the best approach is to have a plan and set goals for yourself so you don’t feel like you’re wasting time. By setting goals and tracking your progress, you can make the most of your gap year.

78vggg,15,2017-10-26,Did I make a mistake in choosing which firm to internship with?,threetotheone,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/78vggg/did_i_make_a_mistake_in_choosing_which_firm_to/,"Hi everyone, after this recruiting season, I was fortunate enough to have offers from seven different firms.  Three of them were Big 4, and the rest were national/regional.  After a really difficult decision, I chose one of the Big 4.  After my decision, I decided to follow up and call the recruiter/partner/other people from the firms I met so I don't burn a bridge.

Five of the other firms were all understanding, and congratulated me and reminded me to stay in touch in case the internship doesn't work out.  One of the Big 4 firms that I declined had what I felt was a different attitude.  The recruiter questioned why I would choose the other firm because 'we don't have many people decide to go the smaller firm over ours.'  The partner that I connected with also questioned why I would choose the other firm over his.

So did I make some type of mistake choosing one Big 4 over the other?  The Big 4 that I chose is smaller but I really connected and got along with all members of the staff.  Is there truly a difference between the Big 4 in terms of prestige or is it all in my head?  Thanks."
78wpjp,2,2017-10-26,Forced to visit step-sibling after family drama,ioriana,DysfunctionalFamily,https://www.reddit.com/r/DysfunctionalFamily/comments/78wpjp/forced_to_visit_stepsibling_after_family_drama/,"This will be long, so I apologize in advanced. 

So I'm having a dilemma as of late. My family was never perfect, dad and mom hated each other and fought... a lot. Usually yelling but it got physical or stuff got broken and I was always made to be the middle man after the fact. I also got a lot of anger from both of them. This, however, changed when my dad left two weeks before my 18th birthday. 

Fast forward to now, I'm 21 and in college. Dad recently got married in my home state (we all moved when I was 9 to another state) and didn't tell me or her 2 kids until after the fact. This, of course, stung as we were just starting to repair a rocky relationship. I eventually just let it go since he didn't get why I'd be offended that I was on the dark or that he went to see our family without me (since he had promised to take me for years and several of my family members have since died). Well this devolved into him saying he does so much for me financially. This isn't true, as he has only recently helped with an ambulance bill when I broke my ankle, the rest was paid by me, my mom, and my grandma. I tell him as much and he gets angry. This had been an issue before where I had to keep my mouth shut under threat of him not helping at all of I said he wasn't helping me as much as mom. At this point my step mom decides to join the conversation telling me I shouldn't get any support from my parents at all and should be self sufficient like everyone else is. First of all most people my age don't have a job (I have a job, an internship, and 18 credit hours) and get more help from their parents. She then said she was self sufficient at 18, which is a lie, as she has previously stated at 18 she was dating and living with a 30 year old. I got angry and just stopped since dad just seemed to agree. 

I couldn't believe he wouldn't stand up for me so I finally made up my mind and moved out as much as I could in secret. Not soon after and they have a child, my half-sister. Well dad is very particular about how I am related to people, so the fact he calls her my sister already annoys me since it is so out of character.but anyway he keeps pestering me to come down and visit the child. She is premature so I am able to push it off until she is 2 months old at least but it sucks that he won't stand up for me against his wife or be apart of my life when it matters to me but it more or less forcing me to see this child. He already treats her children better than me (and better than I have ever been treated) and they will undoubtedly support the 18 year old as he goes into college next year but he still thinks I should be happy he helps at all. I have resigned myself for not asking him for anything and will move the last of my stuff out when I am finally forced to visit. He doesn't even want me to wait until 2 months because they have already taken it to school football games and think she has the immune system to handle that and any germs I may bring. It hurts because I'm not able to even see this child on my own terms, but being forced to go during midterm stress. I just want to cut them out of my life since dad isn't there for me anymore and no one else in that family sees me as more than dirt. 

Tl;Dr dad and his wife treat me like garbage but are basically forcing me to visit their newborn. "

My old Director and I had become friends, and he sent out a recommendation letter as soon as he heard what happened, and *less than 4 hours after being laid off*, I got offered a job from a consultant I’d worked with, which had the exact same pay, and I didn’t even have to interview. 

I graduated in December 2014 with my Bachelor’s in Biology and a Minor in Environmental Sustainability.

*2015:* I moved to a new state and got my first apartment on January 9, right on a lake with a wrap-around balcony and awesome fishing. Two days later, my then-girlfriend traveled over 1,000 miles to move in with me. I’d never been so happy. 

In addition, my wife’s parents are some of my favorite people. No jokes, no sarcasm, I have the best in-laws in the world.

I started my new, job on January 19, 2015, and even got a corner office since one was available. By the end of the year, I got my performance review... out of 5, 3 was ‘meets all expectations’. I got a 5, a personal review from our regional manager that put all of my scores higher than my self review, and a great raise.

During the year, my wife and I traded my truck and her car and bought a car together, which I’d been told by my family I’d never be able to afford for at least 5 years.

By May, I proposed on the spot my wife and I first met, and we were married by October 2015. We had an incredibly small wedding, nestled in the most beautiful little town I’ve ever seen, right in the heart of the mountains in east Tennessee.

During the year, we met an awesome couple and have been great friends ever since. In addition, we lost my wife’s dog, but adopted a beautiful border collie/Lab mix named ‘Lady’, who is the most gentle, loveable dog imaginable.

On top of all this... I’m adopted, and without me knowing, my amazing wife somehow tracked down my *biological mother*, who turned out to be a veritable saint. She’s one of the greatest people I’ve ever met, married to a man I’m honored to know, both of whom immediately became a permanent part of our lives. That’s a story in itself.

There were times that first year that were hard - our apartment looked amazing at first and turned into a horror show (so many stories about it), we had medical issues and at one time, had $0.38 to our name, as well as my adoptive family rejecting us entirely. I’d do it all over again.

*2016:* In February, my wife and I began trying for a kid, and to our eternal surprise, she got pregnant within 2 weeks. 

Plot twist - we’d moved to a new apartment two months before, and about the time we found out my wife was pregnant, we found out our neighbor was stalking us. Terrifying time, so many stories.

We finally move out of that apartment and away from our stalker, into a brand new, gorgeous apartment that was finished 3 days before we actually moved in.

November - our son, James, is born on 11/11/16. He was born early, and was a lil’ fella, but was the greatest thing to ever happen to us. I’m so proud of my son I can’t stand it, and my wife’s calling in life is to be a mother. I’m humbled daily by how amazing of a mother she is.

*2017:* In March, we drove from Florida to Iowa to visit where my wife grew up and where her brothers still live. It was a great time. 

Two weeks later, we find out that my brother-in-law and his wife were approved to adopt a beautiful baby girl, after trying for 5-10 years to have a child. She was adopted from Florida, so they were able to stay with us for a few days after leaving the hospital with her, and they’re both such incredible parents.

In three weeks, we’re celebrating my son’s first birthday, and it’s unbelievable how fast this year has gone by.

I end this by say that these have been the hardest, most challenging years of my life. There have been so many crazy and tough moments that weren’t mentioned (which I can share if anybody wants to know). But more importantly, there have been an abundance of truly incredible moments, as many peaks as valleys, and with that, I am content. "

I pull my hair up into a high ponytail, and check myself out in the mirror. I check the time... 9:55PM, of course I’m running late on tonight of all nights. 

*Another Halloween, another costume.* I think to myself as I grab my purse and phone and head for the door. I wrangle my car keys from the depth of my purse as I approach my car door, unlocking it with a click of the button and climbing into the warm cab. I turn the key and the engine roars to life. The thermometer on my dashboard reads 45°F, and I crank up the heat to warm up the sedan’s cabin. I pull out of my driveway and head towards the Hospital. Every year that I was an intern, I had to work Halloween, what’s to change now that I’m a full time Nurse this year?

I pull into the multilevel parking garage illuminated by bright LED lights, and brace myself for my long walk into the cold night. 

*At least it looks slow...* I think to myself as I walk through the automatic doors and head for the elevator. I tap the small round button for the fourth floor and idly gaze at my phone. I got a text from the girls asking me to come out to some party, so I send a smiling selfie of myself in the elevator with the caption “Heading in to work now. **Don’t** come see me! Haha” 

The door chimes as it arrives to my fourth floor destination, and I step off to my usual wing. I approach the nurse’s station, noticing how empty the hall feels tonight. I check the schedule and see that Clarence - the day nurse - has left me a laundry list of chores to get done on our wing, along with a quick note about a haunted hall that some of the hospital doctors paid to host up on the 14th floor. I roll my eyes, put down the clipboard, and head down to the first room to begin my rounds.

78xand,1,2017-10-26,Should I get a Surface Pro 3 (i5/8gb/256gb) or A Surface Pro 4 (i5/4gb/128gb)?,wbfg23,laptops,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/78xand/should_i_get_a_surface_pro_3_i58gb256gb_or_a/,"I'm looking for a portable, yet decently powerful convertible, and I've basically decided on getting a Surface Pro. I'll basically be using it for browsing the web, taking notes at college, and some coding (mostly web development). It won't be my primary workstation, but it'll basically be my daily driver in the sense that it'll be the device I carry around everywhere. I plan to keep this device for at least 3 years.

Now, where I live (India), Surfaces -well, only the Pro 4, as it's the only one that's even been sold here officially- are very overpriced. The i5/4/128 Pro 4 that's priced at $700 costs near about $1100 here, which is way out of my budget. So I'll be getting an acquaintance of mine to bring one over from the US. The problem is, my (already very stretched) budget is maybe 600 dollars or so. Hence I've decided to go the refurb/used route.

Now a refurbed SP3 (i5/8/256) is about $500, while the SP4 (i5/4/128) is about $600-650. My question is threefold - Firstly, is the extra 100-150 dollars worth it, considering the SP4's processor is better/more efficient/has better cooling while the SP3 has double the memory and storage? Secondly, are refurbished products worth the risk, especially since I won't be able to send it back if some issue does arise? And finally, should I buy used or refurbed? It'd be really helpful if anyone could share their experience regarding such dilemmas.

One thing to note that I will not be buying a Type Cover or Pen, as I'll be getting both from a relative of mine.

Filled up the questionnaire below.


**Total budget and country of purchase:**
 
Around 600 USD. Will be purchasing it from the US.


**Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 

I want a 2 in 1 convertible running full Windows 10.


**How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Shouldn't be too heavy, hopefully around 1kg or so. Don't care about thickness.


**Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**

Windows.


**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 

~12-13 inches.


**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 

Nothing very heavy too regularly. The usual workload will be the following:

* General web browsing
* Media consumption - mostly 1080p content, and some *very legal* soccer streams
* PDF reading - very important, as most of my college reading is on the computer
* Some coding - mostly web development, as I've started an internship which will lead to a full-time job after I graduate. However, this device won't be my main workstation. 
* Note taking - important factor as well, and one of the main reasons I want a Surface in the first place.
* Drawing/Designing - once in a blue moon. Some doodling, mostly. Not very essential.


**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 

Won't be gaming on this device.


**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 

Reliable build quality would be good, as I won't be able to send it back for warranty purposes. Is the SP3 more reliable than the SP4, which I've heard suffers from a few quality issues, especially regarding the display?


**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

As I've stated before, this device won't be my main workstation, I've already got a decently powerful laptop, but which at nearly 3 kilos is literally a pain to carry around. So I want a portable, yet powerful device. But since I plan to keep this for a decent period of time (at least 3 years), which one should I go for - the SP3 or the SP4?"

I know this has been posted multiple times before, but I didn't see an answer that could help my specific problem. 

I plan on going to Japan for an internship in 1 year, as a personal goal I want to familiarize myself with Japanese as much as possible, to both have ( basic ) conversations and to be able to read Japanese. 

I started one week ago, with the memorizing of both the Katakana and Hiragana sound and symbol lists. This went alot smoother than I expected, but I am sure this has mainly to do with images I associated with certain symbols, which helped me recall them more easily.

Currently I am at a point where I am not entirely sure what to do, until I read a thread where people suggested to start with Genki and familiarize myself with Kanji later. I started making my own flashcards in Anki and was quite confident that I would be able to recall them as easily as I did with Hiragana and Katakana. However, I am currently stuck and I feel quite overwhelmed with the words I am trying to learn. ( ex. こくさいかんけい ). After reading a bit more people seem to suggest to only use the Genki textbook for grammar lessons and not so much for the vocabulary.

What would you suggest for a total beginner? Should I finish Genki and use flashcards to learn the words nonetheless, should I download a 2k deck and start with this instead or should I do something entirely different like learning kanji? 

Thanks in advance,

I ask this because I'm having no luck securing unpaid internship work. My resume isn't very strong in PR experience, but I do have corporate work experience, additional skills/organisations outside of school, good grades, and experience with university PR volunteer work. 

My name is (Blank) and I am currently a 3rd Year Public Relations/Marketing student at the University of (Blank), although I’ve called (Blank) home since 1996.  

The marketing strategy employed by the team at (PR/MARKETING FIRM), is the best approach available at this time. With your use of Google AdWords, Analytics, and SEO, your team is able to optimise user impressions, and also find quality of user impression.

This could be through user interaction on platforms, re-marketing opportunities or geographic/demographic and time related clicks. I believe this strategy combined with the huge reach that Facebook and Twitter ads hold, along with other social media platforms, can create a highly cost effective and powerful campaign.
 
I believe that while learning and working with (PR/MARKETING FIRM), I could help provide (PR/MARKETING FIRM) with a high standard of work and gain valuable experience from professionals in the field. 

I would be very excited share ideas and learn new ideas while being part of a team that is clearly pushing the limits of what the internet marketing and public relations has to offer.
 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I all east get paid for aiding him but the 30 plus hours a week I put into the site are unpaid. This doesn't include my normal job that I have. I also have a 16 credit hour semester. On top of that, I fell into running two clubs on campus. My depression has not been this bad since highschool. Of course, it cannot just be these things on my mind. I was raped at the beginning of the semester. This rape was followed by weeks of bullying and losing many friends for claiming to be raped. Later in the semester, I met a girl. She was kind at first but of course as we started to date, that changed quickly. Trying to back out of it has been hard. I am not good with being mean. I am very passive when it comes to stuff like this. My best female friend confessed her feelings for me, as well. Ended up staying at her place and had a good night. First night of happiness in awhile. That blew up in my face as well. She now wants nothing to with me. I have spent every night the past week crying.

Always keen to see where a partner will take these things so feel free to play it how you like! I'll be around for a few hours so feel free to flick me a message even if the post is a bit old.


**Option 1**


Your phone buzzes in your hand as you walk through the busy office. The young new intern trying to make her way in the world as my latest secretary.


You unlock the phone and read my message


""How does it feel to be walking through the halls with your panties filled with that thick load of sticky warm cum""


You can feel your face burn red as you read the message, each step you take reminds you of the sticky mess in your underwear.


It was only 10mins ago that you were in my office, bent over my desk with your mascara running down your cheeks as you quietly whimpered and begged for me to fill your tight little pussy.


Instead I slowly pulled my cock from you and began to fill the soft underwear caught around your young thighs.


I didn't say many words as I groaned deeply as I stroked my thick load into the material before pulling them up, a feeling you weren't familiar with as I pulled your skirt back down over your tight little ass.


You did as expected, turning and dropping to your knees wrapping your lips around me to clean up the mess you'd made just like I'd insisted in our previous encounter.


*buzz buzz* another message


""My little slut. Walking the office with drenched panties. Next time it'll be that perfect little ass""


**Option 2**


You suddenly wake up. You panic. Where are you? What's happening? What's that smell? Alcohol?


And then the fear really sets in as you slowly begin to wake up properly you realise your small wrists are pinned down and there's a heavy weight on top of you, pressing you face down into the couch.


You scream for me to get off, your small frame thrashes under me. Suddenly I have both your small wrists pinned above you in one big rough hand.


The stench of alcohol strong as you feel my other rough hand slip under your skirt, pushing it up as my fingers slide between your thighs and roughly run along your underwear.


Shit... You must have drifted off.


But you trusted me... But you realise you were wrong as you squeal at my touch. Who Am I?


**Option 3**


""It can all be yours"" I say as I watch your response. I can tell you're excited about the offer but also uncomfortable.


It was my wife who first insisted we get you in, a gorgeous girl from the neighbourhood who was just looking to make a few extra bucks as a cleaner.


Our large house was quite the job and we certainly had money to spare, this neighbourhood was a gold mine with people like me with more money than we knew what to do with. You had seemed instantly curious when you arrived today being greeted by myself instead of my wife.


She's long gone now, a relief really as it gave me the opportunity to finally push the boundaries of my wealth and prove that money really can buy anything.


Which leads us back to my offer. A platinum credit card sitting in front of you on the table, it could be all yours. Along with this house and everything I have to offer.


Think of the things you could buy, the events your could attend and never having to work again.


All if you agree to give yourself to me and become mine."

**Sharp:** Hello?........Wait I won that contest?......Oh man, Europe here I come! Thank you people for this opportunity!

Sharp then hangs up the phone, as he’s grinning from ear to ear.

**Sharp:** Man, not everyday you win an all expenses paid trip to Europe! And anywhere I want to go there too! November’s gonna be a good month for me!......But I still do have this job to take care of, how can I juggle that with the trip?....I GOT IT! A mini-europe tour! Last 2 weeks into the IPPV will be in Europe, that should be easy to determine, but what about the IPPV itself…..

Sharp looks around his room, before he sees something, a map of the world on the wall, as he gets an idea.

**Sharp:** Alright, I got a leftover pack of darts from Appelbaum’s title win celebration backstage, I can toss that at the map, wherever we land, we go!

Sharp stands up, reaching into his desk, grabbing a pack of darts, and ripping them open.

**Sharp:** But something feels missing….I need to make this truly random…

Sharp reaches into his desk again, as he pulls out a blindfold, as he walks in front the map, a dart in one hand, the rest of them in the other, as he ties the blindfold around his eyes, before tossing the dart!.....right into the atlantic ocean, as he lifts down the blindfold for a moment to see.

**Sharp:** Damn, can’t exactly have a show on a cruise, lets try again.

Sharp brings the blindfold back up, as he tosses another dart!.....right into the english channel, as he lifts the blindfold down again, just sighing at his miss this time, as he brings the blindfold back up again, as he tosses a third dart!......right into the mediterranean, as he brings down his blindfold once more.

**Sharp:** Dang! Third time’s supposed to be the charm! Alright, still got a few more…

Sharp re-blinds himself, as he tosses a fourth dart!....this time into the north sea. But before he brings down his blindfold, we see Mark Dutch stumble into the room!

**Dutch:** Oh hey Sharp, what are you doing here?

**Sharp:** Got a trip to Europe, figure i’d bring WiR along, trying to decide an IPPV location by tossing these darts at the map.

**Dutch:** Ah I see…..

Dutch then moves over to the map, as he takes the dart Sharpe just tossed, and places right on the spot marking Amsterdam in The Netherlands!

**Dutch:** Well hey! Looks like you hit right on the mark of my home country! Nice shot man!

**Sharp:** I did?!

Sharp brings down his blindfold, as he sees the dart Dutch placed on The Netherlands, as he thinks he hit it there!

**Sharp:** Well, I guess you in particular will probably enjoy our Europe trip!

**Dutch:** Yeah, what luck for you to hit right at Amsterdam as I walk in! But anyway, gotta go, me and Louis are training for our tag title match.

**Sharp:** Goodbye!

Dutch walks out, as Sharp looks at the mat, proud that he hit a dart right on the spot, as the video ends, and we cut back to The Warlords and Sharp at the desk, Sharp looking shocked.

**Romero:** So yeah, the whole thing with the IPPV location was Dutch shaming you, me and Rob had our suspicions. An IPPV in The Netherlands right after Dutch wins a title seemed to bit too convenient, so we inquired about, and thankfully an intern gave us access to some footage so we could find this, and hopefully be able to give Dutch something he deserves.

**Sharp:** And I will! I can’t believe this! I’ve been played a fool! Tell, you what, I figure you two had plans to confront D&amp;B already right?

**Warlock:** Yes, we were indeed after what they did last week by attacking us when we were tired and vulnerable, we’re making sure they don’t get away with a damn thing they do to us.

**Sharp:** Alright, how about this: you two get D&amp;B. Not only is it payback for both of us but I’ll sweeten the pot. I figure your third and final encounter will be special, so if you two get a piece of them tonight, you can challenge them to whatever kind of match you want and I’ll make it official.

**Romero:** Sounds fine, don’t see any problem there. Just an added bonus to what we were already gonna do. Thank you for the opportunity.

**Sharp:** No problem, their attitudes cause more than just you two some problems. Goodbye!

The Warlords the leave the room, as we zoom out the around the corner, where we see Dutch, Becca, and Blackwater around the corner, all up against the wall, listening, as Dutch begins to speak.

**Dutch:** Sharp is conspiring with The Warlords against all of us! This is ridiculous! Come on, we gotta get out of this place, we can’t let them get the upper hand.

Dutch then leads the other two away, as they all begin to walk away, and towards a door, which they open leading to the outside of the arena. Before suddenly, they got stopped in their path by a security guard!

**Guard:** HALT! I have just received a message from Mr. Sharp, that for this week, you three, but especially Dutch and Blackwater. Will not be allowed to exit the premises!

**Dutch:** What?! What for?

**Guard:** Says it’s about you interfering in his decision making process.

**Dutch:** Wow, you guys know shit fast.. but come on! That was just me! Even if you can’t let me out at least let Louis and Becca out.

**Guard:** Sorry sir, it’s orders, I don’t wanna lose my job here.

**Blackwater:** YOU’LL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!

Blackwater attempts to run past and make a break for his car, before suddenly we see a swarm of security flock on him, restraining him, and pushing him back into the building, as he uselessly flails and shouts expletives at the guards, as we now see the more security guards around the area, prepared in case Dutch and Becca do something similar.

**Dutch:** *sigh* Fine, we’ll go back in, but i’ll leave a warning we won’t tolerate being conspired against! We may not find our way now, but we will soon.

Dutch and Becca then turn away, and walk back into the building. We go back to Paisner and Woodbridge at ringside.

**Woodbridge:** Now our general manager is conspiring against the Tag Team Champions?! What’s become of us?!

**Paisner:** This isn’t just business, Mark, this is personal. D&amp;B have been running roughshod on The Warlords for far too long and now they’ve dragged Russell Sharp into it. They’re manipulators, they’re selfish, and most importantly they’re fucking assholes.

**Woodbridge:** But most most importantly they’re bringing us to Amsterdam.

**Paisner:** You’re just excited for the weed.

**Woodbridge:** I can’t stay mad cus I know in a few weeks I’m gonna be so happy.
We cutaway from the scene of the commentators at ringside, to the shot of Maverick, just now entering the arena, from the parking lot entrance. He doesn’t look in the best of moods, and actually looks a bit angry!

**Maverick:** Alright, where’s Eric Matthews!? I need to introduce my foot to his ass!

Hearing Maverick’s voice, Chad Hammocks quickly approaches Maverick, and relays Matthews’ message for him.

**Hammocks:** Hey Mav! Good news, Matthews has decided to give Rosco back, peacefully!

**Maverick:** Wait…..what?

**Hammocks:** It’s true! He said he’s in the locker room, in a kennel waiting for you!

Maverick looks a tad bit relieved, but skeptical at the same time, knowing the kind of person that Matthews has been known to be.

**Maverick:** I need to go see this for myself….

Maverick speed-walks over to the locker room, and shoves the door open. He peers into the room, and sees a kennel with a blanket over it, with [the oinks of a Pig coming from inside.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YK10Zc1Yro) A large smile forms across Maverick’s face.

**Maverick:** Well, I’ll be damned…..

Maverick kneels over to remove the blanket over the kennel, but Rosco isn’t inside!!! 

**Maverick:** What in the goddamn….

Instead, Maverick finds a tape recorder, which is replaying the sounds of Pig Oinks. Also in the Kennel, is a [cheeseburger…](http://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2012/9/5/1/WU0306H_perfect-bacon-cheeseburgers_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.462.suffix/1371609447083.jpeg) Mav’s expression turns from Happy to Pissed in about 2 seconds.

**Maverick:** God-damnit! Rosco isn’t here, but why the fuck is there a cheeseburger in here?

Maverick opens the kennel, and picks the burger up. Maverick looks at the burger carefully, and notices something brown between the bun and the burger meat.

**Maverick:** Wait a minute……

Maverick lifts the bun on the burger, and finds……..3 pieces of Bacon.

**Maverick:**.............no……….NO!!………
Maverick drops the burger, with a look of horror on his face, his body starts to shake, as emotions start to overwhelm his body and mind. Maverick’s eyes start to water as he looks at the bacon on the ground….

**Maverick:** no…...this…...this can’t…….this can’t be…….be real…..

Maverick starts trying to deny in his mind what he’s seeing, but knowing the kind of person that Matthews is, starts to slowly perceive what’s in front of him to be true. Tears start to roll freely down Maverick’s face, as his eyes turn red and his fingers tremble. Maverick looks up into the air, screaming in agony, looking at what his best friend has become.

**Maverick:**:......NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Maverick starts to look a bit crazed, ripping out pieces of his own hair, and he continues to cry.

**Maverick:** My…..my best friend……...reduced to……...a SNACK!.......ON A FUCKING SANDWICH!....

Maverick buries his face in his hands, as he starts to look angry, and VENGEFUL!

**Maverick:** Rosco…….I’m not going to let your demise be in vain……...I promise……..Matthews is a DEAD MAN. A DEAD MAN!!!!

Matthews slams his fist on the ground as hard as he can, slamming it into a small puddle of his own tears.

**Maverick:** I promise…….my friend……

We see one last shot of the distressed, troubled Maverick looking down at the remains of Rosco as we fade away, fading back to the commentators table.

**Paisner:** I……..I don’t even…..know what to say.

**Woodbridge:** You know, Matthews has done some, terrible, awful things here, but…..this time…….this time he really crossed the line…..

**Paisner:** I….I think we all need a moment...after that….Oh my god.

**Woodbridge:** Fans, stay with us, there’s more action to come.

**[COMMERCIAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xzN6FM5x_E)**

**Paisner:** Alright fans, we’re back. Let’s go to the ring.

We cut back into the ring, as the sickening [music of TCTV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S623yzR6SY) begins to play, as Teddy Coronado, dressed in a [fine suit, for him](https://www.funwirks.com/media/catalog/product/c/1/c1959-80s-testival-suit.jpg). He unbuttons the coat to reveal the Undisputed Independent Championship. He carries the title around his waist and a microphone in his hand. He’s smiling violently. The crowd rains down boos as he enters the ring, as upbeat as ever.

**Paisner**: It’s WiR’s own Undisputed Independent Champion. The, *rather unique*, Teddy Coronado.

**Woodbridge**: That’s announcer for weird as fuck. 

Teddy interrupts our announce team’s discussion as he begins to speak. The crowd continues to jeer.

**Teddy**: HelloooOO, friendos! It’s me, Teddy!

**Crowd**: FUCK YOU, TEDDY! *Clap, clap, clap-clap-clap.*

**Crowd**: FUCK YOU, TEDDY!

The crowd continues booing and chanting as Teddy keeps up his shit-eating grin.

**Teddy**: Now, that’s no way to talk to your host, is it, folks? Calm it, calm it. We’ve got plenty to discuss. For example, last week. And some exposition for you at home. See, you might be wondering why I attacked KCJ, why I put her off the air for quite some time. I’m a man of ambition, you see. I am a determined man, and who wouldn’t want that for a protagonist? But I did not intend to end KCJ’s career. I did not set out to do so, friendos, no, no, no. There are casualties in wartime. There are casualties in extermination. That’s what I intend to do. *Exterminate*. Breed out the weakness. The only way to do that, quite fortunately for me, is violence. And I happen to be quite good at violence. I did not intend to breed out KCJ, though. No, no, no. She’s old hat. She couldn’t even beat Brodie Hansen. Twice! Or three times, who cares? It’s just K-C-J. 

The crowd boos at the disregard for one of their favorites.

**Teddy**: Now, now, now, Brodie Hansen, that’s a diff’rent story. Brodie Hansen is something in-ter-est-ing. 

Teddy sits down into [a comfortable position](https://i.imgur.com/dWrb1eW.jpg), taking off his title and putting it on his shoulder in one swift motion.

**Teddy**: But unfortunately, pallies, Brodie Hansen is dead. Buried. There’s some stone in Arkansas that says “Brodie Hansen October 11th, 2015-July 31, 2016”. You know that date well, friends, for that is the day when the beast went ker-splat against the windshield. That windshield would go through another windshield ‘round a month later, but that’s a different story. If I could describe Hansen’s performance there, I would say “car crash”. But that’s only because Brodie Hansen wasn’t there. Brodie Hansen was the monster. The devil’s incarnation on this earthly plane, and then he lost. And he was Brodie Hansen no more. 

Teddy pauses, looking out into the crowd giving him disapproval.

**Teddy:** See, the record books are wrong when they say Brodie Hansen won a tag team championship. Brodie Hansen didn’t. Jon Cody and Lucian Alexander did. Jon *fucking* Cody. That’s the name of the impostor you saw last week, the week before, and every single fucking week “Hansen” has been in since he came back. Brodie Hansen is dead, Jon, and you should stop putting on his fucking skin. Brodie Hansen’s corpse should be sent back to Carcosa and buried. Because Brodie Hansen died when Jon Cody lost that match. And I am going to bring him back and then I’m going to beat him. In the middle of the ring, in the middle of the arena, so the whole fucking world, streaming from TCTV, can see what I am. The god that I am. But first, we have to see Jon. Jon, come out here. Show the world what you are.

Silence reigns throughout the arena for a couple seconds. The crowd is confused, but Teddy’s face seems to know it all. He gets up and goes through the ropes.

**Teddy**: Like the coward he-

[Root Of All Evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cSZ3Vsugso) begins to play. The crowd goes fucking insane and Teddy smiles too. He goes back to the center of the ring, gazing as Brodie Hansen, in all his glory, walks down to the ring.

**Brodie:** You think you’re really clever, don’t you, Teddy?

**Teddy:** Yes. I do. 

Brodie stops, shooting a disapproving stare at Teddy, which doesn’t seem to phase the Independent Champion in the slightest.

**Brodie:** Teddy, do you think I haven’t thought the same things you’re saying? Do you think I haven’t felt the difference? You’re right. Brodie Hansen *did* die that night last year. The monster that wrecked this company and my brain was slain by Andrew Garcia that night. But, unlike you, I realize that’s for the best. No person should be that cold, Teddy. No person should be that unremorseful. I hold onto his name to remind myself of that. I hold onto his name to remind myself to temper that darkness. 

Brodie walks closer to the ring, pulling himself onto the apron.

**Brodie:** It’s the same darkness that’s in you, Teddy. It’s a powerful thing, and, no doubt, it could take you as high or higher than I went if you were to let it eat you up the way I did. But it. Is. Dangerous. You don’t succumb to something that powerful for free. You lose your friends, your family, you lose entire days because you’re swimming in that darkness. You have the potential for real greatness, Teddy. You have the potential without letting that darkness control you. Teddy, listen to me. 

Brodie pauses.

**Brodie:** Don’t be Brodie Hansen.

**Teddy**: Oh, I won’t. I’ll be *so much worse.*

The lights go out. As they come back on, Teddy’s gone and the outside area is filled, every nook and cranny, by a Tedhead. There must be dozens and dozens. Brodie stands alone in the ring. He is surrounded.

**Paisner**: Oh my god, he’s surrounded!

**Teddy**: Yep.

Allen Paisner looks to his side to find Teddy Coronado, instead of his partner, Mark Woodbridge.

**Paisner**: Where… What have you done, Teddy?

**Teddy**: Irrelevant. Now, let’s go, boys! It’s time!

The Tedheads begin to move in. Brodie manages to knock one down, with its screen cracking on the ground, but the rest climb the ropes and enter the ring. Despite their numbers, Brodie towers over them. A few, despite their faces, or lack thereof, seem scared. One, braver than the rest, charges in and is promptly met with [a bicycle kick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jOdM18Fr4w), cracking the screen wide open!

**Paisner**: The power of Brodie’s big boot!

**Teddy**: Educated feet, Paisner.

**Paisner**: Oh, uh, yeah. He’s putting those to, um, good use.

**Teddy**: Perfect commentary. Fucking five stars. Tokyo Dome.

As Teddy re-educates Paisner in his vocabulary, Brodie is fighting off the horde. They’re beginning to surround him. The Tedheads charge in.

**Teddy**: Wake up, Jonny boy.

They grab and swarm over him, like ants at a picnic. One or two have their monitors smashed in, but the rest are climbing over Brodie.

**Paisner**: They’re consuming him!

**Teddy**: Pretty much.

The Tedheads completely cover Brodie. They lay over him, trying to smother him like [bees to a wasp](https://youtu.be/K6m40W1s0Wc?t=2m3s). For a few moments, they seem to be successful.

**Paisner**: Brodie is stuck under the cabal of Tedheads!

**Teddy**: The correct group designation is hoodlum. A hoodlum of Tedheads.

The hoodlum of Tedheads shudder.

**Paisner**: What is this?

It shakes again, harder, and more violently.

**Teddy**: This is an awakening.

The Tedheads go flying off, as Brodie Hansen stands again. He attacks like a man possessed. One after another, the Tedheads are smashed. One goes the way of a big boot, the other, a uranage. A few begin to crowd outside the ring, and Brodie has something for them too.

**Paisner**: [SUICIDE DIVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jSbCfX2cfE)!

**Teddy**: Almost.

Brodie goes flying into the Tedheads, cracking most of their screens. He gets up immediately, and goes through each Tedhead on the ground, making sure their televisions are truly smashed. The hoodlum is scattered. A few remain on the ground, most are smashed. One hides in the crowd, pretending to read a newspaper, as if had eyes or a newspaper. One remains in the ring, lying against the ropes. Brodie gets back into the ring. He stares the thing down and it tries to crawl away, but Brodie grabs its legs and drags it back. The man picks up the television man and sets it up for a familiar move.

**Paisner**: He’s setting up for it! The Orange Crush!

Teddy gets up and screams into his headset. He’s maniacal.

**Teddy**: DO IT! DO IT!

Brodie looks at him. He puts the Tedhead down and walks away. Teddy is furious. He enters the ring as Brodie leaves it. As the Tedhead stirs, [Teddy knees him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUwhSNoDlhI)! The knee shatters the glass screen to pieces.

**Paisner**: TV Knee!

**Woodbridge**: OH! The madness of Teddy Coronado!

**Paisner**: What? How long have you been here?

**Woodbridge**: What are you talking about, Pais?

Teddy Coronado stares off against Brodie Hansen, who stands in the entrance way. Teddy raises his championship and the lights go out. When they come up, he’s gone.

**COMMERCIAL**

We cut back to the show, as we’re backstage again, seeing all of D&amp;B once again walking backstage.

**Dutch:** Alright, so if we can’t get out by the doors, we’ll have to do something else, we can try and evade them while staying in here, turn their attack around on them, or find other means of escape. Louis, you got any ideas?

**Blackwater:** There’s always fuckin’ sledgehammers under the ring for some reason! We can walk to the ring, take ‘em from under there, then go back here to bust through the walls to FREEDOM!

**Dutch:** Are you insane? It’d be suspicious as hell if we walked to the ring, grabbed some sledgehammers, then walked right back. 

**Blackwater:** Nah bitch. Listen. We lure some loser team like The Coffee Boyz or KPC out to the ring for some Tag Title open challenge. Bell rings, crowd’s like *aw yay fighting champions how heroic and sexy and shit, we love D&amp;B ahh,* we go under the ring, then beat the dog shit outta em with the sledgehammers! It’ll look like we were out there just to make a statement, and not at all to get tools in order to escape!

**Dutch:** That’s risky. Too high of a chance of The Warlords just coming out, with them getting a reward for coming at us, they’re not missing their chance.

**Blackwater:** Oh yeah, we’re supposed to be hiding, right. We can wear masks…?

**Dutch:** [*Shakes his head in dismissal*] Becca, you got anything?

**Becca:** There’s some nice places to hide out in here, I hear management got a lounge room, we can hide in plain sight, since they’ll be expecting us to be where the rest of the talent usually is.

**Dutch:** Sounds good, we’re barge in there, kick any suits that may be in there. And relax until the end of the show.

**Blackwater:** Are you sure you don’t want to beat people up with sledgehammers? Just for fun?

**Dutch:** Maybe next week, but not now, and i’m fairly sure the lounge room is just ‘round the corner.

The three continue their walk, as Dutch’s assumption is correct, as they arrive at the door of the lounge room, as we see several suited men and women in there, all casually relaxing, as Blackwater then kicks the door open! As a look of surprise overtakes the suited people

**Blackwater:** ALRIGHT FUCKERS WE’RE TAKING THIS SHIT OVER GET THE HELL OUT BEFORE WE COMMIT A MASS CAMPAIGN OF DISEMBOWELING AND DEFENESTRATION!

The suited people all look completely frozen in shock and fear for a moment, before they all run out of the room screaming. As Blackwater stands there with pride.

**Blackwater:** Works every time! Between the three of us, I don’t even know what I just said.

The three then close the door, Becca closing the blinds on all windows that let anyone peek into the room, as we cut to a different area backstage, where we see Warlock and Romero in the talent lounge room, with various pieces of furniture, and screens showing the show all about.

**Romero:** Do you really think they’re here Rob?

**Warlock:** Of course they are! Becca and Dutch are probably fucking behind a couch as we speak, while Louis probably jacks off behind a chair! We turn this place over, and we’ll surely find something! Lets start with the couch here, I’ll lift it up!

Warlock then goes over to the couch, and begins to lift, but seems to struggle a bit with it, only getting it up a bit.

**Warlock:** Damn, I seem a bit rusty at lifting shit like this, you usually do that. In fact, get over here, i’m hopeless with this.

Romero obliges, as he walks over, and picks up the couch, and effortlessly turns it over!....to reveal nothing.

**Romero:** Ain’t nothing there, you really sure we should keep searching?

**Warlock:** Yes! Maybe Dutch and Becca wanted some alone time, so they had Louis leave, and he’s just behind a chair masturbating by himself. There’s a chair in every corner here, lets turn them over!

Romero then goes to the first chair, and turns it over!.....and again nothing, he then goes to the second chair and flips it!....again nothing. Getting a bit frustrated, he goes to the third chair, picks it up, and flings it across the room to get it out the way!....and again nothing. His frustration quickly building, he charges the fourth chair, and big boots it, flipping it over!....and again nothing. As Romero’s frustration mellows a bit into an annoyance, as he sighs.

**Romero:** Nothing here, where the hell else would they be?

**Warlock:** I’m sure someone’s seen them today, we’ll go and ask.

We come back to Paisner and Woodbridge.

**Paisner:** Warlock and Romero are still looking for the Tag Team Champions!

**Woodbridge:** They can’t be far; Sharpe has the building on lockdown!

**Paisner:** The Warlords want to teach D&amp;B a lesson and pick the stipulation for the match at Copyright Strike. To do that they gotta keep playing this game of cat and mouse. But now we take a break from it, as we got more action in the ring! Lets go to Javier! 

**Javier:** The following contest is a tag team match, and it is scheduled for one fall - 

**Crowd:** ONE FALL!

**Javier:** With a 20 minute time limit. Introducing first, from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, at a combined weight of 407 pounds, the team of Andrew Reilly and Dylan Jones -   THE GOONSQUAD!

[The Boys are Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1NZcH2haIM) starts to build in the background as Reilly and Jones step out from behind the curtain to a medium-sized booing. They stare at the crowd and begin their walk to the ring.

**Paisner:** To be completely honest we don’t know much about these two. They were trained by Joey McCarty, presumably. They’re young, and hungry to make a dent in WiR. Tonight, however, they seem to be on their own, and we’ll see how that goes for them.

**Woodbridge:** From what we can tell, they’re quick, and would benefit greatly from some technique, but they’re scrappy.

The duo roll into the ring and stand in the center, bouncing foot to foot as their music dies down.

**Javier:** And their opponents, at a combined weight of 445 pounds... they are two-thirds of the BBC... CHARLIE KRIEGER and BUSTER BRAVADO!

[Domo23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4OD3IHs5jU) hits the arena and Krieger and Buster charge out from backstage to resounding cheers. They jaw with the crowd up at the top, rolling their eyes with playful smiles, flipping off the fans in the front row before slapping high-fives.

**Paisner:** Scrappiness might not be enough to get them through this match tonight, however, because the BBC are one of the most unorthodox - but effective - groups in WiR history. Their tag reign is the stuff of legends, and they haven’t missed a step yet.

**Woodbridge:** Speaking of which, don’t they have a tag title rematch?

**Paisner:** I’m sure they’ll get to it eventually.

Buster and Krieger charge to the ring, and roll into the ring, immediately popping up and trading punches with the Goonsquad!

**Crowd:** YAAAAAAY!

 A flustered Mia calls for the bell!

**DING DING DING**

**Paisner:** The BBC wasting no time, and this match has already broken down!

**Woodbridge:** Did you expect anything else from these two?

Krieger and Buster get the early advantage, using their strikes to push Reilly and Jones back into the ropes. The BBC, in unison, irish whip their opponents, and charge at them with unison crossbodies! Both Krieger and Buster hook the legs!

...

**Mia:** Um.. who is... legal man?

Krieger leaps to his feet, followed quickly by Buster!

**Krieger:** Whoa, what the fuck, Mia? Are you saying Buster isn’t a legal man? 

**Buster:** I’m BLACK! Born in Georgia! That’s fucking racist!

**Mia:** I.. no.. Um.. I meant.. man in match.

The BBC step back!

**Krieger/Buster:** Oh! Fuck, we’re sorry!

The two step back again, spewing apologies, only to get caught by Reilly and Jones, who hook them about the waist and toss them backwards with dual German suplexes! Buster and Krieger land on their backs, and roll to their feet, slowly getting up and holding their spines! The two teams face off yet again, and start trading fists back and forth! Right hand from Reilly to Krieger! Right hand from Buster to Reilly! Jones kicks Krieger in the gut, who staggers backward! Buster and Krieger lock hands and knock Jones over with a double clothesline! They spin, only to be caught with a double dropkick from Reilly, and both stagger into the ropes! 

**Paisner:** This match is already a mess, and we’re barely into it!

**Woodbridge:** The BBC came out here ready to fight, and the Goonsquad are keeping up with them so far!

The BBC catch themselves, and Reilly charges forward, trying to take them both over with a clothesline - no! Krieger catches him with a boot and Reilly staggers backward! Jones pushes himself to his feet and charges at Krieger, as Reilly charges at Buster, but they’re both rebuffed with kicks! Krieger and Buster charge at the Goonsquad, only to be caught with tandem arm drags! Reilly and Jones pop up, high five each other, and start putting the boots to the BBC!

**Paisner:** Like it or not, the team of Reilly and Jones is showing an impressive amount of chemistry, especially for two guys so young!

**Woodbridge:** Buster and Krieger came out here and started a brawl, and that’s exactly where these two hockey goons shine.

Krieger grabs Reilly’s boot, and fights to his feet, before tossing Reilly down with a dragon screw! Jones turns his focus to Krieger, only to be hooked up for a vertical suplex! Jones slithers out and rolls Krieger up! Buster charges in and stops the roll-up immediately with a kick to the back! Reilly responds by slithering over, and catching Buster with a schoolboy! Krieger pops to his feet and dives over, breaking up that pin as well! All four men push themselves to their feet, Buster and Krieger in between the Goonsquad! Buster throws a stiff punch at Reilly, but Reilly blocks it and responds with a kick to the gut, staggering Buster backwards into Krieger, who is trading blows with Jones! Reilly and Jones make eye contact for a split second, and both charge forward with dual clotheslines, sandwiching Krieger and Buster into each other!  

**Crowd:** OOH!

Reilly and Jones step away, and Krieger and Buster fall flat on their faces!

**Paisner:** Innovative offense from the Goonsquad, and the BBC are entirely on the back foot so far in this match!

**Woodbridge:** Like you said, Allen, these two seem to just click as a team!

Mia comes up to the Goonsquad and starts bawling them out for being in the ring together! The two argue back, but eventually Reilly acquiesces, and steps over Krieger - no! Krieger grabs Reilly by the leg, and rolls him into a kneebar! Reilly grimaces in pain as Krieger locks it in tight, but Jones charges across the ring, catching Krieger with a stiff kick to the kidney and shocking him into letting go! Reilly pulls himself to his feet, careful not to put much weight on his leg, and Krieger pulls himself up a moment after! Both Reilly and Jones turn to Krieger, and shove him into the corner, and start pummeling him with boots! Mia forces her way in, trying to break it up - Buster from out of nowhere! He leaps - reverse rana on Reilly!

**Crowd:** YAAAAAAY!

**Paisner:** Mia trying desperately to get this match under control but every time she tries it, another brawl breaks out! 

**Woodbridge:** Everyone in this match should be in the penalty box already!

**Paisner:** Wow, a hockey joke from Mark Woodbridge. The world is ending.

Buster pops up, and catches Jones under the jaw with a superkick! Jones hits the mat, and rolls out of the ring, clutching his jaw! Krieger staggers out of the corner, and steps between the ropes, going to his corner before flopping onto his face on the apron! Reilly grabs the ropes and staggers to his feet! Buster charges with a big boot, but Reilly ducks under it and goes for a roll-up!

**1!**

**2!**

Buster fights his way free from the flash pin and pops up to his feet! Reilly pushes himself up as well, and the two stand face to face, before locking up! Buster takes the advantage with a hammerlock, and starts kicking at Reilly’s injured leg, while Reilly grimaces in pain! Buster spins out, and transitions the hammerlock into an arm-wringer, before hooking Reilly’s legs and taking him to the mat with a drop toe hold! Buster then spins around, hooking his opponent by the injured leg and torquing it back with a half Boston Crab!

**Crowd:** THIS IS WRESTLING! *clap clap clapclapclap*

**Paisner:** After a huge brawl to start this match, it does seem like we’re starting to get into some actual wrestling here finally! Buster with a surprising technical display, and a submission - unusual from him!

**Woodbridge:** Buster knows that neither of these men have much experience in mat wrestling, so even though it’s not his strong suit, he’s hoping to catch them off guard.

Reilly grabs for the ropes quickly, and Buster torques the hold back one final time while Reilly digs his fingers into the rope, before letting it go! Reilly rolls onto his back, clutching his knee, and Buster takes a step back, measuring. Reilly pulls himself up to a sitting position using the ropes, and Buster charges forward!

**Paisner:** He’s going for the Bravado Buster! 

**Woodbridge:** He’s trying to end this one while Jones is still on the outside recuperating! 

Reilly ducks! He sweeps Buster’s other leg out from under him, and Buster goes throat-first into the ropes! Buster falls to the mat, clutching his now-crushed windpipe, and Reilly pulls himself to his feet! 

**Crowd:** BOO!


Reilly ignores the crowds boos, and acting on his adrenaline surge, rushes to the corner! He steps through the ropes, and climbs up to the top turnbuckle, trying to put as little weight as possible on his bad leg! Buster starts to come to, staggering to his feet, as Reilly reaches the top. The adrenaline fades from his face and a look of terror sets in!

**Paisner:** Um.. does Reilly know how to do moves off the top?

**Woodbridge:** I.. I sure hope so, Allen.

Reilly leaps! ... and proceeds to collide into the dazed Buster with [perhaps the most graceful move in all of history](https://makeagif.com/gif/an-absolutely-reckless-flying-nothing-by-wrasslormonkey-TvSIzM) Both men fall to the mat in a heap, and Reilly clutches his knee in pain! Reilly drags himself to his corner, where Jones has just pulled himself up, and makes the tag, as Buster crawls over to his corner and does the same! Buster rolls to the outside, and hits the mat, while Krieger and Jones charge at each other! Krieger leaps with a crossbody, but Jones is more prepared this time, and catches the bigger man! Jones staggers backward, before dropping Krieger to the mat in a poor impersonation of the World’s Strongest Slam! Jones pops back up, as does Krieger, and the two proceed to trade haymakers that wouldn’t be out of place in a chess boxing competition!

**Crowd:** YAY! BOO! YAY! BOO! YAY! BOO!

Krieger lands with a solid punch, and Jones drops to one knee to collect himself! 

**Crowd:** YAAAAAY! 

Krieger takes a step backwards - Reilly tries to climb into the ring to stop him! Mia goes over to stop Reilly - LOW BLOW FROM JONES! 

**Crowd:** BOO!

Jones hooks the leg, as Reilly goes back to his corner with a smile!

**1!**

**2!**

Krieger gets the shoulder up, and goes back to holding his crotch in agony! Jones gets up, heaves the whimpering Krieger to his feet, and hits the ropes! He comes back, leaps into the air for a superman punch - NO! Krieger ducks, and catches Jones in a fireman’s carry! He spins him out into a cutter!

**Paisner:** Fireman’s carry - MODIFIED SIERRA LEONE CRUSHER FROM KRIEGER!

**Woodbridge:** How did he even have the wherewithal to do that?

Krieger rolls over, holding his crotch still, and crawls over to Jones, pushing him over and hooking his leg!

**1!**

**2!**

**3- NO!**

Jones kicks out at the last second, and Krieger pushes himself to his feet! 

**Paisner:** Dylan Jones showing some resilience there, but he’s in a bad way, and Charlie’s fucking pissed after that nutshot!

**Woodbridge:** Yeah, I don’t think this match is long for this world!

Krieger lifts the still barely-conscious Jones up to his feet, then into the air in a [powerbomb position!](https://gfycat.com/SarcasticUntidyCommabutterfly) He steels himself - ready for the toss!

**Paisner:** Krieger ready to take Jones to The Money Store!

**Woodbridge:** He has to be pissed, if this is what he’s going for!

[**THUNK!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00mhHd15ci8)

Krieger staggers backward, dazed, before hitting the mat hard, as a [white ball](http://muskegostormbaseball.org/wp-content/uploads/baseball.jpg) is seen rolling out of the ring! Jones falls on top of Krieger, still unconscious! 

**Crowd:** BOOOOOO!

**Paisner:** Wait, WHAT?

**Woodbridge:** Krieger collapsed! He was hit with a baseball! Mia didn’t see it!

**1!**

**2!**

Buster charges into the ring, but Reilly is there to stop him with a clothesline!


**3!**

**DING DING DING!**

Jones comes to as the bell rings, and looks around, confused!

**Javier:** And your winners, at a time of 9:35... THE GOONSQUAD!

Jones pops to his feet, still unsteady, as Reilly charges over to him, helping him stand and celebrating with him, as the crowd boos at them! The duo roll out of the ring, and are met at the top of the ramp by Joey McCarty, who is conspicuously holding a baseball bat! Joey raises both of their hands, and the crowd booes!

**Paisner:** Fucking Joey. 

**Woodbridge:** It looks like Joey gave his proteges the assist from a distance there, giving the Goonsquad the win! 

**Paisner:** Seriously though, how the hell do you even hit someone with a baseball from that far away?

**Woodbridge:** It’s all in the wrists, Allen.

The trio walk backstage, as Buster tends to his partner in the ring.

7939j0,5,2017-10-27,How do I focus on things(career) other than my sexuality?,raghu112233,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/7939j0/how_do_i_focus_on_thingscareer_other_than_my/,"I am 24 yo gay male. I was molested(just jerk off and kissing) at 11 and since then I had multiple such incidents with different people. The thing is I am not worried about those incidents. I have started hooking up voluntarily with strangers. I have self-esteem issues. I don't look attractive--that's what I believe about myself.
So, in the last few months, I have been spending a lot of time on reddit and other websites trying to understand myself on the following.
1)Why I hookup? Why I chat with strangers daily? why I am attracted towards handsome men? What is true love? Why are other guys so handsome and attractive?
2)trying to increase my self-esteem
3)Trying to understand what true gayness means? Am I truly gay or am I just reliant on guys for physical pleasure?
and a few more regular social media time wastes and chats for hooking up.
The thing is : I have a lots of work to do--which I am not focussing on.
I have the following immediate tasks to do:
1)current project in internship
2)GRE &amp; TOEFL
3)PhD admissions process
4)Improving profile to a decent level
5)Working out and Excercise
6)Settling down the debts
7)Other club activities
These things never come to my mind anyday. I am having lots of zero days.
How do I come out of these(thinking about sexuality) thoughts and focus on what's important?
I have spent enough time on sexuality.But, still I tend read such stuff daily.
How do I break this habit?
Anyone facing/faced similar experience--Please help"
793fnt,0,2017-10-27,Should I still apply this fall?,ToTheBuckwalds,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/793fnt/should_i_still_apply_this_fall/,"Hi all, hopefully some of you can help me with my decision of whether or not I should apply for grad school for Fall 2018. The thing that's making me nervous and anxious are my GRE scores (which I got this morning). 

Verbal: 31 percentile - 146 points
Quantitative/Math: 51 percentile - 153 points
Analytical Writing: 42 percentile - 3.5 points

I've never been good at standardized tests, and I don't want this to be the thing that doesn't get me into any of the schools I want to apply to; I'm also worried about my overall undergrad GPA at 2.9. 

What I do got going for me is four plus years of research experience between undergrad research, three internships at academic pharma and federal labs, and I'm working as a med-chemist with the NIH during this gap year. I'm also trying to write the best personal statement I can to help sell myself to admission offices. 

I know everyone says research experience is the main thing they look at but I still have my doubts, wanted to get some additional feedback before I start spending all this money on grad school applications. I do love synthesis, working in the lab, learning complicated mechanisms and am willing to put the time and effort into it; I don't want to delay working towards that PhD cause I've already had to for three years (long story, can explain if interested).

Thanks for the help. "
793xun,16,2017-10-27,[D] Hot topics in dimensionality reduction?,tonkatsu_,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/793xun/d_hot_topics_in_dimensionality_reduction/,"

I am about to start writing a thesis in dimensionality reduction (my specialization is applied math and I am interested in machine learning / data science, I have been working in this field as an intern for some time). I am having hard time choosing the exact direction of my thesis. I was told by my supervisor to describe some algorithms and apply them, but I can more or less do whatever I want as long as it is sufficient for Masters thesis.

I really like t-SNE. But everything has been done here and it is implemented in many languages, so you cannot actually come with something new. What is currently the hot topic in dimensionality reduction? I was thinking about combining Autoencoders+t-SNE or focus more on GPLVM (Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model). Any suggestions on other topics? Or any benchmark that you would be interested in? Implement some fancy algorithm?

It just feels like if you google long enough, there is a paper and library for everything.

Thanks! Any help is really appreciated!

7948nl,11,2017-10-27,Know Your Redditor - PolynesianStyle,Tonixman,StarVStheForcesofEvil,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarVStheForcesofEvil/comments/7948nl/know_your_redditor_polynesianstyle/,"#**INTRO**

Hey there! This was a project that I've been working on for these past few weeks. The title is pretty straight forward, but reasoning behind it is this: As I've browsed through this subreddit and met many unique users, I've always wanted to know more about them, as a person.

So I (along with some other users) came up with some interview questions. These questions are meant to answer basic facts and characteristics about each person that partakes in this interview. These questions are divided into four categories: **Personal Questions** (What they're like IRL). **Subreddit Questions** (These are questions about what the person does on the SVTFOE subbreddit, other subreddits, and on the internet in general). **SVTFOE Questions** (These questions asks the person's views on the show we all know and love). and **MISC. QUESTIONS** (These questions I couldn't categorize in any of the ones above, but were still fun/important to ask).

Now, these questions only touch on the **BASIC** facts about the interviewee. I'd love to know every little detail about the person, but time wouldn't allow that; my goal is to do these posts with as many users as timely as possible! With that said, **it is highly encouraged to ask any additional questions in the comments!!!**. Especially if it wasn't covered in the questions I asked.

So without further ado, ***here's an interview with /u/PolynesianStyle***

---

#**PERSONAL QUESTIONS**

&gt; I like to start with an ice-breaker. Let's play 2-truths-and-a-lie. Tell us three quick facts about yourself, two of which are TRUE and one being a LIE (we’ll find out what’s the lie at the end of the interview).

Umm...let me think. Ok.  
My dad once ran me over with a small flatbed trailer.  
I have never broken a bone in my life.  
Snickers is my favorite candy bar.  

&gt; *In Professor Oak’s voice* **“Are you a boy or a girl?”**

I am a boy trapped in a man's body, AMA!

&gt; How old are you?

~~Too old be on here.~~ Very close to turning 21!

&gt; What style/type of clothing do you like to wear? (ex. Conservative, outlandish, sweatpants and band shirts, naturist, etc.)

Depends on the weather.  
If it's hot: a pair of flip-flops, black/grey ~~swim trunks~~ shorts, and a t-shirt are my go to.  
If it's cold: my tennis shoes, a pair of pants, and a long sleeve shirt are my favorite. Jacket's are optional.  
And whatever the weather I practically always wear my hat. A simple baseball cap with my university's color scheme and logo. ~~The hat is faded, worn, and sun-bleached at this point, but I hold onto it for sentimental reasons.~~

&gt; Tell us a bit about where you live and what you like/don’t like about it.

I live in the US. More specifically, the best state: **TEXAS**.  

Now, I know what some of you are thinking, ""Oh, classic Texan, bragging about Texas. Here we go..."", but I'll have you know that Texas is *objectively* the better of the states. You want evidence? ~~Well shit, me too.~~  
Ok but seriously, I love Texas. Despite the massive stereotypes surrounding the state (which are just that, stereotypes), it has a little bit of everything. And despite being so diverse of a state, mostly everyone has a sense of pride about being from Texas. Idk, it's nice.  
The only thing I can complain about is the finicky weather. In the fall I wake up and it's below 60F/~16C, and by noon it's up to 90F/~32C. In the winter it reaches below freezing, but ices over more than it snows. In the summer it’s normal for it to be over 100F/~38C. Spring is...actually nice, but there's bugs and allergens *everywhere*.


&gt; Favorite place(s) to travel? And/or are there any places you *WISH* to travel?

I would say my favorite place to travel to is the beach.  
I love the ocean. I spent a summer living on the beachfront and sometimes I can still imagine myself hearing the waves constantly gush over the sand as I fall asleep. I used to go body surfing every day after work and just chill with random beach people. The sunsets would make everything explode with hues of oranges and reds and it felt like you were in some cheesy movie.  Needless to say, I get why people say the ocean calls you back.

&gt; Do you speak any other language? And/or are there any languages you’d WISH to learn?

English is actually my second language. I spoke exclusively Spanish until I started school around 4-5 years old. I still speak fluent Spanish to all my family and relatives. ~~Just don't ask me to write in Spanish. Unless you want to see every grammatical mistake known to man.~~  
That being said, English is my primary language now. I use it more frequently than Spanish so it makes sense I guess.  
For some reason I find Korean and Mandarin/Cantonese really interesting languages. If I could learn either, that would be really cool.

&gt; Do you have any siblings? Do they also watch SVTFOE?

I have one little brother. Unfortunately, he doesn't watch SVTFOE. No one in my family does. ):

&gt; Chocolate or fruit-flavored candies?

I'm a chocolate man through-and-through. ~~Although I do think fruit flavored candies are delicious too.~~

&gt; Favorite food/group of foods?

Mami's home made Mexican food.  
If I have to say anything more, you don't know what you’re missing out on my friends.

&gt; Do you have any hobbies you’d like to share?

I play *a lot* of video games. I'll play anything as long as it’s fun. RPGs, MOBAs, FPSs, RTSs, platformers, puzzles, you name it.  
I also sorta ended up joining the aesthetic scene on Tumblr for a bit too. I made edits for people's profile pics. ~~Just don't expect one from me anytime soon. Uni and work keep me far too busy.~~  

&gt; What is your most valuable possession(s)?

My desktop PC is my baby. Built her from the ground up and slowly but surely making her a flag-ship tier monster. If I had to lose everything but one thing, I'd probably pick my PC.

&gt; Got any pets? :3 If so, what are they?

Sadly, no. ):  
Although when I lived with my parents we lived on a ranch, so I grew up with cows, goats, horses, sheep, chickens, and pigs around me. We also always had a stray dog or cat that would stick around for however long they felt like before moving on.  
When I get my own place I'm hoping on getting a cat. I'm probably gonna name it Riven.

&gt; What's your current occupation? (ex. Work full-time, part-time, seasonal, student, not old enough to work, etc.)

~~Full time slave to the system.~~  
Ahem...I mean full time student and intern worker.  
I'm currently double majoring in computer science and mathematics while interning for the university I'm at. At the internship I'm basically an IT guy for one of the uni's departments.  
It doesn't leave me with a lot of free time, but I truly love computer science. It's another passion of mine. The internship is something that I pretty much have to do or I would have no ~~society points~~ money.

&gt; How do you get around town? (Bicycle, car, bus, etc.)

My trusty two feet get me around campus on a day to day basis. They haven't let me down yet.  
Other than that, my car takes me everywhere else I need to go.

&gt; Any hidden/special talents you’d wish to share?

People don't expect it, but I played flute for 7 years. ~~Yes, I was a band nerd~~. I dare say I got güd too.  
I was pretty much required to learn how to ride a horse when I was little, and I didn't really know that wasn't a common thing until later.  
Also, I can put my feet behind my head lol.

&gt; Tell us something embarrassing about yourself! ;)

I still have to sing the alphabet song to put things in alphabetical order...  
Same thing with the order of the months...  
~~Don't judge me.~~

&gt; What’s a weakness/character flaw you’d like to improve on?

I’m *really* bad at eye contact. I'm not shy or anything, I just find eye contact extremely uncomfortable. It makes one-on-one scenarios, like job interviews, difficult.

&gt; Favorite Season? (the fall/winter/summer/spring type of season)

Definitely summer.  
I find things are just more exciting in the summer. School is out. ~~I have a legitimate excuse to not wear clothes around the house.~~ You get together with friends and do stupid stuff. It's a great time.

&gt; What do you want to be when you grow up?

I'm striving to be a software engineer!  
Almost there too. I just have one semester of uni left after this one!

&gt; What were/are you like in school? (All high test scores? Class clown? Barely passed? Jock? Class skipper? Nerd? etc.)

Umm... kind of hard to answer because I was a jack-of-all-trades kind of kid.  
I was lucky enough to go to a (relatively) tiny school for the US. This meant that I could pretty much do anything and everything extracurricular related.  
I was a band kid. I played flute. I marched. I was drum major my senior year. I went to state competitions for solo/ensemble competitions multiple years.  
I also was on the (American) football team all 4 years in high school. I played defensive end. ~~This also means I got to march all sweaty and tired. Yay!~~  
I joined tech club for the LAN parties they would throw.  
Finally I was a part of the school's academic coding team. We basically went around and competed in various coding competitions against other schools in our area.  
Grades wise, I somehow managed to keep straight A's all throughout high school. I ended up as salutatorian for my graduating class.  
I know this sounds like I'm bragging, but it was a class size of less than 100 kids. Trust me, there's no way in hell I would have been able to do all this in a larger school district.

&gt; Early bird or night owl?

Night owl. Without a doubt.  
I used to think I was a morning person because I could actually function in the morning. Turns out I'm just good at forcing myself through the pain of waking up. Night time is my true home.

&gt; Do you have a real life nickname?

Nah, everyone just calls me by my name.

&gt; Anything else you’d like to share with us?

If anyone has any questions go ahead and ask. I'm a (mostly) open book.

#**SUBREDDIT QUESTIONS**

&gt; Overall, what do you like best about this Subreddit?

The sense of community.  
It might be because I joined during Hiatus times, but I like being able to see and recognize each member of the community.

&gt; What do you contribute to the subreddit? Or are you a humble lurker?

I come from humble beginnings as a lurker.  
When I formally joined the subreddit, I wouldn't say I brought anything particularly interesting to the table. I simply view myself as another voice that throws their two cents in.

&gt; What’s your favorite flair to browse through?

I browse everything, but Theories and Fanart.  
Theories because I am a lore slut, and any new concepts or thoughts I devour. Fanart because the SVTFOE community has some genuinely talented artists.

&gt; How often do you visit this subreddit?

I'd say at least once a day.  
Even if it's just for a minute or two between classes and work. I like to check up on the state of the sub and see that all is ~~not lost to chaos~~ well.

&gt; What do you mostly use to access this subreddit? (PC, Mac, Mobile, Library Computer, etc.)

Mostly my PC. Second would be mobile.  

&gt; What’s the origin of your username?

I wanted a username that would be related to the show somehow, but that still felt unique. After re-watching the show (again), the line in *Mr. Candle Cares* where Marco is talking about making out with Star made me laugh (again).  
Thus, PolynesianStyle was born!

&gt; Do you go by any other usernames?

Not any that would be recognized here.  
Some from the subreddit have shortened my username to Poly, if that counts. 

&gt; Do you have a favorite user? Are there users you’re already friends with?

/u/Malthus1 has *fantastic* theories and art.  
He was my inspiration for coming up with new theories many a times. Plus his cards look amazing.  
I consider the whole subreddit to be my friend. Like a giant, anonymous, hive-minded friend.

&gt; Favorite fan-artist (or artist in general)?

Oh man, there's so many I don't know who to pick!  
Can I just say all of them are my favorite?

&gt; Do you read fanfiction? If so, what’s your favorite author and/or story in particular (You can include long-running comics as well)?

I never really could get into fanfiction like others could.  
That being said, I'm really enjoying the ShipWar AU comic right now!

&gt; What do you want to see more of in the SVTFOE subreddit?

Theories and Discussions!  
Considering it's Hiatus Times, it can't really be helped, but once November rolls around I'm hoping we'll get to see lots of these!

&gt; How long have you been with this Subreddit?

Umm... I don't know the exact number of days, but it will be close to 2 months as of me writing this. (10/19/17)

&gt; What made you want to join the SVTFOE subreddit?

First and foremost, the show itself!  
I had lots of questions about the show after I first watched it, so I decided to check out the subreddit for it. It looked like a nice community to me, and the rest is history.

&gt; What other subreddits do you partake in?

On this account? None.  
In general, I bounce around all over Reddit. Whatever catches my eye from r/all or from hitting the random subreddit button.

&gt; In the end, what do you want to be known for in this subreddit (and/or the internet in general)?

I'm never really considered what I want to be known for.  
I'm just here to have a good time with cool people and talk about SVTFOE.

---

#**SVTFOE QUESTIONS**

&gt; How did you find out about the show?

I would randomly see SVTFOE fanart pop up here and there. 
 
Honestly, at first I thought the show looked kind of dumb. I was expecting some hyper-sugary-Disney-XD-fest of a show ~~,but I was blinded by my preconceptions.~~ I kept seeing more and more high quality fanart and thought to myself, ""Hmm, only high quality cartoons get *this* much high quality fanart. I guess it's a good show.""

&gt; Why do you like the show and/or What made you keep watching it?

I love that the show isn't afraid to be what it wants to be.  
It takes the classic ""kid-oriented"" cartoon look-and-feel, and throws some actual narrative over it. There's conflict that isn't black and white. There's lessons to be learned. There's over-arching plot progression. And it combines all these parts without hesitation or perceived effort.  
Imo, it's a prime example of what western animation should be.

&gt; Favorite character(s)?

Not in any order: Glossaryck, Ludo, Eclipsa, and Toffee.  
These characters have so much more to them then meets the eye. Their motives, growth, or design can be pieced together from watching the show in its entirety. Basically, the development of the character (or our perceived development so far) is what makes these characters stand out to me.

&gt; Favorite episode(s)?

*Ludo in the Wild*: This is arguably the most well written episode imo. A show doesn’t need dialogue to be great. This is a prime example. Everytime I watch it it gives me the same, “Woah. This is a Disney XD show?!”, reaction.  

*Running with Scissors*: Because who doesn't love adult Marco and his possible adventures with Hekapoo. ~~criticisms aside~~  

*Just Friends*: For the shipping plots, c'mon.  

*Face the Music* and *Starcrushed*: S2 finale, what can I say. Plus, Star's Song Day song was stuck in my head for like, a week after watching it.  

*Moon the Undaunted*: Not only is this a flashback episode, but we get to see Eclipsa in the flesh for the first time! ~~That, and young Moon is too adorable.~~

&gt; How would you rate the show? (aka, what’s your OBJECTIVE opinion?)

On a scale of 1 - 10. A solid 7 to a light 8.  
SVTFOE does a lot of things right, but it doesn't do everything right. Basically, it's good but not a masterpiece. Ya know?

&gt; Favorite moment(s)?

*Blood Moon Ball*: the dance scene. Cute, and it carries heavy implications.  

*Storm the Castle*: Star confronts Toffee. Agh! There's so that could be said about this scene, so I'll just let that speak for itself.

*Bon Bon the Birthday Clown*: the Jarco date. ~~Fight me.~~ It's adorable and the Blood Moon makes a quick cameo.  

*Face the Music*: Star's Song Day song. Patrick Stump kills it and it's a good song.

*Starcrushed*: Toffee vs. the MHC. I had to make sure I wasn't watching Dragonball Z when this scene first started. It makes this list easily.

*The Battle for Mewni: Toffee*: Star's golden transformation. The animation. The soundtrack. The Sailor Moon references. The form itself. It's all glorious.  

*S3 outro:* I find this outro amazing. I might be channeling my inner weeb, but I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.

&gt; What did you think of the movie? Did you survive?

Overall the ""movie"" wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either.  

I felt like BfM had some really high highs, with some surprisingly low lows. Episodes like *Moon the Undaunted* and *Book Be Gone* rank high in the BfM list, while episodes like *Marco and the King* and *Kind Ludo* make me feel like the rest of the ""movie"" loses its pacing.  
Then there's the fact that Toffee dies within *minutes* of getting his body back. While that does formally introduce Eclipsa into the plot, I felt like the loss of Toffee's character was too steep a price to pay. Especially with how suddenly it seemed to happen.  
Still, I can't complain. I apparently enjoyed BfM enough to re-watch it multiple times so.

&gt; If there was ONE thing you could change about the show, what would it be? (something NON-shipping related)

I've talked about this before on the subreddit, but the after effects of *Running with Scissors* on Marco's character.  
I know that it's been confirmed that Marco's memories of the 16 years with Hekapoo are like some far-off childhood memory to him, but I'm just not satisfied with that.  
It might just be me, but the shot of Marco looking at his old childhood room in drab-grey colors and showing us he forgot his password is a clear indication that those 16 years *did* affect him in some way.  

Then boom. *Running with Scissors* after effects are never brought up again.  

The worse part is that there’s an explanation for it, but we have to learn from an external source as to why that is. I feel like it should have been made more clear for the audience, in show.

&gt; Which crew member(s) behind the show would you like to meet and what would you have them do? (autograph something, say a line, reenact a scene, a simple high-five, etc.)

Daron Nefcy herself!  
Naturally I would have tons of questions for her, but I would request that she *only* speaks in Starfan13's voice. ~~This is something that desperately needs to happen.~~

&gt; What SVTFOE merchandise would you love to see?

If an official complete SVTFOE Book of Spells was released, I would probably ~~cry because I can't afford it~~ scrape change off the floor to buy it.  
Ooh, and it could come with a little Glossaryck plushy too! And the table of contents would be in the middle just like the show. ~~Disney, please~~

&gt; You just got hired by Disney to work with the SVTFOE crew. What’s your job title?

Social Media...  uhhh Guy.  
I would basically show up to work, post ~~quality~~ shitposts across social media, and get paid.

&gt; If you somehow got the wand, what spell would you use?

*Easy-Peasy-Time-Freezy*  
I would basically have all the time in the world to do whatever I wanted.  
~~Hehehehehehehe~~  
I would worry about getting Father Time back on the wheel later. I've got all the time in the world, right?

&gt; Favorite headcanon? (If you’re unfamiliar with that term, basically it’s your personal interpretation of canon behind a show or book or movie etc. AKA It’s canon in your head)

My favorite headcanon would be Jackie's ~~a mermaid~~ personality.  
I'd like to think that Jackie's cool demeanor isn't some act or that she's just some ""sk8r gurl"". Rather, Jackie is the type of person that likes to see everyone be themselves.  
Jackie understands that being comfortable in your own skin is a vital part of one's own happiness in life, so she goes out of her way to make sure that whoever she's around feels comfortable. She shows this in her date with Marco in BBtBC.  
This may come of as a ""cool"" or ""chill"" personality type, but in reality she just wants everyone to be happy and worry free like she is.  
~~I might just be projecting myself onto Jackie here, but I believe.~~

&gt; Do you think the show will continue being light and bright or will it take a much darker turn?

I think that the show will stay around the current ""darkness"" levels.  
Sure, there will be more suffering. Some more grey area choices characters have to make between two evils. Probably some more deaths along the way, but I don't see this show taking any exceptionally dark turns any time soon.

&gt; What do you hope to see in Season 3?

Another topic I've discussed before.  

&gt; In no particular order  
&gt; 
&gt; * The Snookers Queen herself, Eclipsa
&gt; * Marco obtaining/wearing his fabulous cape
&gt; * More of the OTP, Starrito
&gt; * Side character development. (Jackie, Janna, Tom, etc)
&gt; * Moon's death suffering character arc. Where will it go?
&gt; * Glossaryck eating more pudding  

But yea, seriously, my body is ready for S3

&gt; Alright, the big one: **Who is your OTP (one true pairing), and why?**

Oh boy. The big question.  

Let me tell you about how much I like Jackie's character.  
Jackie is prime OTP material in my eyes. She's got it all. She's fun, hot af, ~~possibly a mermaid~~, and most importantly, understanding. I can see why Marco is down for Jackie, I'll put it that way.  
~~Also, I might have gotten a crush on Jackie while watching the show. Don't judge me.~~  

But at the end of the day, my OTP goes to Starco.  

And I'm not just saying that because of the Blood Moon connection or ""Starco is endgame"". I honestly see Star as a better fit for Marco.  
It boils down to this.  
The person you spend the rest of your life with is going to have an impact on how you grow in life.  
Jackie is great and she would help Marco grow into a person who is comfortable with who he is, insecurities and all, and there is nothing wrong with that.  
Star is the polar opposite. She will force Marco to grow into a person who overcomes his insecurities and flaws through adversity. Marco would also do the same for Star.  

It's the nature of give-and-take in the Starco relationship that ultimately swings Starco into my OTP territory.

#**MISC. QUESTIONS**

&gt; Favorite Book(s)?

I was extremely fond of the *Redwall* books by Brian Jacques when I was in middle school.  
I read every single one that my library had, and then found the rest online to read. It's an extremely well put together world, with the books spanning hundreds of years of lore. Plus, I love his writing style. It's so descriptive.

&gt; Favorite Movie(s)?

Hard to say, so I'm just gonna rattle off some movies that come to mind.  
I love Tarantino Movies. *Interstellar* was great. I've probably watched *Fury* like, over ten times. A ~~really stupid~~ movie called *Kung Pow: Enter the Fist* holds a dear place in my heart for making me laugh non-stop everytime I watch it. *The Iron Giant* makes me cry. I would apparently watch *The Lion King* non-stop when I was a toddler. *Exit Through The Gift Shop* is my go to documentary to recommend people.  
Umm...yea, that's all I can think of off the top of my head.

&gt; Favorite TV show(s)?

Well *Star vs. the Forces of Evil* is definitely on this list now.  
Other than that...hmm.  
I've watched *The Office* (American version) too many times to keep count. *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* is hilarious, period. *That 70's Show* is probably one of the only sit-coms I'll actually watch. *Samurai Jack* was a show I grew up loving. I like *Rick and Morty* a lot, but who doesn't. *Avatar: The Last Airbender* has phenomenal character development. *Adventure Time* is a great show too.  
Does anime count?  
If so, then *Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood* is on the list (and should be on yours too, regardless if you like anime or not. It's a gotd@mn mastah’piece). *Afro Samurai* gets on here too just for it's extreme artistic style-ization. *Samurai Champloo* is legendary, with an equally legendary soundtrack.  
I'm sure there's more, but I can't remember it all.

&gt; Favorite song(s) and/or Band(s)?

I cannot answer this question in it's current limited state. My body will not allow it.  

First of all, let me just say this. I am music junkie. So prepare for a wall of text. I live with headphones on. I sleep with headphones on. If I could shower with headphones on, I would.  

I don't limit myself to any genre either. I'll listen to Classical, Vaporwave, Rock, Metal, EDM, Lofi, Hip-hop, Trap, Country, Jazz, K-Pop, basically anything. That being said, my heart holds 3 genres most dearest.  

First and foremost, Hip-hop was my genesis. I fell in love beats and rhyme schemes at an early age. Learning music theory and seeing how it applies to all types of music is extremely interesting and I find Hip-hop to be the most diverse and interesting of all music types.  

Coming in second would be umm... Lofi? I can't really pin down the genre because it's one of those things where the internet can't decide on what to call it. Make fun of me if you want, but you know those ""shitty"" Soundcloud accounts that flip tracks and make them their own? Yea, those guys. I love that stuff. ~~Shout out to anyone who knows who Emune is.~~ I love that stuff because it's the kind of music that focuses on the fourth, oft forgotten, element of all music. Timbre. ~~Seriously, music theory will change your life.~~

Third would be any of the guitar focused genres. Things like classic rock, early metal, alt-rock, acoustics, etc. etc. My dad was a *huge* fan of guitar legends like Hendrix, Page, and Santana and would blast their music while baby-sitting me. I've loved guitar ever since, and I'm pretty sure that's why lol.

&gt; Favorite quote(s)?

Oh, idk... I've always been horrible at remembering quotes.  
The only thing that comes to mind is one of The Lich's speeches from *Adventure Time*. For some reason it's etched into my mind.  
[It might be a spoiler, so I'll hide it under here.](#s ""Fall.  
You are alone, child. There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people.  
These ancients are just the beginning. I will command a great and terrible army, and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished.  
You are strong, child, but I am beyond strength. I am the end, and I have come for you, Finn."")

&gt; Favorite Video Game(s)?

Ok, this has a definitive answer.  
It's Kingdom Hearts baby.  
I've been a fanboy ever since day one. I'm the guy who has every single game in every one of its release editions. I own like, 4 copies of the first game.  
And yes, you bet your @ss I'm hype for KHIII. If you took all the hype from every person in the subreddit for S3 of SVTFOE and measured it against the hype for KHIII in my left pinkie toe, I would bet my pinkie toe has more hype.  
It's unreal. KHIII news sends me into excitement induced, table flipping rages.  
I cried when 2.8 was released and I played 0.2.  
~~I may have a problem.~~

&gt; Favorite actors/actresses? (you can also include voice actors)

Actors: Javier Bardem, Mads Mikkelson, Matthew Mcconaughey, Leonardo Dicaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Cera. The list goes on honestly.  

Voice Actors: Ron Perlman, Vic Mignogna, Mark Hamill. I don't know as many voice actors by name unfortunately, but there's definitely more.

&gt; Who’s your celebrity crush?

Can't say I have one actually.  
I was never into the whole ""celebrity crush"" thing.

&gt; Who’s your fictional character crush? (If you have one)

Same as with the celebrity crush thing. Just doesn't happen for me.  
~~The exception being Jackie. I would totally date Jackie.~~

**Firm B**:Small Public firm, amazing flexibility, kool co-workers

My mother in fact, began the process as soon as I was able to pronounce the name of one on a road sign. I honestly was just curious why Portland was state according to the sign for Portland State University when I thought Portland was a city in the state of Oregon. As an adult, I spent most of my time thinking about what I want to do. In Uni, I dabbled and eventually got a science degree just to impress my family I could do it paying out of pocket(non of them got degrees). In the process, I worked 40-50 hours a week just to pay for school so I had zero time for an internship. My parents refused to contribute to college funds since I had bad relations with my step mother who was a control freak. Growing up, she was physically abusive, made every decision for me without input, fed me canned pasta every night to eat alone while she watched and then complain that I was fat(5'2"" 109 lbs) then feed me laxatives for breakfast. Let's just say social transition to college was difficult. I did job shadow, but felt more like they didn't want to be bothered. After Uni, I worked environmental education with one company for three years, but got tired of traveling around. It was glamorous at first, but wore out eventually. Since then, I've worked one customer service job after another. I did a term of Americorps as my first office job, but it was very dull and didn't live to the intenseness I expected. I tried to get a Master's in Teaching, but dropped out because I didn't enjoy the conflict with government. Now I'm working at office in customer service(again...sigh) for a very well known outdoors outfitter, but feel this pressure of not working up to my potential as I near closer to 30. I've had ideas of starting a value added food company, but don't want to work 60+ hours a week. 

A good buddy suggested to sell my car to travel the world since my work gives me up to 12 weeks a year of unpaid leave. Other friends said to stick this job out since it's a good company. I'm scared of being broke so I keep working this cycle of one customer service job after the other. I am a loyal person even to those who aren't, but dream of being a rebel and make a scene in order to do what's right.  "
794pdy,2,2017-10-27,[f4M] Little Sister's best friend is growing *fast*...,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/794pdy/f4m_little_sisters_best_friend_is_growing_fast/,"Some families tell the older siblings to be nice and be friends with their younger brothers and sisters, because someday their friends will grow up to be cute and attractive. You were never told that, after all, you're over 10 years older than your sister! Sure, you were still nice to her, but that comment never really came into the fold.

You were in college anyways, doing rather well in your major, and could already see your future ahead of you. You had a cute girlfriend of 3 years that you would probably be married to after you graduate, and you'd already had an internship with a company that will most likely give you a luxorious job after you finish your degree in a few more semesters.

This summer however? You're staying at home, the internship just happens to be closer to your parent's house than your apartment near the university across the country. Go figure.

You weren't really looking forward to it, but it would be nice to see the family again.

What you didn't expect to see so often is me, your little sister's long time best friend. Apparently while you'd been gone your sister and I had gotten even closer, to the point where she's either always at my house, or I'm always at your house!

That didn't bother you that much, or at least it wouldn't have... But since the past year I've been growing... A lot.

A 10 year old shouldn't go through puberty, or at least such a strong one right? My ass has gotten so fat that pants that fit it and my broodmother like hips don't fit my tiny preteen waist! It's the same story with my breasts too! 

The worse part? I'm still growing, and fast! Every day my underage latte colored breasts grow just a bit bigger, forcing my already strained tops to stretch out more and more to contain the perky preteen bosom that is practically begging you to look at it.

What you didn't expect was how much I like to talk to you too, sometimes your sister says she feels like a third wheel around the two of us! Because of that, she tries to keep us apart, childish but understabale for our ages. I still ended up following you on instagram, showing off how many older creepy guys comment and follow my pictures even though my birthdate - December 20 2007 is in my bio.

One day, as I'm combing my long, wavy and curly hair that tumbles from my head all the way down to my pant-busting ass, I notice you looking. Not overreacting, I smile. ""Zach... Is their something on my ass?"" I say with a giggle.

***

I'm looking for a somewhat realistic roleplay this time around! Plenty of illicit flirting and teasing, and even growing on my part before you finally fuck me! Feel free to jump right in if you get the feel of the RP, but some questions are alright!

Kinks: Ageplay, Sizeplay, Growth, Cumplay, Impregnation, Pregnancy, and more! See my other prompts for more ideas!

I just recently moved from Canada to the US to start my full-time career and I'd like tips on how to best position myself for a great future. I also want to help my parents with their mortgage of somewhere under 200k CAD (still in Canada). They immigrated to Canada with nothing,  started from scratch, and raised me to where I am today on a combined salary of less than half what I make now. I also don't know how much they've saved for retirement, but I don't think it's that amazing. I want to somehow give back to them. Here's where I am now.

* No debt (RESP by parents + internship money) 
* Salary just over 100k/yr
* About 150k in stock vesting over 4 yrs
* ~100k in savings (a quarter in the stock market)
* About $1700/m in rent
* Not sure how much utilities will be
* Although not the best decision financially, I kind of want a car (~35k, finance or lease)

I've already set to contribute enough to max out employer contribution for my 401(k) (US equivalent of RRSP?), and will start looking into the Roth IRA (~TFSA?). After that I plan to have most of my investments in index funds, with a small portion to invest in stocks I choose. What are some other ways I can set myself up to maximize my finances for the future? Also, how would the 2017 tax year work, would I still file Canadian taxes? Thanks!"

I know this sounds like an /cscareerquestions thread but I wanted to get the ideas of Android developers here since I'm looking for an Android job.

I'm familiar with the hottest trends Rx, Dagger, MVP, Architecture Components etc. I have used these technologies and released few applications on the market. Wrote a CV by looking up to some examples from people who got into Big 4.
I keep applying for jobs but no one returns back to me. Like %90 of the jobs are looking for a full-time experience for 2 or more years and I got nothing except the 2 interns (2 months total). There are some companies looking for junior devs, I applied all of them too but got no response. I feel like companies do not even give a chance to me. Like I read their posting and have everything they want, I apply then a big nothing. I really want to be an Android developer but I don't think I will ever be one. Considering even improving myself on C# or some backend technologies and applying to those jobs since there are much more postings for them and most of them are looking for juniors.
Is it possible for me to get an Android job after 1 year of working in some company doing non-Android related work? That will feel like hell to me but I will do it if I have to. Or are there any tips you can give out to me? What am I missing? How did you find jobs as a junior developer?
I will appreciate any tips.

7965vd,1,2017-10-27,My #metoo and getting screwed legally,Mirandal95,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7965vd/my_metoo_and_getting_screwed_legally/,"https://turtleboysports.com/da-joe-early-major-susan-anderson-force-troopers-to-alter-report-for-judges-daughter-who-said-do-you-know-how-many-people-i-had-to-blow-to-get-that-after-heroin-oui-arrest/

Thank you Turtleboy for writing this piece on the corrupt piece of shit that is District Attorney Joe Early. I have my own gripe with his bullshit, and coincidentally enough its also a #MeToo story.

I was raped by my biological father from the ages of 16 to 20. I moved in with him after never having a relationship to escape the care of my very mentally ill mother. I was manipulated, fucked with, abused, fed massive amounts of alcohol to keep me unconscious, and generally terrified of telling anybody because of how violent my dad was mixed with a lack of faith in there being any help for me.

I stayed for fear of winding up in a shelter with no money, no family, no car or any opportunity to continue progressing through my education to eventually become a normal, tax paying citizen who could support myself. I am generally a stellar student, and have plans to go to law school after I finish up my senior year this year.

Let me just say that the District Attorney’s office for the Worcester County was a JOKE. You want to talk about victims being afraid to come forward? They affirmed every fear I had. Their “victim witness advocate” tried fervently to plant the idea in my head that I wouldn’t want to go to court and see my father or his family, and that she has seen this type of situation break up many relationships, so it would probably lead my boyfriend to leave me due to the burden of the stress. When I insisted that I wanted to continue, I offered first hand witnesses, including the younger sister I lived with who was experiencing the first stages of grooming herself before DCF removed her (thankfully). I had family therapy with my father in which he admitted to the participation in the incestuous relationship. I had my therapist waiting over a year to get a subpoena. They even tried to inflict fear in me by kindly reminding me that if I signed a mental health waiver, my father’s defense would have access to all of my records. To which my response was, “Okay, well I have nothing to hide. I am of sound mind and have been reporting this relationship to my therapist for years now, and all of the records reflect this.” Nope. They didn’t care.

I had a 3 hour audio and video interview with the Uxbridge Police Department that they did not care to look into. I told them how my father had gotten me PREGNANT and wanted to move me down south to have his child. Which was reflected in my therapy notes they did not look at. I poured my heart and soul out. I hired my own attorney to apply some heat to the situation. I relentlessly was the squeaky wheel, always asking if there was anything more I could provide or any more I could do to help.

I had medical records, phone scrrenshots, witnesses, and a strong composure that they would not have been nervous about if I were to stand trial.

And they ONLY recommended the charge of Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor. My dad raped me at least once a day for four awful, fucked up years of my life, and today he only has probation for giving me ALCOHOL.

I had the majority of the court room crying after my victim impact statement. I had a judge who apologized wholeheartedly to me for the absolute DISGRACE that the prosecution from Joe Early’s office was. She kept reminding me that it wasn’t the COURT’s decision, nor the UPD, but the District Attorneys office.

I was told by my private attorney that often times these corrupt ASSHOLES only take cases where they could see a benefit from doing so. For example, they’d rather prosecute a drug case in hopes of raising the overall numbers in order to get a grant for a new drug sniffing dog or other things of the sort. My case surely would cost the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars, and so it was not a priority. Incest is not a rampant issue in the Worcester County, so it does not need to be addressed. A district attorneys job is to recommend charges that are likely to stick and be found valid, but also to serve the community’s hot problems.

Well Worcester County, does this seem right to you? My dad is a concrete mixer driver. He pours at K through 12 schools and university across MA every single day. But he isn’t a sex offender. Nope.

I met Mr.. Early once in a Honey Farms (of course… where else in Worcester). I immediately introduced myself. He told me to apply for an internship at his office. I brought my case up super politely, because I have some class, even though this guy ruined my chances at any kind of closure or moving on. He emphasized with me, promised me he would pull my file the very next morning and personally take a good look at it.

Bull. Shit. So if anyone from his office stumbles upon this comment, as they likely will be looking at this article painting this guy in such a good light, yeah if Mr. Early has a hard time remembering little old me, I’m the nice college kid who stopped him in Honey Farms as a last ditch effort to save my case from being deep sixed. Fuck. You."
796h74,49,2017-10-27,That Time DH packed BIL2’s Apartment,AntiKolobian,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/796h74/that_time_dh_packed_bil2s_apartment/,"BIL2 does this really fun thing where he doesn’t adult. He leaves things until they become an emergency for someone else, then FIL swoops in and asks/assigns someone else to fix it for him.
 
One time, BIL2 and his wife needed to drive to the airport, but the tires on their car weren’t weather-proofed for the area, so they swapped cars with us and drove our car to the airport. DH also missed a whole day of work to take them to the airport on a separate occasion and has also gotten things out of storage for them.

This particular time, BIL2 had gotten an internship with Disney World and he and his wife moved there **WITHOUT PACKING UP THEIR HOUSE AND TAKING THEIR THINGS.**

So, FIL calls and asks DH to pack up their apartment. FIL is going to pay for DH to do this and we were dirt poor and desperate, so DH says yes.

First thing DH does is try to figure out where to get boxes. He calls BIL2 and asks if there are already boxes at the apartment or if he needs to go pick some up. Simple question. But BIL2 tells him that he is too busy working and can’t answer. So, DH calls BIL2’s wife who tells him, “Oh, BIL2 and I are hanging out at the [Disney] park with SIL1 and her husband right now.”

DH lost it. He doesn’t even care that BIL2 is at the park – no, he’s pissed that BIL2 lied about it. What is even the point of that kind of lie? He gave DH the runaround for what purpose, even? I still can’t wrap my head around it, years later. WTF.

So, BIL2’s wife starts crying because DH is yelling at her. FIL and MIL are nearby, see her crying, get on the line and tear DH a new one about packing the apartment. MIL quotes the Bible parable about the ungrateful servant at DH.

So, it’s basically a shitstorm over the phone because BIL2 couldn’t be bothered to answer a simple question about the boxes DH needed to pack up BIL2’s entire fucking apartment.

I’m listening as best as I can to what is happening, but I’m not getting everything because I’m only hearing bits and pieces. But one thing I know for sure – this isn’t fair. BIL2 is constantly taking advantage of DH, never taking care of his own stuff and now he’s been caught in a lie, but DH is in trouble? WTF?

Well, I was young and naïve, but I thought that surely MIL would listen to reason. Everyone in the family went to her for everything and she was involved in everyone’s lives, so she was the logical one to talk to. I’d write it all down in an email to her and explain everything and it would all work out and be fine.

It was not fine.

Here’s a basic run-down of my email: “This is not the first time that DH and I have had to clean up after BIL2 because he didn’t plan ahead of time,” followed by basically the second paragraph of this post and ending with how upsetting the situation is.

First, MIL does not respond to my email, FIL does. This is what he says:

“We all have our faults, but family is about helping each other.  I wish all of my family would get [along] better.  I wish you would accept us with our faults.  It is not my intention to ever hurt [DH].

[Stuff about money] … May I ask what you or your family is doing to help yours and [DH]'s circumstances?  Are the two of you progressing in your lives?  Especially where it concerns your eternal progression?  I am sorry […] you believe I'm holding it over his head.

[Stuff about how the recession has been hard for everyone, especially him.]

… What more do you expect?”

Here was my response:

“Family is about helping each other. Family is not about taking advantage of each other, which is how DH and I feel about BIL2 - that he's taking advantage of us and he's been doing it for a long time.

I’m not seeing the part where I’m not accepting anyone. I do accept your family with their faults. I guess I’m missing the part where acceptance means that I should ignore their faults and let them continue to abuse everyone around them. 

I wish you would accept me with my faults. If you did accept me with my faults, you would accept that I’m shy and quiet and you wouldn’t have told [DH] … that you give up on having a relationship with me. Maybe you don’t realize it, but every time you say it, you’re rejecting me and it hurts.

…[your] questions are not only unkind, but are none of your business. It is not any of your business how we are progressing eternally or otherwise. It is not any of your business how my family is helping. These questions are presumptuous.

‘What more do you expect?’ All I expect from you is kindness.

All I want is an acknowledgement that my feelings and [DH]'s feelings have been hurt.”

Guess what I heard back?

If you guessed nothing, have a cookie.

Oh, and DH packed up BIL2’s house after all. I was struggling with health problems at the time and couldn’t help, but I did eat all the chocolate out of SIL’s jewelry box. (Can’t put it in storage or mice will eat it.)

Next year I will be a senior, and I really don't know what to do about my lack of clubs and ""student involvement"".

Basically, I haven't made many friends in college and the only people I do talk to are graduating either this December or next spring. I really am more a homebody type- and I don't like the whole partying/drinking thing, and that seems to be all of what people do here... that or talk about guys all the time - I'm a girl with a homebody boyfriend as well. And I also feel so many people are cocky?? I've had multiple people say to me, as I have a job ""I don't get why people work and go to school at the same time."" After I say I am working to pay for college, rent, food, etc.????? It is such a different vibe than in my community college.

Even those people I do talk to, I never really got out of the only talking about school phase. I've asked them to join ASCE with me but they are pretty much homebodies as well and said no. It's hard for me to join a club knowing I will join alone, but it seems like that is a huge thing employers look for.

My first two years of college were spent at community college and the last two years I have been at university. I used to work 25-35 hours a week as a barista and as a full-time student but now work 15-20 hours a week with a better paying state internship.. I find it really hard to even have time to do all of the homework on time let alone social things and also am really shy, but I don't dislike people?? If this makes sense. Some call me an extroverted introvert.
Anyway, since I've been here it seems as though everyone already has their cliques and hangs out with each other all the time. (Most of them don't work during the school year, I know. If I could I would not work, but I am in the awkward middle-class tax bracket of not getting grants, yet my parents pay $0 for my school or housing.)

I'm starting to look at entry-level civil engineering jobs and am noticing quite a few request involvement in school clubs or activities. Currently, I only have been involved with Engineers' Week at school volunteering to help set up events and stuff because it is so flexible (since it is only for one week, a sacrifice I can make for work). But I really do want to join the ASCE student chapter at my school but I wonder if it is too late? I'm still really nervous about the social requirement (attend a tailgate) since I don't know anyone and I assume people go with friends (also, I don't care for football.. the only sport I slightly care about is hockey).

The competitions don't seem too bad. They seem interesting, really! I generally don't have any problems talking to people if I am in a position where I have to.

**TL;DR**
 So a lot of things make me feel like a flop. Is it too late/pointless to join an ASCE student chapter as a second-year senior with no friends and as a pretty shy person."

Our usual day consists of waking up in our small apartment, getting ready for work, watching Netflix or movies together, and then going to bed. I wish our lives were more exciting than this. I feel like we are starting to become a couple that doesn't do exciting or new things.

One day, I hear someone moving in across the hall into apartment 4E which has been empty for a couple of months. Later that night, I woke up suddenly to loud music and girls yelling and screaming. It was only Tuesday. After my girlfriend and I woke up several times throughout the night, she asks me angrily to tell whoever it is making that noise to keep it down. I angrily walk into the hall and bang on the door. Someone opens the door after a few seconds, the music gets louder, and my jaw almost hits the floor. A woman with bright highlighted blonde hair, smokey blue eyes surrounded by heavy eyeliner, thick juicy red lips, spray tanned dark skin, and humongous fake breasts barely held back by your bra and tank top. ""What's up?"" she says in a bored and playful way, blowing a large bubble with her bright pink gum. Her less attractive girlfriends still behind her giggle and then resume dancing and drinking. I pause for a moment, still in awe of your unbelievable figure.

https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/c0.134.1080.1080/15043501_1077607605689537_1830411655922581504_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyMDYxNDA2MzYyOTIyNDIwOA%3D%3D.2.c

""Uh, it's three in the morning."" I say while trying to be serious and convey my point. ""Can you girls.. try to keep it down?"" I say while still eyeing you from head to toe. ""Sure thing, sexy. But next time you should come by and have fun with us."" You say playfully again. I reluctantly break eye contact and walk back to my room. I lay down next to my girlfriend and she asks tiredly, ""Who was that?"" ""Just some girls?"" I lie. The truth is, you're not just some girl. You're the sexiest woman I have ever laid eyes on, and the new sex symbol that just moved in across the hall.

The next few weeks turn out to be pretty difficult. I can't stop thinking about your body, flirtatious personality and my boring love life. Every time I see you in the hallway or elevator you throw me a wink or stretch showing off your body wrapped in your tiny inappropriate clothes. I start to think less and less about my girlfriend and think more and more about you. These days I seem to find any excuse to stop by your apartment or catch a glimpse of you as you head out with your girlfriends to have fun in the city. I just can't stop thinking about you..

Hey there and thanks for reading. The kinks I want to explore in this prompt are cheating, betrayal, hesitation, bimbofication, public sex, caught cheating, and corruption.

If you want to roleplay, I would like to discuss the character you will be playing a bit. Would you her to be a stripper, exotic dancer, or even a street walking whore? Do you take joy in helping break my girlfriends heart? Will you stop at nothing until I'm your play thing and I do everything you ask?

Let me know if you add anything or have any other ideas for the prompt. Looking forward to hearing from you :)"

It was all flavors of lunacy, it turned my facial hair gray over the course of a winter and that's no joke.

Somewhere between my second and third pot of coffee of the night, a unconscious and badly hurt woman was brought in from a hit-skip. In the middle of surgery they figured out she was pregnant, and it went from a serious but routine procedure, to a ""write this down for a textbook"" kind of emergency. Without ID to pull a medical history, they had to rely on their eyeballs, and was of an ethnicity that stayed startling petite even in pregnancy.

Everything goes okay, mom and baby are stabilized, just another night of big medicine in the big city.

I kept a working relationship with the nursing staff (that's a lie, they were pretty and I came up with excuses to be around them) and they let me in on the growing problem. She didn't speak English, and post-anesthesia they couldn't pull any info out of her. Days pass, and she's lucid enough to explain that, of all things, she's from Bhutan (look it up, I had to). It took awhile more to find a translator for her particular language, but at significant effort we finally dredged one up.

Problem was, this fella barely spoke English himself. Nobody could tell if he understood enough to pass on, and he seemed to get more and more defensive over her. Over the course of a few days he got incredibly attached to her, and it got to the point where he wouldn't leave the room. Our officers finally had to get involved, the only reason he wasn't ejected was the almost total lack of any other fluent speakers in (probably) the country.

After about a week, the baby daddy presents himself. Mr. Lothario was a local (don't ask me how they hooked up through the language barrier, that's some Nicholas Sparks shit) and we finally get good information on her. A social worker eventually got ahold *of her husband* back home, and he flips his lid.

Mr. Bigshot Asian Businessman does a lot of business internationally, and his wife decided to just stay here after their last trip. Our suspicion was that she ran away and he didn't care enough to look, but he sends his lawyer anyway to sort things out. Unfortunately his legal eagle was Hong Kongese, and probably learned all his American law via JAG reruns on the flight.

East Asian Matlock can't provide the proper documentation to make decisions for her and starts getting into it with the clinical staff, the translator can't or won't voice her consent on anything, and our legal team starts throwing galactic shit-fits about liability and legality. Everything starts slipping further and further off the rails, and things come to a crescendo when Lothario tried to beat the lawyer in the ER drive.

I'm still nursing my first cup of coffee for the night when a call comes in, low and behold, I'm speaking to the gawddamned Bhutanese embassy. The first pangs of ""international incident"" hit the administrators, and a frothing panic spreads from office to office upstairs. Things got real ruthless, real fast.

Lothario goes to jail (did I mention he had a warrant), the Translator gets the boot and a personal call from our Chief of Staff to his boss, and the Lawyer holes himself up in an airport hotel still desperately googling medical power of attorney, how to.

Things quiet down, she recuperates in peace and is surprisingly polite on her own. One of our interns at the time was Nepalese (?) and they could communicate enough to just about get by. She was discharged shortly after, and thinking back now, I'm pretty sure the county stepped in to get her someplace stable.

I only saw her once, one morning about 0300 I was walking back from the physicians-only Starbucks (don't tell) and saw her being transported from the floor. For all that was going on around her, she seemed remarkably happy with her child.

**Morning after edit** Changed a few clarifying details, you folks are great."

798vqn,7,2017-10-28,Into The Abyss,SebastianWInter,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/798vqn/into_the_abyss/,"Water covers most of the Earth’s surface. Everyone knows that. The ocean is enormous and mighty, it provides people with abundant resources, but not everyone knows that 95 percent of the ocean is unexplored. People usually are surprised to learn this information. For this reason, ocean always fascinated me. In a way I’m even glad it was like that because it gave me a unique opportunity to explore and research places and things that no one had seen before me. That’s why I chose to dedicate my life to oceanology.



When I came to my internship in college, I got lucky and was hired to go on an expedition. The expedition went to explore the Kermadec trench. This trench is the fifth deepest in the world, at least of the known ones, and reaches 32,963 feet in the deepest part. It stretches 620 miles in length. Logically, such a huge place is almost unexplored.


The expedition was trying to save on the finances, so they chose me as a man who would pilot the bathyscaphe and immerse in the trench. I had to take samples from the ocean bottom. I clearly remember all the preparatory processes of the expedition – selecting the research ship, bathyscaphe, crew recruiting and countless small details that were absolutely necessary. And then the day of diving came.


The day of diving back then was cold and inclement, strong winds were blowing, and standing on the board was unpleasant. I was worried that the diving wouldn’t be possible because of the bad weather, but in the end forecast promised no wind in an hour.


I remember when I got inside the “Jolly Roger” ambient wind sounds became much more silent. After all, passenger area hull was made of 3 inch thick, high-strength steel. Then I closed the entrance hatch and was sensing how ship’s crane was lowering me into the ocean. Through the small porthole I was watching as air bubbles that had been trapped in the winding metal constructions finally got out in freedom and were sweeping to the surface. Already a few feet below the surface all the sounds completely subsided, and the sense of absolute tranquility occurred.


Soon it became completely dark, and I turned on the powerful LED lights to see the surrounding ocean. “I’m reaching 2000 feet,” I remember me announcing this over the radio. Now it seems to me at that moment something happened to my memory because  I can’t remember events clearly after that. In my memory, my own voice sounds distant and strange. It sounds as if it belonged to someone else. Not long ago I blamed this on the fact that the abyss had affected me with its greatness, but I don’t believe that anymore. All the following events in my memory are hazy and unclear too. I remember that I successfully reached 32 316 feet depth, collected some rock samples and ascended to the surface. I’m incapable of remembering smaller details. Such as, underwater creatures, topography of the ocean bottom and my conversations with the ship through the radio. In my head there’s only one grainy picture – lurid, gray ocean bottom illuminated by the LED lights.


Two months after the expedition, I had a dream. Very disturbing one. That kind of a dream which you remember for all your life. In my dream I’m inside the bathyscaphe again. I’ve reached the ocean floor, and I’m trying to palpate something in the sands with the robotic arm. In this dream there are two more men with me. One of them is talking over the radio, but I haven’t touched the radio at all. “We have reached the bottom – 32 316 feet,” I hear my colleague announcing. Failing to palpate what I was looking for in the sand, I use another device to clean up the place so I can see how to maneuver. Once the spot is cleaned, I see in the camera screen that the strange object is the hatch handle decorated with a variety of forgings. I beckon my colleagues to look at it. We can’t believe our eyes. Then one of us comes up with an idea that it’s a camera glitch, and we decide to look at the mysterious object through the porthole with our own eyes. We change the position of bathyscaphe so we can see this object, and it really looks like a hatch with an elaborated handle. Besides that it is shining in mystic purple tone which is much different from the rest of the ocean bottom. Following events in my dream are the most horrific and incredible.


Hatch suddenly opens and very bright yellow light is streaming from it. We all for a moment become blind, because our eyes are accustomed to twilight which prevails in the bathyscaphe. However, I notice the black shadows surging out of the hatch. When we recover from our blindness, all ocean bottom is illuminated by a bright light. Everything is clearly visible as we were on the surface. I discover that the whole ocean floor is covered with the same purple metal hatches, but only that one we have poked and nudged is open. Then the fear of death seizes all three of us because on the bathyscaphe ceiling a red light appears. It looks just like a laser, and it is easily cutting our sphere. I hear how my colleagues are screaming. Radio operator shouts in the handset, “SOS! SOS!” but it seems that radio isn’t working anymore. Then happens the strangest thing. I loose control over my body and I’m unable to move. I can see that my buddies have the same problem. Next we see that the hull has been cut, and I am thinking about death under the powerful press. However, water doesn’t start to flow inside. I see that strange creature removes the cut metal piece and looks inside our cabin. Other creatures are visible beside that one. Beings are out there – in the water, but we are still in our places, and the water isn’t flowing inside.


Creatures are best described as a mermaids, but they are not the ones from the folklore. They are larger than us – people. Their bodies throughout have similar color as humans because their fish tails aren’t covered with scales. Beings have unusually long, smooth fingers. Their faces recall a human face, but the nose and mouth are proportionately smaller than human’s. Most horrific are the eyes of the creatures, they have no resemblance to humans. Eyes are completely black. There are neither the pupil nor iris – whole eye is pitch black. However, beings have some common features with mythical mermaids. They all have long hair and breasts.


The very next moment I am frightened by new terrifying events. One of the beings stretches its arms, seizes one of my mates and pulls him out of the bathyscaphe into the ocean. Helpless person is still petrified and keeps his sitting posture while taken out of his place. Then another creature goes after my second mate and also pulls him out. I see how his name tag glides along my eyes and I can clearly read – K. Gerald. When the first two creatures have disappeared with their victims God knows where, a third one is peering along the edge inside the bathyscaphe. It looks like it wants to stretch its hands and grab me, but she is hesitating. Her face has stuck in my memory the best from this awful nightmare. Blond hair, slowly fluttering in the water, small mouth, tiny, slender nose and eyes like black holes. Finally, mermaid stretches her slender index finger and makes a gesture as if to touch my forehead. Physical contact doesn’t occur, however, when she does it, a thousand bells start to ring and chime in my head. Then I woke up.


After that night, I didn’t have this dream anymore, but I couldn’t forget it. It seemed to me that black eyes of the being were still watching me. Then I decided to investigate research results to prove myself that it had been only my vivid imagination, and nothing supernatural had happened.


I took the research file and began to thumb through it. I didn’t find anything peculiar there. All results were completely normal. However, when I was closing the file, I accidentally opened the first page, which described the general things. Such as expedition ship, submarine and crew member names that I knew by heart. And then I got petrified by horror. In the documents clearly was written K. Gerald – radio operator, ocean biologist and third “Jolly Roger” crew member. I remembered the name tag from my dream instantly. I immediately called the organizer of the expedition, although the clock already was half past eleven in the evening.


“Hello,” sleepy voice answered back then.


“Hello, Mr. Smith! Lucas is calling there. You remember, two months ago I participated in your expedition to the Kermadec trench.”


“I recalled your voice, but what do you want from me in the middle of the night?”


“I have a question about the submarine crew. Why did I descend in the trench alone? The submarine has three places! And why the file contains other submarine crew members?” I asked emphatically.


“But we talked about it! To get more funding, we invented false crew. What are you pointing at, Lucas? Do you want to blackmail me? You won’t succeed…”


I wasn’t listening to him any longer. I tried to remember the conversation about finances, but I failed to do that. In my memory there was no such conversation.


“Hey, are you still there?” I heard him say. When I didn’t reply, he put down the handset. I remember that by then I had already a better idea what to do.


The next day, early in the morning, I arrived at the port, where the expedition ship was still docking with “Jolly Roger” on board. Finances for expeditions are difficult to collect, so research vessels are often idling in the ports. The captain, with whom we were good friends, was there and let me on board. I immediately went to investigate the bathyscaphe.


I was circling around it and trying to find some unusual stuff, but couldn’t detect anything. Then I climbed up on the crane, which was about bathyscaphe roof height. From there I jumped over to the bathyscaphe. I had a clear action plan. I was looking for the place where in my dream the red laser had cut the hull. I knelt down and started to examine bathyscaphe roof inch by inch. And there it was. A small ripple in paint. It could have been just a tiny painting defect, and no one would have found it, but I knew, it wasn’t just a simple painting defect. No defect is forming a perfect circle…


Tomorrow I will look for some simple office job…

799702,0,2017-10-28,Me [20M] accidentally broke my friend's [19F] heart.,TrollzL0rd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/799702/me_20m_accidentally_broke_my_friends_19f_heart/,"I posted about this a while back, but I feel like maybe I still need more advice and I may have neglected some pretty important details the first time round so here goes the full uncut story.



About 3 months back, I broke up with my first girlfriend while I was attached to a company for my school internship, and it hit me really hard. I went around looking for bars/clubs, and blew a ton of money on drinking to keep the pain in check, and I couldn't focus at work, not even the slightest. We kept in contact throughout though, as much as it hurt me, I still couldn't bring myself to cut her out completely. 

About 2, 3 weeks of this goes by and then I happened across an instagram account of a girl who had the same last name as me, and I thought maybe this is a sign I should move on, so I chat her up and exchanged numbers, then we agreed to go out together. I let her know I just broke up, and she was okay with it, we even went out drinking together a few times. After 3 weeks or so of going out and everything, she confesses to me that she has feelings for me.

At this point I didn't know what to do, so I asked her for some time to think about it. She did make me feel way better than before, and I totally enjoyed being with her whenever we went out, so I thought to myself ""It's time I moved on"" and then told her that yes I liked her too, and so we got together.       
  

However, slowly I came to realize maybe I was just using her as a temporary solution to my sorrow. I really started to think things through again, and when she questioned why I didn't openly hug her, or hold her hands and all that, I realized maybe I just wasn't comfortable doing all of that with her. So I called her out, and explained to her my stand, and apologized to her, but hoped we could stay friends. She seemed to take it well, until later I got home and found out she had been exploding and throwing a tantrum on instagram saying I had been toying with her.

I did not know how to react, so I tried to at least contact her, but she cut me off completely and now its been 2 months since we last talked. I want her back as a friend, because I really liked going out with her and having a whale of a time, I just don't have romantic feelings for her. Where do I go from now?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: met a new girl after breaking up, got with her then realized I don't really love her and I want to stay friends but she's blocked me everywhere and now I'm feeling really guilty and need some sort of closure."
799ukw,1,2017-10-28,"Me [22M] and my ""ex"" [21F] just randomly stopped talking after 2 years",IdkWhat211,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/799ukw/me_22m_and_my_ex_21f_just_randomly_stopped/,"So i met this girl through a friend and it first started out through just talking obviously. I got to know her pretty well and i started to really like her. My friend said to me, you should ask her out, so i did. The response i got initially was that she doesn't hang out with guys and she wanted some time to get to know me. 

Okay I thought. So i never really brought it up again since she told me that. I come to find out she is actually a good girl and never has had a boyfriend before and has never actually done stuff with guys. She is very close with her family. 1 year passes with on and off talking and i don't really see her. Except for one time we exchanged gifts on christmas. Things became pretty serious as i noticed she liked me a lot. We even talked about a future together. At this point, I had started an internship working a ton of hours not being able to make much time for even myself. I had asked her to go out for valentines day weekend since i was working the valentines day, and she declined saying she doesn't want to for the weekend. 

Towards the end of my internship, she started to mention to me the fact that we have not even seen each other after talking for so long. I brought up the fact that she mentioned she doesnt hang out with guys etc etc so i didnt think about it, and the fact that I don't even have time for myself because of this internship. at the end of the internship, i had constantly asked her to hang out because she was mad about this and she declined bringing up the fact that i am now asking after the fact that she brings this issue up. This was Spring 2017

After some on and off talking over the summer, about every 2 weeks or so. This last month we just have not even talked. I really liked her, but at the same time i feel like i fucked up so theres no point to even reach out to her now with a month break between us. I am thinking to myself that i need to move on. We had really strong feelings for each other as we were each others ""first love"" ..

The reason why i don't want to reach out to her is to see if she will ever reach back out to me and see if she still cares. Although, by doing so, i feel as if i am playing a game. I just feel awkward reaching out now after a month of not talking. I know some might say just do it and talk to her, but I just really feel weird doing so. It feels as if I don't even know her anymore, and it sucks. I also believe if a girl really misses you, she would reach out to you as well. She has her own internship starting and school to still finish up so I think she is just caught up with that. Other than that, I think I should just try and move on and just see what happens and let the true colors show. 

tldr; Spent a year talking to a girl and she told me she doesnt hang out with guys one on one, when she really is a good girl and close with her family. I never bothered to ask again after that response. The next year becomes really serious after just a couple times of seeing each other, and then she brings up the fact that i never make time for her, while i was in a busy internship schedule. I asked her to hangout after that, she declines saying its too late. On and off talking over the summer, leading to not talking over the past month. We really really liked each other, and talked about a future.  Do i contact her? Or just let the true colors show and move on.

My apologies if this isn't the right spot.

I'm a computer science and data scientist master student from the Netherlands. I've specialized in Data Science and a little bit of innovation, particularly in health care. I want to look for an internship of about 6 months to graduate, which involves doing something new and novel and results in a small master's thesis paper. 

I would like to find one in Iceland! But I worry that at this point I might be too specialized for the market. I'm guessing there are only a few positions to go around and that they are most likely already fulled quickly with Icelandic students.

Can anyone tell me where to look and if my chances are at all existent?

79a9fx,133,2017-10-28,Dad got upset that no one was taking care of him.,Drysaf,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/79a9fx/dad_got_upset_that_no_one_was_taking_care_of_him/,"So yesterday, I got paid from my internship. So I took mom out for dinner to treat her. Now a few weeks back, I invited both of my parents to this tea parlor. Dad declined, but mom accepted. Well, we ended up not going to the tea parlor, but to a different restaurant.

Well, yesterday was the day we went out. Mom picked me up from work and we headed out to the restaurant. Dad calls. He and mom talk, but then he asks when we are coming home. Mom tells him that we were going out for dinner. He complains that I need to cook dinner and that we were only going to X restaurant to ""lush it up"". Mom tells him that he is a grown man and he can cook for himself. He starts ranting that we had an agreement ( we didn't) about how he would wash dishes and I would cook, and If I broke this agreement, that everyone can just cook and clean after themselves. Like, I rarely go out since I live with my parents currently. The last time I went out to do anything was to visit my boyfriend in another state in August. God forbid I spend time outside of work and home. Mom said that we would be at least a couple of hours, but he took it as us being done in two hours.

So we get to the restaurant, enjoy some samples of wine and get a table. Dad calls me, asking if we are on our way home yet, because ""it's been a couple of hours."" I tell him that we aren't done yet and he said that he would cook for himself but I can wash my own dishes.

I guess he wants me to feel bad, but I don't. If fact, this new arrangement would be better for me since that would mean that I wouldn't have to spend 2+ hours cooking food for him, myself, and my lunch. He never cooks when I am around and he expects me to wait hand and foot for him. If he actually sticks to this ""threat"", which he probably won't, it would be a relief. Also, who gets upset over someone going out once in 2-3 months? 

Edit: for words and to add that he made it sound like he was been abandoned and nobody cared about him for simply going out. He also bitched about me not bringing food back for him, even though he said that he would cook dinner for himself and he never asked for anything."

79bolo,0,2017-10-28,IO/CSO &amp; general internship questions! would love any thoughts people could share!,mcl2015,foreignservice,https://www.reddit.com/r/foreignservice/comments/79bolo/iocso_general_internship_questions_would_love_any/,"Hi! I applied for the DC Summer 2018 State Department internship and listed my preferences as 1) The Bureau of International Organization Affairs and 2) The Bureau of Conflict &amp; Stabilization Operations. I've just been asked to have a phone interview with the Office of Human Rights &amp; Humanitarian Affairs and the Office of Management Policy &amp; Resources (both in IO).

I have a few questions about these specific opportunities and the general process if anyone has any insight!

1. For the internship application process, does your first choice bureau first receive your application and if they are not interested, it goes on to the second choice? Or do both bureaus receive the application in the initial process? I guess I'm asking if at the moment since I have possible opportunities from IO, does that rule out any chance of me hearing from CSO? Or is it possible that they also have my application now and could (obviously depending on if they think I am a suitable candidate) reach out to begin the interview process while I am still doing the same with IO offices? 

I am generally interested in IO because of my interest in conflict and human rights and it seemed like the most logical choice because from what I've read CSO has undergone a lot of organizational and leadership changes lately (although I could be totally wrong), so I guess on paper IO seemed like the more 'rational' choice. This made me hesitant to list CSO first in case the Bureau has any problems with those changes still going on next summer. However, while I am very interested in the opportunities at IO, there are a few specific things with CSO (such as the Peace Process Network and RESOLVE research program) that I was very interested in and I would still love the opportunity to consider that option (obviously this is dependent on them actually wanting to interview me). 

2. Could anyone provide more insight about the interview process? Any tips? From what I've read it varies widely from office to office and based on the individual conducting the interview but I would still love any suggestions!

3. I also would love any general thoughts/tips/insight about these two offices and these two bureaus, especially because it seems that so much at the State Department is fluid right now.

4. Specifically for IO, I would love to know if anyone has any thoughts/experiences that could give more insight as to the nature of their focus on human rights and conflict compared to other bureaus that are dedicated solely to those issues. Obviously the function of the Bureau is to coordinate US policy and actions with other international organizations in supporting these issues, but I guess I am wondering the nature of the work is in comparison to bureaus focused on these same subjects.  

Thank you so much!!!

79bzx1,2,2017-10-28,"Hey schatz,",vanillasyrup,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/79bzx1/hey_schatz/,"I heard about what you did Thursday night. I was getting ready to head back up to visit you and our friends and play the game I grew up in college with, and all I did after hearing you say those words high off your mind... I cried so much. 

I can't believe I let myself fall for you again, especially with how the last time I asked you out went. It was so strange, I misinterpreted so many things and I think you may have misinterpreted things and slowly, I pulled away. 

I did so because I knew my mentally-ill ass may act for me, and ruin our friendship. S says that you consider me a good friend, and considering how you treated the small one after finding out she liked you around the time I liked you, I was terrified you'd do the same to me. I couldn't believe S for 3 months. 3 months of jumping on discord every day with you and S and T, for 8-9 hours each night while you three relaxed a summer away and I looked for an internship. I pulled away because it pained me so much after a point that I knew I couldn't have you. You're the first person I've ever been sexually attracted to besides my abuser from freshman year. It's so hard to let that feeling go. 

So I came back, and I thought I was going to be okay. I may have misinterpreted you again in staying on discord for a while alone together, and honestly thought that something may happen? I cling on to hope too much sometimes that it would wind up hurting me more than it should. 

I tried so hard to convince myself you aren't for me. You talk about things that I know you're sarcastic over, but my radar pings after a certain point with some of the things you've said. I don't want to go into details here, but a few things scared me, I don't want to be hurt again by someone with the ability to manipulate people. I have such a hard time trusting people who know how to manipulate people. My abuser did that to me and those who I thought were my friends. It's taken me years to pull myself back together, and I know it'll be more before I'm okay. I'm mostly okay, but I'm not okay. And that's okay, I know how to deal with it now and keep it off of friends who worry about me. So many are worried about me because of how I took that Thursday night. You did nothing wrong. You're allowed to jump back on the dating horse since you had a bad time previous to that.

But then you got high

And J asked you about that girl from earlier

And you went off about how a suitemate cockblocked you when you took her back to the suite to chill, or something. 

I pulled off after that point. 

I don't know what I'm going to do tonight. I see you in a few hours to get fucked up with a bunch of friends and I'm terrified my mental illness is going to speak for me. 

Know that no matter what happens to us, I feel like at this point there's nothing I can do; you'll always hold a spot in my heart, and while it's hard to convince my mental illness that it's okay, I just want you to be happy in the end.

79c1qf,0,2017-10-28,Study in Denmark(higher education),ItsRentyl,Denmark,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/79c1qf/study_in_denmarkhigher_education/,"Hi,

Few days ago there was an exhibition in my country about studying abroad. 
Denmark got my attention and I decided that I want continue my studies there.

Unfortunately, I don't know much about the universities and I'm asking for your help.
Firstly, there was a school called UCN, it was very likeable. They said that their school is providing free danish language courses, but they teach in english. 
They also said that they have ""problem based learning"", so I don't have to learn hours and then forget it, but I will gain real life experiences thanks to the group oriented works and they also have  connection with lots of companies.
These souns pretty good, but than I heard that UCN is not a real university, it's a univerity college.

I don't know what's the difference between a university college and a simple one. Does the college's degree worth less?Which one is more likely accepted?

I also heard about aalborg univerity, and It's also seems very good, but I do not know anything about it.

So, my goal is to achieve a degree and after it a master's degree.
I am interested in:
Business
service,hospitality and tourism management/event organizing
international hospitality management
international sales and marketing
computer sience-software/web development

I'm from Hungary, your country seems amazing and a very.very good place to live, but I don't want to travel here, study for 5+ years and got a useless degree.
On the other hand I want to have fun.

I heard that, with the help of the danish schools I can travel lot's of countries. For intsance Dania University gave me leaflet about their summer school in Vietnam or I heard that one of their student works in Disney land as his internship work. "
79ck3o,1,2017-10-28,Can't decide where to go after I graduate from University [22M/21F],confusedperson11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79ck3o/cant_decide_where_to_go_after_i_graduate_from/,"Hi everyone. I am having some personal problems right now. I'm a Canadian currently interning as a software developer at a large tech firm in the bay area (California). My girlfriend lives in Toronto. I'm about to graduate from university in about 6 months, and then I will have to make a decision about my full time job. I currently have an offer for around 80k CAD at a company that I have previously interned at in Toronto. The company I am currently working at in the bay area, if I get a return offer, would probably pay around at least 105k with a significant signing bonus of maybe 20-25k ish as well as RSUs. Probably they have a 401k plan as well and I don't know if the Canadian company has an equivalent plan.

Financially speaking it would make the most sense for me to accept the offer in the bay area (if I get it, which is not guaranteed). Career wise also, I think the work is probably better at the company here. However I don't know how well I could stomach living here for at least 1-2 years. To be honest, I kind of hate the south bay area. It's a large suburban sprawl with nothing to do. My life here consists of going to work, coming home, cooking dinner, calling my GF for a few hrs and then going to bed. I rarely go out much on the weekend. I find it fairly boring here, and would prefer to live in a city. Also it's quite difficult to get around without a car, which would add to my expenses if I chose to live here. The rent is also considerably higher. I would expect to live here for about 1200/mo with roommates vs. maybe 700/mo in Toronto. So that's about 500/mo * 12 = 6k higher cost of living, maybe it translates to approximately 10k of before tax income that can be deducted from the US salary. Another thing is the exchange rate; USD / CAD ratio is currently at something like 1.28, so if you multiply the USD salary by the exchange rate it becomes much higher. But of course, no one can predict the USD : CAD exchange rate in the future, so it may not be wise to factor that into the decision. And the purchasing power of CAD is not really adjusted for that exchange rate in most cases. 

I feel fairly alienated living here. I live with two roommates who are/were my friends before moving here. But we have had a few arguments, and are not great terms right now, which makes things not so great. They are both good strong friends with each other and okay friends with me, and we have different lifestyles as well which leads to conflicts about things like what time to be quiet (they woke me up at 2:30 AM last night talking) or cleanliness (I admit that I am not the cleanest person in the world, sometimes I don't take out the trash or leave a bit of a mess in the kitchen.) As the saying goes, three is a crowd, I think. I have other friends from school living here, but we rarely see each other. It is hard without a car as I mentioned previously. I think if I moved here fulltime my lifestyle would be similar. Actually I have lived in the bay area on an internship previously, before I met my girlfriend, and my situation was much worse. I lived with a landlord and we had arguments fairly frequently, and I practically never saw my friends for 4 months. Anyway I am trying to resolve my situation with my current roommates (there is one of them that likes to start arguments with me, the other supports him at the start but backs off after we start arguing more seriously). But this is not the point of this post, so I won't go into much more detail.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 13 months. We have been living in the same city for about 3 months at the start of the relationship. We have been doing 'semi long distance' for about 8 months of that 1 year where we spend a couple days together every 2 weeks or so. That's fine, actually it's no problem. And we have been doing very long distance for 2 months with no visits. It's okay but not great. I love my girlfriend very much, and we would stay together if I chose to accept the bay area offer, but it would definitely put strain on the relationship. Also the longer you work at these large tech companies in the bay area the more financial incentives they give you to stay (assuming you don't get fired in the first couple years). What I mean is promotions as well as the RSU vesting schedule. So it may be even harder to leave financially in a couple of years, unless I can work at a similar company in Canada. I have tried to get a job in the past at one of these 'very high paying' companies in Canada but failed. I will have another chance in January but I am not too confident in my ability to pass 4 rounds of technical interviews in the same day. It will require intense preparation as well as some luck to pass it.

So I will likely have to deal with multiple offers with deadlines expiring at different times. I will not know if I have a fulltime offer for my current company until late December. I will know the deadline of my current offer fairly soon. And I want to interview with a couple of companies in January when I'm not working fulltime in an internship. So the time pressure to decide will get much worse in the future, it will definitely put a lot of mental strain on me. In a way it would be nice if I didn't get a return offer at my current company so that I could go to Toronto without having any reservations about it. But I don't think that's the right attitude to have. My girlfriend says that she wants me to pick whichever offer will make me happier. She does not want force me to move to Toronto as she thinks I will have resentments if I give up a potentially better career opportunity to be with her in person. Although she will be very sad if I take the bay area offer, of course.

There is another problem as well. My girlfriend will graduate from university one year after me and she still lives with her parents. I have been living on my own for over 4 years. She has met both of my parents. My girlfriend still has not told her parents about our relationship, and that kind of bothers me. She is Filipino and I am white. Her mother is fine about relationships and will be accepting of it. But her father is very protective of her and is very aggressive about relationships. For example, when her previous BF (white guy) met her father, he denied that they were a couple and they had a heated argument. Her father proceeded to not talk to her for a couple months. He wants her to be with someone who is Filipino as well, I think. Apparently he has said that to her in the past, a long time ago. Which is pretty unfortunate for me. This makes me very uneasy... I have told her how I feel about this, that I want her to tell them about our relationship soon. Understandably she does not want to do it from the past experience, but still... This previous incident happened about 2/3 years ago, so potentially things could have changed since then, as she is 21 now. I feel like if I am going to move to Toronto primarily for her then her parents should at least know that we are dating, but maybe that is again not the right attitude to have. Whether or not her father approves of us dating will not change anything between us.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I feel very confused about my future. I can't decide between bay area / Toronto. I have been thinking this over for the last few months and it's just becoming harder as time goes on.  What do you think about this situation?"
79ct56,1,2017-10-28,"28 M4F - Multiple Prompts, take your pick!",iamincontrol69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/79ct56/28_m4f_multiple_prompts_take_your_pick/,"A couple of different options here... I'm always keen to see where a partner will take these things so feel free to play it how you like! I'll be around for a few hours so feel free to flick me a message even if the post is a bit old.

*Option 1*

""It can all be yours"" I say as I watch your response. I can tell you're excited about the offer but also uncomfortable.

It was my wife who first insisted we get you in, a gorgeous girl from the neighbourhood who was just looking to make a few extra bucks as a cleaner.

Our large house was quite the job and we certainly had money to spare, this neighbourhood was a gold mine with people like me with more money than we knew what to do with. You had seemed instantly curious when you arrived today being greeted by myself instead of my wife.

She's long gone now, a relief really as it gave me the opportunity to finally push the boundaries of my wealth and prove that money really can buy anything.

Which leads us back to my offer. A platinum credit card sitting in front of you on the table, it could be all yours. Along with this house and everything I have to offer.

Think of the things you could buy, the events your could attend and never having to work again.

All if you agree to give yourself to me and become mine.

*Option 2*

Your phone buzzes in your hand as you walk through the busy office. The young new intern trying to make her way in the world as my latest secretary.

You unlock the phone and read my message

""How does it feel to be walking through the halls with your panties filled with that thick load of sticky warm cum""

You can feel your face burn red as you read the message, each step you take reminds you of the sticky mess in your underwear.

It was only 10mins ago that you were in my office, bent over my desk with your mascara running down your cheeks as you quietly whimpered and begged for me to fill your tight little pussy.

Instead I slowly pulled my cock from you and began to fill the soft underwear caught around your young thighs.

I didn't say many words as I groaned deeply as I stroked my thick load into the material before pulling them up, a feeling you weren't familiar with as I pulled your skirt back down over your tight little ass.

You did as expected, turning and dropping to your knees wrapping your lips around me to clean up the mess you'd made just like I'd insisted in our previous encounter.

buzz buzz another message

""My little slut. Walking the office with drenched panties. Next time it'll be that perfect little ass""

*Option 3*

You suddenly wake up. You panic. Where are you? What's happening? What's that smell? Alcohol?

And then the fear really sets in as you slowly begin to wake up properly you realise your small wrists are pinned down and there's a heavy weight on top of you, pressing you face down into the couch.

You scream for me to get off, your small frame thrashes under me. Suddenly I have both your small wrists pinned above you in one big rough hand.

The stench of alcohol strong as you feel my other rough hand slip under your skirt, pushing it up as my fingers slide between your thighs and roughly run along your underwear.

Shit... You must have drifted off.

But you trusted me... But you realise you were wrong as you squeal at my touch. Who Am I?"

She has been volunteering at the library since April, selling donated books, toys and jewelry. She refuses to apply for SSI, but I don’t think she is capable of getting a job. She is disorganized.

She tells us she won’t be approved but we tell her you never know when less you try and it’s OK if she doesn’t get approved, though I think she will get approved. She was in special ed and my friend whose son was also in special ed told me I can give SSI her IEP and special education records and she will be approved. Problem is she won’t sign record releases. Every time I talk about SSI she gets mad. When she was in school I called the counselor to talk to her about this, and not to tell her they will be talking about SSI. When she was called in to the counselors office and found out they were going to talk about SSI, she immediately stormed out. She refuses to listen to anyone. I told her in order to get a good paying job you have to do an internship first for 1-2 years and even people who do an internship for 1-2 years or more have trouble finding a minimum wage job. At least with SSI she will have money. She is flat out against this and will be upset anytime I talk to her about SSI. I am think perhaps hearing from someone her age also applying or on SSI will her. I was a teenager along time ago and I forgot what it’s like to be a teenager, so I don’t know how to talk to her in a way that will reach her. Any suggestions?"
79d41e,3,2017-10-28,6 days in... feeling.. empty... Flatline? is this good? bad? HALP.,Tha-Wolf,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/79d41e/6_days_in_feeling_empty_flatline_is_this_good_bad/,"About myself... cuz I am going to be posting a lot more often. Hopefully I can make some friends here cuz ya'll can respect the grind of this life and this mindset.

Anywho, long long story short:

- I bust my first nut at 13 (I am 25 now). It was to Brazilian Bubble Butts. I remember how I literally couldn't handle wtf was going on.

- I was addicted to porn until October 23rd, 2017. I am no longer addicted to it and I never will be again, period.

- I had a few streaks after discovering NoFap a few years ago... 30 days here. Maybe 40 days another time. Either I had sex , or I beat my meat eventually after rationalizing with myself that I wouldn't do it again. 

- I got into a deep hole of beating my meat to porn for like 2 months recently. Plenty of p.jelly and high def videos. Deepthroat videos started to lose its luster and i needed something more.  This is when I realized that I failed. I fucking failed myself. Period. No excuses. No one else made me beat my meat like a loser twice sometimes three times a day depending on how lonely i felt. I did. I looked myself in the mirror, and I put the blame on myself. No one else. 

The pain of staying the same was too much for me. So I had to change. 

Now, I aint trying to brag ( maybe a lil fuck ya'll lol ), but I am GOOD looking guy, as superficial as that sounds. I have nice ""equipment"",and women know this. I have all the physical and personality traits (mostly) to be an attractive male except for the fact that I am 5'9 and I don't have a lot of money currently as a freelance Web Developer (only source of income until i get hired, which i will be soon; offered an internship). This hurts my self confidence and self esteem because ill literally watch women REALLY put themselves out there to get my attention... and I don't have the confidence and ill consciously watch myself NOT follow through because I am broke af living on my grandparents couch. I am not saying that being physically unattractive would make me feel better, but being an attractive guy having this problem just gives me another perspective to feel shitty about.

Now, on to the point of this.

Flatlining.... how does that feel to you guys? How long does it last?

For me, today I just felt.... empty. I dont know. I dont really feel like myself. I don't really want to talk to anyone... yet, alls I want is connection. It's such a weird paradox almost. I dont' exactly feel depressed (i've gone through a few spells of depression to know), but just....

... empty. I wrote a couple more lines to a song today that I was really happy with and that made me feel alive a little... but otherwise... i'm empty.

79ddtv,26,2017-10-28,Struggling to keep up the lie,Sarif_,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/79ddtv/struggling_to_keep_up_the_lie/,"Does anyone elses family practice Islam to such an extent that literally every aspect of life has to be planned around it? Right now I'm on an internship and it's a really stressful time for me. I work nearly 50+ hrs a week and what little spare time I have I spend studying courses/skills to increase my chances of getting into grad school. I come from a working class area in a North American city where most of the Muslim kids I grew up with have literally zero prospects in life. Either in jail, dead, or working some manual labour job for the rest of their life. So many of them have memorised the Qur'an yet are the most despicable kind of person and their parents don't have the faintest idea.

Meanwhile, there's me. I'm the first of my family to go and work on getting an engineering degree. I saved my family great financial strain by winning a scholarship to offset some of the costs of university. Every penny I make from my internship I use to help our family. I don't indulge on anything. All I ask is to just have that 1-2 hours of spare time a day to just relax or study. But now, they force me to go to this Islamic class. Where I have to memorise hadiths and countless ayaats. 

Now as expected, I do absolutely horribly. I fail every week because I don't have time to prepare anything. This has now been the 5th week in a row where I didn't have anything to prepare and now my parents are getting extremely accusatory. Asking me why I don't care about ""deen"" and whatnot. Asking if I *really* believe. I tried explaining that I don't have time because of work and studying. But they got all incredulous asking why I spend so much time studying duniya stuff. Apparently I should only be working and using my spare time to ""build my imaan"". The stuff I study right now won't help me in the afterlife so I should spend all my spare time just memorising surahs and hadiths. 

What sucks is I can't even bring myself to study these hadiths because they're just so obviously a waste of time. And sitting down to read them is so infuriating because every other word is some glorification and Allah bragging about being the most merciful and the most gracious that I'm seriously starting to feel as though man's are lowkey worshipping Trump.  Add to that the anxiety of wasting time because I compulsively plan out my day and now I have to block off a whole section of time devoted to something I know provides no value for my future.

And lol we haven't even got the worst part. The emotional guilt tripping is what makes me want to just throw myself out the window. Telling me its either choosing to study or choosing to follow their wishes. Always comparing me to others saying so-and-so is hafiz (great but so-and-so is 22, works at Dairy Queen, and smokes pot all day). My parents literally applaud someone who threw away their life but happened to be forced at an early age to memorise a bunch of verses more than their own son who is actually trying to make something of himself. I don't like to judge, so please don't think I feel as if I'm better than so-and-so mentioned before. It's just that I try so hard to succeed and make a better future for myself that it genuinely hurts when I'm told I'm somehow worse than the guy who just gets high all the time. 

So my current dilemma is this. Do I throw away everything I've been working on. All the preparations I've been making for my grad applications, and just go to this damn class that literally requires full-time commitment. The only alternative is that I refuse to go and I know that this is the point of no return. I've already tried explaining and reasoning and all that did is raise accusations that I don't value my religion.  Anytime I say I don't have time they hit me with the ""Oh, studying is more important than your deen?"". And obviously I say of course not - how else can I respond? I can't go down that path because the community is already still tense as fuck since this one girl literally declared her apostasy in the most dramatic fashion. Now it's like the Spanish Inquisition up here and I can feel the heat. I can't give anyone any reason to think I'm an atheist. I'm not sure if my family would kick me out or not. But I definitely know that they wouldn't speak to me and I'd be surrounded by a community that I know doesn't take apostasy lightly. 

I just needed to get this off my chest because it really does feel as though I'm drowning.  I've never been one to really suffer from anxiety but lately these weekly confrontations with my parents over my lack of religious studies is wearing me down. I have no one to confide in and no where to go. Lol I can't even yell in anguish because neighbours. Pretty much have to keep it all bottled up inside. So forgive this long rant, but I needed the catharsis."

* &gt;&gt;&gt;CONT
  * There was three people involved here this should be safe Fisk Lambert and Condrey
  * Those were the kind of the three founders I believe
  * Andrew McCabe picked one of the founders
  * Again, using you the Awan Spy ring
  * We had Fiske retire--was forced Fiske into retirement
  * They also entrapped Condrey into a indictment--he and his wife
  * And kept their chosen-one gave their chosen informant a third of the business
  * And take then took two-thirds of the rest of the business
  * I think this is the truth
  * And Mr. Lambert needs to not eyedropper the information to the house Intel committee Devin Nunes
  * His committee he needs to do full immediate public hearings to explain exactly what happened for all questions for all the house Intel committee of what happened
  * So the full facts of uranium one will come to the light of day
  * Now the reason why uranium one is so important with the Awan spy ring and where the two meet is:
  * ***Uranium trade enabled a dark weapons ratline. And it enabled a drug ratline***
  * Because the FBI took over the management--international management of uranium
  * They put an agents all along the way here
  * And satellite surveillance all along the way on these ratlines
  * They then became the color of law this became the color of law ratline
  * Anything could be added to this ratline
  * Highly enriched uranium going toward the developing nations who are developing their nuclear energy programs as well as their weapons programs, nuclear weapons programs going in one direction once that uranium is depleted, these Maersk ships going in the other direction
  * The direct benefit that McCabe gave to his own spy ring--one of his own spy kids was to Imran Awan
  * To Imran Awan's father--this is through the CIA, Imran Awan's Father depleted uranium was diverted into the weapons factory in north punjab for making depleted weapons
  * And also twelve farmers were defrauded in northern Pakistan to make a refinement, a drug refinement capability to make generic drugs
  * These drugs Andrew McCabe knows full well get diverted into pain clinics--illegal pain clinics primarily, and re-pilling operations throughout Canada and North America
  * And McCabe knows full well that that is enabled
  * Not saying Comey
  * Comey was mainly interested in Lockheed's interest here with startups created out of the medical radio pharmaceuticals and new testing procedures nuclear medicine, etc
  * Muller I believe was just interested in keeping the oil interests happy with their shipping lines, and keeping the oil interest happy with their dark weapons trade,
  * But McCabe is the one who added this this drug premium to the to ratline
  * {{ 911bs: McCabe is likely going to be assassinated soon:  once this is proven and people catch on to this, there will be a lot of angry vets, parents of children, etc parents and family of the withdrawal suicides.  McCabe should seriously consider at this point running for his very life or seeking witness protection. Generally speaking, he should get out now if he knows what's good for him and his family. I am not threatening McCabe in any way, neither is anyone in this investigation. I have not nor will participate in or endorse in any way violence against any state actor or institution.  I'm just stating noncontroversial basic human psychology.  I'm speaking about Truth and Consequences }}
  * So that's what makes Charleston
  * So important because Charleston becomes the strategic MOX plant in the United States
  * This is where uranium can be enriched, along the chain
  * This is why I believe that I was singled out by JTTF, Coast Guard with the parallel construction, the false imprisonment, etc, by their own admission
  * This became the flashpoint I believe
  * History will show this will be the flashpoint back into why the whole uranium one deal was brought to light
  * It will be the Iran-Contra of our time, I believe
  * And I believe full hearings are needed by Mr. Lambert to disclose the full dynamics of how this trade was established in the first place
  * Transportation logistics role in it
  * And then I believe there's it going to be another company that Senators are going to be getting involved in called ACS
  * One of the ACS locations is at Imran Awan's home
  * There's another one in Florida
  * There's another one in Charleston South Carolina
  * There's another ACS in Arizona
  * Primarily but because I believe John McCain is on me Senate Armed Services Committee
  * All this is called in my book Awan contra
  * And all this needs to come to light
  * We need immediate immediate hearings, open hearings, not eyedropper leaks to press over a period of months and hoping everybody forgets about it
  * Uranium one must come to light
  * The peepee dossier and the Awan inspiring go right along with it because in managing these secret ratlines you need domestic surveillance against targets
  * I believe the Peepee dossier was nothing more than a a payment to MI6 for spying on American citizens
  * No way no way somebody's gonna pay nine million dollars for the peepee dossier
  * And the Awan spy ring already was in place for people in Congress
  * So really their left and right hands hand in glove fit with the Iran-Contra
  * Uranium one the peepee dossier all a part of the same system enabling HEU in one direction, depleted uranium in the other
  * Enabling the dark ratline for dark weapons in one direction and drugs in the other

  * This is Day eight and I apologize for the squinting and the Sun
  * I'm moving from Maryland here Largo Center where I lost the laptop or whatever happened to it
  * There was reported it to a block house here also the station manager downstairs it was either the 611 train of the 616 train
  * Two kids were arrested I don't know we're just just out yeah actually right over here
  * And there was three kids near me that night
  * And it was just interesting because they were arrested right as I came out
  * And I didn't know if that was related or not but I kind of dozed off on the last two stops and I don't know what happened the kids
  * I did talk to the the police officers there at the metro police officers
  * And I said was it related to the theft?
  * I probably would have done the--the thing on the Les Misrables
  * That's kind of how i see my life with McCabe is sort of Jean Valjean and Javert
  * I would have probably been like the priest and said John you forgot the other candles--you you just took the candles?
  * So anyway I out that I just can't see two kids getting their life ruined over for taking a bag, when we've got a spy ring in Congress and terabytes of information going to Pakistan, thousands of money transfers, and who knows how many thousands of people pieces of equipment that went and came back and is spread out through 30 different parts of our DynCorp DHS backbone, that we've lovely constructed
  * So I am going to be going into kind of dangerous territory today I'm going to go to CIA headquarters, which is Reston
  * I'm gonna be meeting a person in the Intelligence community just to let everybody know up front in case I don't show up
  * There's my train so I'll see you all later
  * I will just say that if I don't get a chance to say this again 
  * ***DIA is running a campaign on every phone call, that's out in Bluffdale, Utah***
  * ***...That being used by Booz Allen to look at your phone calls, look at your texts, is also being replicated in Cheltenham England at GCHQ***
  * ***And by and the DIA liaison officer in Anacostia [who is] the brevet general, [and he] is the guy who's running that program***
  * ***And Andrew McCabe was instrumental in organizing a nine million dollar payment to MI6, to get all your phone calls for Hillary Clinton***
  * I don't know how many deep dives that is
  * ***But it was 250 parallel constructions by Samantha Power***

* [Day 8.3- Awan Contra - MAVNI, DISA, Joint Spectrum Center - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbtNyqZhNU)
  * This is Day 8
  * Just before I get to Virginia I may as well record one more Capitol report
  * I want to do this as long as possible but parallel construction sometimes has a way of finding you, especially when you really get to the uranium
  * So today I'm going to get to another key program
  * And it's called the program I believe
  * It's a Counterintelligence program much like COINTELPRO Counterintelligence program but this one uses a foreign-born to come to the United States that have been trained in Intelligence and operations from foreign wars
  * And some people think this is the Muslim Brotherhood
  * It's really not. It's a program called MAVNI M A V N I
  * And I believe its military assets vitally necessary for insurrection
  * And they probably have some other thing for the AI
  * But it's military assets vitally needed in case of insurrection of the american people and these are people that can be counted on as a unit as a tribe...or many different tribes but the Awans are going to be a big part of it
  * So--you don't have to add there's no should I shoot at a fellow American for protesting?
  * There's none of that that goes to the person's mind
  * And that's what you need for--command and control in case of insurrection an insurrection
  * I believe General Grange's son runs this program
  * And it's I think it's quite open there's lots of Army manuals...out there and I won't go into all the Army manuals
  * And Alex Jones always is throwing up the Army manuals for the insurrection manuals, so I don't have to cover that
  * But so the MAVNI program bought brought in I believe around a hundred thousand folks from overseas
  * So these are all the positions you would need across the whole DynCorp DHS backbone all 30 agencies
  * Now our other agencies involved other than the thirty involved and kind of like the JTTF agencies outside of Coast Guard, and--Customs and Border Patrol all those different agencies?
  * Maybe. Who knows
  * I'm I'm real sure that man the effects directly the the DHS a group of Federal agencies of 30 I think somewhere in there
  * I probably all everyone's going to be infiltrated as far as the whole DHS backbone, because you want to be able to go across the backbone and know that your information assets are secure
  * You're not going to have any loyal Americans standing up and going hey I don't think this is right gonna be able to immediately immediately eliminate any threat
  * I believe the Awans are involved in the DISA it's called DISA this Defense Information Systems agency which is the IT agency for the Department of Defense
  * It's in Springfield where I'm going or not I'm actually not going to Springfield but it's close to where the Awans have the house
  * It's where they have the compromised houses is what I call it or whatever you want to call six three one four Springfield
  * It's where the DHS guy Atif lives, that is associated with the Awans
  * It's where the Awans all kind of came as their first stopping point in 2004, when Imran moves from an intern at Inter America into being a actual employee of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz or Wexler at that time
  * So MAVNI there's been several as Russell from can't remember which state I think it's Nebraska maybe it's Kansas, ex military veteran say hey the MAVNI program is is a disaster
  * There's 6,000 people we have no idea where they are
  * Well those are the one that became the covert operatives
  * We know where Imran is
  * We don't know where he lives yet
  * We don't have this picture
  * They can't seem to publish that as a Congressional employee
  * Rao Abbass, same thing Quasi Mensa same deal
  * But the 6000 are going to be sprinkled all around the United States around key centers and I believe it's going to be for the the around what I call insurrection centers
  * Basically in an insurrection you want to cut off all communications, cut off water supply, etc heard people and too concentrated areas, and then being able to manage each one with a force that moves in between the concentrated areas
  * So keep everybody kind of stay put
  * Cut the communications lines, trains, planes automobiles that sort of thing
  * So I think the 6000 are those
  * They're bringing in a ton of people to st. Louis to the NGA Center in st. Louis, which is as I've said before is the same thing for Snowden in NSA, where people are gonna just be shocked out of their mind, that they're collecting all of our phone calls
  * I remember people denying that and saying Snowden was--conspiracy theorist, until James clapper finally admitted it
  * The same thing is gonna happen with Clapper who started at NGA, when people find out that nanoSATs these little satellites in low orbit that just burn up and they throw them away like tissue paper
  * Do the same thing for for managing your day-to-day movements
  * People are gonna be shocked out of their mind that everyone's tracked, collected it all with these nano sets
  * The Awans are very close to this project
  * I believe that there was a deal done as I mentioned earlier this morning with mi6, basically using the liaison loophole, to able to be able to go into all your phone calls...
  * ..And do what they call a ""deep dive"" that's taking selectors saying
  * I think this person's this this and this you select a whole bunch of communications a subset of your total communication
  * And then people go through analysts go in and annotate and markup those things
  * {{ 911bs: it's what George is saying but it's worse than that.  They are doing pattern-of-life analysis with predictive models of behavior by actually recreating a simulacrum of yourself inside of a type of virtual reality construct called the 'sentient world simulation' that is deriving all the possible moves and future events based on behavioral and personality profiling that relies on the deep dive and total information awareness perspective to draw upon multiple source of personal informaion and an analysis of behavior }}
  * So they say well this guy looks like he's putting up an antenna in his backyard you can say looks like he's running commercial the analyst would write ""might be running subversive communications for cells of his weird whatever""
  * But the whole idea is try to make everybody look at mentally ill
  * Try to make everyone look subversive
  * Try to make everyone seem not so, crazy and that sort of thing and that's the markup
  * Then that information is then pushed out to JTTF through the through the fusion centers in each state and each large city 50 I think use about 82 fusion centers
  * So that's where this is going
  * I believe that the Awans  are critically involved in this DISA program
  * And I believe the joint spectrum Center in Annapolis Maryland is where they can order up these deep dives
  * Now I think there was a --that I do believe that Peepee dossier was a nine million dollar payment to MI6
  * I don't know how often they make these nine million dollar payments,
  * But you're gonna get to see all the segways--can you believe Segway drove his own Segway off a cliff?
  * So look hey guys cadets yeah yeah Oh what what what agency Oh future
  * FFA Future Farmers of America is at Future Farmers of America?
  * Anyway you get all kinds ...everything happens here in Washington DC
  * So I'm gonna leave it there
  * I think DISA is where these different safe houses that Imran has
  * Yes drugs are a part of it
  * That's to pay for the whole operation
  * You want a lot of footprints
  * But I think I don't want to say Imran is a big nasty drug dealer I don't want to give that impression or he's a big nasty it runs a big nasty car theft ring
  * These are what's known as proprietaries
  * They pay the bills basically they pay the bills
  * So that you can run these different operations the main the main purpose is MAVNI is military assets that are vitally needed in the case of an insurrection
  * {{ 911bs: MAVNI is essentially GLADIO...leave behind weapons to fight your own citizens; of course you're going to fight your own citizens if you attack them with illegal drugs, corruption, child sex trafficking, organ harvesting, psychological warfare through the media... it's a luciferian hegelian dialectic.  Gladio was freemasonry }}  
  * Again, everyone says this is conspiracy theory, until they google
  * Please google before you say it's conspiracy theory
  * Please a Google representative Russell and his comments about MAVNI, about the 6,000 people they can't find in front of Congressional testimony
  * Talk to Mike McMahan about the vetting project, where they said 66,000 got pushed through with absolutely no vetting, when he said,  ""hey what are we doing?""
  * So anyway this is kind of fun--I normally try to give out stuff incrementally, because I don't want to overwhelm and try to--it's like the Snowden thing
  * But on these key dates, where you think well--I might get parallel construction on me today
  * You got to kind of do the data dump
  * So I apologizes this is a little bit long

* [Day 8.4 - Awan Spy Ring Is Really Just Input For NADRA Satellite App - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpd76GdL8E)
  * This'll be a fun one
  * This is Day eight my fourth one today
  * Let me explain the four-sided clocks, just in case
  * let's suppose we're back in the day of the Popes, when they were kind of up for sale
  * They were Popes were pay-to-play
  * Pope pay-to-play they used to call a triple P
  * And you had the white Guelph's and you had the red Guelph's or whatever let's just say we had the red we had the white
  * Sometimes they say the white and the black Pope
  * All that stuff
  * You would want a system whereby you wouldn't have to--if you had a large organization, you wouldn't want to be able to have like an org chart that you could look at, because if the other side ever got that org chart, you're finished, right?
  * So what you do is you kind of create a spinning wheel right
  * If you took the clock face, twelve positions right, just turn it sideways, those would be twelve guys in robes, basically
  * If you spin the wheel, wherever it comes you have a let's say three organization layers, you kind of have three clocks on their side
  * You down here if you're an underling would never know where your orders are coming from
  * They spun the wheel those guys are all in robes you don't know them
  * That's the other thing you conceal their identities of the bosses
  * And it's one of twelve identities
  * So for any given order, you would have layers of combinations
  * And each time you go up a layer, the permutations of all the things you have to run down to figure out where the order came from would be endless
  * The Enigma machine basically is the same idea--the Germans did
  * It it's just the three wheels set vertically
  * Now if that's confusing well and I don't know what to say
  * But clocks came into vogue and they had this feeling that--order was very important and this this was--360 minutes of the earth was the--the 360 days of the year and all this sort of thinking
  * ***So it really comes from this kind of the Masonic thinking comes from a lot of this order necessary order***
  * And the same way for structures--having square corners and the square and the whole idea
  * ***And this whole idea that if you were out of order it was a threat to the whole society***
  * So if a brick is out of place that's a threat to the whole society if somebody's not managing and exactly at the right time of day the monks are not praying at the right time of day etc, that's out of order
  * So there's this heavy emphasis and order
  * But the key that I want to make key point I wanna make because you never know when you get to make your last one, when you get parallel constructed, is this idea of the all the people above you are in a Directorate of 12
  * And you don't know at any given order who that order came from, because the guy is hooded, you don't know who he is
  * And that is very effective, because if you went and let's say I got the order and I just did something and they torture me
  * I'd say I don't know that's one of 12 guys in robes--take your pick
  * So it's very effective
  * Well the English picked us up--who knows if Chaucer was a spy or not and and went over to to Quattrocento went over to the Renaissance to see what was going on bring it back to England? Who knows?
  * But one thing he did bring back maybe was this idea of of layering or however you want to call it and--I guess it's degrees
  * Let's just call it degrees
  * And the Protestants versus the Catholics--this helps greatly as well, because again, it's a way of hiding your organizational structure from your opponent okay
  * {{ 911bs: At the honorific frats, the knights of columbus, knights of malta, knights of holy cross, ordo of knights templar etc; that's the interface where masons 'become' inculcated into a paraCatholic tradition ('jesuits'?).  Queen Elizabeth II is a KNight of Malta, and a Catholic...and Pope Frank just took over Knights of Malta, which is a 'above 33rd degree masonry' requirement.  In other words it's Catholics-v-Protestants is a massive school play, and that's why BONO and U2 essentially gave up being revolutionaries when they joined the Globalists at the UN and Hollywood, the internationals brought them in and told them the true nature of the biz. }}
  * Now here's the Washington piece and here's where we're gonna get down to the end of the street with Virginia Mason
  * Washington, I think believe the same thing
  * Because if you're a rebel, you've got the British Intelligence coming after you
  * Now some people say maybe Washington was both
  * So we don't know that
  * But anyway the idea of the four-sided clock is: you're always looking from wherever angle you're looking at, you're always reminded that don't get out of order
  * Don't get out of order
  * That Washington Monument going way back to the Greek with the I at the top
  * The reason why it's beveled slightly at the top is to to protrude the eye is the same idea before clocks existed in Egypt, which was the eye is all-seeing
  * And we're watching you buddy
  * {{ 911bs: Gargoyles on buildings are the same thing.  They were video cameras before video cameras were invented }}
  * And now we move forward to the big eye
  * Which is a lot of people say what the series reminds them of is the big eye--
  * It's like kind of like watching 1984 or the movies Snowden
  * You just you don't know how it's gonna end
  * George's like Winston running around trying to remain alive
  * And there and and it is a little bit like Snowden in the sense I'm the NGA guy, and Snowden was the NSA guy,
  * [Whereas I am] exposing the NGA thing with the Awans and the Nanosets and the whole developing the NADRA application in spending three months out of the year in Pakistan and terabytes of information
  * So you can see I'm letting on a little bit more what the terabytes are
  * I know it's not just a scheme to defraud the American people...
  * It's going to which I think is maybe worse, which is this scheme to surveil and harass the American people okay
  * So Virginia Mason right now
  * I'm kind of in ground zero of this
  * So I thought hey I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna do a piece here
  * The problem comes when you no longer have a situation like Protestants and Catholics
  * Or when the CIA brought this in
  * I'm also in the middle of CIA central that--when OSS was going overseas
  * There was agents you never knew who was on whose side
  * I understand all that when you go out go out of the country
  * But the problem comes when you bring it in to law enforcement and you make these secret layers, law enforcement
  * When you make the secret torture center, which is your are equivalent is these fusion centers
  * They had them in Vietnam and the Phoenix project
  * Same idea: torture centers
  * And the way you get at the other guy's chart is you torture
  * So the problem comes when you have these secret meetings and says George is out of order
  * We need to bring the wrath of the order down on George--
  * This this order is being disrupted by George
  * And that's the problem
  * And so McCabe, being a good Virginia Mason that he is
  * This is something that exists
  * And I'm all the other hooey about--
  * Now there is the trial of fire in the trial of water and--if we we we said ""ok we're gonna go through this secret ceremony and then we're gonna burn your heart with this poker--a trial of fire, you'd remember that""
  * Especially if they were burning incense in your nose
  * If they almost drowned you in water, and then they were when you got out you immediately smell that same burning
  * Burning incense would mean something different to you going forward, it would be this reminder that if you ever tell anybody this you're--the trial fire and the trial of water
  * So that is really the whole Masonic thing debunked or demystified if you will
  * It's just a way of warning you to keep your mouth shut and stay in line
  * Don't get out of order
  * {{ 911bs: you mean to lay ('vulgar') people 'for all intents and purposes', they are a criminal org.  Yes, true.  But freemasonry's clearly much more than that.  They are up to some really weird stuff and the things they do cannot be explained by mere criminal networking.  All the focus on relics, 33rd parallel north, consciousness magick of the number 7 in arts and letters, and focus on the temple mount, the attempted capping of the pyramid with gold facade....that's beyond cartel-ism and into the mystical }}

  * And of course you've got the beautiful Northrop Grumman behind us right next to CrowdStrike down in there in by Lee Stranahan
  * There's just too much money
  * There's just too much money in all this
  * There's too much money there's billions trillions
  * There's seven point seven trillion and dark budget, that's unaccounted for
  * The title of my series from about day 100 when I picked up this pattern was DynCorp DynCorp DynCorp
  * That's that's the list that's the video list
  * And Summon Herndon and I'm on Dulles corners--Dulles corners Drive right here
  * And there's there's good old Aaron Rich behind me organizing his team at Northrop Grumman for the next project
  * So that's next project that's gonna save you, the American people, and keep you secure and safe
  * ***Well is there really any terrorists at all?***
  * {{ 911bs: yes, it's the CIA }}
  * I mean that's the big key question
  * Well yeah there is
  * ***They're right here in Herndon: They're the CIA***
  * {{ 911bs: called it. }}
  * I had a cab driver. It's so good to meet with people, new people every day, and ask them their stories
  * And this was a guy from Myanmar and his whole family was in a refugee camp
  * And he had gone over the border in Bangladesh
  * And he was trying to make enough money to get one of his kids: one.  Back
  * And it's the same story over and over
  * The CIA goes in.  Soros is the funnel.  Create a corridor.  Get the resources.  Get out
  * And oh by the way have a self congratulatory dinner, toasting yourself, and how important you are
  * And have sycophantic, twenty-somethings reporters, talk about the conspiracy of it all to say anything other with other than that
  * It's really quite amazing
  * This pattern just repeats itself over and over
  * So I had a good talk with my good friend deep uranium that called this way back in day 100
  * And said Charleston's the key
  * Look at Iran
  * They're using the depleted uranium which you can feed into the breeder reactor
  * There's breeder reactors in Iran
  * If you would have to you turn lead into gold
  * He said that maybe 200 days ago
  * I didn't believe him
  * I had to go through this process step-by-step-by-step 1400 videos, of checking out every piece of fact that he told me
  * Because he worked there for decades
  * He works in a team that was there for decades
  * He was right he was right and the school play is a school play
  * All this DNC and CNN
  * It's all fake
  * It's all fake
  * I was looking for a Braverman
  * I was searching for a Braverman
  * Braverman almost was murdered by those two Egyptian assassins that came in and blew up did the [pressure cooker] bomb as the warning outside his apartment
  * He came that close to being murdered
  * That's what happened
  * It was a Braverman was the last hero in this story
  * The DNC leak is not a DNC leak--it's a controlled story--it's a fake
  * The DNC leaked they pushed out all these names of all these people who gave millions of dollars George Clooney all these Hollywood stars that gave 1 million or 5 million
  * Well guess what? They didn't give that money
  * That was laundering money from drugs and dark weapons
  * And a lot of the money's made legitimately through friends like Aaron Rich and Northrop Grumman
  * The Podesta, the whole pizza gate was made to bait the Fox crowd
  * Now Podesta was maybe kept at a distance let him know put him down a little bit
  * Don't let him get too powerful
  * I'm not saying that there wasn't some checking going on in these in these releases

  * I filed a lawsuit to prove exactly that
  * I don't know how far I'm gonna get, because it's obviously
  * I don't want to call it the deep state, because it's not really deep, it's right there--that building's not underground
  * It's all the defense contractors--its Lockheed, its Raytheon, its Northrop Grumman, its Boeing, the Senate is a show, CNN it's a show, House of Representatives is a show

Is linear algebra a hard class since its mostly an introduction? Plus I'll have a GE I'm taking and work 20+ hours a week so will it be doable, I'm pretty average when it comes to school especially CS. I'm doing alright in CS 146 (might end with a B) right now its not hard just my math class (Combinatorics is hard af) and pledging is taking time away from it

•	Lazy as fuck. Procrastinator of ridiculous proportions, filling the dishwasher or cleaning and rinsing my mouth piece feel like a pain in the arse. 
•	Incapable of learning anything of an significant order of logical difficulty (and therefore any trade whatsoever)
•	Chose stupid worthless liberal arts career just because I thought it was the only thing I could do right, struggled with even it and then changed to another subject but not after wasting a lot of effort and my father’s money.
•	Decided to study economics, a total failure, I couldn’t even pass the 101 and Calculus looked as it was a form of mental torture. As I said, incapable of learning real stuff. Left college and went to a technical institute to learn accounting, much easier carreer. I passed the first couple subjects with high scores, but they were made of contents a freaking 5th grader could learn with ease. As soon as it got complicated…disastrous. When I applied for low level accounting jobs with my easy subject high GPA on my resume, they wouldn’t even call for an interview. 
•	Can’t get a job at all, not good at anything, useless failure. Destined to be a janitor clearly (if I’m lucky, I’m so stupid and socially ignorant I don’t even know where to seek such low end jobs).
•	Emotionally weak, lacking any sort of resilience whatsoever. Highly neurotic, HSP. Very anxious personality. I have moderate to severe SAD and mild to moderate OCD (how bothersome it can be is not mild at all, not to mention that procrastinating isn’t solved by my overthinking)
•	No discipline, no grit, no motivation, I easily frustrate because I realize that I can’t and stop doing stuff with anger.  Doing stuff with purpose feels like a gargantuan, unbearable effort which I’m not capable of doing, not that it would matter since I’m some kind of an idiot.
•	Hypersensitive introverted egomaniac, obsessed with what people think of me, take everything personally, including statements that aren’t directed towards me specifically but I feel that they are referring to me, a frown is a dagger even if I don’t have anything to do with it. I feel people behave rudely I assume that they dislike me and that they are mean and cruel.
•	Incapable of organizing and planning like any normal person, my mind is cluttered with tasks which look like in total they’re insurmountable and end up doing nothing (see first item above)
•	I can’t focus, can’t put myself to do boring stuff, even thinking of starting them is painful. Very hard to sit through a class that isin’t 100% compelling and fun without losing focus and mind wandering. After 4 months of meditation, nothing has changed, or not significantly at least.
•	I feel really guilty. I’m a loser and yet I live with affluence, supported by my parents and leeching them. So many hardworking, capable, smart, gritty people weren’t fortunate to born with the same privileges as I am, yet I’m living with great comfort, hot shower, 3 meals a day, laptop and high speed internet, a TV. I can’t enjoy leisure thinking about it. I can’t, and the thoughts are more frequent than ever.
•	No social life, couple of friends which I very rarely see, social hermit, I’m starting to dislike social gatherings and going out to hang around with other people quite a lot.
•	Porn addict, internet addict, screen addict. I’m not even getting proper sleep anymore because of these three. When I’m awake and not indulging myself in these things, I’m walking talking to myself constantly.
•	I think I’m very selfish and ungrateful sometimes, after all I’m part of the blessed ones that live without lack of any basic need, food, shelter, etc, and plus I’m really healthy (not mentally obviously). So many people suffering so much more, hunger, misery, slavery, natural disasters, war and oppression, and here I am, whining like a baby because I wasn’t given an average set of cards in life. Big deal!  So I can’t enjoy leisure cause I feel guilty, and I can’t feel hurt for the same reason. It’s quite a shitty thing.
•	Eventually, my family is going to realize what a fucking bum I’m am and they are gonna cut off supporting me. I’m scared, but I’m also sad because they’re good decent people who love me and I’ve been a major disappointment to them. It’s going to hurt them a lot.

Realizing you’re a loser is not harsh, it’s excrucicating. I’m tired of being told that I’m making excuses and that I need to work hard and that it’s my fault. Yeah no shit, Sherlock…but I CAN’T CHANGE BECAUSE IT’S MY FAULT. If I weren’t a loser, I wouldn’t be so lazy in the first place. If I were someone who simply had a couples of backfires and needed to be back on my feet, I would be asking for help and advice at r/getmotivated or r/getdisciplined. I’m fucked up, I’m useless, I'm unable, I’m a slob, okay. High school I barely escaped alive, below average at best and awful at worst in every subject minus English. My teachers, my principal, my professors, every single interviewer I had , every job test and internship I took so I could get hired and I’ve failed (that’s right, never had a job) without telling me has already told me the very same thing I’m telling you: I. Am. A. Loser.

I’ve stopped believing in all self-improvement crap “you can do whatever you want and you’re special”. I don’t even believe that we have much free will at all anymore. We’re given certain attributes, traits, and abilities when we’re born, and it’s fixed. That includes discipline, proactiveness, conscientiousness and self-control. We can’t change who we are. It’s all genetics. I’m a bio determinism jihadist. The whole “growth mindset” theory helps you to discover what was already inside you. It can’t make any more disciplined, hardworking, intelligent or able. Sure it works wonders with inner city kids so that they can learn arythmetics. But to being good at something in life when you aren’t good at anything (much less useful), to a person who’s just wrong and can’t do things right? Who needs to take medication so he can function like something that resembles a mediocre person? Yeah right, keep the BS rolling hurtful asshole. Life is good or cruel by circumstance, life is a matter of talent and inherent traits, randomly chosing what will your place at table can be.

Why am I writing this? Why am I making a huge effort to write something that’s taking me hours to finish so a bunch of anonymous strangers on the Internet can read and comment whatever they want to say (and criticism is not something I take well at all being weak). Because I loathe myself and I’m hurting so much. The only kind of people I think can understand the emotional agony I’m going through are people with depression. But I’m not depressed. I’m a loser. It’s the only thing I’m right, trust me. I have a legitimate reason to feel horrible. People with depression aren’t losers, they just have a liar inside their heads that tells them they are and they believe it (reading many posts with the title “I’m a loser” and then reading what they really are have made me realize this). But we’re one the same because we suffer. My life is generally torture and sadness, interrupted by some (getting slimmer and slimmer) minor joys. I want help. How can I stop feeling like this? I’m crying myself to sleep. I’m writing this feeling the effects of sleep deprivation. I’m generally so fucking sad. What should I do? What minor steps can I take? Should I get a pet? Should I change or add medications (I take Wellbrutin, which has a different brand name where I live, but it’s bupoprion all the same)? Is there something that’s not complicated so that this loser can feel a little better?

Please. Help me. It hurts so much. I need to accept I’m a worthless loser. I want it to stop feeling this bad. I’m starting to self-harm. I don’t know if I won’t do it again.

P.S. I don't think I'll respond to your comments. So I want to thank you for your help and any advice that you post here. To the people who plan to post some tough love crap, or dispute my beliefs about what determines your life, I won't comment on you, but I won't read you either. You're wasting effort."
79gdkg,51,2017-10-29,I wish I lived a little more and waited a few more years before having kids.,wastedmyyouththrow,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/79gdkg/i_wish_i_lived_a_little_more_and_waited_a_few/,"Just a little self indulgent rant I need to get off my chest. 

Growing up, I was the 'good girl' who did everything right. Straight As, 4.0 in college, did internships instead of studying abroad in the summers except for one year, straight into grad school and even did summer school to start working a good job a year earlier, got married, had a baby, decided to have one more and got twins. 

And now I have just turned 31 and have so many regrets. For some reason, turning 30 was OK. It was 31 that hit me.

I never did anything cool with my life. I'm just a 31 year old mom with a 4 year old and 2 x 2 year olds. I never travelled - I've only been abroad once for one summer semester and even then, I was studying more than enjoying it.

I keep looking at people my age who have actually done cool stuff with their lives and enjoyed being young and wish someone told me that it is OK to slow down a little and do a little travelling and enjoy my life. Because I see people my age now just starting to 'settle' and it's working out ok - but they got to live first. They went to all these wonderful places and did lots of cool things and I regret that now. I wish I did that. My life has been nothing but studying, work, and babies. I have a good job - better than most, I am financially comfortable - probably more than most of these people I talk about,  but I still feel like I did it wrong. 

I wold never give back my babies, but I wish there was a way to like....go back to 26, convince myself to wait a few years, enjoy life with my husband, and then get the same babies in my early 30s. And by the time they are grown, it will be hard on our body to travel as much, and I'll need to help them with their college costs because I'm extremely grateful my parents saved and funded my education and it would feel wrong to not pay it forward to my own kids.

But why, WHY, didn't I let myself backpack through Europe first? "

You know what I’m talking about, that neighbour that had a kid, but all the boys on the neighbourhood dreamed about fucking her. And as I think that are MILFs here that walkways wanted to fuck younger guys I’m bringing some prompts.

*****

**Soccer Mom**

	I was playing at the match when I saw you cheer on the grandstand. When I looked I saw an astonishing MILF with gym clothes that showed how hot your body is. 

	You seem to be someone’s mother, but who? I couldn’t stop thinking so I could talk to you.

*****

**High-School Teacher**

	I’m at detention today, but why is that? I was talking to a friend about how your big and juicy your ass and tits are. 

	When you enter by the door I give a little smile because I would have to spend two hours looking at your tits while you stay sited there. But will you stay seated?

*****

**Friend’s Mom**

	You are my friend’s mother, a MILF that knows that it’s a MILF. A beautiful body, that you like to show on your string bikini while yours sons friends enjoy themselves by the pool.

	That wears leggings and short-shorts with tops and tight blouses and dresses so people could appreciate and see your body

	Today your son invited me to go to the pool and here I am looking at you on your bikini with a boner...

*****

**Mother In Law**

	Here I am, next to your daughter, my girlfriend, introducing myself to you and your husband. Well... mostly you, because I can’t stop looking at you, your tits, your curves, your cleavage. 

	My cock is already hard and we are here about ten minutes, my mind is away from the living room, more precisely at the bedroom, where I’m imagining to fuck you.

*****

**Maid**

	Every now and then my parents employe a new maid and this time it’s you, and I can’t be happier. You are a astonishing MILF, and with the french maid costume it’s even better, hot as hell.

	One day when I come home from class I see you on your knees cleaning the floor, your ass up, the skirt barely covers it. My dick got hard and my backpack fell on the floor. You look back with a smile that I can’t decifre.

*****

**Boss**

	It’s my first internship and you are my boss. A thick, big tit boss, MILF boss.

	On the first day I noticed all male employee look at you with desire, and they surely have a good reason for doing that. You blouse shows your cleavage and your pencil skirt is tighter than college cheerleaders one. You make everyone dick gets hard and you know it.

*****

**Workmate**

	You work with me at my internship since I started here. You as an employee and me as an intern. You are recently graduated so you know how my life at work is difficult.

	Since day one you offered to help me with everything at work from paperwork to make contacts and rise at the company.

        Tonight is the night I’m signing my contract and we are having an office party after, maybe you are going to help me with one last thing.

         These were some prompts I came up with, if you have any other idea just send it on your message. Here’s my [DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/74yixv/m4f_nick_albe/?st=J8NEGQOY&amp;sh=56921c66), there’s my kink list and some information you may want to know."
79h7sr,22,2017-10-29,Going No Contact with Indian parents -- My Story -- Seeking Advice and Support,tonmouson,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/79h7sr/going_no_contact_with_indian_parents_my_story/,"Dear all,

I'm a 32 year old male of Indian descent, now naturalised in the UK and a permanent resident in the US. My parents live in India still. I am the only child. I grew up under very straitened circumstances, and the constant threat of poverty. But somehow, I ended up making myself to the UK with no money, and going to university at the three oldest universities there, on scholarship, and am now trying to make it as a writer, and a poet. I am gay, and married to a wonderful man.

Growing up, I idolised my mother, whom my father and his family treated horrendously. My mother always told me what a horrible person my father was (and this part is largely true), and so, I've never had an affectionate relationship with him. (They're still together, however.) When my mum said she said she had sacrificed her entire life for me, that she lived only for my sake, that without me, her life would have no meaning and would die, and that without her, I would have ended up an orphan, with a rootless existence, I believed her. Such declarations as these, I heard every day, growing up.

However, over the past year, and especially this summer, I have come to realise that I might have been in an abusive relationship with both my parents, particularly my mother. She has always insisted on controlling all aspects of my life -- from where I went to school, to what I studied, and what I did; I even had to suffer two years of studying medicine in India, simply because she wanted me to, before I got an internship in the UK and left for good. (My sexuality provided a convenient route to escape -- it is illegal to be gay in India, and when I came out to my mum, she was immediately accepting and supportive, which I'm still grateful for.) But, over the past few years, I have begun to wonder at the level to which her desire for control would go, especially on the question of money. When I was hospitalised last year, due to severe illness, in the UK, they went behind my back, and asked some of my closest friends, whom they've never met, for money for themselves. She also kept asking my husband for money and gifts behind my back, but always justified it by saying she was doing it for our sake, and that all her assets would eventually be passed down to us, after all. 

My parents have always left me dozens of missed calls at all times of the day, tonnes of texts and e-mails, and I cannot go anywhere, or begin anything significant, without seeing them on Skype and getting their ""blessings."" (I don't believe in god, but don't begrude them their beliefs.) But I attributed these behaviours to their culture, rather than just them. However, this past year, their behaviour was so painful and hurtful to the point that I often went for weeks without speaking to them, which was rather unusual for me.

I think the peak of the crisis was this summer, when my heart, and my love for my mother, broke, so to speak. When my husband and I visited her in India, I went into a deep decline, psychologically speaking, and began to feel suicidal. (I always hated going to India since my move to the UK. A part of me died, every time. And I am beginning to understand why.) My parents live in a studio, next to a slum, and would not have us stay anywhere else, despite our requests otherwise, and so, when I was so ill, I could not but tell them, and seek consolation in people of whom I believed the best. But, to my absolute horror, my mum turned it into an opportunity to fight with her husband -- jobless now for nearly a decade -- and staged a suicide attempt. She cut her wrists (very mildly, just enough to cause small, but insignificant bleeding), and swallowed four strong pills of benzodiazepines (not more). She claimed she had swallowed ten, but when my husband went to call the ambulance, she came clean. My father just stood there, doing nothing. Then, I had a flashback: she had used suicide threats against her husband several times before, and used it to draw sympathy from me. She would also tell me that if she died, my father would ruin my life. 

My husband and I were horrified. Having lost friends to suicide, and having been depressed enough to want to kill myself, I knew the nature of suicide. This was not a suicidal woman. This was an elaborate threat, designed for attention. Feeling no longer safe there, my husband and I returned to America a day later.

But, before we left, my parents acted as if nothing had happened. They both continued to ask me for money, asked me to get a high-paying job so that I could send them a monthly stipend, and again, asked my husband for gifts, behind my back. When I confronted my mum about her suicide threat, she blamed it on me, asking me how could she act otherwise if I confessed to feeling suicidal. Without me, she said, she had no life. I believed her. I thought I was in the wrong, that I had been selfish. It was only in hindsight that I realised, there was a difference between feeling suicidal, and threatening suicide. I never have done the latter.

Since we came back to the US, I've been LC with my parents. I've been in the hospital, receiving treatment. My husband kept them informed. However, they soon started sending him texts, accusing us both of selfishness, and not caring for them, because we didn't call them. When I wrote to them later, explaining that I needed some time and space to recover, I got some very passive aggressive responses, accusing me of being hurtful, and ungrateful. When I threatened to cut off communication, they threatened severing all contact, and then, three days later, followed it with another text, saying my mum was dying, and that if I wanted to see her alive, I had to come on Skype. 

There is a lot more to say, and I haven't the heart or the energy to say it. Such as: how I'd been confined all my life to the four walls of my apartment, how I was always asked to fulfill all the emotional needs of my mother, how I was responsible for all health, happiness and meaning in her life, how I have lived the first twenty years of my life for them, how they still tell everyone that I'm a doctor (and not a writer), how once my father hit me, and burnt my thighs, as punishment, and how, my mum, who thinks she has divine powers, always maintained that all my accomplishments in life were as a result of her prayers and blessings, more than any effort on my part. I could go on. But I cannot.

So, three days short of my birthday, and with help from an accomplished psychiatrist, I'm thinking of going No-Contact with them. My husband is very supportive, and thinks it the right thing to do, as do a few of my friends. But having believed, until this summer, the best of my mother, I'm finding it indescribably hard. I ""know"" it's the right thing to do. But the image of my mother's sad face, the fear that they might kill or hurt themselves, the fact that my mum did suffer on account of her marriage, the very possibility that the past thirty years could all come down to this,  suffocate me with guilt and misery, and I'm struggling to cope. I'm very tempted to just talk to them, and try to reason things out. But I know that they will never admit to any wrong-doing, and that, sooner or later, things will only get worse. In fact, such is my fear of reprisals from them, that I have blocked them on e-mail and Skype, and have changed my mobile number.

Over the past few days, I have composed a long letter to my parents, which explains how much I still care for them, but, declaring that I'm going no contact with them for a while, outling the reasons why I feel I must do so. I also have outlined the non-negotiable terms under which any future contact might be possible -- provided that I initiate it, at a time of my choosing. If they violate the terms, I have said, I will not talk to them ever again. The problem is, I need to translate the letter into my mother tongue, so they'd understand, and if writing the letter was hard enough, and nearly destroyed me, translating it is going to be that much harder. I'm also not sure if this is the best way to go NC.

So, fellow sufferers, am I doing the right thing? Is this the right way to do it? Is there a better way? Am I being a selfish or ungrateful son, even though I've always taken care of them, as much as I could? Am I the victim of abuse? Could it be possible that my mum and dad never really loved me, and used love as a means to validate their own lives? If so, how do you deal with the insufferable feelings of guilt and torment? All thoughts, suggestions, advice would be welcome. I also wish I could post my letter to my parents here. Alas, it is a bit too long. (If links to a Google Doc is permitted, I'd be happy to do so.) But, if, as I hope with this post, it would give comfort or help to others as well as myself, I should only be too glad to do so. 

I look forward to hearing from you all. Apologies for this long message.

Ever yours,
T.M. 

P.S. (1) Thank you so much, to all of you, for such supportive and understanding responses. I cannot tell you how comforting and helpful it has been to read all of your messages.

(2) And, here, my NC letter: https://redd.it/79s9u3"

Today I would love to do a romantic Roleplay with another woman. I was thinking I could be maybe a young big shot at a fashion magazine and you either my intern or just someone under me.

How our relationship starts is open, I could be married in this Roleplay and we have to sneak around my husbands back, maybe he wants me to introduce you to him, or maybe I’m just a young woman who is single and looking for love.

My kinks are light bondage, pet play, reluctantly having sex, transformation (not always physical, just you changing my mind, and personality), d/s, lingerie, spanking, public.

My limits are, animals, bathroom stuff, and extreme pain like cutting and open wounds

I’d prefer women for this, and if any guys want to play as women that’s fine, just don’t tell me you are a guy. Also I could be convinced on letting a guy play if he is committed and shows me why I should play with him."

You, as the title states are a rich CEO, of hotel and cruise line chain..your married, but not happy, you see you married your highschool sweetheart, and sure you loved her once but now, you just dont. 
You started messing around with your interns and assitants to fill the empty void then you find your next victim....me, shy innocent and petit, the complete oposite of you.
You feel odly attracted to me, and i to you, but i never give in to your attempts of getting me, until i do...but this time its not just a quick fuck to you, its something more,you think you love me, and i feel the same to you,except one thing other then your wife and my age (18...youll be 27) is keeping us apart.. your my fathers best friend.
I also want to maybe incorporate something along the lines of us being together non officially, but you still being possesive..then having me walk into yojr office, catching you in the act of a sexual deed with another one of your workers..her saying rude things to me and you agreeing and saying them as well.

So basically paradise in hell daddy❤.

79iixb,8,2017-10-29,Should I give up and be happy where I am?,ru_tang_clan,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/79iixb/should_i_give_up_and_be_happy_where_i_am/,"Hi, OK so trying to decide if I should keep working towards my ""goal weight"" or just be happy with where I am.

Background - I am a 5'7'' female, late 20s, and my current weight is 128 or so. I'm not super curvy - I tend to carry all my extra body fat in my tummy. 

For most of my teens and early 20s, I weighed between 125 and 130ish and was always pretty ok with it. I was envious of skinnier girls with flat stomachs, but I was OK with where I was. I overall liked the way I looked.

A few years ago, I developed some bad habits and gained a lot of weight really quickly - at my highest I was about 145. The extra weight really made a difference, I hated how I looked, and I got serious about CICO after about a year of being unhappy.

It went great - I lost 25 pounds in about 8 months. For the first time in my adult life, my weight was between 118 and 120 for about a year. I LOVED my body for the first time. I wore clothes I never could wear before. I felt amazing. I loved loved loved it.

Then, a little over a year ago, I had a summer internship that involved a lot of eating and drinking, and I gained about 10 pounds. I've been trying to lose that weight since. I've been unsuccessful because I've been bad at sticking to CICO - I get drunk or stoned and eat an insane amount of food like twice a week, I always say it's not going to happen but then it always ends up happening, it's also partly because I hang out with different people now than I used to and they're always down for late night food / ice cream etc.

So two things:

1. It's weird, but I was always happy being about 128 before, but now I *hate* it. I feel so fat. I can't wear any of the cute clothes I used to fit into. I started crying the other day getting dressed to go to a dinner because I felt so fat in everything. I just hate the way I look now. It's like I got used to being so skinny, and I loved it, and I'm so devastated to have lost it so quickly. Like I was so happy with how I looked, for the first time I loved the way I looked and had the type of body I never thought I could have, and I'm so mad at myself for fucking it up, and for being *so bad* at getting back to my old weight. 

2. Should I give up and just learn to like being 128 again? I had an eating disorder when I was younger (like 13), and I'm kind of nervous about getting into that zone again - like I know I'm irrational, and I look fine, but when I look in the mirror all I can see is fat. 

I'm thinking about going cold turkey, no alcohol or weed until I get back to 120, but I guess I'm also wondering if it's worth it, like if I'm being unhealthy mentally here or what. 

IDK, sorry this is incoherent, I'm just so tired of hating my body and struggling. Thank you in advance!

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who responded. I think I am going to take a break from trying to eat at a deficit, but also take a break from drinking and smoking so much. I think I'm going to try to check in with a counselor or something - I know the way I feel about how my body looks right now is not healthy, and I want to try to get a handle on it. I'm also going to try to focus on improving my weight lifting and yoga, and generally try to appreciate my body more for what it's capable of than what I think it looks like right now. I also think eventually I'll probably focus more on body recomp than getting back to 120 or so. Thank you again everyone for your help and kindness."
79iyyi,14,2017-10-29,Not finding a girlfriend is the least of my problems,littlefe11a,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/79iyyi/not_finding_a_girlfriend_is_the_least_of_my/,"Been a lurker for the past few months, and I wanted to get my situation out there.

 
19 years old, go to an average college, asian male. I am both overweight(155lb) and short(5'4''). And I am ugly as sin, very squinty eyes and super pudgy face. I've always been this way, and due to the constant bullying and harassment I faced in middle and high school, I've developed a notable degree of anxiety. Never had a girlfriend, of course.

&amp;nbsp;

I have only two things possibly going for me, one is I have always been told I'm smart for my age, and always did well in school. Unfortunately, since I never did any extracurriculars, and I did terribly at the higher ranked college interviews, I ended up at a worst college than my older brother and sister (who were academically less inclined, I might add). The other advantage is a relatively wealthy and generous family, which I should very thankful for. But there's where the real problem comes in.

&amp;nbsp;

I am definitely not alone in being physically disadvantaged. Hell, I should probably be thankful for my current situation, with my parents paying for my tuition and wellbeing, and my not being inflicted with any painful or debilitating illnesses (just poor eyesight). And if that were then end of the story, I think I would be okay with it, and learn to accept myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

What possibly makes my situation different are my siblings. My older and younger brothers are both much thinner than I am, and both 5'10'' or over. And much, much better looking, I swear they could be KPop or JPop stars (younger brother dyes his hair too, which would look so silly on me but anything works on him). My sister isn't ugly like I am either. Their grades may have been worst than mine, but it was always a marginal difference, and they were always more active in sports, more popular, etc. My older brother bullied me quite a bit growing up, of course, along with the rest of the school. And when we visited family, everybody would point out how much thinner, taller, and more handsome my younger brother was becoming. They are always heaping praise, telling him he could be anything he wants to, while ignoring me (This especially annoyed me, since he did absolutely nothing to look the way he does). They also like to ask why I'm the same height as my sister, but the same weight as my brothers, which I try to make a joke of when it comes up (they laugh, but not at the joke). My parents are actually the worst offenders, if ever I get on their nerves for some reason, they eventually resort to pointing out my physical inadequacies. Whenever I'm near my siblings I am constantly reminded of my those shortcomings, even by strangers (""You're the OLDER brother?"" or ""You're related to them?""). And most of all the subconscious pity, once the truth gets out, of EVERYBODY WE HAVE EVER MET. It's so clear how much better my siblings' first impressions are than my own. It's humiliating. 

&amp;nbsp;

All of this has made me very insecure about my being, and getting into a worst school than my siblings despite my better grades has confirmed to me the idea that life is just random and unfair. One must do the best with the hand he or she is dealt, and I have been dealt an unplayable hand. Ugly, short, fat, unsociable, and anxious amongst a family of overachievers who are the picture of perfection. Upon coming here, I completely lost my drive to compensate for my inadequacies with hard work, and have just been lazing around, getting by. It's never really paid off in the past, after all. Since my school isn't as difficult as my siblings', I'm still doing quite well. But I haven't been planning for the future, not looking for internships or anything. No dreams or goals. Not even hobbies, really. 


Sorry I rambled on for so long, I needed to tell somebody how I felt about this. And I was wondering if any of you guys had a similar situation.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - I am ugly, short, and fat in a family of good looking, tall, and thin siblings. And everyone brings it up. And it sucks. So much :(. Also kind of lost my motivation to work because of it, since I couldn't care less about my grades or my future job right now. "
79j14o,5,2017-10-29,[ROLEPLAY] Heineken: Open Your World,ANazaryan,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/79j14o/roleplay_heineken_open_your_world/,"### March 6th 2017, Stotton-on-Sea

There was a town and it was called Stotton-on-Sea and it smelled of sea salt and brine from the ocean spray and it smelled of lumber from the lumberyards which were filled with working men and lumberjacks who felled the oak and sycamore trees which grew in the forests being ever pushed back on its borders and whose branches have shadowed more crime than any single lifetime could bear witness to or perpetrate. 

This forest which had once housed the wild boar and deer that had, alongside fish, fed the community in its adolescence and which now is the domain of little more than an otter or badger provides the building materials for the houses in the town which over time had become transatlantic replicas of the Suburbia to be found in the American nation and whose style had abandoned any English or European architectural roots and which were generally uniform and painted one of several particular pastel colours that had been approved by the council. In one of these homes there is a man whose name is John MacLachlan. His business is hardware supplies and farming equipment which has allowed him to enter into relative prosperity when compared to his forebears, including his father who had been a permanently temporarily impoverished handyman and general ne’er do well and his grandfather who had belonged to a brotherhood which formed the advance guard of all canaries fluttering down into a condemned mineshaft and with these increased circumstances he had kept his wife housed and sent his eldest son off to be the first representative of the noble clan MacLachlan at those lesser higher education institutions established by the Labour governments of the middle of the previous century in order to accommodate an increasingly educated poor and with his job raising a younger generation done, settled into something approaching a retirement. 

There was a day in the year’s youth when he had noticed the grass on his lawn growing free and wild after he had dropped the keys to his Lexus into the thick of it and he had resolved to condemn this period of growth to hell and perform something approaching ethnic cleansing on the grasses on his lawn and while doing this he had suffered a heart attack as men of a certain age and build are wont to do and his wife had summoned in order, his lawyer, an ambulance, and his eldest boy who was called Dale.

When Dale MacLachlan arrived in Stotton-on-Sea by train almost a week had elapsed since the hospitalization of his father and the elder MacLachlan’s health had not improved by a considerable amount since then and in some areas it may have regressed and weakened him. He was strapped up to various wires and machines connected to his arms, chest, and neck like they were vines or rope holding him back and the bed was arranged with both rails up so that he could not fall out of the bed and an emergency alarm was pressed tightly into his grasp in case he should drop it and sweet waters and biscuits and jellies had been left out for him to eat if he had the strength but much like a dying animal eating was no longer either concern or instinct for him. Dale and his mother and his aunt were there at his side and although Dale had just arrived both of the woman had been ensconced in the hospital for the entire week in case further tragedy befell their family. The hospital’s resident physician who was a poorly aging man by the name of Harry Gomez and who had long been the family doctor flung apart the curtains surrounding John’s bed with much aplomb and little regard for privacy and exposed the family to the well-lit, and sterile and crowded ward. He had on a standard white overcoat that was clearly too big for his slight build and a warm smile.

**DR. GOMEZ:** Hello Dale. 

**MACLACHLAN:** Hello, Doctor Gomez...what can you tell me? How’s he doing?

**DR. GOMEZ:** How’s who doing? Oh, right, your father, well, you know how these things go. Say, though, Dale, haven’t you been due for a physical for sometime? Why don’t you throw on this here robe and lie down over there? It’ll only take a few minutes. Don’t worry, I made sure to warm up my hands before, since you complained about how clammy they were last time.

**MACLACHLAN:** Oh, Doctor, I don’t think that’s necess-

**DR. GOMEZ:** With all due respect, young man, which one of us attended medical school in London? I think I know a thing or too more about the sort of… changes that a young man’s body undergoes than you do. Did you know that a new study out of Oxford says the recommended age for a prostate exam is actually 20 as opposed to 50? If this old man’s memory serves, I believe you’re coming up on the “2-0” yourself. 

**MACLACHLAN:** Well, if that’s the case...you can never be too safe, Doctor, and this is routine medical practice. Alright, sign me up.

At this point Mrs. MacLachlan began to show signs of concern that Doctor Gomez’s behavior was veering off in a less-than-professional direction, and interjected on behalf of young Dale’s safety and for the common morality of the room.

**MRS. MACLACHLAN:** Oh, Doctor, surely this can wait till his own, scheduled visit? 

**DR. GOMEZ:** That was my initial prognosis too, ma’am, but you know that prostate cancer’s a real killer. Now, Dale, if you’d like a moment to… loosen up a bit, that’s perfectly acceptable. I understand totally. 

**AUNT BARBARA:** Oh, for Christ’s sake, I can’t bare to watch anymore of this...

As if by the sole intervention of the God of the Christians - who all gathered in the room had dealings with on their own personal time in the Anglican church, out on the so-called Thunder Road which had been named both for the Bruce Springsteen song and for the punishment it sustained in the Great Storm of 1987, and which had been the first structure built in the town in the 1400s and which was most recently renovated under the leadership of a Reverend Paul Brown who had the great misfortune of later being one of the casualties in the fondly remembered Swine Flu epidemic in the late 2000s - the elder MacLachlan rattled out one haggered sentence which caught the attention of the entire room.

**JOHN:** Dale, my boy, is that you…?

**MACLACHLAN:** Yes, dad. I haven’t been at university for *that* long. Well, it looks they’ve got you strapped in there real good. 

**JOHN:** Uh-huh.

**MACLACHLAN:** You hangin’ in there?

**JOHN:** Uh-huh.

It seemed John was quite moved by his son’s being there and like twin geysers his eyes welled with that salty, natural lubricant we all know as tears. It had been some time since John MacLachlan had cried, reportedly the first time that he had done so since all of his foreign workers decided to leave thanks to his ardent support of Vote Leave in the Brexit referendum and the sight was was disquieting to all present. Before Dale was able to stave off the cascade of tears his father reached for his hand and brought it close to his chest. It was clear by the strain in his voice that he was fighting immense pain to form even the simplest of phrases. 

**JOHN:** It’s good to have you back, my boy..

**MACLACHLAN:** It’s good to be back, dad. Hey...it’s good to be back.

In the days immediately following his arrival in Stotton-on-Sea and that emotionally-charged visit to the hospital, Dale was afforded a great deal of time, perhaps too much time, to think about his father’s condition which by all accounts was worsening. As he walked home one afternoon along a familiar and rudimentary dirt road, he came across an old tool shed that played a major part in his upbringing. He remembered many a summer days spent there with his father, learning the difference between a Phillips and Robertson screwdriver and the many different types of lumber that the forest offered for the taking. His attention was then drawn to a tree stump, upon which sat an old, green Heineken bottle, which was his favourite beer and in his own words “the only beer for all weather and terrain”.  Dale obeyed his first instinct which was to pick up a handful of smoothed pebbles and try his hand at knocking over the bottle, a feat he quickly learned was more difficult than he remembered from his childhood. Bending down to gather up more stones, he was alarmed to find what was instantly recognized as a human ear lying in the grass. The ear was crawling with maggots and black ants and gave off a horrible odor that Dale’s nostrils were wholly ill-prepared for. The severed body part prompted many questions in the young lad’s mind, the most pressing of which being to whom the ear belonged and whether or not this person still roamed the Earth, and the second most pressing being if he could perform any tricks with the ear to ascertain facts about it. What kind of ear was this, for example? What was it interested in? Did the ear have a favourite album, and was it by Chuck Berry? All these poignant questions and dozens more raced through his head as he searched for something with which to corral the decaying ear into the paper bag he had brought his lunch in. Finally finding a twig sizable enough to move the ear Dale hurried off to report his find to the local constable who also happened to be his closest neighbor. 

When MacLachlan arrived at the police station, a large and well-fortified building which was located not a ten minutes’ walk from the greenery where he had found the ear and which had been built on the site of an abandoned orphanage for reasons that were primarily to be summed up as “It’s quite brazen, any spirits or demons will say: Those guys? They got balls”, he almost bounced up the steps such was his great excitement over the news of a detached and rotten ear, and nearly collided into an imposing and thick-bearded individual who was wearing the sharpest suit that he had ever seen in his life, but the man nimbly avoided him and continued on his way.  He headed up to the front desk where Samantha, a girl he had briefly dated in Year 12, was clearly now an intern.

**MACLACHLAN:** Hey Sam, you look great today. Say, who was that guy just then?

**SAMANTHA:** Uh...I think his name was like….William, like, or Winston...or maybe it was Wilfred...and he works for something called like...ISPIED? They’re above even the Feds.

No one had yet informed Samantha that the FBI had no jurisdiction over the United Kingdom.

**MACLACHLAN:** Thanks for your help, Sam, and does Constable Evans still work here?

**SAMANTHA:** How should I know? I only just started working here two days ago, and why are you here, you’re meant to be studying friggen architecture or something and what the hell do you think you’re -

**MACLACHLAN:** Nice seeing you again, bye!

Although Dale’s comments may have seemed flippant, in reality they were entirely earnest, and he was constitutionally incapable of sarcasm. With his ex of no use, our would-be detective decided to find the Constable on his own, and such was his eagerness to show the constable his discovery and his good natured way that God once again intervened and made it so that MacLachlan instantly came upon Room 237 which was marked with a sign that read “Constable Evans.” The room however was vacant and the constable was nowhere to be found. Seconds later though a man in a tweed overcoat who we could only assume was Evans rounded the corner with a stack of documents under his arm. 

**MACLACHLAN:** Excuse me, sir, are you Constable Evans?

**EVANS:** Yes. And you are?

**MACLACHLAN:** Dale MacLachlan, sir. I don’t think we’ve met for quite a while, but I remember one time I was standing on the street and a woman came running out of your house completely naked, and your wife was chasing her with a pan, and you were trying to -

**EVANS:** Yes, I get the picture, Dale. My, you’re barely recognizable these days. How’s your old man doing? I understand he’s in the hospital. 

**MACLACHLAN:** He’s doing alright, I guess. I hope so. They’re actually running tests on him now, that’s why I’m home, and they were going to run tests on me. Have you been for your routine prostate exam, yet? The doctors say it’s the key to health and safety.

**EVANS:** A prostate exam at your age? Does this quack you call a doctor know you can’t be much older than 20? I’m not even 50 and I still haven’t gone in for mine. Dale, I think you might need to consider looking into a different physician. 

**MACLACHLAN:** Well...he’s been the family doctor for a real long time. I’ll admit it was a little weird when he insisted on it right then and there. Whatever, I have something more important to show you. You see I was walking along the green from the hospital to my house and I found a real severed human ear inside a beer bottle. It was a Heineken, too. You ever had one of those? My dad tells me they’re from Holland but the packaging says the Netherlands, real good beer either way, though, I think. I remember my first Heineken like it was just yesterd-

**EVANS:** I don’t mean to cut you off, son, but I need you tell me about this ear. You mean to tell me you found a human ear out in that field?

**MACLACHLAN:** That’s right, sir, a human ear. I’ve got it right here with me in this bag. I figured I should bring it to you. It’s a real shame, though, because I completely lost my appetite and my Aunt Barbara packed me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch. Now I can’t even think of eating my Jiffy! Well, anyway, enough about that, like I said, I thought it best to bring it down here and see what our boys in blue thought about it.

**EVANS:** You figured right. Let’s take a look at it, then.

Dale carefully opened the brown paper bag, emitting that foul stench into the room and letting the constable take a look inside.

**EVANS:** That sure looks like a human ear, alright. Oh God...you never forget your first ear, son...let’s run this down to the boys at the coroner’s office and see what they make of this, and then you’ve got to show me exactly where you found this, son, understand?

Dale nodded.

The coroner’s office was notorious for attracting those sort of people who preferred their sexual partners to be in a less responsive state and the man Evans had given the ear to did not seem to contradict that stereotype. Three such corpses were out laid out on tables in plain view where they were being worked on by masked doctors. One, a rotund East Asian, was halfway through the process of being sliced open and dissected when the ear arrived, demanding the full attention of the coroner’s office’s entire staff. In another corner was the cadaver of a crusty, old fisherman who had washed up on shore three days prior with an entire colony of barnacles found to be thriving in his many orifices, while the final corpse belonged to a college-aged girl who was found with a living moth cocoon lodged in her throat. As the men stood around a large, metallic bowl that housed the decaying part, the coroner explained to the best of his ability what an ear might mean for the person off which it had been removed.  

**CORONER:** These tests will take sometime. Meanwhile I’ll have someone comb through the morgue records, but I don’t remember any bodies coming in minus an ear. 

The coroner turned to face Dale. 

**CORONER:** Now, a jaw or, say, a heart, might well indicate a dead person, but an ear or finger could just have easily come off someone still living. That is to say, we can’t really determine much based solely on the ear until the tests come back in. 

**MACLACHLAN:** What can we tell about the person from those tests?

**CORONER:** Quite a lot, actually. Sex, blood type, race, stomach contents, sexual history, really everything that’s relevant we’ll be able to find out once we run those tests. What I can tell you right now, though, is that this ear was definitely cut off by being worn down by dental floss over the course of several months. 

**MACLACHLAN:** Sometimes, the truth can be more outlandish than even the most fantastical novel.

**EVANS:** Come on, Dale, let’s go see where you found this.

**CORONER:** Before you go, can I interest you fellas in some coffee?

**MACLACHLAN:** No thanks, I’m more of a tea guy myself. A nice smooth cup of Punjana or even an Earl Gray is all you need in life.

As promised Dale through a roundabout way in which he took several detours to engage in father-son activities with Evans like crazy golf or eating ice cream together eventually took the constable where he had found the ear and a team of investigators promptly sectioned off the field with obnoxious, bright yellow caution tape until it began to resemble the set of one of the countless police procedurals with an acronym in their name that Hollywood continuously churned out, probably starring an ensemble cast that included Ice Cube, Ice T or perhaps both, preferably both. The crime scene was teeming with uniformed police whose main job it was to prevent the “Lügenpresse” as they were so affectionately known in the precinct from reporting on this bizarre matter. A police photographer was also present to take pictures of the scene, especially around where Dale had only hours ago stumbled upon the ear in question. As the local police carried out their duties, Evans took Dale aside for a moment. 

**EVANS:** Now, Dale, I know you’re a smart young lad, but I should remind you that we aren’t very keen on having the press catch wind of this, and it’d be best if you kept this whole thing strictly confidential. I’ll say again, don’t discuss this with anyone but myself or other law enforcement officials. Understood?

**MACLACHLAN:** Yes, sir. Thanks for letting me in on this much, anyway...I was wondering if I might take the ear home, to investigate it in my own time.

**EVANS:** No, son. No can do. I can drive you home, though. After all, it is on my way home. 

**MACLACHLAN:** Sounds good, chief. I call shotgun, though!

**EVANS:** There’s no one else in the ca- you know what, sure, Dale, I’ll let you ride shotgun this time since you’ve been such an incredible help to the department today. In fact, I’ve been talking to my buddies and we’re thinking of making you an honorable deputy. Would you like that?

**MACLACHLAN:** Oh, boy, would I ever! Does that mean I get to wear a badge?

**EVANS:** Sure does. 

**MACLACHLAN:** Sweet! Let’s ride, commissar! 

The constable and his newly-appointed deputy then took to finding Evans’ pristine police cruiser and hopped in Dukes of Hazzard-style. Once they settled into the comfortable, leather-clad interior Evans flipped on the car’s radio which began playing Roy Orbison’s hit “[I Drove All Night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5N9IHqqGcA)”

*I had to escape*

*The city was sticky and cruel*

*Maybe I should have called you first*

*But I was dying to get to you*

*I was dreaming while I drove the long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah*

*Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide*

*This fever for you was just burning me up inside*

*I drove all night to get to you*

*Is that all right?*

*I drove all night, crept in your room*

*Woke you from your sleep to make love to you*

*Is that all right?*

*I drove all night…*

79jdlp,23,2017-10-29,A press reference to Mishicot in Nov 2005 and some other tidbits about TP,hollieluluboo,TickTockManitowoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TickTockManitowoc/comments/79jdlp/a_press_reference_to_mishicot_in_nov_2005_and/,"&gt; The sheriff says the Mishicot area remains a focal point of the investigation. “This is the last place she is seen alive and seen by somebody, and of course we’re going to be concerned, interested in that area.”

This was taken from a WBAY2 broadcast or release. I don't have the exact date - I got it from another website that re-reported it on 8th Nov 2005.

I wonder if they were concentrating on Mishicot because of the car sighting being reported to AC? It seems odd they would say Mishicot and not Two Rivers or Gibson if they were referring to the area around the salvage yard.

There was also another headline quote:
&gt; Sheriff says Steven Avery may be among last to see missing woman

but the link to this was broken or the webpage was gone.

Then there was this:
&gt;Tom Pearce of Pearce Photography is proud to announce the addition to our staff, Teresa Halbach, as a photographer. 
She brings her own fresh approach to Tom's innovative style. In the world of photography, we believe that two creative minds are better than one. At Pearce Photography, we're certain that you'll be happy with either Tom or Teresa for your photographic experience. We invite you to read more about us here or stop by the studio to meet us personally.
Teresa Halbach graduated from the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay in 2002 with summa cum laude honors. While studying photography, she worked as an assistant manager and photographer at a local studio, where she photographed mostly children and families. She accepted an internship with Pearce Photography in her final semester of college, which brought her to stay on as a photographer specializing in children's photography, as well as weddings, families, seniors, etc. She has exhibited her work in the Lawton Gallery at UWGB and has attended numerous photography conferences across the country. To view children's portraits by Teresa, click on CHILDREN.

All the links are broken as Pearce Photography has been dissolved and the website is no longer there. However, I finally got [a screenshot](https://imgur.com/IcY5Z77) of that particular part of the website using the Wayback Machine.

I also found this reference to TP from another young (at the time) female photographer who seems as though she may have been before TH:
&gt; I learned an abundance of knowledge as a photographer's assistant to Tom Pearce; Pearce Studio's, Green Bay

She talks about the business being formed in 1996.

Her website's not very good IMO and it has some pretty weird 'reviews'. Reviews seem to have stopped in 2010 and there have only been a few hundred visitors but there are still photo albums from 2017. She has several email addresses associated with the business, which is quite confusing.

[This](https://imgur.com/S6nVikU) is what's left of the 'glamour' page of TPs website, which I'm sad to say made me giggle a bit. IMO his website is a bit sleazy - the whole thing, not just that page. He goes out of his way throughout his website to chastise other photographers for expanding their technical knowledge and specialising in particular things, sending himself up as the best photographer out there because he does none of this. He sounds as though he had issues with competition being around. Tries to make himself sound artistic but doesn't quite make it, IMO. I work with a LOT of photographers and videographers in my business and if I looked at a website like this one I wouldn't go near them, even though he claims to have won prestigious awards and been 'called upon' to the Whitehouse. The photos are pretty shoddy, he never gives prices and states he will not give prices over the phone. To me, that would shout dodgy geezer and/or precious princess. [This](https://imgur.com/mBguX3e) is what the inside of his studio looked like.

Example:
&gt; Many photographers pride themselves on their technical knowledge.  They immerse themselves in studying the specification of very new lens, camera, filter and gadget that comes onto the market.  There seems to be great comfort and security in attaining such technical knowledge.  But all too often, this is used as a blanket to conceal a lack of creative ability.  Great art grows from the mind, the camera is only the tool.  As are the painters brushes, the sculptors chisels.  They are partial means - but not the way. 

This was an odd statement on his website:
&gt;NOTE: We can mail your our price list through US Postal mail only - not email. Please include your mailing address when contacting us. Thank You! 

I was going over this again:

&gt;TP did say that TH had mentioned to him several odd occurrences while working for the AT magazine. He said TH told him she had some problems with male clients over the summer after the photo shoot; and while filling out paperwork and taking payment, she often was invited into the homes. He said TH said some males become verbally or physically flirtatious offering her drinks, etc. TP said that he had warned her to be careful, being alone and often times in rural areas. TP did say TH had mentioned she had been receiving multiple calls, from an unfamiliar number, to her cell phone recently. The caller would never leave a message. TP said as far as he knew, TH had not answered any of those calls and did not know the caller. TP said he remembered one day her commenting when the phone rang, again the same number, they just called five minutes ago. TP said TH said she did not recognize the number and did not answer.

and thought it was odd that he says TH did not answer calls from numbers she didn't know. As a business, you would always answer them in case it is a potential client, unless it is from a known spam number or harasser.

I can't get any more from his old website at the moment, as the Wayback Machine has decided to go down. Will try again later."

It's come to the point where I am getting jealous when I watch the boys at the bus stop fondle and fuck her before school. 


I, like most fathers, took her virginity at a young age. By the time she was 8, she was already the best cocksucker on the block. At 12 she had her first gangbang that I, as any father would, participated in. Now at 15 she's already the head of both the Cheerleaders and the Orgy Squad. But as much as I adore watching my little girl get her holes filled with cock, I've had a hard time letting her go lately. Sure, Janice usually gives me head with my morning coffee, and I, like everyone else in the office, regularly uses the interns to relieve myself after a rough day, but there's something about having a warm pussy to come home to that I just adore.


I love my daughter and I want her to grow up and fuck all kinds of people, but am I wrong to feel jealous when I see her going down on Miss Richardson from across the street? I've even been thinking about maybe putting a baby in her to get her to spend more time at home.

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

Because of this, I highly recommend you go and [check out the previous seasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/71vtnp/d_playhouse_season_archive/) if you haven't already before moving on to this season, just so you are informed of certain events or people that may be mentioned by others in their bios or in the season write-up.*

Welcome back, simulators of the world! Nearly a month of writing and dealing with school and play rehearsals (woot, I got a part in a local play! :D) I've been busy and juggling changes in scheduling. However, that didn't stop me from getting this season out before the end of the month! I am proud to present the sixth season of Playhouse to you all. This time around, we got thirteen new houseguests. However, one of them is not playing to win. One of them is playing to mess up plans, relationship, and just spread chaos throughout the house for five weeks in order to earn fifty grand. This person is known as The Saboteur, and the other houseguests will have to try and figure out the identity of this Saboteur before they mess up too many plans in the playhouse.

We'll just jump right on into things then! [The simulation for the season is here,](http://brantsteele.net/bigbrother/12/r.php?c=Qkakedgb) and [the write-up of everything is here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xprRv3_smBtBjowXcbsviEV_IqQslMFNlnnoc2Y71UQ/edit?usp=sharing) The bios are down below, and the fan favorite poll is at the bottom of all the bios! With that, go ahead and enjoy the season :D

* Archie Novak, a 30 year old car sales representative from Salem, Oregon (created by MrBitPlayer)

“Hey, nice to get acquainted with you all! My name is Archie, and I work as a car sales representative. I know most of you may think of car salespeople as sleazy or manipulative, but I assure you, I am nothing like that. I just care deeply about helping other people, and want to take the time and effort to make sure they’re comfortable with myself, the company, and the car they end up purchasing. Outside of work, I’m also like this. I always wish to make people feel comfortable in my company, and to be able to trust me as much as I show trust towards them. Women are especially a priority for me--I would never, ever dare to disrespect any woman on this planet. Due to this behavior, I’ve received multiple compliments from people claiming that I’m a modern-day gentleman, to which I have to agree for the most part. I do have my mistakes here and there, though, and I’m working to work out those bumps. I’m here to prove that nice guys don’t always finish last. You can be moral and hold yourself and others to a higher level of respect without manipulating others and still win this game. My gameplan is to show fierce loyalty to others, and see who shows that same amount of loyalty back. From there, I’ll keep myself around the ones that are truly loyal, and run the game with them from there. In a respectful manner, of course. I don’t want to put down my opponents or crush people’s dreams. I want to make this a positive experience for all involved.”

* Chras Engarde, a 24 year old animator from New Haven, Connecticut (created by happykyle1119, who also created the character bio, so thanks for that!)

“Ok now before we go any further, I should probably explain my weird name. My actual first name is, well, kinda embarrassing. I would prefer not to tell anyone on camera, or on the show. So I go by my last name, Chras. The last name I go by, Engarde, is actually my mom’s maiden name. I am an animator and I love my job. I loved anime and cartoons at a young age, and have obsessed over art, animation and script writing forever. I have always wanted to compete on this show, the whole concept in my opinion is awesome. My strategic plan is to try and form an alliance between me and one other person to put all my trust in. I will never form an alliance with a large group, I know I will get betrayed eventually. I’m very social despite my personality, I don't know why I find it weird. Probably because I'm really weird. I will literally start singing vocaloid songs and dancing for no reason. I think I can do well if I put my mind to it. So, please root for me for season six!”

* Christine ‘Chrissy’ Waker, a 19 year old rock band drummer from Detroit, Michigan (created by FrieNads)

“Where the hell were my drumsticks, you fuckers!? I didn’t see them in my luggage, and we’re entering the house in just a few hours, so you give them back or find out where they went or I swear to god...oh, shit, is the interview starting already? Eh, fuck it, leave that part in. I don’t wanna have to go through four or five takes trying to start up this thing. I mean, when our rock band has to record the same song more than twice, I get pissy, and we typically have to record like eight or nine times all because Harrison decided to have another god damn soda and burped into the microphone again. Okay, so, my name is Chrissy. People say I’m a very chaotic and rebellious person. I tell ‘em that’s one hell of an understatement. When I was seven, I beat up three kids that were harassing me for lunch money, all of them three or four years older than me. The worst injuries one of ‘em had was a broken arm and ankle. When I was thirteen, I set my eighth grade teacher’s car on fire because he wouldn’t let me do extra credit work to try and salvage my piss-poor grade. Got to spend a few solid nights in jail after that. When I was sixteen, I finally had enough of my family and ran away from home, dropped school, and lived with my older cousin until I got kicked out by his ass. Now, I live with my rock band. Rock music is the only thing I care about, aside from the band and my girlfriend, who’s the lead singer of said band. Anyways, about this game. I’m here to win this bitch. I don’t care who I piss off or how many people I gotta betray, that money is mine and mine alone. Better hope nobody stands in my way, or else they’ll wish they never messed with me.”

* Diamond Syre, a 47 year old stay-at-home mom from Knoxville, Tennessee (created by FuyuhikoFan4Ever)

“Hey everyone, Diamond here! I may not be very recognizable, due to my hair darkening over time, but I’m sure some of you have seen me before. I’ve played in Drama House twice before! Would’ve been three times, but...eh, we won’t talk about that disappointment. So yea, I know that there’ve already been two other Drama House contestants on this show in the past, and surprisingly Lars did much better than Rebecca in his season somehow. That guy is just one big douche, I tell ya...I’m getting off topic here though. I’m a more physical player in my previous experience on Drama House, and I plan on using that same type of gameplay to propel me deep into the game here. I’ve never been too good with forming deep social bonds or strategizing, so maybe finding a solid ally to help me out with that could benefit my game. Let’s be real though, competition wins are really the only thing that matter in this game. If you have power, you get what you want. It’s as simple as that, and my strategy will be likewise. Hopefully I can place better than Lars did, or at the very least, better than Rebecca!”

* Edgarus Abrion, a 21 year old YouTuber from Chestertown, Maryland (created by Nahuelfire39)

“Good morning, afternoon, evening, or night; pick the one that applies to you. Welcome back to another episode of Critical Review with Abrarus...is what I would say if I was opening another episode of my YouTube series. Yes, I am Abrarus on YouTube, but in this house, I’ll simply go by my real name: Edgarus Abrion. Admittedly, I don’t make a full living off of just my webseries, but I do make a good portion of my profit from it. So much so that I only have to work four hour shifts three or four days a week to compensate. I’ve always been told, ever since I was a young adult, that I am an excellent critic. It’s just a skill that’s always been with me. I use this in my day to day life by criticising movies, books, other YouTubers, and various other forms of entertainment that people love to consume,but don’t always think too intensely about. However, this skill will also prove very useful in this game: I’ll be able to properly assess other competitors, no matter how many layers of false behavior they use to hide their true colors. I don’t want to be a leader of any sorts, but rather an advisor, someone who’ll help out another by using my advice for others to judge who to trust, and who to evict. I’m mainly playing for just the fame and publicity to gather new followers for my channel, and also to meet new people and test out my assessment skills once more, but this time in a more competitive environment. I do believe I’ll succeed, but there are a lot of unknown factors that could stop me.”

* Fabian Altulli, a 27 year old waiter from Rolling Hills, California (created by me)

“I’m not even gonna try to hide this, I’ll straight up say it to everybody watching right now: I got onto this show by scamming money from the casting producers of this show. Heh, yeah, sounds like one heck of a story right? So, long story short, one day I was working my waitering job as usual and there were three casting producers for this show talking to one another over lunch about how to find a person to fill the role of the Saboteur or whatever, ‘cause that’s the twist of the season I guess. I’ve never heard of this show before, so I didn’t give a damn what they were talking about, but I knew if they were part of a production team of a TV show then they’re probably pretty wealthy. So, I scammed ‘em. When they asked for the bill, they gave me their credit cards, and I replaced their credit cards with expired cards that looked the same. They didn’t notice the difference right away and went on with their business while I took as much money out of their accounts as I could. The next day, the three of them came up to me saying they knew what I did, but that they wouldn’t press charges under one condition: that I play in this little gameshow of theirs as a Saboteur. So here I am, recruited to play by robbing the producers! Haha, the things I get away with sometimes, I tell ya. So yeah, I’m the saboteur! I’m here to screw things up and create chaos for a couple weeks, and if I manage to stick around that whole time, I get rewarded fifty grand. It’s a super good deal, and I hope it works out well for me, ‘cause i don’t have shit for a strategy or whatever. I still haven’t planned what I’m going to do. I’m just gonna go in there and mess things up, I guess. We’ll see how it plays out once I’m in there.”

* Griffin Puck, a 28 year old law intern from Berkeley, California (created by Walrus_Song)

“Hello, I’m Griffin Puck. Remember this name, because it will soon be a legendary one. I’m a law intern for one of the most prestigious law firms in the country, training to become an attorney in a few years time. People tell me that I am ambitious and competitive, and they are correct. They neglect to mention my other abilities, though, such as my eye for detail, my strategic mind, and my subtle manipulation. That last part is probably good they don’t mention, because it tells me they don’t realize they’re being manipulated. I’m in this game for two reasons; one, I wish to compete against worthy opponents in a huge social experiment. Two, I wish to win the title of Champion. While I’m not sure if I’ll have any opponents who can truly be worthy enough to challenge me in any aspect of the game--well, except maybe physical, I could have people beat me in the physical aspect--I’m still determined to fulfill my second reason for being here, which is to win. I’ve already planned out how I’m going to do this. Step one, I’m going to align myself to one person and stay true to that loyalty only. Step two, I’ll manipulate a situation in order to make an eviction go my way, just to test the waters and see if people can perceive my skills or not. Step three, slowly build my influence and create small, but effective deals and bonds with the other competitors--this step won’t occur until the jury phase, mind you, as I’ll have to wait long enough for the competition to whittle down a bit. Step four, use this secure spot to get myself to the end. Step five, present my game to the jury and win against an incompetent gameplayer. I have my plan, and I will ensure that everything happening in this game will revolve around it.”

* Katherine ‘Kathy’ Nevermore, a 32 year old VIP concierge from Los Angeles, California (created by SavedBySkittles)

“My name is Katherine, but you can just call me Kathy for short. I’m a VIP concierge, which means I spend my day surrounding by the rich and the famous! Admittedly, I do envy them a lot. I’ve found a way that I can reach their level, though, and winning this game is the last step in that plan. You see, I’ve managed to get an...abnormally large amount of cash while working in-and-out of this job. If I manage to get to the end of this gameshow and win the half million, then I’ll have reached my goal and truly be set for an early retirement from my job and to fully enjoy the lavish luxuries of the city life. A huge house, fancy cars, a pair of shoes for every day and an outfit to go with them. My perfect life of decadence. Now, you may call me selfish or cheap, or whatever other vain language you typically use to describe someone like me. However, I believe you’d all feel the same way as me if you grew up in an extremely poor family who had to work with filthy, stinky animals and hopeless, dying crops in order to survive in this world. So, don’t be hypocrites, and don’t deny that what I’m doing is just. My plan for victory is to use my social ability to make people feel comfortable around me, to trust me. Lure them in so I can use them to my advantage. I don’t see many problems with this plan, as it’s a strategy I’ve been using in life for a while now, and I’m standing here much better off than I was before. I don’t expect you to respect me, but I do expect you to enjoy my presence in this game. So, have fun watching~”

* Lex Schamane, a 29 year old shaman from Whidbey Island, Washington (created by me)

“We don’t heal in isolation, but in community. That is a quote from Kelley Harrell, a great shaman teacher. A handful of months ago, I meditated on the meaning of that quote, and I realized that I had been isolating myself from my island community by leading a different path in life than them, and meditating by myself most days of the week for hours on end. I felt like I needed to change my daily behavior to an extent, to put myself in a situation where I would have to interact with people and they would have to interact with me as well. I found out about this show doing just that--taking strangers from all over the country, and even the world as there’s been a contestant from Canada and another from France, and forcing them into a house where they must communicate with one another in order to stay within the house for another week. I applied, and I was herded through the casting process at a rapid pace. Here I am now, with my goal being to heal within community rather than isolate myself like I had been before. My strategy for this game will be to follow the orders of the ones currently in power, so that I may maximize my stay in the game. I also plan on using my aura-sensing abilities to judge a person’s character and whether or not I am in a good position amongst my peers. I don’t plan on winning very many competitions if any, as the pursuit for power corrupts one’s soul and intent. I also don’t plan on trying to please everybody, as those who shred away parts of themselves to fit in with others slowly wither away. I’m merely going to continue as I have been before, with the added exception of interacting with the environment around me more often than I had been before.”

* Phillipa ‘Pip’ Quill, a 34 year old policewoman from Columbus, Ohio (created by Rude_Lamb)

“Hello everybody! My name is Phillipa, but my friends just call me Pip for short. I’m a single mother of a lovely five-year-old daughter, and I’m playing this game for her. My ex-husband...he turned out to be gay, long story short, and we divorced after he learned that he had impregnated me. Since then my ex-husband has married another man and they’ve been living well together. I’ve been struggling on my own, though. Worst of all, my daughter spends most of her time over at my ex-husband’s house because I don’t have the money or time to support her as much as I’d like to. So, I’m here for her. I want to win the money to have more time and cash to support the two of us, and have her spend more time with her mother, the one who actually cared about her and didn’t end a marriage over her existence. My plan is to try and stay quiet for the most part. My nickname, Pip, is short for Pipsqueak, because in the force I’m shorter than most other officers and much quieter. When I do speak, my higher-pitch voice surprises people and makes them laugh for not noticing me sooner. This can help me in this game, because if I can hide long enough for the bigger fish to fry themselves, then I’ll be able to jump in towards the end of the game and make a big enough name for myself to take home the title! Hopefully my plans come to fruition, and I hope you all root for me during my time in this season.”

* Ralph ‘Ralphie’ Watterson, a 60 year old diner owner from Chicago, Illinois (created by JackHeadphonious)

“Before I begin, I just want to say one thing: Hey Auntie Ignis! I got casted for the show, and you better bet that I won’t disappoint! Stay safe until I return, okay? Alright, now that that’s out of the way...my name is Ralph Watterson, but I insist everyone just call me Ralphie. Even my diner workers and close friends. As my occupation says, I’m a diner owner. However, owning a diner is much more to me than just having a restaurant. To me, that diner is my child. I’ve never had any actual children, or gotten married for that matter, because I was constantly working as a janitor ever since I was in my late teens just to keep my aunt and I sheltered and to slowly fund money for this diner. I could’ve just taken out a loan, but I didn’t want to do that and then have my business potentially fail. This way, if my business failed or succeeded, it would be on my own money and I wouldn’t have been in debt if it did fail. Thankfully, ever since I opened it on my 40th birthday, it has been increasing in terms of profit, quality, and overall success. It was a long hard battle to work for it, but now that I’ve spent twenty years managing that place, I can safely say that it was a worthy investment of time. I’m here to win the money so that I can retire safely, and leave the restaurant in Rudy’s hands, who is my right-hand-man in terms of running the place. I’ve trained him already on how to run everything and I am very confident in his abilities, now all that’s left is for me to secure my future and end my long journey. I worked hard to get that diner open, and I’ll work just as hard making deep, caring relationships with the people in this house in order to win this game. I don’t expect to be a huge move-maker or power player, but I believe that I can be the winner if I put my best effort into it.”

* Rosalina ‘Rosa’ Mendez, a 30 year old teacher from Houston, Texas (created by griffen128)

“Hello! My name is Rosalina Mendez, or just Rosa for short. And no, future students of mine, you can not call me Rosa in my classroom. It is strictly Ms. Mendez in there. Speaking of which, I’m a history teacher for a living! I just find the past so fun to examine, so much to learn from it. I also just enjoy explaining and teaching concepts and ideas to other people, so I decided to combine the two and pursue a career out of it! High school certainly wasn’t the best place as a teenager, but coming back into it all as a teacher wasn’t as bad as I initially thought it would be. My motive for joining this game is to just give me a fun thing to do over the summer, instead of working a side-job to earn money. My game plan to win is to just be sociable and be around people that I like and balance out with me well. I’ll most likely be looking for a more exciting personality or two to team up with. You all better have fun watching me, because I’m about to school the rest of this competition on how to win this game! I know, bad pun, but I don’t care, I’m just excited to start!”

* Stasia Zhu, a 25 year old retired bounty hunter from Miami, Florida (created by FierceLoxy)

“Uh, hi. My name is Stasia. The job title probably sounds really ridiculous, and believe me, I wish it was just a joke of a job title. Being a bounty hunter...it wasn’t exactly a choice I made, or a choice I was very happy with. I’m not a very, um, aggressive person. I’m just kind of sensitive and afraid sometimes. That’s mostly why I quit. Unfortunately I, uh, haven’t had much luck in finding a new job since then. I live by myself just doing odd little jobs for people here and there, nothing too fancy and just enough to get by. I have been told I have a very accurate aim, um, like when I throw a ball. Maybe I can find some career out of that...apart from that, though, I need cash badly. I also don’t have the time, money, or, um, energy to socialize with others, so I’m playing this game to maybe find some people I get along well with.  My strategy is to just cling to others, really. Not very...honorable, I guess. Don’t think that matters, though, in a game where people just backstab their friends for their own personal benefits and nine times out of ten it doesn’t work out in their favor at the end of it all. I think I can do alright. At the very least I’ll shoot for making the finale, so I can, um, get the runner-up cash prize. That’d be a nice goal for me. Just reaching the end.”

she never tries to make plans or go out with friends. When she does, she always has a good time but she says she only thinks about me and just wants to go home. Her parents have been arguing a lot lately and it puts a lot of stress on her. To add to it all, i will be graduating highschool in January while she still has to finish the rest of the year. Every time we talk about it she gets really upset because she only has two other friends. One of which is also graduating early and the other is doing the work internship class and will only be at school for 4 periods. I have tried finding her a hobby but haven’t been successful. I’m really worried about her. She also has a very low self confidence. I feel so helpless because i have no idea what to do. Her family can’t afford a therapist because her insurance doesn’t cover it. I need advice on what to do and how to help."

I am involved with church, attending more than a few mission trips. I played football first 2 years of highschool, and now am on the rugby team for fun. Also last year i participated in an innovative competition at UTA (university of texas arlington). Idk if it matters but my highschool is decently difficult, ranking 297 in the state of Texas. And i am in a thing called the stem academy, which 120 members of our junior class are in. Also I know 100% fact that if I went to any other highschool in this area, I would be top 5%. I can say with confidence that I am smarter then most kids in top 10% at other schools around me. But I decided to join this STEM program, which classes are substantially more difficult."

Today I would love to do a romantic Roleplay with another woman. I was thinking I could be maybe a young big shot at a fashion magazine and you either my intern or just someone under me.

How our relationship starts is open, I could be married in this Roleplay and we have to sneak around my husbands back, maybe he wants me to introduce you to him, or maybe I’m just a young woman who is single and looking for love.

My kinks are light bondage, pet play, reluctantly having sex, transformation (not always physical, just you changing my mind, and personality), d/s, lingerie, spanking, public.

My limits are, animals, bathroom stuff, and extreme pain like cutting and open wounds

I’d prefer women for this, and if any guys want to play as women that’s fine, just don’t tell me you are a guy. Also I could be convinced on letting a guy play if he is committed and shows me why I should play with him."

This is my first post here as the problem I am facing has only now gotten to the point where I am unable to deal with it myself. I am 22 years old.



I want to just start with some background info:

My mom was diagnosed with liver cancer earlier this year. She is recovering very well thanks to some immunotherapy breakthrough medication and is looking very well.


My sister has always been extremely difficult to interact with. Over the last 6 years she has been verbally abusive to my mother, me and my father who constantly showers her with praise and material goods. She regularly threatens suicide in her tantrums whenever she is confronted and has held a knife to me on multiple counts.


My parents got divorced when I was 13. While my parents do still remain in contact, there is constant tension and my dad seems to have taken a back seat in our lives. I speak with him fairly regularly but my sister blocks him out completely until she has something she needs.



The main story:

I recently graduated university in May this year and I had plans to go to Munich which resulted in me convincing my girlfriend to apply for her masters there. All my plans changed when my mom was told she has 8 months to live.


I came back to my home country and stayed with her, helping her out in her business and trying to be as supportive as possible. This was extremely difficult due to my sister being here for a summer leave from her University. Over the summer I woke up and went to bed hearing horrible things against both my mother and me from my sister.


My girlfriend saw I wasn't doing well, so she came to visit me for 2 months, getting an internship in the business as well. This of course sent my sister into a rage where she constantly picked fights and made my girlfriend's and my life hell. We both toyed with the idea of moving out and mentioned it a few times, but ultimately decided against it as I felt the need to be with my mother. I was basically doing everything for her, even though she still went to work, and did my best to make the infusions and appointments as easy as possible. 


When my girlfriend left back to her own country, vowing that my sister would never be allowed near anything we hold dear, things started to change. My mom, who I have always had a loving and incredible relationship with, started becoming very cold. We would constantly get into arguments about really ridiculous things (which I admit, I should have just kept my mouth shut) and she began catering to my sister completely.


When my sister finally left, I was so relieved... but this was short-lived since my mother and me would constantly get into fights at this point. I heard things such as ""You're a waste"", ""you're unmotivated and lazy"", ""You're not the son I thought you were"" (after eavesdropping on a conversation with a friend of mine) and other things which cut me deep.


When the scans came back showing that my mother was getting 'better than i could have thought' (according to the doctor). I brought up the plans of me moving to Munich again. She was furious, saying that I am abandoning her in her time of need. She constantly said things like 'what did i do to deserve this...' and other things that made me feel guilty for wanting to move out.


From that point on, I kept a little distance. Only talking when I was spoken to and keeping my head down. I began smoking up again (did so quite a bit earlier on in uni) and playing a lot of video games to keep my mind off of it. I even started going out more often (something that I just don't like doing) and getting wasted with my friends. While these things helped, I always felt very detached and in some sort of world where things don't make any sense.


It was after she made me do a visa application for my sister (who i no longer have any contact with) and me complaining today morning about how she is 20 and can't do her own application that she erupted. She told me that I have no right to complain about anything since I am what she sacrificed her last 22 years for as well as telling me that I was the reason that she was stuck in a horrible marriage for. She said I was sick and addicted to games, and that I am a loser.


I have become a very bitter, cynical and angry person over the last few months. I still help her with everything, but I have shut down emotionally towards my mother and since I work with her, things are always extremely tense. I love her very much, but I am finding myself starting a lot of arguments and being very depressed/aggressive lately. I have gotten her to agree to let me go to Munich in January finally, but I really feel like our relationship and all the love that was there is gone.


I really do not know what to do, or if this is the right place to post this. I am just wondering if anyone can give me some insight into the issue and how I should approach this to keep everything as smooth as possible. I have become very emotionally unstable and its beginning to affect my self confidence, happiness and health as I have been losing weight and sleep...


Please let me know if anyone could help me out,

Thank you

I'm a marketing student currently looking for a part time job. I have experience bartending and in retail, but would rather look for something semi-related to my intended field of work. 

I know the obvious answer is internships, but the one I have currently is unpaid and it's looking to be the same situation for next semester. The only entry level p/t marketing interviews I've been on so far ended up being pyramid schemes that couldn't go on my resume even if I took them. Did anyone do something similar in college, or have ideas for what to look for? "
79n56f,1,2017-10-30,My [20 M] girlfriend [21 F] is upset because she's stuck in a place where nothing good ever happens to her,fenderbender265,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79n56f/my_20_m_girlfriend_21_f_is_upset_because_shes/,"So my girlfriend recently graduated college and is currently working in HR. The thing is, she really wants out of the country. She firmly believes that nothing good ever happens to her here and it's hard to argue with the proof.

Her parents always give her a hard time. They always get angry at her for the shallowest of reasons. They also expect her to help out in finances like food for the whole family, even though she earns barely enough to send her six-year-old daughter to school and for her both of their necessities. 

She's also almost always at odds with most of her peers. When she was in school, she had disputes with her classmates, including her thesis partner. She also feuded with who I consider as her closest friend in her class, and it reached the tipping point during their internship together, and that affected her evaluation for the said internship. 

Recently, she also feuded with her roommate whom she works with as well. They disagreed on a lot of things regarding work, and often they also argued whenever they're together in the apartment. It also reached the tipping point when that roommate blatantly looked at my girlfriend's phone and read a message from me that she was entirely convinced was about her. We were talking about her roommate that day, but still, my girlfriend got really upset because her roommate invaded her privacy.

This, amongst other things back in high school, led her to believe that she's incapable of making any friends.

Work is extremely difficult for her too. This is her first job after graduating, and she feels that she isn't learning anything. The only person in HR with her just orders her around, even though he isn't her boss.

She keeps telling me that she'd do anything just to get out of this country and get a job, any job, even completely unrelated to her degree such as a service crew. We have exhausted every resource in trying to find a job abroad for her and still, nothing.

We live in a country where crime is rampant, where people get killed by other people every day, and where it never feels safe to walk anywhere anytime. We keep thinking that it's just a matter of time when it happens to us or to someone close to us.

I don't know if she is depressed, but I can feel that she's lost all hope. She tells me that she feels empty inside and that she has no purpose in life. She keeps telling me that she is unlucky. She feels that nobody appreciates her existence anymore. 

I want to help her so much. I'm trying everything that I can. I've asked for help from my parents who are abroad, but they can't find a job for her either because immigrant worker laws are very strict. I'm still a Junior in college, so my options at helping her are limited.

I don't know what else to do. I love this girl and her daughter so much. I keep telling her that once I graduate I can help her with finances and even finding a job since she would accumulate multiple years of experience by then, increasing her chances to find a job.


But she doesn't want to wait. She has been waiting for the longest time for something good to happen and still, nothing has. It's understandable if she's losing patience, but I don't want to lose her.

Help.

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend feels that nothing good ever happens to her, wants to move out of the country but can't because of lack of job offers and strict foreign labor laws. Feels hopeless and unlucky."

I don’t do drug. The most I’ve touched is weed and prescription narcotics because I needed them. 

In May, we began actually talking about being serious and one night I went to his apartment and he was extremely paranoid as we were walking into his apartment saying you’re going to flip out in a second omg and stuff like that. We get inside and he pulls out $180 worth of cocaine from his pocket. I was pissed and shocked. He said I don’t do this often it’s not a problem and whatever else. I sat there still in shock while he’s doing shit in front of me and said cops were here once over it. I came to my senses and said I need to leave. 

He blew my phone up for days saying I hope I didn’t scare you off, you’re an awesome girl I don’t want to lose that and whatever. In my mind we were done. I began seeing someone else. Nick eventually started blowing my shit up saying get dinner with me I want to talk to you and whatever. I agreed to meet him only if he was clean. He assured me he was. I get to the restaurant and he shows up acting normal. Once I started talking he started saying off the wall shit. I asked him what are you on? You told me you’re clean. He said he wasn’t on anything except for a mood stabilizer and he’s been clean for 3 days. I was irate I said I needed to leave and he made a huge scene in the restaurant - spilled two drinks on himself and flipped out on me for sleeping with someone else. I was absolutely mortified. However he was visibly upset that I told him I’m not going back to his house. He apparently told his parents I was coming to visit and hang out. He said it was fucked up of me to not go say hi to everyone, hang out and watch a movie. I was over it and I went my own way after saying you need help. This is the last I spoke/saw him even though he still made attempts. 

Nick has been completely MIA for over a month. I questioned where he was because he never went that long without sometime of contact. He randomly popped up out of no where. He texted me and he said was in Texas for a 30 day inpatient rehab. He’s going to stay in Texas for 3 months to get himself together and then move back (we live in PA). He asked if I could come and visit him in Texas. I told him no. There’s a million reasons why I said no but here they’re not exactly relevant. My assumption is he’s kind of expecting some type of relationship when he gets back. My guess is probably a serious boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. 

I don’t know his whole motive about going to rehab. I’m not sure if he did it for himself or he did it so I’d be in the picture. Here’s my dilemma. I’m in the process of applying to law school. I hold two government internships one in juvie one beginning in January with probation/parole. For obvious reasons, I can’t get wrapped up in drugs or anyone who does drugs. I’m NOT against being with someone who has had a past. Drugs don’t make you a bad person. I just need to know damn well they’re doing the right things. 

How do you know when someone really wants to be clean and is doing the right things? Do I run or do I stay?"
79pmx8,2,2017-10-30,"Losing faith in humanity, someone please tell me that there are genuine people out there...",kevin129795,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/79pmx8/losing_faith_in_humanity_someone_please_tell_me/,"This is my first time posting on this subreddit, so I hope to introduce myself, why I feel the way I do, and to get help finding a way out of it. 

I've recently graduated college back in May, and since then have been looking for jobs in economic research. I found an internship in DC at the Center for International Private Enterprise that I will be working at from November to the end of February, and will move there in two weeks. Although I have something to look forward too, what happened in between me graduating college and now really hurt, and it's just overwhelming. 

I'll start from the beginning. 
When I was in high school, I didn't really have many friends until my senior year, when I met a great group of guys who I knew cared about me and supported me. There was one guy, in particular, Adam, who actually worked with the therapist who I was seeing at the time, and he was especially genuine and caring and wanted to help me. He and I later had a falling out, but he is still remembered as one person who really cared and was sincere. 

Fast forward to now, and these guys have stopped answering my texts and taking my calls. I hear that they go out sometimes together, and since I've never been invited, I guess they just don't consider inviting me, or did, but decided against it, both of which hurt. They have jobs and are busy, which is understandable as to why they wouldn't answer stuff to a certain extent. I haven't seen them since May, even though I hit them up to hang out once a week to once every two weeks. It seems like they just don't give a shit anymore. If they can't at least take the time to respond, it shows me that they don't consider the time and consideration that I have for them to mean enough to warrant 20 seconds of their attention to respond. I feel really hurt by them, as they say, that they care (the one time that they did respond when I asked them), but it doesn't feel like it if they don't actually do anything. They also say things like ""let's hang out sometime"", or ""I'll make sure to spend time with you,"" and then never follow up on it and never do. It feels insincere and creates false hopes that they really want to spend time with me enough to actually do it. 

This is especially true with one friend, who promised me a trip to Vegas after graduation, that he would visit me one summer when I was in DC, and that he would get a tattoo with me on my birthday, none of which happened. In addition, he would show up 30 mins or more late when we did meet the few times before graduation this year, and the vast majority of the time not respond to my texts showing that he doesn't value my time and he doesn't care. He also told me that he really cares about me, which is a lie and that I'm a great guy. 

There is one bright spot in that there is a friend from college, Tom, who I know is genuine and sincere with what he says, as his actions match what he says he will do, and he is true to his word. He is the only real friend that I have. 

So, I have one friend, now that all my other friends stopped talking to me, and I feel really alone and distrustful and pessimistic about people. I'm tired of people being nice on the surface, only to not follow through with things, say what they don't mean, and who think it's ok to ignore and reject your friends. All I want is two or so friends who I know will be real, and who will say what they mean, and who will be there for me like I would for them. I am willing to give a hell of a lot more than most people and would consider myself a true friend. I just want people to do the same for me. 

The thing is that this cycle has happened about three times before in my life, once in middle school and twice in high school, with different friend groups. With a consistent track record of shitty behavior by people who were supposed to be my friends, I'm starting to lose faith that there are many decent people out there. Sure, I have two examples of that, but much more examples of people disappointing and hurting me. I'm beginning to lose faith in humanity in general and am starting to believe that karma may not be real, and that me being a good person and caring about people won't mean anything, because people don't see it, or they don't care, or they take advantage of it. 

I've been really distraught about this for the past two weeks or so, but it was building ever since I graduated college. It's gotten to the point where I'm throwing up from all the anxiety, and have no appetite to the point where I'm losing about a pound a day. I need to know that people can be sincere and be real, or else I think there is a real possibility that I might kill myself like John did in Brave New World when he couldn't take the drugged out, hedonistic people in the World State.

79q860,0,2017-10-30,Student nurse. Afraid I made a mistake,dot_Ben,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/79q860/student_nurse_afraid_i_made_a_mistake/,"Hey everyone I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this question but here goes nothing.

So I dropped out of college before, I was studying IT at the time.
 I took a year off to see what I do want to study, I did a bunch of internet tests and got help from a group of people who helps clueless students like myself help decide what study/direction in life could be a good choice. I got many ''healthcare'' results.

Fast forward a few months. I'm in college again, studying to be a nurse, or a RN as it would be called in the Americas I'm guessing.
I'm now doing a small one week internship, necessary for our class, the place where we actually do the internship was picked for us by the college, no way to noted a preference. I just got done with my first day of internship where I just look at other nurses doing their job in a housing unit for mentally handicapped seniors.

Long story short, I am terrified. I tried my best to up hold a professional appearance. But as a 21 year old who hasn't ever worked in the healthcare side of jobs, having to see how difficult working with handicapped people is, I am scared. Not so much for just this side of nursing, but in general.

I tried helping myself by googling places to work as a nurse, hoping to find a way to work at a hospital (thus far I think my dream is working as a nurse at a hospital). Just to find that most people looking for nurses in my country (The Netherlands) are looking for nurses for seniors in particular. Which I don't think I like. I just don't think it fits me.

So now I'm scared that I picked the wrong direction in life again and might have to drop out yet again. And I just don't want to put that strain on my parents since they were supportive enough the first time i dropped out.

I wasn't just trying to vent, I guess I'm hoping for some help, I don't know if I'm just psyching myself out or if I really just made the wrong choice of profession.

I hope someone reads this and can give a word or two of advice, or share their experience going from a student nurse to a RN

Thank you"
79r5n6,2,2017-10-30,[22F] Life post-university and self-doubts,Teahconny,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79r5n6/22f_life_postuniversity_and_selfdoubts/,"I don't want to sound like I'm pitying myself but I needed to discuss and share with people who aren't part of my life. I've split post into three sections so you can only read the last one if you don't care that much.

A bit of background: I am from Eastern Europe, I grew up there but never felt like this is my home, I simply didn't fit in.  I was a shy and quiet child, not very popular among the kids at school because I was too serious about studying and had different interests. My parents [63F&amp;60M current age] had a very ugly divorce when I was about 12 years old, my dad cheated on my mom and tried to live off her money and stay home while dating the new woman for about a year prior to the separation so my mom fell into depression. I remember at that time at school kids would often pick up on me because I didn't want to give them my homeworks, help them cheat on exams and I generally annoyed them with my presence. Then after school I'd come home and find my mom crying in the bathroom so I'd have to help her go to bed and take care of her. I don't have other family - my grandma died from cancer when I was 10, my grandpa got hit by a drunk driver when I was 14, my other grandparents died when I was too young to remember them. In high school things became better but I continued to struggle to find people that can relate to me and my dreams. I became very determined to go to a good university abroad hoping that it would help me build a new life away from my past experiences.

University:  I got admitted to a top university in London and my fresher year was amazing - I finally found people who were similar to me and throughout the past three years I made friends I honestly love and wish the best for. Unfortunately in my second year I didn't manage to find an internship, I lost some friends and felt extremely lonely. I became depressed - I still had people who care about me and an amazing boyfriend, but nothing could keep me from feeling lonely and unhappy. In my third year I started going to therapy which didn't improve how I felt. I was missing something - I was so exhausted from London - I felt constantly underperforming - if I was getting good grades - I had no social life, when my social life was good - it felt meaningless, when I was with my boyfriend - I felt I was neglecting my friends. I couldn't keep up with the pressure and the fast paced life of living in a 7million people city where people always do something and never stop.

Now: I graduated with highest honours but I didn't manage to secure a job. I think my mental health affected me so I wanted a break more than to fight to get a competitive position and move to a 9 to 5. As my tenancy expired and I was jobless, I moved back home to Eastern Europe and it's been hell. I don't get along with my mother, I don't have the friend circle I had the past 3 years and I feel so lost, unworthy and like a failure. I don't want to go to back to London because I feel ready to move on and close it as a chapter (I fear I will continue to struggle with the pace and lifestyle there, weather also affects me very badly) and staying home is not an option. My boyfriend[21/M] is in the UK and I miss him very much but he has started his new job and even if I was there, I know he puts his work over us and he wouldn't have more than 2-3 hours a week for me so I cannot base my life on what are his future plans.


I guess my question is how do I believe in myself again? I worry a lot, I want to take care of myself and find my purpose and passion but I'm scared that I'm wasting away my efforts in uni by not just sucking it in and fighting to get a nice graduate scheme as every day it gets too late for that. I've lost my confidence and lost what I stand for. Spent my life dreaming of graduating from a university like this and now I just did it and don't know what's next and do not have any family moral support or love to fall back on as both my parents don't care. I want to start fresh but don't want to be back in 3 years again, complaining about my life again. I have doubts - what if my circumstances weren't that bad as I feel, but it's me that's chronically unhappy and has a negative outlook so changing the environment, won't change my life for better.

Thank you for reading this long post.

79rg5f,5,2017-10-30,Portuguese League,1Warrior4All,warmballersofficial,https://www.reddit.com/r/warmballersofficial/comments/79rg5f/portuguese_league/,"Hi, I'm a portuguese citizen so I will give you some news on the portuguese league this season.

Porto spent nothing, picked the loanees and is now top of the league with the best attack and defense of the league (a tip to Chelsea *cough cough*). They can thank their african trio - Aboubakar, Marega and Brahimi, as well as new manager Sergio Conceiçao, who brough Nantes from relegation zone to 7th place in Ligue 1 last season, and is now proving a successful choice by Porto board. But isn't their squad too short to compete in so many different fronts? Will they survive if one of their attacking gems gets injured?

Benfica, current champions, may be under a bit of an intern crisis, after 4 successful seasons, because they sold almost all their talents and only signed flops like Douglas and Gabigol (ahahah). Also they lost 5-0 to Basel in UCL and are at this moment placed third in the table. Can they reignite the flame and get their shit together? Or will they crumble and wait for next season to come back strong?

Sporting CP are quite competitive this season, trying to put an end to a drought of 15 years without a national title. They also made some great signings like Acuña and Bruno Fernandes. But will Bas Dost scoring prowess be enough to win the title? Will Jorge Jesus coaching abilities crush in the end of the season as usual?

Braga, the forever 4th team of Portugal (no wonder why they are called the Arsenal here), are enjoying a good run, with 5 wins in the 5 last games. They had a rough beginning, losing to Benfica and Porto, but since then they managed to keep an interesting record and are now placed... 4th. They are also having some success in Europa League, having won in Germany to Hoffenheim and at home to Istambul Basakheshir. However, they fail in decisive moments, like against Ludogorets and Porto at home, which might seem they are better but not ready yet for bigger flights...

Surprise team this season: Maritimo, who have 6 wins in 10 games, including a draw against Benfica. Probably the big credit goes to coach Daniel Ramos, who already won manager of the month in september.

What are your thoughts about the portuguese league this season? Do you follow it? Thanks for your attention!"
79rj1p,209,2017-10-30,My [21F] boyfriend's [21M] parents are abusive and I refuse to go back to their home after an incident.,BadMegalovaniaRemix,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79rj1p/my_21f_boyfriends_21m_parents_are_abusive_and_i/,"I mostly need to get this off my chest, I won't lie.

Charlie lives 15-20 minutes away by car. We've been dating 5 months and it used to be my pleasure to drive up there and spend a few nights at his place.

I knew his parents are abusive and scream at him for nothing sometimes, physically assault him and take away his phone and computer. He will be able to get out of there by the end of the school year, when he gets an internship. His plan for the future is to have very limited to absolutely no contact with his shit family.

I tried to make sure his family liked me, and it worked, I always tried to be very agreable and nice to them and since they love keeping up appearances anyway it worked pretty well.

Some time ago, I'm going to guess about 3-4 weeks ago, I was staying over on a sunday evening and I didn't have my car, because a friend of ours would come drive us to school in the morning.

The parents had been away all day, they came home in the evening (pretty drunk actually) and Charlie's little sister [17F] went to complain that we ate too much lasagna or something. Okay, sibling trouble. His parents then proceeded to SEVERELY OVERREACT to dumb sibling trouble by calling him in the kitchen, berating him, and screaming at him. 

He apologized and left me in the room while he went there, told me not to worry too much and this is normal to him, it happens all the time.

So there I was alone in his room, in the dark, absolutely panicked because nothing terrifies me more than people screaming, helpless, alone, in danger and with no way out, because I didn't even have my car there. I had been in this situation before and it went about the same way, I don't know how to really convey how terrified I was.

So I was having one hell of a panic attack and crying like I was actively trying to shoot my eyes out of my sockets, and I hear a bang and louder screaming, so I think they're attacking Charlie and I panic (some more) and go to the kitchen (again, in tears).

I arrive and attempt to say something like ""is everything okay in here""; it comes out as ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??!?"" with a broken tearful, pathetic screamy voice. Obviously I still regret this. It sounds like a bad excuse but I wasn't really in control here.

Next thing I know, Charlie's father, a terrifying motherfucker, is millimeters away from my face, screaming at me so hard I think he actually spluttered on my face. My first instinct was to block him with my arm and push him away as hard as I could (I'm frail) and from there my boyfriend finished the job by pushing him the hell away. It was a mess. Everyone was screaming. I was trying to get my phone, and kept repeating ""I'm calling my dad, I'm calling my dad"", in the end I didn't. I was still sobbing so hard my chest was actually hurting, at some point I thought I couldn't breathe anymore. 

When Charlie was done pushing the whole family away from me he gently took me by the shoulders and led me outside to get away and calm down. He was very sweet and patient and seemed to know exactly what to do, including getting me out of there. His mother came out a few times on the doorstep to glare at us wordlessly. Charlie said ""go away, can't you see she's not doing well, can't you see this isn't normal behavior, she's not used to it"". She tried arguing that I wasn't to speak to them this way (don't know if this is the correct wording), but he made her leave. 

He let me calm down, said it was a normal reaction, I kept apologizing and he didn't let me. He let me go inside to pack my bags and talked to his family in the meantime so I didn't have to face them, we left through the window so they wouldn't try to stop us, and went to seek refuge at his aunt's place. Everyone there was very sweet and welcoming, everyone in the family knows Charlie's mom is a monster. 

I haven't faced Charlie's parents since. I refuse to. Charlie told me he told his mom ""this isn't normal"" and she said ""do you think SHE's normal with her gross scars all over her arms?"". I used to self harm and I haven't done it in years. My scars are very faded. She's just a disgusting, vile woman.

The thought of talking to them makes me sick. I've ignored them the last time I saw them from far away. Last time I picked up my boyfriend I was very scared just from being in my locked car in front of the house for 5 mins.

I know I'm not over it and need to process it, I was actually hoping this thread would help me overcome the ADHD and finally text my therapist.

My boyfriend seems to understand that I don't want to come back. I told him I probably wouldn't apologize to his parents, and didn't want to see them. At least for now, I just can't. He seems to be getting sort of tired of it though. I feel bad that he has to come over (we both live with our families) though I try to make it as comfortable as possible and my family likes him. He has expressed today that he's sort of of upset that he has to choose between being home and being with me. 

I don't think he understands how terrified I was and I don't know how to tell him so he understands, I have this feeling that he's so used to it he just thinks I should stop feeling bad after a few days. That's sort of the way he acts sometimes though he keeps telling me it's alright I know it bothers him. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR Boyfriend's parents were horrible enough to make me have a panic attack, I don't want to see them ever again, my boyfriend keeps saying he understands but he's getting tired of having to choose between being home and being with me.

EDIT: Thank you, I didn't expect so many responses. I don't know how to answer everybody but I appreciate every response, even those guys that tried to determine in what context it is okay to assault your child over lasagna. 

I'd like to stress that the reason I was so panicky is also because they have a history of physical abuse. I ran in when I thought they might be hitting Charlie. I agree I was overreacting. I disagree though that I owe them any excuses, because acting adequately anyway would have been to leave quietly and never cross paths with these people again.

Charlie and I are on the same team. We've been talking about this and I've been translating the comments for him. This post led to a sincere talk about how we were both feeling about it and that's ultimately what I wanted. I am not going back there and Charlie agrees with that fully. He said he didn't realize I took it so harshly and was still thinking about it; obviously he's not a mind reader. 

Charlie is getting out in a few months, that's when we all leave the school we're both in for an internship, and until then we're gonna make it work like this. Thank you."
79rma8,1,2017-10-30,Girlfriend [23 F] and I [25 M] are at work/study crossroads and don't know if we will ever see each other again.,Mojito619,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79rma8/girlfriend_23_f_and_i_25_m_are_at_workstudy/,"I met my girlfriend at work about 7 months ago. It was love at first sight. I didn’t know it at first because I never felt so strongly before then. The chemistry was unreal, and things got serious seriously quickly. In a matter of weeks, we were practically living together (but giving each other space when needed etc.), going to work together and going on holiday around France and Italy. We have both never felt so comfortable with each other and truly are in love.


We are both rational people and based our relationship on communication and honesty. Which is why we are both happy together as a couple (obviously the chemistry helped).


She’s from Tunisia, whilst she’s not a practicing Muslim, the country isn’t the most forward thinking about relationships or women’s rights for that matter. Tunisia also has a weak passport meaning that emigration is difficult for her. Historically, Tunisia and France are related which is why she managed to get an internship in my work place for 5 months.


We spent 4 amazing months living and travelling together before her contract was up and had to return to Tunis. By that time, both she and I finished our masters in biochemistry and electrical engineering respectively. I am now looking for a job and she wants to continue studying, but in Europe. 


She’s aiming for Hamburg mainly for the course and the financial factors for a non-EU immigrant. She has a good chance of getting accepted since she’s very bright, has lots of recommendations, is currently learning German to a level of B1. But will only get a response from the university mid-February. She has also prepared dossiers for a couple of universities in France for next year if Hamburg falls through.


I had always planned to move from France to Germany after graduating because of my interest in travelling and more interesting job prospects for me. Now there is also the factor of us possibly being together again which brings even more reason for me to go to Germany. I have a backup in France if I don’t find work in Germany.


We are currently doing the Long Distance Relationship thing. Which sucks for the both of us. We really love each other. But knowing that I can’t go to see her in Tunis because our every move will be scrupled and that she can’t see me in France until January of next year because of visa and Tunisian banking laws is extremely frustrating.


The uncertainty of where we will both be in a couple of months’ time is taking its toll, especially for my girlfriend which I totally understand. Where will she be next year: Germany, France, Canada? Where will I be? I am willing to follow her because I know that even though I might not get that fictional dream job in Munich or whatever I’m confident that my skills and degree can land me an interesting job nonetheless. But I do say to myself that I shouldn’t factor her in to my decisions. Or am I wrong?


We are wondering about if we should break up, and if this would make things easier for us both by going our separate ways. I just know that she is the most amazing person I have ever met, and the feelings are mutual. Do we keep at it? Do I find a short interim job until February to hear Hamburg University’s verdict? Do we break it off? My heart would follow her to the ends of the earth, but my rational side is deeply confused. There may be an angle or a solution that I’m missing which is why I am looking for advice. I don’t know if I have gone into detail enough for you to give me an opinion so don’t hesitate to ask!


**TL;DR;: Boyfriend and Girlfriend lived, worked, travelled together for 4 months, truly in love with each other, but now have to do a Long Distance Relationship due to visa and Tunisian culture problems. Both of us are at crossroads for where to study/work next. Both of us want to go to Germany but GF will only know if she will be accepted in February. LDR is hard for us especially since we don’t know if we will ever see each other again.**"
79rood,1,2017-10-30,"My ex [20 M] broke up (again) with me [20 M] after two years, and I'm not sure if I can be hurt/angry especially since I want to (need to?) stay friends.",breakupASK,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/79rood/my_ex_20_m_broke_up_again_with_me_20_m_after_two/,"My ex and I started dating beginning of Freshman year. Worked well long distance during the summers and semester internships. I was pretty happy, we only had one real fight about a month into our relationship. Cut to beginning of this semester, Junior year. About three days after our 2 year anniversary (he made an awesome arduino powered scavenger hunt for me), he says he wants to break up. That he actually hasn't been happy for a couple months now and that I have a very abrasive personality, stopped a lot of healthy habits (going to the gym, etc.), and don't have a lot of friends. He also adds that he himself has a lot of growing to do and wasn't ready for a relationship. 


Obviously this completely blindsided me. I ask him why he didn't tell me, any of this and he said it's not like I can change who I am. I was pretty hurt but kind of understood. I was pretty dependent on our relationship and did not have much (any) friends beyond the close knit group we were in. We end on pretty good terms, I'd say. I know I deserved better but also recognized that it's not worth cutting him out of my life forever.


Cut to three weeks of no real contact. I flirt a bit, and hook up a bit on the apps. See him on there as well. Say hi. I'm single again, reached out to some old connections but still pretty lonely. Then one sunday, I come over to pick up a hat I left over and he asks if we can catch up. I say yes. He tells me how he had really bad, traumatic experiences with boys. I tell him about how I've been doing. And I think this is good, that we can talk about this as friends instead of exes. But anyway, he says he realized he made a mistake and says we should get back together. And yeah, I missed him, so I say yes.


And I think we're back to normal. We say ""I love you"" again and stuff. We go on a few cute dates. Then last Wednesday, we were talking about mental health and stuff. And it leads to a fight about one the ""traumatic"" experiences he had, and whether or not he was overreacting. Don't want to get into too much detail. But I was wrong. And I realized I was wrong later that night.


I feel horrible and text him an apology that night, explaining why I said what I said. We meet up again two days later and he says he's still mad at me but totally understands why I said stuff and it was reasonable but he's still hurt but let's do boyfriend stuff again. 


And we do boyfriend stuff the next two days (couples costume on halloweekend, dinner date, etc.), and it doesn't come up again. Until last night. I was playing video games on his computer while he was on his bed in the other room, talking to a friend of ours on Facebook. He forgot that he has on-screen notifications whenever he got a message and I was able to read a bit of the messages that she was sending like ""if you're not clicking it's just better to break it off now before he gets too hurt"" and stuff.


So I get off and talk to him, tell him I was able to read a bit of the on-screen conversation. And he fills me in. That ever since that fight we had he just lost all feelings for me again. And that he was planning on waiting to see if the feelings came back. And I ask him if he wants to break up and he says ""I don't know"" but I think we all know what that really means. But yeah he talks a bit about how much he feels like an asshole and how he doesn't want to hurt me. And I feel like I'm going crazy and feel so stupid, and try to tell him that he could have handled this better. But he doesn't think so. That he's sorry but he can't control his feelings, and he didn't want to lie. 


Cut to now. I want to be angry and hate him and tell him how he did me wrong. But I'm not sure if I can blame him. He thinks that I dumped him. I'm not even sure what he could have done better (this time, at least). More importantly, I think, is that I spent my whole college life so far with him, and our group of friends. We spent literally everyday hanging out. And he really is my best friend, and I feel like losing that, along with the whole friend group, would be even worse. 


We are planning on talking again this weekend because I said there's still a lot left to communicate. He said he doesn't have much else to say.


EDIT: we're gonna talk about being friends again, I'm not pining for him back or anything. just wanted to make sure that was clear


Sorry if this is a mess.

---   
  **tl;dr**: 


BF of two years broke up with me out of the blue, it was clean then got back together, and then we broke up and now its messy. I don't want to lose a friend/friend group as well and don't know how if I'm right to be a bit hurt/angry

79sq50,2,2017-10-30,21F4A - The Corporate Mole,DPPBIMB0,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/79sq50/21f4a_the_corporate_mole/,"Hey there :) So I don't have a neat little intro for this concept yet but I'm hoping some of you will be willing to get in on the ground floor of a new concept and have some fun with me.

I would be the boss of a big corporate office, the sort that sits in his ivory tower and only comes down to see the peons when they aren't meeting my deadlines. 

I may have lacked the charm of other corporate leaders but I was damn good at my job, those harsh deadlines and unpaid overtime made us the most productive office in the city. 

In fact the higher ups were so impressed they feared I was being overworked and hired a second to help me with my work without asking me; you. 

I resented this. I worked hard to be where I am and they just plopped you down and expected you to be able to do some of MY work as well as I do. I had never trusted anyone but myself in this world, I wasn't about to let you ruin my fucking company. As such I treated you more like a secretary than an equal.

Things only went to shit because of that damn mole. My R&amp;D department were just working out the kinks in what would no doubt be the biggest product we ever released. It would be worth billions if not trillions. It was the Molecular Rearrangement Machine, a surgery-free replacement to cosmetic surgery which could handle any minor adjustment from changing your eye colour to cutting fat off your gut. It was fucking revolutionary.  
I had told The Board all about it and they were practically frothing at the mouth to get it released, big dollar signs in their eyes.

Imagine our surprise when our greatest rival RevelTech announced the exact same product before we got the chance. I was fucking furious. There was no way those imbeciles had developed this technology in tandem on their own; there had to be a mole. And when I found them I was going to pop their head off. 

The Board was equally bloodthirsty, watching their imaginary billions slip from their fingers. The plan had been their idea: use the device to disguise a spy and send them to work at RevelTech and find out how they got their grubby hands on our blueprints. 

I thought about it long and hard but at the end of the day; I knew it would have to be me. No body else at this company had half the brains to pull of the operation and if we got caught we would be sued out of existence for corporate espionage. Hell it wouldnt be so bad? I could go undercover disguised as an intern, lose this gut, get my hair back and be back to being me in a few days with evidence in hand to fire this fucking mole. You would be left in charge while I was away.

That's when you saw the opportunity. Or hell, maybe you'd been planning this from the start, ever since you found out about what the nerds were cooking down in the labs and I never ceased to treat you like an undeserving idiot? Maybe you were the mole all along?

It hardly mattered. You knew once I was gone you were never letting me come back. Your one advantage was that you actually had friends in the office, particularly in the labs while everyone despised me. You learnt from them that in working out the kinks the Molecular Rearrangement Machine had grown far more powerful than I knew.

With a few million slipped under the table the plan was set. When I woke up from the procedure I was to look [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/eytGDwz.jpg) and that's not even to mention mental changes and reconditioning. I would still be me with all my memories, you made sure of that, but you were going to have a lot of fun with me."
79sspf,97,2017-10-30,Let's take a minute to talk about achievements.,Ralisor,Smite,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/79sspf/lets_take_a_minute_to_talk_about_achievements/,"So, I'm one of those players who enjoys working towards some of the achievements that Smite has in place. However, I think there are definitely some that need reworks due to the fact that, while gods get rebalanced frequently, the achievements seemingly never do.  
  
Let's, for example, take one of Ares' achievements. One of his achievements is to hit and pull **5 gods** with his ultimate. Yes, you heard that right, they need to be pulled as well. Which means, not only do you need to play a gamemode with 5 players, you need the entire team to be within ult radius, and you also need to count on the fact that not one member on the entire enemy team has beads up. Which, when people see Ares, is a pretty popular relic pick for ADCs in the duo lane.  
Now, I get that some achievements are meant to be extremely difficult, because it gives you both an actual sense of *achievement*, as well as the bragging rights that come along with it. If we look at the global Steam achievements for Smite, currently only 1.5% of the playerbase has Ares' 5 chains achievement, which, in your eyes, may or may not be an acceptable number.  

However, let's look at some of the more difficult achievements that currently exist in Smite.  

Sitting at 0.7% of the playerbase, we have Ratatoskr's ""Got Nuts?"" achievement, which requires you to get 3 stuns with a single use of his Acorn Blast. Post-nerf, I'm not sure if this achievement is even possible to get anymore.  
  
At 0.6% of the playerbase, Anhur's ""Fury of the Desert"" requires you to get a triple kill with a single use of his Desert Fury ability. I've played a decent amount of Anhur, and it's hard enough to get a single kill with that thanks to the combinations of beads and the prevalence of escape abilities on gods. But again, I digress.  
  
0.5% of players currently have Cupid's ""The Power of the Heart"" achievement, which requires you to kill three or more players with the damage from Heart Bomb. Not his ultimate, mind you, the ability that telegraphs for 3s, and does at most 170 damage + 90% scaling.  
  
The last achievement I'm going to mention on my list (not the last one that may or may not need fixing), is Vamana's ""Baby Smash"", currently at 0.4% of the playerbase. This one requires you kill at least three gods with his ultimate, Colossal Fury. Now, I'll be honest. I've never played Vamana, and I haven't been playing Smite since before he got nerfed into oblivion (In my experience, I almost never see him in games), but not only is it rare to see a Vamana pick, it's even more rare to see him get a single kill with his ult. Not to mention three.  
  
Now, there are plenty of achievements sitting at low percentages of the Steam list, but, many of them have to do with newer gods, or with statistics that would build up over time, such as Tyr's ""Bringing Down the Law"", but there are also some pretty difficult achievements I didn't mention. I wrote up this post to try and get some insight on how difficult some of these achievements are, and to gauge whether or not they're reasonably so in the community's eyes. To me, I think a rebalancing of achievements would be a welcome change for Project Olympus, or maybe a task Hi-Rez could pass on to an intern, but I'm eager to hear what you all think.  
Thanks for reading!  
  
tl;dr: Achievements are hard. Too hard?

79t0wc,1,2017-10-30,Would personally meeting managers help with getting an internship?,SirGoaty,Atlanta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/79t0wc/would_personally_meeting_managers_help_with/,"Hi, I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at Georgia tech, and I'm currently looking for an internship for either spring or summer. 

So far I've just been applying online with various degrees of success, usually just getting a coding challenge and phone interview.

I know there are a bunch of tech companies in Atlanta, so does anyone know if actually going to their HQ to ask about internships is worth it, or would I be told to just apply online.

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!"
79t4n1,118,2017-10-30,"Asked for documentation, received it",COMPUTER1313,MaliciousCompliance,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/79t4n1/asked_for_documentation_received_it/,"At work, I requested documentation from a vendor for a production machine's PLC (programmable logic controller) after all of the programming comments and variable names went missing.

Normally the comments are stored in a separate memory card while the programming logic is in the PLC's main flash memory (comments take up much more room than the actual logic in most cases), and engineers have to statically allocate physical memory addresses for the variables (accidental usage of the same physical memory bits for different parts of the program have happened before).

Anyways, the external memory card was gone, and nobody could find it. So all we had was a bunch of programming logic that had no labels or comments. Imagine in C/C++ if all of the variables were something like ""L2312"" or ""F105"" because the original ""parts counter"" and ""master alarm"" labels disappeared.

I contacted the vendor as the machine was still under warranty. The vendor mailed me a CD about 1-2 weeks later. In that CD was a PDF file with +2000 pages full of images of the original code that they programmed in a few months ago. And for some reason, OCR (optical character recognition) doesn't seem to play nice.

I asked if they had any of the config files with the programming comments that I could load it directly into the PLC. They denied having such files and said the PDF file was the only backup of their work. I asked them what would happen if they had to use the PDF file themselves if they had made a mistake, and they said that it has never been a concern for them.

Now it's a game of which engineers/supervisors are willing to throw their interns under the bus, because someone has to read the PDF images and manually copy all of the variable names and comments.

It has always been your brother and you for the last ten years. Abusive guardians just shy of physical beating, emancipation at 17, it has always been just you and him.

The first time you saw him cry he was 11 and you were 14. You did not understand the bond of blood and flesh until you have seen your own cried his heart out because he had been told he was a disgrace and he was worthless. It did not matter then you were so depressed, you knew you were living for him. You were not going to let anyone hurt your flesh and blood. He was it, he was family and family was all you had. 

Tonight was the second time he cried. 

It has just been you and him for the last ten years he is essentially your child. It hurts when your own kid, your younger sibling, the child you love and want to protect from all the hurts, does not think he can confide in you. 

He has been so stressed out, so depressed, so unmotivated. Of course you knew, but you were not aware the depth of his distress. As the matter of fact, you added on to it. You thought you had to toughen him up for life, because you won't always be there. All of the sudden the tattoo makes sense, the sex makes sense, the smoking makes sense. It kills you because you always have thought you were the cool sibling, he could always confide in you.

But you weren't. 


My dear brother, I love you and I will always do. My wish for you is to be happy as you can be, to marry whoever you want, to make all the mistakes you can afford to because you learn from them and to live the longest, happiest, most fulfilling life. 

It is not that you have not done enough or achieve enough, you have certainly done so. A full tuition scholarship to college, working all through out your 4 year, a teaching internship. I should have never placed my expectation for myself on you. I did, but we are going forward on your pace. 

I will never abandon you. "
79tfke,84,2017-10-31,Tales from Law School,TorreyL,talesfromthelaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromthelaw/comments/79tfke/tales_from_law_school/,"I hope that law school still falls under the legal umbrella.

So far, all of my stories have been pre-law school, although I have one really good summer internship story I keep meaning to write up. This one takes place in a law school class.

This class was called Pre-Trial Litigation, and it was set up so that we were in groups of three to four people taking one side on a fictional case. It was a personal injury case where a pedestrian had been struck while crossing a street. I was assigned to the Plaintiff's side, and one of my team members and I never got along.

For some background, the class was co-taught by two judges, a prosecutor, and a PI attorney. The class was only open to 3Ls or 2Ls with litigation experience. I fell into the latter category. On the first day, one of the judges had everyone in the class state their legal experience. I said I'd worked for five years between undergrad and law school and spent most of it as a paralegal. It is slightly relevant to the story that I look about five years younger than I am.

At any rate, it soon became clear that one of my teammates and I were never going to get along. Our biggest problem came in one of our early assignments. Our pleadings were due by the time class started, but he wanted them all submitted the day before. I think that's a good goal, but it's not good to be inflexible on that.

One weekend, I had a journal deadline at midnight on Sunday. Our pleading was due on Monday at 4:15 pm. I admit that I failed to mention to my teammates that I had a journal deadline, but I honestly thought I'd finish my journal assignment in plenty of time. (I ended up dropping out of that journal because it was so badly organized. In this particular assignment, they'd given footnotes to spade for an article, but clearly hadn't read it, because one of mine had 24 SUBFOOTNOTES that I had to track down on the DOJ website.) Asshole teammate submitted the assignment before I had a chance to work on it. (NB: He submitted it well before it was due. If he had waited a few hours, like every other team, I would have had my part done.)

I know that I should have informed them, and I take full credit for my failure to do so. I emailed them about an hour after he had submitted saying that I was sorry I hadn't gotten my part in before he submitted it, that I'd had a journal deadline that I thought I would finish earlier, and that I would make it up to them by doing the next assignment on my own and just giving it to them for review/editing before submittal. Reasonable teammate said he wished I'd told them beforehand that I had a deadline, but he understood that shit happens, and my proposal seemed fair to him. Asshole teammate said something along the lines of ""We all have other things going on! I have a baby. What makes you think your stuff is more important than ours?"" (His baby was living with his wife in another state, and I was taking more classes than either of them plus journal. I once calculated hours because I was really pissed at him, and I was doing about five more hours a week of stuff than either of them were.)

After this, he thought I was super lazy. I started doing my work way early so he couldn't claim that. Once, he had to eat his words after sending a nasty email about how I hadn't done my part only to realize I'd done it the day before. Another time, I'd submitted my initial draft, and then my roommate had accidentally overloaded a circuit in our house so I couldn't access the internet to submit further work although I could access stuff I'd already downloaded on my laptop. (For lizard owners: don't plug all of your heat lamps into the same outlet or your roommate may get nasty emails from teammates.) I submitted my final edits about an hour before my teammate submitted it because that's when I got internet/power back. I didn't feel guilty because I'd already done the heavy lifting on my part, and everything else was a light edit. Asshole teammate still sent me an email about how this was the second time I'd been late (even though I'd submitted my section well before he'd submitted his) and either I had to turn myself into the professors or he would. I sent an email taking full credit for the first mistake and explaining that I'd done the next section to make up for it, and telling them that I had submitted this one days in advance but wasn't able to make my edits because my power and internet had gone out. I also specifically requested that any deficiencies in these pleadings be taken against my grade and not my teammates.

I know I've mostly been ranting about this guy, but this next part is the real reason I didn't like or respect him. One day, we had to submit our initial discovery disclosures. Because the fictional case tried to balance the sides, our client wasn't perfect. In particular, our client had said in a deposition that she wasn't ever expected to recover from her brain injury, but a few months later, a doctor released a report saying she was. My teammate said that we should not submit her medical reports because it would show a contradiction. I said it wasn't that big of a contradiction given that she was a lay person testifying months earlier. He said that if we didn't release the records, they wouldn't be able to find the inconsistency and therefore had to accept her testimony. I said that no jury or judge would find her testimony compelling without medical records. He said I didn't understand what he was saying. I told him I understood exactly what he was saying and he was wrong. He asked if my experience as a paralegal had taught me how to evaluate cases in a very sarcastic tone. I said it had and that it was offensive that he would presume that paralegals would not have the knowledge and experience to evaluate cases. He instantly shut up and started sulking.

At the end of class, I told him I was sorry for speaking to him so harshly. He asked if he could give me a few tips as a ""more experienced"" person. He first asked me how old I was, and I could tell he was a bit taken aback and thought I was significantly younger. He then told me that as former officer in the military, he had learned to never call people ""wrong"" or they would stop listening to you.

I refrained from doing anything more than nodding because I knew anything I said would make things worse. However, the following thoughts went through my head:

1. My father was an NCO in Vietnam. One of the first things you learn as an officer is you cannot pull rank on a civilian. Telling me you were a major so I should respect you is both irrelevant and a violation of the military code of conduct.

2. Being a military officer means you are used to people obeying you, no questions asked. Rather than making you look like a good teammate, it makes you look like someone who has never had to think critically about his decisions and is used to being obeyed with no other input.

3. I only said that he was wrong because he was assuming I didn't understand his argument. I did, and I disagreed with it. I said I thought it was wrong because it was the only way to bring the argument to a stop.

4. If you think someone saying your idea is wrong is a personal insult, you have some issues.

5. If you think you can carry that attitude about paralegals into most law firms, you're going to be fired. There were at least two attorneys fired because of how they treated me. The complaints didn't come from me; they came from my attorney boss."

79ukuz,3,2017-10-31,RabbitVCS problem?,tundrat,CentOS,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentOS/comments/79ukuz/rabbitvcs_problem/,"So I'm a very rookie in using Linux. And I'm kinda new at work as sort of like an intern. Anyway, I was told to find a good SVN program to use for 32bit CentOS 6.8 in Virtualbox and I found RabbitVCS as the close equivalent to Windows TortoiseSVN.  
I know there's a CentOS 7.0, but 6.8 is what the company is using.  
  
So sure enough, it was easy to use as just using the Right Click menu to use in the file browser. With green and red icons at the files and stuff. That was a few weeks ago and in the meantime I was struggling with understanding the code of the company's program. At some point I noticed that the RabbitVCS icons disappeared. And IIRC I'm supposed to use it with the Right Click menu, but the functions aren't there either. However the icons are still there when I check Properties-Emblems.  
I'm not confident that I'm even doing this properly, but I did try uninstalling and reinstalling it too.  
  
It may or may not have something to do with the OS updating to 6.9. Or maybe updating something else with the software updater. So, did I accidently break something? Or is it simply that RabbitVCS no longer works with the latest updates?  
If it doesn't work anymore, what other similar SVN is there?  
  
(It may be hard for me to reply to further questions as I move back and forth to home and work. And also that again, I'm a rookie with Linux.)"
79uoke,5,2017-10-31,Interning Integers?,odh_moyer,Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/79uoke/interning_integers/,"Hi all,

I am working with a large dictionary of sets of tuples of low entropy integers (range -180 to 180).

Memory and simplicity are both concerns, therefore, I would like to expand the default allocated integer objects to include -180 to -6, which should dramatically reduce memory consumption without affecting my code base/adding any complexity.

Is there any simple way to do this? I have tried searching google, but no one has asked this question to my knowledge.

I realize I could apply a transformation on all of my entries to fit in the -5 to 256 range, but then I will lose some resolution and I need to add a layer of bookkeeping to my dictionary.

Are there any other data types (ctypes/numpy) that automatically intern? Maybe I could just type cast to/from str when accessing the dictionary. Though that seems silly though since integers are immutable too.

Cheers!"

I know these aren't enviable experiences, but given how people in left-leaning spaces tend to talk about how they're so universal, I can't help but feel like I'm being left out. I have also never been hit on or asked for my number or anything of that sort. The final nail in the coffin, I recently realized, was my interactions with another member of my research team. A grad student I had been interacting with a lot, despite being a 20-something white male with a background in computer science, never ONCE mansplained anything to me. Instead, he saw my expertise from a previous internship as valuable, listened to my suggestions, and overall treated me like someone who was competent and capable, never patronizing me. Again, I know these aren't fun things to go through, but with how often I hear about them, given their absence in my life I can't help but feel like I am blatantly and visibly male to everyone. Does anyone have any similar things like this happen to them?"

He can't make plans until essentially last minute due to an intense feeling of FOMO. Before realizing this, he tried to end it with me due to a lack of seeing each other and distance; but after realizing he had this time commitment issue he decided to go see a counsellor to fix himself in order to save our relationship. The problem is, for the time being, I feel horrible waiting around not for when he gets better, but for IF he gets better. We obviously also can't work on our relationship (which is at a critical point) until he fixes this issue within himself. 

Our relationship can't work without planning in advance because we live an hour and a half away from each other (temporarily) due to school. He's supposed to graduate next year and live half an hour away from me because he has a job lined up for him. 6 months ago, when we started dating he worked as an intern at the same place and we were able to see each other 3 times a week because he had a car and everything was perfect. In about 6 months, it'll be the same story plus I'll even have a car. I don't know if I should try to help him and stick through, or just end it with him at this point. I love him very much, met his family and vice versa, and have an intense bond- just bad circumstances. There's nothing I'd want more than for this to work, I' do anything for him. But right now, I feel devastated and overwhelmed with constant thoughts of whats going to happen.

Reddit, I would really appreciate some input on whether I should stay or go. My heart says yes, but my logic and well being say no. "

* Unsub: ~$6,000

Assets:

* Savings: $3,000 (1.25%)

* Checking: $1,600 (0.10%)

* Traditional IRA: $4,550 (This is something ridiculous like a 3-yr CD at 0.33%)

* Expenses: $1200/mo
* Net: ~$350/mo

Third year same story, we'd party, do drugs but our grades always held up and we didn't neglect life.

Over the last 8-9 months since meditating I've realized how far I proverbially fell, how I became depressed by hanging out with overall negative, toxic people who veiled  it as humor towards others and ""just memes/banter"". One of which in particular has been struggling with depression for years.

I moved away from home for an internship that is now halfway done and have realized that through meditation, metta and practicing compassion I've become more like my old more childlike self. More optimistic, more go-getting, more situational humor vs direct funny personal insults/disses. And that as a result my quality of life has greatly improved.

Through this journey of realizing that I am the universe and every other human is a manifestation of the same matter and energy that I am and realizations that being compassionate to your self makes you more compassionate to others and vice versa sparking a positive feedback loop, always trying to love others and not harbor negative feelings about them.

Last night in a group chat I was trying to explain to my ""friends"" something about desire and setting better habits which was being constantly meme'd and not taken seriously when someone in the group chat not as close to me as the ones doing the banter says ""I agree with a lot of what 613 is saying and I've read a lot of the research he's talking about, why are you guys putting him down"", the reply: ""idk I'm not actually paying attention to what he's saying I'm just memeing""

As a one off whatever, but when this not being taken seriously and not being listened to properly like real friends should I realized I need to cut one of them in particular completely off and only be friendly with if I see in passing at the gym or whatever. 

I felt a wave of anger and went and demolished a punching bag in the gym and embraced the feelings and 10-20 minutes was back on cloud 9.

How can we cut people out of our lives while still loving them? Would loving them not entail that we want them in our lives? But I've tried to help them (1 in particular) look at the world in a better more positive way, explain to them how bad habits feed depression and how good habits and foundations can help instead of thinking continuing your current lifestyle and just taking SSRI's can help.

Of the core group of 8 including myself there is one that I want nothing to do with anymore, another who I was never really close with and another that I want to really cut off too but he's very close with 2 of the other remaining 4 others aside from myself that would make that almost impossible.

When just 5 of the 8 talk or hangout it's great, stimulating conversation, positive vibes but as soon as any one of the other 3 are present it's just a hotbed of toxicity, dissing/roasting, showing memes on the phone. 

Fucking done with this shit.

Life is basically at 90/100 from 10/100 this time last year. The remaining 10 is just how I need to fix my social circle and start dating.

For people who live in a different area than your parents, how are you planning to/ did you handle visits? We live in Miami and both my parents and MIL are in Nashville. His mom is annoying to me, as is typical for a MIL/DIL pair, but we have a descent relationship. My mom and I are pretty close and I definitely want her help (plus she's a pediatrician so she knows way more than me!). We live in a 2 bedroom/1 bathroom and definitely do not want everyone staying with us. HOWEVER, we live in Miami, which is very expensive, so we can't ask MIL to get a hotel nearby. Fortunately, my parents have family friends who live in Miami during the winter (my due date is in summer so I'm fairly certain they will let our families stay at their place), but in a neighborhood about 20-30mins from us. I'm thinking that I'll tell my MIL that she can come down for a few days after the birth but I'll have both her and my mother stay at this family friend's place (assuming that's ok with the friends, of course, but they leave town April-November and my due date is in July so should be ok). We will still have a bed set up in the guest room and I assume I'll want my mom to stay some nights and hang around more. I'm a little worried about the distance between the two places because it's not quite close enough that MIL can just drop by for 30 mins at a time when I say it's ok (remember, Miami traffic can be bad!). This is a first grandkid on both sides so everyone is going to be super excited. Overall, I know that I can easily tell my parents to leave/ find something to do and they will, but I'm not as comfortable telling his mom that. Does anyone have any advice? 

One more thing - my husband is a medical resident so his schedule is pretty busy (that will be his chief year and July is when the new interns start). Maybe it would be best to say his mom can only come to Miami while he's able to take time off? That way he can be the one to tell her she needs to give us a break? I feel bad because I know my husband wants her to be as involved but obviously my needs are the priority!"

Recently I applied for an intership(one of the best in my city) that is well paid for the industry and teaches lots of current technologies for development for 6 months and then there is a big chance interns get hired fully for a position in this important tech company. The thing is, the internship would be paying half of what I am earning now (23K vs. 11,5 K), and even if I could get used to spending less (I can start saving 600dolars a month with my current salary) I would have only 4 months for saving until starting the internship. I live in an apartment with a bedroom and a balcony with my pet bunny,  and the lower Rent I could pay in the city is around 7K. 
The thing is eventually I would have to leave my job to start in the field I like and i don’t know if I should try to continue renting or to take a step back and go back to living with my parents until I get a salary that could let me live comfortably again in an apartment of my own. I have been living on my own for 7 years now and part of my feels really humilliated of having to go back, specially since my parents live an hour away from the city where my job, university, my friends and boyfriend live. 
On the other hand if I could get in this internship I would be getting in one of the best right now in my field and I am willing to sacrifice what I can to start my professional life in the best way possible.
Also if it isn’t this one, any other job in the field will be payed a similar or less salary to start, and this is a change I will eventually have to make. "

That takes luck and being incredibly lazy. I'm talking about living in the modern society:

For starters when I made the most money I was working the least. Putting in almost 0 effort showing up to work, being a warm body, and going home. I was never on the chopping block. Never close to being fired. None of that. Any time someone IRL someone would bring up how hard my job must be I would point out (rather quickly) that it was the easiest thing I've ever done. Literally ever. I was making 80k a year and more days than not I was sleeping at work, straight through my shift. Every single one of my friends also got a job at the same place. They did exactly like me. In fact in 2 years I don't think we accomplished a single thing. Life was fucking great. The job got old, I mean just sit around for 8 hours a day and bounce a ball at a wall and try to stay entertained. It gets old.

The job I had prior to that I was in the military. I busted my ass and nothing ever came of it. Not a fucking thing. I was much poorer, and at constant risk. The job wasn't worth the pay what-so-ever. It led to no career opportunity out side of the military. None of that.

I started college 6 years ago and broke my dick doing it. (While working at the job that paid me 80k a year.) I was studying a stem subject 8-10 hours a day, 6-7 days a week. I came out of school with really good grades, a resume with no gaps. No dice. Couldn't find work and wound up in debt.

The job I worked previously couldn't even pay me more than 8 an hour and I worked harder there than any other job before that, and the store I worked at only had 7 employees and the store grossed over 5 million a year. Seems to me they could have easily raised my wages based on how hard I was working.

Taking the advice of people like sargon I worked even harder. I polished my resume, changed to a field that had more growth, worked even harder, and for the past 2 years I've been studying information technology on my own for about 6 hours a day. STILL CAN'T GET A JOB IN IT. I have an internship as well meaning I have experience in the field, and certifications. Still no luck. That internship got free work out of me though. Hell I even have 4 years of experience in technology while in the US Military. Even greater irony is I'm really charismatic in real life. I rarely meet people who dislike me, and that I dislike. I work great on teams, but prefer working alone.

My question is why does sargon think that working hard leads to success? It clearly doesn't. It doesn't lead to employment. It doesn't lead to money. It leads to interviews where you are insulted for 'not working hard enough' or 'being a millenial' (Which I'm not ironically.) so the question I have is:

How hard do you have to work, objectively, to 100% of the time secure a job paying at least 30k in the US? (most tech jobs pay that btw)

How many hours do you have to put into something to 100% chance get a job?

If you don't like the 100% chance, then give me the odds you think are reasonable. Because I'm not seeing any reason anyone should work hard unless they are inclined to do so. Then its not a bragging right, its just innate to who you are.

I'm not seeing this and I think its just his bias working against him."

I'm in my second corporate accounting job straight out of school (not counting internships) and absolutely hate it.  3 years out of school working as a senior staff accountant is something I'm pretty happy with, but good god is this place insufferable.  Politics up the wazoo, no organization, controller has no idea how accounting works, nobody interested in process improvement, etc etc.  I've done 3 closes and I still don't know when anything is due or what my actual duties are, but here I am getting scolded because I didn't reconcile pre-paid accounts for the past 3 months and my response was ""I did not know you wanted me to do that"".  I took the job in order to move states (and go from staff at a firm I liked to a senior), and have been here for just over 3 months now.

That all said, I'm looking for help with 2 questions really:

1) How soon is too soon to leave a new job in our industry?  I figure I can frame it as a temp position I took in order to move if asked.

2) Given I have way more than enough saved up, should I leave and then job hunt, or job hunt then leave?

79xbju,1,2017-10-31,Is Refinancing a decent Option for me at this moment?,DevChatt,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/79xbju/is_refinancing_a_decent_option_for_me_at_this/,"Hey Guys,
My current Student loans are sitting at about 27k all in. I have on top of that about 5k left in credit card debt on 0% interest...this was used to pay for a car which i am hoping to have paid out at the latest by july next year (this is with contingency, plan will be to pay it off even faster).
I think next year I may consider refinancing my 27k in student loans to reduce my interest payment and also to put all these loans in one place. Currently my average student loan interest rate sits at about 5.5percent-ish as i remember the last time I did the math....which is awfully high. I pretty much used up all of my deferment after I graduated college since I was unemployed for a small bit and then was an intern barely making enough to pay these loans. 
Now I currently make 62k a year less bonuses and sometimes I do part time work and tutor as well for additional income to pay off car and also have something to do with my free time.  I also have 9k in a safety net which I am hoping to jump up to 10k soon. 
I currently am on the graduated plan for navient(24k) and am paying a minumum of 182 a month but usually pay an additional 50 bucks as well to the highest interest loan to save $ there as well. I also have one of the other loans at ESCI (3k) at 52 bucks a month on top. 

My question to you guys...I am looking to refinance early next year...doing my research the biggest risk i have is loosing deferrment...which doesn't matter to me much since I already used it up...
What other risks do I run privatizing out my loans for lower interest? "

I followed my sister's steps into going to a local school but that ended up being a costly decision (30k student loans currently). My parents wanted me to pursue medical school since I did well in school without trying too hard and since they've done so much for me I didn't disagree. After finishing my sophomore year, I started to have doubts about the career choice but had major sunk cost fallacy due to student loans and time/resources spent on studies. I wanted to do programming but kept hesitating and decided on biotechnology (90% biochem/10% programming). I find science related jobs easily and get some interviews for coding positions but end up getting cut when it comes to the technical interviews. I want to return to school for a CSE degree at the same university since that would make the fastest route due to most transferable credits and the school's good reputation but ultimately I would have to live in another city and take on many more loans. I am looking into scholarships/fellowships to minimize any part time work I would do. This would require lots of time/money but a friend said this would be the best method since  I will have proper knowledge of the field and could go for internships between the years and get a good job to begin with after finishing studies.

The other plan I had was to do a coding workshop since it is a lot less time and money but I've heard some cons about this route as well since you don't get the in-depth knowledge needed. Another friend said this will at least get my foot in the door so I can work my way up or job hop once any learning opportunity runs out. 

I don't really know which would be the wisest path since I really feel pressured by financial debt and being so behind compared to most people my age since I would be restarting a career. The science path I realized is not for me due to low earning potential, with high requirements such as masters/phd, and funky hours due to the work not able to being put on hold. I would rather take 1 step back now so I don't regret my future 40 years later. If anything, my main goal is to work in the programming field and gain lots of experience so I could potentially put my first degree to use in bioinformatics. I just want to make the right decisions because I feel lots of remorse and regret over many decisions I have made since I worked so hard/long for the biotech degree compared to many other students but end up with less job prospects/income. Any advice is welcome!"

We got engaged this past summer and all is well, except for her insecurities over my friendship with one of my female coworkers, Brooke, who started at my company as an intern and was hired full-time after graduation.

Brooke is, no doubt, a beautiful girl, but there is nothing going on between us. She's one of the few coworkers that don't make me want to quit. We started hanging out after work occasionally after she was hired full-time - dinner here or drinks there. Nothing special. We are friends. Meredith met Brooke at a company function and I could tell she was jealous right away as I know her so well. I should say, that at this function someone called Brooke my work wife and I knew that also made her uncomfortable. After, she asked me a few questions about her and even admitted she was jealous and didn't like that, but she seemed to understand everything was kosher. 

My birthday is coming up. My coworker and I have never given one another birthday gifts, but we did exchange Christmas gifts last year. She surprised me today with tickets to my favorite hockey team for my birthday! I'm an avid hockey fan and I go to a few games a year with my fiancee, but this game is at my team's home arena and I haven't been there in awhile. I immediately accepted and even put it on Twitter.

I admit that it was a big mistake and I should've checked with my fiancee before I told her I could go because it does involve some traveling and it was the day before my birthday. I knew that the second I got home when she asked me about the tickets and I told her who gave them to me. She flipped out, told me that our relationship was inappropriate, that we had already talked about my birthday and she had a whole weekend plan like we talked about. She said it was inappropriate to go away for the weekend with another woman and to ignore her and all my friends who set aside time that weekend already for me. I admit, I forgot what we had talked about and feel really bad about that. I told her I won't go to the game. It's not a big deal as we see my team whenever they come to town.

I told my coworker that I was sorry, but I already had plans that I had forgotten about. She surprised me when she game back and had tickets for another game for the next weekend. She told me she knows a season ticket holder and if the next weekend didn't work, we can find one that does.

I haven't responded to Brooke because I do not know or think that this will be okay with my fiancee. On the other hand, this is something I would do with a male friend, so I do not see it is wrong. I want to go. I want to go back to where I grew up as I haven't been since earlier this year and go back to the place where I watched games with my dad. It's purely platonic and I think this should be okay with my fiancee, but I'm afraid she's so insecure about this all now she would be angry if I went.

I'm seeing Brooke tonight at a Halloween thing and my fiancee will be there too. I need to figure out how to handle this before I leave.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My fiancee is insecure over my female coworker/friend, who wants to go to a hockey game with me in another state for my birthday. I do not know how to handle this, but I'll be with both tonight at a Halloween party. What do I do?

EDIT: An update since a few of you asked for it: We wound up not going to the party last night as neither of us wanted to go (neither of us are really party people) and I was only going because Brooke had me promise I would show up. We stayed in, gave candy out, talked, and watched Halloween movies. We had a long talk about everything and my fiancee was very honest about me about how much this has hurt her and that she was trying to let me make my own decisions. She said that it was clear from the beginning that Brooke liked me, but she could deal with it if I had set good boundaries, but I didn't. She pointed out to me (like some here did) that going out to dinner and drinks with her when I'd pay most of the time (yes, I know - I made more money so I thought this was okay) was a date. She said that I forgot about her when I agreed to spend my birthday and a weekend away with another woman, or just didn't care. She asked me how I would feel if she did that with one of her coworkers and I admitted that it would make me really uncomfortable. I admitted that I liked the attention and that is something I need to deal before we get married. Even though I liked the attention, I do not think it will be that hard to cut Brooke out of my life, as she really isn't someone that I would normally be friends with. We agreed that I should stop spending time with her in any non-professional manner. We talked about how to go about doing this with her. We have a lot to deal with and won't be getting married until it's all settled. Thanks for your advice, however harsh it was.

Also - I showed my fiancee this post and she was admittedly annoyed at some of my responses (deservedly!). But she agreed with everyone who said the term ""work wife"" or ""work husband"" is a dumb term and I will be putting a stop to that, too. "

I'm currently a sophomore undergrad studying Computer Engineering at Northwestern University. Recently I got interested in cybersecurity despite having little to no knowledge on the topic. There are not to many courses/resources for cybersecurity offered at my school, but I'm willing to self-learn.

The question I really want to ask is, what is the job market  for cybersecurity-related CS/CE majors right now who are fresh out of undergrad? I've been focusing a lot more on data structures and algorithms recently for software engineering and development internships and I must say, I've gotten pretty good at it for a sophomore. Furthermore, it seems like being a software engineer pays a lot better (for fresh undergrads at least) since Big4/Unicorn companies are heavily recruiting software engineers and devs. I'm definitely gonna do more reading on cybersecurity and then evaluate my choices, but I don't know if it's worth giving up a career in software engineering for. 

Lastly, if I want to have a career in cybersecurity, what are the necessary steps I plan to take? I'll definitely try to participate in CTFs, read books on TCP/IP stuff, but beyond that are there any steps I can take towards landing a good cybersecurity internship/job?

P.S. Subject to change, but I currently don't plan on going to grad school"

As per the title, I am a 22 year old Aussie male entering my final year of university (Bachelor of Business, Tourism &amp; Hospitality Management) in 2018.

I have to do a University Internship at the end of my degree (November 2018 - Feburary 2019) and I am wanting to do this in Las Vegas as I there are so many great opportunities in the casinos and other tourism/hospitality organisations and establishments there.

I have already corresponded with my university internship team and they basically said sort out the green card/working visas and permits needed before you look for a job; as such I'm hitting up Reddit to try and score some advice from people who have done this before or maybe just know the in's and out's of the process and can help me out... any advice is much appreciated, and I'm also gonna be putting a similar post in some other forums like the green card forum and the internship forums.

Looking forward to some valuable discussions and also, any Yankees or ex-Aussies that can offer some good advice and maybe live in the Las Vegas area, would be awesome to have some dialogue here and then hang out if and when I do make it.

Cheers!"
79zyoj,2,2017-10-31,I bottle up my relationship problems. They are quite complicated. Here they are.,ProportionableFun,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/79zyoj/i_bottle_up_my_relationship_problems_they_are/,"After years of being content with my love life, I am experiencing continuous double heartbreak and I absolutely hate it and want to curl up in a ball and binge eat crunchy Cheetos.  I have never told the whole convoluted story to anyone before - just bits and pieces.

Five years ago, I meet Boy.  We are 16 - I skipped a grade, so I'm a little ahead.  I am immediately enthralled.  We quickly become close friends and I patiently wait for him to break up with the girl he's always complaining to me about.  One year later, he does.  He initiates our relationship.  We have one awesome year of cliche high school relationship, exchange ""I love you""s, then I leave for a big fancy college I feel like I have to go to, prompting the deepest, darkest depression of my life and the onset of an all-encompassing existential dread that I still haven't fully shaken.  He never comes to visit and we talk on the phone at best once a week.  I start drinking a lot as a coping mechanism.  He doesn't trust me to make good decisions.  The first time we had sex was, I found out later, because he thought I was lying about being a virgin.  I consider ending the relationship here.  I lose my financial aid because of a cosigner with shoddy credit and have to transfer to a state school, back home where Boy is.

While I am emotionally at an all time low after my lifetime of good grades and high SAT scores and extracurricular activities has been shat on by Sallie Mae, Boy is getting ready to leave for his big fancy college.  He does, and the first few months while I'm at home are awesome.  I visit frequently, we explore his new city together, and he connects with my friends there.  I start scheming to move there after getting my degree.  We start talking about when we're going to get married.  Things are great when I decide to take a semester on exchange in Europe, and we talk almost every day of my first two months there despite the five hour time difference.  After these two months, I get an unplanned phone call from him where he tells me that a week before, he'd kissed someone else.  A man.  This is where the shit hits the fan, except not really, because I love this person and care about nothing more than being around to support him.

The next year is a lot of the same.  I move around a lot for internships and my studies, and while to my knowledge he never strays again, he bottles up his sexuality problems and they only get worse.  I try to help him, but he refuses to tell me anything.  I spend nights crying because I don't know what's wrong or how to fix it.  I finally end up in his city for the summer, hoping that being physically present, I can help him get through it and everything will go back to normal, only for him to move somewhere else.  In an absolutely backwards, misguided attempt to save our relationship, I tell him I think I'd be okay with not being exclusive.  I expect him to meet a man, leave me, and finally relieve me of the feeling that I have to be there for him no matter what.  We break up almost immediately, because *he* can't imagine *me* with someone else.  I cry and plead on the phone with him for hours trying to get him to change his mind, to make everything stop.  Finally, it's over.

I'm in a new city, and I meet someone new.  Girl.  Not a surprise to me.  Again, I like her immediately.  We have a great first few dates, we turn out to go to the same university and have a bunch of mutual friends, we see each other a few times a week.  I feel like things are headed somewhere, and at the time, maybe they were.  I'm excited that I like someone again.  Now we're back at school, and things are definitely not headed anywhere.  I am doing my best to stay emotionally distant, but she'll occasionally really open up to me about the romantic past that makes her not want this to head anywhere, and again, I do my best to be there for her.  Other times, she's totally cold.  I am not sure what she wants from me.  I'm pretty sure if I stopped reaching out to her she wouldn't chase after me.

Boy and I started talking again as friends recently.  The girl he's seeing now is the exact physical opposite of me...and a girl.  It's not like we broke up conditionally, but I always thought the problems with our relationship stemmed from his apparent lack of attraction to women.  I guess it was just a lack of attraction to me.  I wanted to tell him that I still loved him and that I'm here for him, and he took that as me ""not being over our relationship"", told me he didn't have any feelings for me, and blocked me from communicating with him.  I am drinking heavily, barely eating, and sleeping with someone who doesn't care about me - if he were acting like that, I'd be on the next plane to see him and try to make him feel better.

I have invested myself in these two people who could not give less of a shit about me.  I feel like shit all the time.  I wish I could just detach."
