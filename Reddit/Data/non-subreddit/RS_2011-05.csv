h15vv,2,2011-04-30,Things were perfect until she said something.,NRussiaAccountThrowU,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h15vv/things_were_perfect_until_she_said_something/,"I am 20, my girlfriend is 20, and the other girl is 20. I have been dating this girl for 2 weeks. I have known her for over 8 months though. We have a connection that runs months deeper though.

So what this makes this story unique is that it takes place in Disneyworld. Yeah. I was working there as a college internship, with my now girlfriend as my coworker. I was single the whole time I was down there.

One night I run to catch a bus, only for interns, and get on and say ""You guys don't need to worry, I made it"" to which this voice responds ""Good I was really worried"" I look to see this gorgeous girl, with her roommate, and I say ""I think Ill sit down right here""

We start talking for a 20 minute bus ride, and she is snappy and sarcastic, which I go right back. I got off the bus, and wasn't mad, but she made me trip up over a whole bunch of things I said, I knew stuff I should have said, and I was upset that this girl beat me at a sarcasm match.

She also said ""I bet you are going to be a creep and add me on facebook"" because I saw her name tag. I was, but now I couldn't. So I sent her a message on facebook saying ""This isn't a facebook friend request"" We talked a little, and eventually she added me.

The whole time she said I was hollering at her, so I couldn't be predictable. So I never made a move after that, and we were friends.

Months later, I am infatuated by my current girlfriend. She is wonderful. Nothings going wrong, everything goes great, and we really like each other. 

I get a message from my friend. The one I met on the bus. We start talking, and topics go to topics, we talk about how we met. Then I say, ""well Im glad I didn't ask for your number, that would have been bad, you would have turned me down."" to which she says, ""You had an opportunity before I started dating my current boyfriend""

This girl is beautiful, and funny, and wonderful. My girlfriend now, there is nothing I can complain about, she doesn't have a huge sense of humor, but she is the nicest person I ever met.

Ever since that girl from the bus said this, every time I am on the phone with my girlfriend now, I think ""I really do not care what you are doing, I want to know what bus girl is doing"" Every time she text me, I hope its bus girl, and I know shes great, and nothings wrong, its just I cant get over this girl and this lost opportunity.

I don't think I can solve this, I just need to get over it, how can I reddit?

h2ops,1,2011-05-02,"Sober 4 months now, but don't know what will happen after drug test.",rockcanteverdie,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h2ops/sober_4_months_now_but_dont_know_what_will_happen/,"First off, I'm glad to find this community. It's nice to be able to talk to people going through similar experiences. 

i'm a 19 year old engineering college student. My dad is a professor at the university at which i study. He pays my tuition and i live with him. This last semester i had been striving to get a co-op (like a paid internship but alternating semesters studying and working). My goal was to be able to pay my own rent and finally live on my own(meaning away from parents, not without roommates) without getting student loans. For once in my life, i was driven. I quit smoking weed completely this semester so that no matter what, even if the drug test was a hair sample, it would not fuck up my chances. 

Well, i got the co-op. i start in august. i'm really excited, but one thing kind of bothers me. since i quit, alot of things in my life have gotten better. I'm much more responsible. I'm alot more willing to step outside my comfort zone and stretch my limits. i'm 1000% more social and outgoing now. last year, when i using a few times a week, i was doing better academically, but all i did was school and then get high on the weekends. now i'm in a fraternity and actually have a social life. So my problem is this: i've been feeling what i saw Subduction refer to as a [reservation to use](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gnu34/i_want_to_be_done_playing_this_game/c1oxwg7). And once i pass my drug test, i'll have no important reason not to smoke weed anymore. i'll be in a new city and living away from parents for the first time. I predict that at this time it will be VERY hard for me to not start smoking weed again. and i don't even know if that's a bad thing. I've gone long periods of time with what seemed to be controlled weed use. But i've also abused it. i smoked daily for about 8 months after graduating high school and my life most certainly went downhill. I know that i'm happy with my life now, but i also know that it's possible to use and not abuse it. but the possibility of using it without abuse makes it easy to start abusing it without realizing it. i don't know what's going to happen. i don't want getting high to become my default activity again, even if i'm getting all my stuff done. but i really miss weed. it's funny, if i were to get high right now i'd be so excited that i'd spend my whole buzz trying to decide how best to spend my buzz. it's happened before, and i always feel so pathetic when it does. i don't know what to do.

sorry if that was really disorganized, i just never get to talk about these things."
h2abk,8,2011-05-02,Closed-off SO is driving me insane. Is there hope or is this a lost cause? ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h2abk/closedoff_so_is_driving_me_insane_is_there_hope/,"We (19M, 19F) have been in a LDR for almost a year now. We've been friends for 6 years since high school (though some might argue about the intermittent 2 years). The distance has been extremely tough on her, but somehow we've made it through to this point. It's also become increasingly clear to me that she has trouble opening up (to me, to anyone, but her aggression is more noticeable when we interact). 

A particularly bad but revealing phone conversation happened last night. She called while I was sleeping, but I answered it anyway. She insisted I go to sleep but I asked her to indulge my request for once (i.e., to talk to her). Our previous phone calls have all ended on bad terms, so I really wanted to break the chain of bad conversations before I head home and see her on Saturday. 

Throughout the time we talked, I spoke to her encouragingly about telling me what's bothering her, but she would dismiss my concern, stating she doesn't have to tell me anything and she doesn't have anything to say. As the call went on, she became extremely rude and insensitive to how I might feel in reaction to the mean things she's saying and the annoyance in her voice. 

I was getting restless and upset, but I stayed calm. I asked her why she bothered calling if she sounds like she doesn't want to talk to me at all. I don't think she knew how much she was hurting me. At the same time I understand she has this irrational fear of getting close to someone because they might hurt her (note: her parents had a bad split when she was young; her dad's a scumbag). The conversation ended badly with me not getting through to her and us parting in bad moods again.

I've thought about giving up on this relationship several times now, but she's the best damn thing to have happened to me. She's transferring to a closer school this fall, and we made plans to live together for the summer while I intern in San Francisco. Everything seemed fine, but the week before I head home, this happens and the implications really hit home. 

I want a girl who's not needy but also isn't afraid to open up and confide in me because she, like me, takes solace in knowing someone else is there for her even when I can't help her with her problems. I need someone who wants to talk to me, because a LDR is hard enough as it is without the physical presence. Not incessantly talkative, but feels comfortable telling me everything. Why do some people feel the need to be so defensive? It makes no sense to me, because a closer relationship benefits both parties, whereas one that's closed off is ultimately a lost cause. Should I try to fix this shortcoming or move on? This problem drives me crazy, and I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR** Girlfriend has trouble opening up to me, becomes very defensive about my trying to get close to her, doesn't talk to and confide in me like I wish she would. It drives me crazy. Fix or move on? "
h1zgl,6,2011-05-02,I was just at the party outside the White House. AMA,tenspeedscarab,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/h1zgl/i_was_just_at_the_party_outside_the_white_house/,"Heading off some potential questions: to my knowledge, I did not make it onto a camera, I am 18, dual citizenship USA and Thailand, Democrat. I'm in Washington for an internship on the Hill.

I got there at around 11:30, when there were just a few people around. Then it started swelling. Lots of college kids from GWU, lots of beer and cigarettes. Lot of people tried climbing the lightpost, and one person attached a US flag to it. A guy in full body america flag spandex and Spider-man showed up. Anything you want to ask me, go ahead.

EDIT: To be clear: I was not one of the flag-waving, chanting frat guys. I was a roiling mix of anger, fear, sadness and confusion. I think the way the crowd was acting was incredibly wrong. No one's death ought to be celebrated. It's just wrong to take to the streets chanting when someone dies. It's what Fox News would have us thinking the barbaric Arabs would do. The double standard sickened me, and I was scared because I felt that if somehow, my thoughts were known to the crowd, I don't know what would happen to me. That's why I made this AMA. To get the word out: THIS WAS WRONG."
h1uv2,6,2011-05-01,I was turned down for my dream job...twice...help me remember that my career isn't everything in life,shattered_dreams,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/h1uv2/i_was_turned_down_for_my_dream_jobtwicehelp_me/,"There's a specific job I've wanted (for a specific company - not just the role) since my senior year in high school - 2006. Back then it was just a passing fantasy, a ""wouldn't it be cool if someday...""

But then in 2009, partway through college, there was an opening for the position, and I actually got the opportunity to apply and be seriously considered. I was up against tons of other applicants, so I wasn't surprised when I got the very nice letter (and personal) letter telling me that I wasn't quite qualified, but maybe someday.

Then in 2010, I was offered an internship with the company for which I wanted to work. During that time, I got to know a lot of people within the company, including the ones who make the hiring decisions. Soon after finishing my internship, I got a call from my former manager letting me know that there was another opening for the position, and that I was being considered for it.

They flew me across the country for the interview, and I let myself get my hopes up. I was under the impression that they had already made up their minds to hire me, and that this interview was just a formality (after all, I had interned for them, they knew me, etc). But I soon found out that three other people were being considered for the interview. Still, I thought the interview went well, and afterwards I was told I'd hear the decision within two weeks.

MONTHS passed, and finally I received a short email from them saying that they had decided not to hire anyone after all, but that I was on their shortlist if they decided to hire again.

So I graduated college, took a position in IT, and now work a boring 9-5 job in which I feel trapped and bored. And I feel like crying because of it every single day. I have no motivation to try to excel at my current job, and I also feel very little motivation toward anything else - I just keep thinking that my life would be perfect if only I had my dream job.

I have great family, great friends, am in a very happy relationship - yet I honestly have trouble caring about that. Jobs are such a significant part of life - they're where you spend roughly a third of your time, they're how you are able to provide even the basest means of survival for yourself. So I always told myself I was going to be one of those people with a job I love - that I would live to work, rather than working to live.

Reddit, please remind me that having a dream job isn't everything - that family, friends, and significant others are worth living for. Because I've completely lost sight of that."
h1rm7,1,2011-05-01,Getting back to the gym - seeking advice/recommendations on my routine,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/h1rm7/getting_back_to_the_gym_seeking/,"So I’m starting to get back into a routine and I thought I’d ask for some feedback/advice.   I read the FAQs (and read much more elsewhere) so please don’t tell me to go and do that, I’m posting this in hopes that someone has some advice personalized for me or can point out something I'm doing wrong.  

Some background info- I’m a 21 year old college student 6’3” weighing about 180-185 and have some previous gym experience but haven’t really been serious since last summer, and just started up again about three weeks ago.  It feels so good to be active in the gym again and I’ve convinced myself I’m never going to taper off again (and I quit cigs over a month ago woot!).  This summer I’m going to be working an internship back home so I’ll probably be working out almost every day.  
As far as supplements go I take animal pak in the mornings, recently started taking jack3d preworkout, and take whey post workout.
I recently bought starting strength but haven’t gotten around to reading it yet.

So I’m doing a split routine divided into five different days, usually in the following order:

**Chest**

* barbell/dumbbell bench press

* barbell/dumbbell incline press

* barbell/dumbbell decline press 

* cable crossovers

* dumbbell flys

**Legs**

* squats

* still working on this, need to start doing deadlifts but I’ve been too lazy to read up and learn about them

* seems like I don’t like a lot of the leg workouts but hopefully you guys know some that I should start doing 

**Back**

* wide grip pull-ups

* bent over dumbbell row

* barbell reverse grip bent over row

* close grip lat pulldowns

* hyperextensions (lower back)

**Shoulders**

* dumbbell shoulder press

* barbell front raise

* barbell upright row

* dumbbell lateral raise

* dumbbell bent over delt raise

**Arms**

* skullcrushers

* dumbbell bicep curl/alternate hammer curl

* preacher curl/barbell curl

* 21s sometimes

* reverse grip triceps pushdown

Some questions:
* The gym I’m currently at doesn’t have free standing squat/bench stations so I’m using a smith machine, am I really losing out on a lot by not controlling the weight myself?

* Are chickfila nuggets good for someone with a pretty fast metabolism trying to bulk (8 nuggets has 260 cal, 12g fat, 28g protein)? Now that I type those out it definitely looks like it’s a good option, and they’re so delicious and accessible on campus so I eat them pretty frequently..I guess I try to avoid fast food but when I get it I go for what I think would be high protein and relatively less fatty (ie stay away from fries, sodas,etc). 

* Any advice on getting those calories in as a college student?  I’m usually busy most of the day so I try as much as I can to keep eating but it’s not always easy.

* What’s better – controlled (slow) lower weight, or higher weight that I can’t control quite as well (not dangerous or anything)?  How many reps should I be able to do of a certain weight before actually moving up to it (ie doing 10 reps of 55 on dumbbell bench but only able to do 6, then 4 reps of 60)?

* Whenever I do my last set for a particular exercise, I immediately do another set with half the weight until my muscles are completely destroyed. I don’t know if that’s recommended but I’ve done it for some time now and it makes me feel like I take my muscles as far as they can go (ie repping 60 on dumbbell bench and can’t even get 30s up at the end)

* Any other suggestions/tips/criticisms?

Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.

h4aq5,6,2011-05-04,Does it ever get better?  Will it change?,throwaway5280,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h4aq5/does_it_ever_get_better_will_it_change/,"I (male) have been going out with my girlfriend for over four years.  We are both in our early 20’s and have recently graduated from the same college were we met.  We do not live together, but see each other often, and sleep over three times a week.  For the first three years our relationship was great, I saw her as the girl I want to marry.  However, this past year has been the toughest part of our relationship, and I don’t know if it is worth it to continue.


I will try to be as unbiased as I can be describing the situation, but that is almost impossible as I can only take an educated guess at how she feels.  Consequentially, this is all from my point of view.

   

**Background**


From my point of view, the trouble started last September when she started an internship and her MBA courses (she is part of a 1-year MBA program, so the course load is larger).  The large amount of work that she has is causing her significant stress.  Additionally, around this time she went off her birth control and became paranoid of getting pregnant.



Around the end of November my Internship ended, and I was turned down for a full time position due to cut backs.  In the mean time I have been working part-time in retail while I search for a full time job.  She has told me that she sees me as the man she wants to marry, so my difficulty finding a career has been a source of stress for her.  I understand how this affects her, and I am trying to remedy this situation. However I don’t think she realizes how hard it is to start a career in this economy. 

   

**Sex Life Problems**


Since September our sex-life has radically changed.  Her paranoia about getting pregnant meant that we started only doing oral sex.  Up until January, we would be intimate once or twice a week.  In the past three months I feel lucky if it is even twice a month.

She has made what I feel to be no effort to be more intimate.  I have approached this problem with her, but it has become a really touchy subject. I have talked to her about it, and she has agreed that it is her problem and she needs to change it, but I still feel like she hasn’t done anything about it.  This is a great source of stress for me.

   

**Relationship Problems**


I recognize the fact that she has been stressed with her work load, and I have offered to help her in any way I can.  I occasionally drive her to and from school, help with research, proof read her work, write study guides, and cook.  However, I feel that recently she has been treating more like an assistant than a boyfriend.  She has started to act like me doing these things are my job since I am not currently employed full-time.  I rarely feel any gratitude from her after doing these things.

Additionally she has been a lot more irritable and tends to snap at me quickly.  This has never been an issue until now, and recently I feel like I need to always tread carefully around her.  Right now, if I were to try to bring up any problems she will have a break down, and I do not want to be the cause of it.

I feel like this relationship has been almost entirely one-sided with me doting on her because she is always stressed.  If you were to ask me what she gives me in return, I would honestly have to think about it (though I could be blinded to it due to my anger at the situation). *Edit: I have had time to think about it, and there are plenty of examples of little things that she does that show that she still cares about our relationship.  They are just not that easily noticeable.*



She graduates from her MBA course in June, and has already discussed with her internship about full time employment.  By my projections, I HOPE to have a full time job by then as well.  My current plan is to wait until then before approaching her about how this year has been, when both our tempers are cooled and the future is not so foreboding.

So my question is:  Will it get better?  By the end of the summer when we are both gainfully employed will things change?  Will I get the girl I used to be with back?



**TL;DR:**  Girlfriend is overworked, has low sex drive, and is irritable.  I am looking for a job and feel like our relationship is falling apart.  Will it change?

**   **

** *Edit:* **


*In the interests of being fair, I should tell you that one of her complaints about me as of late is that whenever we do anything fun together, she feels like she has to be the one to plan it.  My excuse is the when ever I have tried to plan anything, it always falls through because she is so busy, so I have recently stopped trying.*"

h5egi,2,2011-05-06,STILL can't get over her,[deleted],relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/h5egi/still_cant_get_over_her/,"I'm still hung up my ex. We dated for 6 months, but it ended 7 months ago. My problem is, I can honestly say I've never been happier in my life than when I was with her. She graduated college in San Antonio about a month after we started dating, and moved back to Houston. We visited each other every time we could and things were going great. I made plans to move, attend the University of Houston, and work at an internship with a racing team. I lie to myself about it, but the main motivation for the move was to be with her. I wanted to marry her. Then, about two months before my planned move, she started acting distant and dumped me for no reason (that she would tell me). She said she just had a change of heart. The opportunities in Houston were still worth the move, so I went ahead with it anyway. We tried hanging out as friends a couple times before I moved, but even though she had said she loved me during our relationship, she was bringing new guys around almost immediately. I had been hoping once I moved we could reconnect, but that hasn't been the case. We haven't spoken once since I've lived here (4 months). I think that our relationship ended during the ""honey moon phase"" where everything is perfect, so I have her built up as the perfect woman in my head. I have to admit, the only flaw I can find in her is an immaturity with relationships. She's 23 but dates guys like it's middle school. When one relationship ends, it's right on to the next one.

I'm starting to see someone else, we haven't even kissed at this point, but I definitely like her. But I still think about my ex constantly, I even had a dream about her last night. I don't know what to do. I want to move forward, but I still can't get her out of my head. I feel like I'm trying to start a new relationship just cover up the old one.

 I'm afraid of being rejected if I try to reconnect with her, and if we started hanging out again I know my sole motivation would be to get her back. And even if we did get back together, I would constantly fear getting dumped again for no good reason. I'm seriously considering therapy at this point. I don't want to live the rest of my life fearing that the perfect girl for me got away. I know there are plenty of fish in the ocean, but let's face it, some are better than others.

Should I try to talk to her? Should I just ignore the feelings and hope they go away? Should I get professional help? She dominates my thoughts when I don't have something distracting me, and I'm sick of feeling this way."
h58ka,3,2011-05-05,6 Summer Weeks in England,TurnToReddit,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/h58ka/6_summer_weeks_in_england/,"Howdy! (Yes, I'm Texan and I say Howdy.)

Some background info:
I'm heading to England through a school program and will be an intern at HerpDerp Group for about 6 weeks. (Mid May to early July)
I've browsed through /r/travel and looked through a few posts and got some excellent suggestions. (Many thanks to OutofH2G2references).

However, I've actually got 2 weekends of my 6 weeks there taken up. I will be heading to Bath and York those two weekends. This experience will actually be my first time out of the US in some 18 years.

Can any of you give me some suggestions as to what the heck I could do with my spare time? I've got a few things in mind but some solid suggestions would be great. Also, I am looking for some fairly cheap things to do (though I realize England isn't the place to be for that) if possible. Considering this is probably one of the few time I'll ever be able to go outside the US, I think I can make an exception to the cheapness rule. 

Suggestions for ""you absolutely have to see -this-this-and-this if you're only going to be here once"" would be awesome.

By the way, how do the British ladies feel about not-so-bad-looking Asian Texans? Just wondering if anyone had the answer to this.

Thanks ahead of time."
h633z,3,2011-05-07,Last-minute summer housing needed! Beginning May 14th.,little-fish,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/h633z/lastminute_summer_housing_needed_beginning_may/,"Hey Reddit, I tried so hard to find housing on Craigslist and hitting up my in-person networks, but it's been suuuuper impossible for me to find a place to rent that's within walking distance of the Metro red line and within my budget (under 1000 or so but really under 900.)  I'm starting my internship on the 16th and feeling kinda screwed.

Anyone have any leads on housing? Anyone need to sublet their place for 3 months? I'm totally flexible and will crash on your couch for a couple of days if our dates overlap. 

Thanks Reddit!

Edit: Thanks for the replies so far... Like all good redditors, I've been checking Padmapper and Craigslist consistently -- the problem isn't finding listings, it's getting the people with listings to write back to me (which people have, but then they're way too far from the subway or decide to take some local and stop replying). I considered paying up for GW housing but the dates don't work and they don't have singles left for the summer. 

Edit 2: FOUND A PLACE TO LIVE! Thanks so much Reddit!"
h5t3k,4,2011-05-06,[FR] AA + house party + pub,Dorman010,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h5t3k/fr_aa_house_party_pub/,"Okay, just got back from the field, somewhat tipsy (4:35 A.M. here), so excuse any mistakes with this FR.

I come back from my internship, take the usual bus at the train station, when this *smoking* hot redhead HB9 sits in the same bus, wearing a tight grey dress. I am reading my book (in Hebrew) and try to get her interested, but then I remember that *I* am the one who needs to approach her. Got AA all over me and next thing you know, girl exits the bus. I spend the entire remainder of the bus ride and more kicking myself mentally for not even trying an approach. Get home by around 19:00

There is a house party at one of my female friends' places on around 20:00. I know I cannot get prepared on time (gotta shower and whatnot), so I arrive a total of around an hour and a half late. House party is meh, only social circle, so no real place for gaming.

At around 00:30, we move out to the centre of Brussels. Two of the group decide to go home, leaving us as a total of 3 (2 girls and me, one of them kinda HB 7, but not gonna try to game her). Eventually, I call one of our friends, and she and more mutual friends will be where we are in 5 minutes. We wait 10, and they still don't arrive, so we decide to go to the *Delirium* - basically Brussels' most notorious spot and, unknown by my female friends, a regular PUA are.

Fuck. So tired. Already 04:45 A.M. now... bite the bullet, finish this FR!

So we get to the Delirium. I decide to call my friends to see what's up. This is when things get interesting. A girl (HB around 7.5, let's call her Dancer) grabs me and tells me ""Let's dance!""

Me: ""I gotta call my friends.""

Dancer: ""Let's dance!""

Me: Or else what?

Dancer: she pulls closer to me, can sense some attraction in there (well, duh, she drew you in for a dance! I know, I know.

Me: No, really, I have to call my friends.

Dancer: I don't care. *continues dancing*

Me: *pulls her closer* Well, whatcha gonna do about it if I go? *smiles*

Dancer doesn't answer, but grabs my hands, so we dance a bit, and then she suddenly pulls away from me saying ""Very bad, D minus!""

I decide it's time to sit down, so I grab the nearest chair and another, and tell her to sit down next to me. I do some fluff talk with her with pretty heavy kino all the time, and then I stand up, and touch her armpits to make her stand up again (wanna dance again). Next thing I know, she's back with her friends without telling me anything. What the hell. Next!

That is exactly when my friends arrive, so we have some fun and laughs, then I notice a group of 4 girls, mostly HB7, standing next to the bar in order to buy a drink, but they're being hit on. I wait for them to go back to their table, make eye contact (keep the 3s rule this time), I stand up, walk to them, and start the conversation:

Me: ""Hi, ladies, how are you?""

HB7: ""Fine, you?""

Me: ""Well, I have a question for you - I saw you over there, from across the pub, and I wanted to come and talk to you. However, I don't know how. So, do you have any advice for me on how I should talk to you?""

She: ""You could start by buying my friends here a drink."" (she's the only one with a beer)

Me: *sits down on one of the chairs* Oh, I don't do that, as a rule of thumb. [fluff talk and some kino here, but I don't feel the attraction, so I eject as my friends are waiting for me].

Go back to my friends, talk some more, then I go to the bathroom. On the way back, I meet Dancer again. So I smile and say ""So, we meet again."" she says ""Yeah, I just have to use the bathroom!"" and taps me on the chest. I knew immediately what this was - pity tap. Meaning ""I don't really like you that much, but I'm going to touch you in order to give you some of my value and make us both feel a bit better."" I go to my friends and I sit there, looking for other sets to open, but there's nothing in this part of the pub. I notice that one of our friends has disappeared, so I go look for her. I find her standing alone, so I ask her why she's alone and not with the group. Next thing I know, some Portuguese guy comes and talks to her (and she likes him, 'cause she's 1) a slut 2)Brazilian). I go downstairs, where there also ain't a lot of people. I make eye contact with a girl (HB7) immediately, and walk up immediately.

Me: Hey, how are you doing?

She: *looks puzzled*

Me: How are you doing? *smiles*

She: I'm sorry, I don't speak English.


*BAM*. Dead in my tracks. I try Dutch, she speaks only French. Well, that's my cue. Time to leave.

As always, feedback is appreciated!"

Never been before. I will be living in Lincoln Park (edit: near N. Racine)  and half my time there will be commuting to Skokie, and the other half to the south (26th and California). I can take a car, but with gas prices, the distance I have to drive, and the unreliability of my junk car, I would rather just fly and rely on public trans if I can. 

According to Google, my public trans commute to those two areas (to Skokie, hoping a line and then onto a bus; to 26th, two lines) my commute would be around an hour (to 26th) to an hour and fifteen minutes (to Skokie). If I portion off two hours in my day to commute each way, how safe would I be in my estimate? Here in Pittsburgh, it's not unusual for a bus to just skip right past a stop during rush house because of lack of room on onboard. Is that common here? Realistically, how much time should I be adding on to my commutes?"

I remember back a few months ago, when i first started dating my girlfriend, all I had to do was think about her and I kissing and BAM, rock hard (she was my first EVERYTHING, including kiss, I'm 20, so that might be why there). That was about 7 months ago.

I did break it off with her recently, not getting into that. However toward the end of the relationship I noticed it getting much more difficult to get as hard as I used to be able to (for instance, on spring break, we had sex twice a day, no problem getting stiff). My erection was very easy to lose, like when getting a condom on, and sometimes it would get about half way. I still had sex with her like this, but I wasn't very happy with my hardness.

Now we have been broken up for about a month (I broke it up with her), and I can't get very hard even watching porn. The thought of just looking at porn and the videos used to get me hard. Now it is a struggle.

The semester is over and so are finals. It is summer time and I start my internship in a few weeks, so I don't see any stress in my life. 

How do I overcome this obstacle.

Edit: BTW no changes in diet or lifestyle. Still taking multi vitamin, only thing i picked up was i started taking ginkgo biloba for blood cirulation."

h8s10,8,2011-05-11,I am too weak... need advice.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h8s10/i_am_too_weak_need_advice/,"I guess I should start off by saying that I am kind of a dorky guy, and just ""broke up"" with my first girlfriend... The thing is, I can't help wanting to be nice to her... and I was wondering if this is normal or if there is something wrong with me, or maybe I am just handling this all wrong.

So we started dating when I was 21. Things started out well at first - I guess that's what they mean by the Honeymoon Period. I trusted her completely... but slowly things deteriorated.

She would argue with my about the silliest things. Things that she knows I am right about, but she would just argue to save face. She would sometimes not speak to me for days and call up ex-boyfriends or friends who had a crush on her during these times. I always end up forgiving her; I guess I am just too soft. But I think that's when I started to develop trust issues.

During winter break 09/10, she went back to China, where she was from. When she saw me after she came back, she told me how much she missed me, how much she realized I am the one she would want to spend her life with. A couple of days later, I found out that she had been talking to her ex back in China, and has been writing him long emails about how much she misses him and how much she loves him. When I confronted her about it, she says the emails meant nothing, that she was just trying to get revenge on him for cheating on her the first time around. I wanted to leave her then... but she got physically sick every time I tried to break up with her, so with her I stayed.

Things were fine for a while... then I found out she has been calling and texting this guy who was interested in her. A LOT. And everytime I asked her about it, she told me there was nothing going on. I asked her to respect my feelings and back off a little, because I did the same for her. She would agree, but never actually carry out her promise.

One day, she just called me and told me that we should be friends because she might have to move back to China one day. She started telling everyone that I was single... but pretended that we were still going out in front of my closest friends. I just went along with it... I didn't want to hurt her feelings... I guess we are not dating, but she doesn't want me to see anyone.

This spring, she was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She would bring this up every time I tell her about something that bothers me... telling her to leave her alone, cause she has problems. Three weeks ago, she left for another state for an internship... she told me that her phone died a couple days after she reached her destination, and that I shouldn't call and text her (which I used to do daily). I found out today that her phone never died, and that she's been in regular contact with a couple of the guys who she knows are interested in her.

My heart hurts. I don't know what to do. I know for my own sake I should avoid talking to her, at least for a little while. But I do know she loves me (after not seeing me for a couple months, she started crying the second she saw me and wouldn't let go of her hug), and she also has an anxiety problem, and I don't want to stress her out by distancing myself from her.

Sorry for the long post. I guess I just wanted some opinions on what I should do. Also... since she was my first girlfriend, I don't really know if all girls are like this? Am I being too sensitive? Any advice would be welcomed...

Looking for advice regarding possible internship.,Testicklish,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/h9sp5/need_help_getting_into_the_it_field_looking_for/,"I am a college senior who is required to complete an internship in order to graduate. My degree is in Technology Management and I have a potential internship that may come through.

I need help from the software community to help me ace a phone interview were I to receive one. So onto what the internship would entail. From what I understand I would be part of a team upgrading a large company from windows XP to windows 7. I am trying to get into the IT field but lack work experience. The only experience I do have is retail (work to get me through college) and personal computing at my home. 

If any of my fellow redditors could give me advice or if any of you have experience upgrading from some OS to 7, any information would be helpful.

Thanks!"
havgq,6,2011-05-13,I might be living alone with my dog next year and I need your advice.,husk4602,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/havgq/i_might_be_living_alone_with_my_dog_next_year_and/,"I'm an 18 year old University Student and I've just finished my first year of University. The past year, I lived with my 2 siblings. My second year of University is going to be a very different experience specifically because both of my siblings are temporarily leaving for year round internships. I'm essentially going to be in our leased house alone. I've never had to face the challenge of living alone and so after discussing it briefly with my parents they believe it would be helpful for me to have my dog stay over with me for the academic year.

I thought about having my dog live with me and I realised that similar to any situation there are positives and negatives. A positive would obviously be the companionship. However it could create many inconveniences for me, such as having to feed and walk him on a daily basis.

I'm worried about the idea of living alone because I feel that it's already going to be a challenge to be that much of an independent individual so suddenly (to the extent that I have to worry about what food I need to make, paying bills, managing the tough academic workload, having a good social life, exercising) I think that if my dog were to come live with me it would complicate things a lot more for me and generally making everything more difficult.

It's clear that the answer points to a no here, however after being on vacation I realised how much my dog is neglected by my parents. He's fed well but he doesn't get the full exercise and attention that he needs and I get the feeling he's a bit sad and lonely.

On one hand, I'm feeling guilty and want him to live with me because I'd know someone else is present around the house and he's a great companion. On the other hand I can't help but think that it'll become extremely difficult to manage everything and that I won't be able to handle such a complicated lifestyle.

I'd appreciate your advice.

hapv9,3,2011-05-13,4 Year Relationship (2.5 Years LDR) at a Crossroads.  Need Advice...,snkp360,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hapv9/4_year_relationship_25_years_ldr_at_a_crossroads/,"**Background Info**
* I'm 26 she is 23
* Met while still in college my senior year her freshmen Year (I did the 5 year plan)
* I moved about 4hrs away when I graduated 2.5 years ago for a career
* She just graduated and moved home about 1hr from where I currently live
* In about a month she is moving 8hrs away for an internship for 9 months

**The Story**
Our relationship has been great, but like a typical relationship it has its ups and downs.  We we have done out best to keep things interesting and exciting.  For the first part of the LDR (1yr) things continued on as normal, albeit not seeing each other that frequently due to school/work etc but we managed and made it work. Her senior year she went to study abroad in Europe for a semester and that's when things started to take a turn for the worse.  


She started pulling away from me, not really putting effort into the relationship and what seems to me not really caring about us anymore.  She ended up going abroad when things were still on rocky terms, after a lot of talking and soul searching we worked things out for the better and ended up strengthening our relationship even further, I ended up taking a trip out there for 2 weeks and traveling with her.


After the study abroad our relationship was amazing, I was going to propose in July, up until the past couple of months when she started pulling away and not putting effort in the relationship again.  I think a lot of this was due to her being overworked in school/trying to graduate/work commitments coupled with me not physically being in the same town as her.  This put the mentality in her that ""oh hes not here so I don't have to worry about it"".


To summarize the last 5 months we fought constantly and she was always angry or frustrated at something, leading to awkward and angry conversations between us most of the time.  I did my best to support her/be there for her/love her but never really got reciprocation.  When we would see each other on the weekends we could, things were good and we had fun.  But every other time is was frustrating and hard.


About 3 months ago it got to the point where we decided we needed a short 'break' (I know a bad idea) to re-evaluate our relationship and how we feel about each other.  I took it seriously, thought a lot about it and came to the conclusion that I still did want to be with her, but that we needed to make changes in our relationship, really putting in effort because lets face it, LDR's are hard.


We got back together and I was putting everything I had into making this work, she was moved back home now so it was a lot easier to get together, but still wasn't seeing any effort from her in the relationship, no kissing/hugging/intimacy since before the break.


I come to find out she really didn't do much thinking and didn't take it seriously because she ""knew she was going to see me and talk to me after the break"".  She also went out on a date with a guy friend of hers that has been hitting on her and they kissed.  I know we set ground rules about etiquette during the break and it was basically do what you want, but still it really got to me.


About 2 weeks ago I ended the relationship because I just couldn't take anymore. A great analogy someone told me is it was like running into a brick wall constantly, you can only do it so much.  After the breakup I drove to her house to pick up some stuff, she broke down crying and apologized for everything, saying she was sorry for taking me for granted, how she treated me and how she acted.


I still care for her and would do anything for her but I just don't know how I feel.  We are currently talking and trying to figure out how we feel about each other and the relationship, I know she wants it to continue but I am utterly confused. I am worried that the fact that she is leaving again in a month will restart the cycle of her pulling away from me and not caring about the relationship.


I am not looking for a direct answer or exactly what to do, because I know only I can make that decision.  But any advice /r/relationships has to offer would be greatly appreciated.


**TL;DR.** Girl of 4 year relationship, 2 years LDR has pulled away from me in the past and did it again.  We broke up and she wants me back.  I still care for her and want to work it out, but still have apprehensions because she is leaving again for 9 months.

hanql,1,2011-05-13,I got a graphic design job less than 1 month after graduation. Just wanted to share the news / what I learned about job hunting. AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hanql/i_got_a_graphic_design_job_less_than_1_month/,"There's so much job seeking / unemployment talk everyday that I thought I could shed some light and give some good ideas. I'm 22, renting in Florida, and just finished a BA in Art with a Graphic Design minor. I had 2 graphic design jobs in the past 4 years totaling 10 months of employment plus 6 months of retail work. Because of my spotty work history I had no positive job references, no connections, and filling out the employment history section was always a pain. I'm not even that good of a graphic designer. There are about 10 brochures/mailers/posters I actually feel like showing.

So with all that out of the way, here's what I did. Before I graduated, I revised my resume and made 2 different copies. 1 is for applying to art and the other is for graphic design such that the art resume listed galery shows and materials used while the graphics one listed design jobs and freelance work with long descriptions of duties. I used online job searches and applied to those despite not meeting all requirements. Those are generally a waste of time unless you are over-qualified and it can be just like throwing paper into the wind. You have to go out on foot. I drove to a copy placer and had 20 copies of each resume printed on decent paper for about $7 total. I used Google maps and searched for art or design places in a nearby area. I drove to each of these places, walked into the office, and asked to speak with someone about ""employment opportunities."" I got to speak with someone almost every time and even if they weren't looking, they still gave me advice and kept my resume. There is always something to gain from talking to someone whether or not you get a job. Before you leave, make sure you get their contact info and when you finally get home, send them an email or a letter thanking them for whatever. Applications are a waste of time. If you know your application won't say much, try to find smaller places or get as far as you can without having to fill out any long forms.

So it turns out the place I now work is attached to place that printed my resume. I walked in there and only one person (out of 6) was in the office. I asked her about hiring and she said they were thinking of an intern or something as they economy has turned up a bit and they have extra work. I showed her a printed portfolio (bring something physical with you along with a resume to demonstrate your skill) and gave the resume since she said she would show it to her boss. Despite me being a bumbling idiot that day and knocking over a stack of business cards, I went home and sent her a thank you email that also worked as a cover letter. I told her I had looked at their site and I liked their stuff and I attached a digital copy of some more of my work. The great thing about follow-up emails is that a place can easily lose your resume, and that email is easily forwarded to management. I found out later that I made a strong enough impression on the woman I spoke with that he was kind of advocating for me.

But it's not done yet. I got an email from the boss asking to interview, so I said yes to any time she would like and brought the printed work from before along with another resume copy. I learned the most I've ever known about interviews during this interview. It was nothing hard or grilling. When interviewing, the interview has nothing to do with you. It's not about what you have done or who you are. It's about what they want and it's about talking. You are not representing yourself, you are just talking. Do not think of it as drawing from the limited bank of knowledge including your past and your skills. You are actually speaking from an infinite amount of possibilities aided by your previous knowledge. If they ask you a question, yes or no should never be the end of your response. Every answer you give should be a longer demonstration of what you could be for them. If they ask you what you know about a topic, you must say far more about that topic. For example, if you are asked ""What do you know about compressing JPG images without losing quality?"" You tell them all about JPGs and then about GIFs and PNGs and TIFFs. It's also important to ask them questions. Be inquisitive. There's probably some questions you honestly would like to have answers to but you're too nervous to think about. If you just start asking, those questions will come to you and you will become more confident in your position. At some point, ask if you can take a tour of the workplace. This gives you another chance to see what they work with and to say for yourself that you can do what they do or that you could improve something. If there is a boss above who you interviewed with, ask to meet that person or see if you can come back when they are available. When you go home, send another thank you.

I was always hearing about people getting jobs with luck, and it discouraged me. But that's what job hunting is, you are looking for that luck. The job you will get is most likely not listed anywhere, it's just an idea being tossed around an office. Sorting for candidates and posting jobs is a chore for employers, so if you can find them before they have to go through that, you have a much higher chance of getting hired.

Hopefully my info can help someone. I'll be moving around a lot today so I'll answer questions sporadically. I cannot give referrals and I do not know of any openings anywhere."

From 2008-2009, I worked in the GE Tax Department as a 1-year state tax intern.  My responsibilities were to create state tax returns and annual reports for the GE Energy entities.  During my internship, I created over 600 state tax returns for various entities.  I was also in charge of filling out quarterly estimates and extensions.

I have worked with various state and federal tax employees there.  I will try to answer any question to the best of my knowledge."

My parents kept with the vow to the church at baptism to lead us through religious education until confirmation (becoming and adult of the church). Throughout my childhood and adolescence I believed in God. I was still shaping my opinions of him but I believed. I went to CCD or what many would call ""Sunday School"" weekly and was taught about the bible and taught how to be a good Christian. During class I couldn't help but think that half of the crap being spewed out by my teacher was utterly wrong and implausible. I was the kid in class who always had to ask questions or argue with the teacher. I'm sure I was an annoying little brat but those conversations helped shape and solidify my personal beliefs about spirituality. I won't get into details about what I disagree with or agree with because it really is inconsequential.

Everyone has different beliefs, values, and morals so therefor arguing my personal beliefs is fruitless. After I was confirmed by the church my parents stopped making us go to Church and this was right around the time high school started. Being the extremely angsty teen that I was I found solace in drugs, misbehavior and debauchery. I blamed all of my problems on everyone else. God, my parents, my friends and I did not blame the person who's fault it really was, Me.

I began to grow contempt for God, my parents and my friends. The more research I did the more biased I became. I started off as agnostic, than pantheist and then when I hit rock bottom in my depression I became atheist. I started reading loads and loads of atheist material online. Peoples rants about fundamentalist Christians, about why god can't exist. I believed it for awhile but over the years and through college it just didn't sit right with me.

I started to see the irony in these rants that atheist have. While, many atheist are good people and intend to do well, they start to become what they hate. They start to do exactly what the Fundamentalists do. They preach to other people about their personal beliefs and try to force them on others. I think many fundies and atheist mean well by what they do, but they really are just breeding insecurity which intern becomes hate.
Hate becomes violence, violence becomes war. After thinking this I thought to myself, I don't fit into either one of the belief (or non-belief) systems, so where do I fit in? I don't know if it's because unconsciously I feel comforted by the feeling of believing in something because It was instilled in me at such an early age, or if there is something more to it. I simply have come to terms with the fact that I simply don't know.
I have no proof that there is a God but I also have no proof that there isn't. The only thing I know is that when I pray to God and believe in something higher I feel better. Somehow I feel better. Maybe it's just psychological, maybe spirituality is a human instinct, or maybe there is something greater then us. I simply do not know.
Therefor I won't argue for one or the other because I do not know. I may have theories and arguments but I have no definitive proof one way or the other so I will not try to tell somebody how they should feel on the subject.
I will simply state how I feel which is the purpose of this submission to make people think. To solidify there own beliefs and to find solace in themselves which ever way that may be.

I was raised Catholic and although my parents were not devout Catholics, we still made it to church (usually). My parents kept with the vow to the church at baptism to lead us through religious education until confirmation (becoming an adult of the church). Throughout my childhood and adolescence I believed in God. I was still shaping my opinions of him but I believed. I went to CCD or what many would call ""Sunday School"" weekly and was taught about the bible and taught how to be a good Christian.  During class I couldn't help but think that half of the crap being spewed out by my teacher was utterly wrong and implausible. I was the kid in class who always had to ask questions or argue with the teacher.

hcv1i,1,2011-05-16,This guy I met on an internship is LITERALLY a 5 year old obsessed with poop,[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/hcv1i/this_guy_i_met_on_an_internship_is_literally_a_5/,"Not biologically, but mentally.

I'm a senior in college. Last summer I did a 6 month internship at a large, multinational company. I met this guy there who goes also goes to my school and was on an internship at the same place. Now let me start by saying this kid is 22 years old. I took him out for his 21st birthday. However I'm thoroughly convinced that mentally he's mentally a five year old.

Basically all he does is play video games. One of those kids. Except he doesn't even play intelligent games, he sits around all day playing his Wii. He once told me that he had stayed up until 5AM all week (while we were working) playing Carnival Games for the Wii. Or Mario Party on the Wii, with the baby minigames. That's the kind of games he plays all day.

While I was on my internship, he literally brought a backpack full of games to work with him every day. Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, connect four, simon says, stuff a 5 year old would enjoy playing. He literally had a backpack full of games like this on him at all times. We would play them at lunch sometimes, which was cool. I asked him if he could bring something like Chess or Uno (you know, something that takes more than the mental capacity of a 5 year old to play). Instead, he started bringing Mad Libs.

Now, this was all good and fun, for the first couple weeks at work. We would hang out at lunch and play games or pool. I would try to crack jokes, but they would always go over his head.

Him: ""Hey want to play doodie-ull?""
Me: ""What?""
Him: ""Doodie-ull. See, I took the word pool, and replaced 'poo' with 'doodie', HAHAHA!"" (laughs really loud and obnoxiously)
Me: ""...""

About the extent of his sense of humor.

And the fucking Mad Libs. We did a couple in the first couple weeks, each of us filling in the blanks with poop/gross related things. You know, like you do when you're 5. It's fun once in awhile. He could not keep his shit on the downlow though. He would always read these Mad Libs REALLY loud in the cafeteria, and laugh really loud and obnoxiously at them. While my coworkers were sitting nearby. Even after I would tell him to shut the fuck up, he wouldn't get the picture. After I quickly stopped participating in the mad libs, he would fill them out by himself, and then still read them out. LOUDLY. and laugh. really loudly and obnoxiously. Many times I just stood up and left in the middle of lunch it would get so out of hand. Once he literally sat there and read poop related mad libs out loud while the President and VP of this large, multinational company walked around and talked with people in the lunchroom. They didn't go anywhere near the table he was sitting at.

I thought it was obvious that you shouldn't act like that during lunch WHILE AT WORK. Aren't we trying to make a good impression here? This guy is 22 fucking years old. I figured he would have at least a cursory understanding of what's appropriate socially. I was dead wrong.

And it didn't start out that bad. He would just throw a doodie reference in there every once in awhile and we'd laugh. Eventually, over several months, it got way out of hand to what you see above. It was a gradual process. Saying stuff like:

""dude, keep it down""
""People are looking at us""
""Don't fucking shout""
""Dude, what is your fucking problem? Stop yelling about shit at the top of your lungs. This is supposed to be a professional environment.""

had no effect.

At first, I thought this kid was just a really good IRL troll. Because after all, who doesn't like a poop or fart joke once in awhile? But no, after knowing him for almost a year, I know that it's for real, and literally nothing else goes through that kids head. I would tell him this, sometimes rudely, daily. At first, we would talk about games, tv, music, etc, but he would ALWAYS degrade the conversation to poop, farts, and doodies. Every time. As time went on, there was less and less time spent talking about normal shit before he would start talking about doodies and laughing obnoxiously to himself.

Then the text messages started.

After I made it very clear to him that talking about that shit ALL THE FUCKING TIME, especially that obnoxiously at work, was not cool and he should shut up, he started sending me doodie text messages. Up to 5 or 6 a day. I would never respond or acknowledge them. Seriously, look at this:

http://imageshack.us/m/34/7797/snap20110415115836.png

Note, I went through 3 phones over that internship, so these are just some of the messages on the phone I currently have. They started about a month before that and continued across all 3 phones.

In 6 months, I responded ONCE to these messages. Here it is for reference:

http://imageshack.us/m/853/9049/snap20110415115756.png

Now again, I would get 5-6 of these per day, every day, AND NEVER EVER RESPOND. And he'd keep sending them. Eventually I blocked his number though my cell provider. No more messages. Until like 3 months later when I saw him in passing at school. I later got this from him on facebook:

http://imageshack.us/m/233/8835/74551698.png

Yes, he actually called me ""Charmander"". He refused to call me anything else.

I didn't get any texts though. Until a couple weeks ago when I got another one. Promptly sent him this (green message):

http://imageshack.us/m/577/3379/snap20110415115840.png

A few days later I get this:

http://imageshack.us/m/42/1529/snap20110415115845.png

Yes, after I blocked his phone number and told him, he used one of those web-based text message services to send me that.

Again, if I didn't know this kid personally, I would think he was the best, most devoted troll of all time. But no, this is literally who he is. This is literally all he thinks about and all that goes through his head.

A couple week ago I got this:

http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2694/snap20110501214605.png

Then I got on facebook and messaged him and told him he has no life.

----------

Anyway, how can I fuck with him? Despite the fact that sending me this shit over 8 months after I told him not to legally constitutes harassment, I considered outing him publicly on facebook, but he blocked me from seeing or posting on his wall.  I'm still FB friends with him, but can't view any aspect of his profile at all.

----------

Anyway, I posted this on another message board I go to a couple weeks ago and people got a kick out of it.  I figure people here would too."
hctf0,1,2011-05-16,Family is in extreme debt. I need a student loan/grant/scholarship/whatever to help fund my dream internship and final year of college. What can I do?,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hctf0/family_is_in_extreme_debt_i_need_a_student/,"Hi Reddit. I'm a 20 year old art student in Philadelphia. I've got myself a kickass (but non-paying) internship at Marvel Entertainment in NY and one more year left of college. I'm currently living in a beautiful and super cheap apartment in Philly that I'd love to keep, but I'm having some trouble. Moving back home is not really an option at this point.

I have kept somewhat good grades (A's and B's) and they'd definitely be higher if I wasn't working so much. I currently work as a freelance web designer with odd but regular jobs on the side. I also take a lot of free and underpaid jobs, just to get my name out there. I work really hard. I have the biggest dreams for myself and my work.

Today my family called to ask me for a pretty ridiculous sum of money to help them pay their mortgage. They're in a great deal of debt and living with them, is living in a very unstable and stressful environment. They've got two other children to put through college, so asking them to cosign a loan is impossible. I know this. I've got no extended family to ask to be a cosigner, as our family was basically disowned.

I'm just asking for a stress free summer and senior year, so that I can focus on my work and make the most of my internship. I have been working really, REALLY hard this far and I'm reaching my breaking point. 

And yes, I've gone to financial aid on several occasions and it sounds like they can't offer us any more. 

What options do I have left?"

My uncle who is going through a messy divorce asked me to come work for him this summer in the Arkansas Ozarks. I went down there for a week and realized that I would be working all day without getting paid pretty much at all.

Fuck that.

I am most likely taking a consulting position where I will be on the road most of the time.  This will usually be Sunday-Friday gigs and I will be doing them 2-3 weeks out of the month on the norm.

I have lost 26 pounds from my peak which I put on starting during my internship during school and continuing through my current position.  I attribute my 268 pound peak to a combination of sloth and poor diet choices. 

I lost the 26 pounds through diet control mostly but I have also put on a lot of muscle through weight training.  Currently I am strictly doing 5x5 routine 3 days a week and starting to get my diet under control again after my wife and I recently had our first son.

I recently had my first take of life on the road, and although rewarding from a career perspective I found it hard to control what I was eating like before and getting to the gym was more than a challenge.  Breakfast was easy since I had oatmeal from the hotel's continental breakfast.

I will be working with co-workers at client sites for the next few weeks, but after that I will be flying solo.  

My thought on fitness was to buy a set of resistance bands and start doing p90x instead of my 5x5 routine when I am on the road.  If there is a suitable gym available I will do SL5x5, but most hotel gyms don't have free weights.  I absolutely abhor running and I think I am still a bit too heavy to do any sort of distance jogging for fear of hurting my knees.  Currently I weight 243.  Recent low before my son was born was 237.   

For diet I had a couple of ideas.  If the hotel room includes a small kitchen, I could always buy groceries and cook for myself.  I could make a single grocery shopping trip when I fly in.  If I am eating out I could pretty much stick to lean protein or something like subway.  If I eat mainstream fast food it is pretty easy to track calories albeit not at all healthy.

Do you guys have any thoughts?

TL/DR:  Taking job where I will be on the road.  Any ideas for workout/diet to continue losing weight?"

Last summer, I was going through a lot of family problems. It was a lot for me to handle. I met a really great guy, and he wanted me to date him. I was not in a good place mentally to date someone seriously. At first I tried. We kept scheduling dates, and something would happen and I'd have to cancel. We spent more time emailing, texting, and talking on the phone than in person. He was understanding about everything and tried to be my friend, but in the end he said it wasn't enough. We stopped talking in January because he wanted more than I could give him at the time. He told me that whenever I felt ready to date, to let him know. He didn't want to turn his back on what we could have. 

Since then, I've been going to a therapist and getting help. My family problems are getting better. I finally feel like I am in a good place mentally. I want to contact him and see what happens. The problem is that I am about to leave for the summer for an internship. I am going to be on another continent until August. So should I contact him now? Or wait until I get back in August?

I feel so antsy about contacting him. I want to talk to him because I miss him so much. But I don't think it's fair to contact him when I won't be around for a while.

(Or making a move for that matter),[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hcb9i/iama_guy_who_is_terrified_of_asking_girls_out_or/,"I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Most recently, there is a girl who I would REALLY like to ask out but I just can't get myself to do it. She bought me Starcraft II for my birthday, a $60 computer game, and I still don't have the courage to do it. Here is a picture of it and the card she made for me http://i.imgur.com/yeRFf.jpg. (I posted this picture about a month ago to pics and nearly all the comments pressed me to make a move on her, to no avail though).


I don't know if there's a phobia or a term for this, but my fear of rejection is what keeps me from doing anything. In my mindset, I'd rather nothing happen than be rejected. I guess this can apply for other things too in my life, like I never try out for sports teams because I just assume I wouldn't be able to make it.


Experiences with this problem I can recall from elementary school; in 4th grade I wanted to ask a girl out so I made her a valentine card. I couldn't give it to her myself though so my rowdy friend had to practically steal it from me and give it to her. I wasn't there for it but he later told me she said it was against her religion to do it or something like that.

In 5th grade, a girl I liked more than a lot was practically best friends with me the entire year. Her friends even yelled at me for not asking her out and soon the year ended and it was too late because I wouldn't see this girl ever again throughout middle school and high school. She surprisingly goes to my college now and we smile and wave whenever we see each other.


The only time I've ever asked out girls has been on the internet, and once through a text to a girl who lived on the other coast of the country from me and I had only ever been with her during an internship. She accepted but we ended up never seeing each other again so we broke it off.


I'm not sure if anyone even has anything to ask me but I just really needed to get this off my chest somewhere. Who knows, maybe this will give me a chance to get kicked into shape."

I do enjoy .NET, but want to get my feet wet with something else.

I have played around with very basic PHP, but I want to do something more advanced. I have looked into CakePHP, but I don't know if that's a good way to go or not.

hd6ec,0,2011-05-17,Second abortion 2 weeks ago today. Then cheated on my boyfriend. Not able to cope. What do I do?,stuff_and_stuff,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hd6ec/second_abortion_2_weeks_ago_today_then_cheated_on/,"Hey Reddit,

I wrote the title to this post and felt like a monster, but there's no other way of putting it: it's what happened. I'm posting this to try and explain myself and get some help.

I had an abortion two weeks ago today. It was my second--I had the first one about two years ago and still think about it almost every day. 

When I told my boyfriend I was pregnant, it was 2 in the morning, raining, outside his apartment. He got really angry. 

His initial response was ""No"" and after we talked about it for a little while longer, I told him that I was thinking about ending the pregnancy. He agreed and told me that we were in it together but he needed some space to think and so I went home in a cab. The next morning I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood to get a medical abortion. 

Over the course of the week I moved between feeling complete despair and numbness, which had not so much to do with socio-cultural stigma or my even wanting to have a baby, but more this feeling that I'd really, really, really fucked up everything.

Medical abortion works like this: you take a pill at the clinic that kills the fetus, then you take another pill 24 hours later that makes your uterus eject everything. Lots of blood, severe cramping, lots of throwing up, for pretty much a full day. 

He went with me to the appointment, held me in the waiting room, took a nap with me when we got home. Then, he came over the next day and held me through most of the graphic, awful parts. And the next morning, I woke up and I could smile and feel okay because he was still next to me.

But over the next week, I went back to feeling numb or full of despair. We didn't really talk about what'd happened, I think because neither of us really knew how to. I guess I seemed outwardly fine, or that's what he told me.

Then, my ex-boyfriend visited me and my roommate. He'd been good friends with my roommate throughout college and we'd been on good, platonic terms for several months after not speaking to each other for four years. Anyway, long story short, we took a lot of xanax and drank a lot and then I cheated on my boyfriend.

Then, I ignored my boyfriend's phone calls for 2 days, lied to him, and kept taking xanax. Eventually, he came to my house and I admitted what had happened and everything fell apart.

It's been another week and I feel bereft and lost. I know that it's my fault--the relationship and the abortion, and that I have no right to ask for anyone's pity, especially not his, but I don't know how to cope with how I feel. I've let my job and internship slide, I'm broke, and no one but him really knows what happened. I feel like I need him and his support really badly in order to heal from this but I have no right to ask him for that.

Reddit, has anything like this happened in your life? What am I supposed to do now?"
hd69n,3,2011-05-17,I had sex with my ex and I really want to tell her current boyfriend,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hd69n/i_had_sex_with_my_ex_and_i_really_want_to_tell/,"Hi my ex girlfriend and I broke up over Christmas break because it was obvious that something was going on between her and some other guy (I had moved in the fall for graduate school). I thought we were in love she stayed with my family over Thanksgiving and I was suppose to stay with her's for Christmas. We were pretty serious to say the least I had plans to propose this Summer.

So, now she has an internship in my city for the summer.

She came over to my place several times last week and we eventually hooked up. When we were hanging out the next night I found out she had cheated on her current boyfriend(the guy who she ended it with me for) with someone else as well, and not only that, but had also cheated on me and every single one of past boyfriends followed by laughing. I know I also ""got on the good foot and did the bad thing"" but it is definitely evident that she is going to always do this. She told me that she just got bored easily, which is fine but she lets guys fall in love with her just to back stab them, and then tries to keep them in her life just to have someone to fall back on.

Should I let her current boyfriend know the situation? I would have really liked it if someone had told me before I got so attached. 

Oh, and I am never gonna talk to her again.

**edit** I told him,and he said he appreciated it. What's done is done."
hd4no,2,2011-05-17,"I need Career Advice, Reddit.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hd4no/i_need_career_advice_reddit/,"So I want to go into the film/tv industry.  I always have.  I went to college for Video Production, learned all about the ins and outs of shoots, and graduated in '09.  I kept hearing about how the job market in LA was awful at the time, so I stayed in my college town to direct a webseries, that I'm still finishing.  I then moved to Chicago last August to start my career in video production.  Since then the only production related job I've been able to get (other than a few random freelance gigs) was a four month, full time, unpaid internship in corporate video.  Everywhere I look for jobs it's all corporate video, or helping out for free or low pay on student films or low-budget indie films, or PAing on the few TV shows or movies that come here, but the people I know who do that have been doing it for years and are just professional PA's (not trying to knock PA's, it's just not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing).  

I know that I'm very young and have to work the shit jobs, I know that I have to PA and be the intern before I can move up, I'm just considering that Chicago isn't the right place for me.  I feel like I could work my ass off here and get into corporate video, which isn't my goal.

What I'm considering doing is moving home for a year, living with my parents to save money, and moving to Los Angeles.  I really want to live in Los Angeles, and the industry I want is there.  Should I leave Chicago when my lease is up in August to go home to save?  Or should I keep trying here in Chicago?  I love Chicago, I love living in a city, I DESPISE the weather here.  I'm at a loss, because I don't want moving home to seem like I'm giving up, because I'm not.  I'm just going in a different direction.  Now I'm rambling.

tldr: I moved to Chicago for video production but realized my dream is TV/Film, which really exists in LA.  Should I move home for a year and save up to move to LA?  Or should I not yet give up on Chicago?

hd0y4,1,2011-05-16,Help me create comedic art! Literally.,BreakingANDGentry,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hd0y4/help_me_create_comedic_art_literally/,"Dear Reddit,

I am currently wrapping up the second year of my degree and have noticed lots of my friends have internships planned or have started their own businesses. They have something they can be proud of, something that they created. One of them is even a diamond merchant and a millionaire. So I thought, how can I compete with that? I realised, I don’t want to compete in a business sense or as a way of making money, I would like to have something, something created from nothing, something to be proud of to show others.
This is why I have come to Reddit, to ask of the talent here, to help me.

During 2010 and 2011, I have been living in Mainland China and every-time I have thought of something funny, I have jotted it down. This has helped to keep me sane from the culture shock of adjusting. I have now accumulated enough items for about 40/50 sketches. I originally wanted to film the ideas and make a comedy sketch show akin to “Picnic Face” or “Derrick Comedy”, however after much thought, I realised there’s so much artistic talent on the net that I’d love to work with some people and make variations on the joke. If I could set the scenario, then Reddit draws their versions of it, then they are hosted on a website, a gallery of art from a theme.

I originally came here to find a single artist to work with, yet I feel, that I don’t want to create a “web-comic” everyone and their mother has done that. I don’t want a weekly news feed and a comic section, as a matter of fact, I want the term comic, to be insulting to what you produce. I am here to ask for some “starry night” raw-top of the line art. Make it surreal, make it pop-art, make it modern art. Make it watercolours. Just make it your own and make it art.
I’d like to describe to you one of the first jokes, 




**The Mine**

Panel 1:
A larger, almost Santa like figure sits at the head of a long table, his face covered in mud, his eyes red, the table is long and lined with all his catholic children. In the middle of the table sits one solitary pie, steaming away.


Panel 2: 
The panel zooms into the dark gloom of his face, to show his weariness.


Panel 3: His perfect house-wife cuts the pie into pieces, making sure to cut a larger slice for father, father’s mouth twists into a grim smile of approval.


Panel 4:
One of his angelic blonde haired children believes that today is the day to test his luck, throws down his chair and shouts “Why every night do you ALWAYS take the largest slice of this families meal? Why not share equally? Is it because you believe us not your equals despite being your sons?”


Panel 5:
The father flies into a Catholic Rage, the crucifixes and paintings shaking on the walls and bellows “Listen you BRAT! When you have spent every one of your snivelling little days down the mine like I have, you’ll know some respect!”

Panel 6:
Silence falls upon their home,they stare at their feet, too ashamed to speak.


Panel 7:
The soft glow of a purple neon sign illuminates all around it; the dumpster next to it, the abandoned cars. The neon sign reads *“The Mine”.* 


Panel 8:
Inside we see the father in a fake tacky and dirty miners outfit grinding a business man in a suit for money,  as the businessman, clearly skinnier than him, glances at his watch in boredom. (I want this scene to still be purple, illuminating the figures.)


P.s Sorry if my grammar or English is not very good, I’ve spent quite a while in China speaking and reading Chinese everyday and hearing people speak Chinglish. Sorry!
If this one gets a few entries and goes well I’ll start posting the others. Thank you

Edit1(Spacing)

TLDR: Let’s make some art, skip to the end for the first joke I’ve put up for people to try. Also shame on your for not reading my writing D:

I don't know how this will turn out, but tonight my heart is crying and for reasons I do not understand, I have no one to talk to.

Let me start with my bio. My name is Andrew and I was diagnosed bipolar and a.d.d. at age 14. I realized I was bi-sexual at a young age, although I have never had any opportunity to express my feelings, and have defensively repressed most of them. I spend most of my young life struggling with friends and dealing with these emotions that I could not explain. This could easily be the cause for my attraction to smoking pot. Outwardly, I have a good life, and am a gifted musician and an intelligent, passionate student.  

In my senior year of high-school, I met a girl named marianne. I loved her and she loved me perfectly for several years. She went on to a college 2 hours away from mine to study music, and I would visit her. With each visit, I felt her drift away until on one visit, she broke up with me. 2 weeks later she had a new boyfriend, and stopped talking to me completely.

I am now 20 years old and well along in my young professional life. This year at school, I met a beautiful chinese girl named Zoe who fell in love with me. We dated for a while, but I continually felt very detached. Before she left, she asked me if I even liked her and I couldn't respond. Now I have no way to talk to her.

Most of the time, i am very happy. Happy with the way I look, happy with my musical prowess, and happy with my excellent summer internship. Last night though, I had an emotional breakdown. I feel nervous and alone, as if I cannot deal with growing older. I can't keep my mind off marianne, although I honestly want nothing more than to stop torturing myself. Life is a blessing, and I love being alive, but I sometimes feel dead and corrupt. 

I don't want to feel this way, and I'm beginning to realize that depression is not something I can simply shrug off. I want new people in my life, positive people, but I cannot find them. 

Redditors, please. I don't know what I'm asking of you, or why I so badly need to get this out. I know I am a good man, and want to share myself with anyone. I thank you so much, anyone that responds. God bless us all."

I am a columbia university master's student interested in moving in Manhattan ASAP! I have to move in by June 1st, and have money ready! I am 22years old, female, and pretty chill! I love theatre, music, and being involved politically. I am super busy - I intern 3 days a week, go to class 2 days, and work on the weekends and some nights. I also make income from an acting troupe I'm in. I'll be a great roomie cause I'll hardly be in during the day and will come home late a lot of nights after working! I also don't smoke or have pets, but am totally okay with it and just a socializing environment if that is your place! 

I've been screwed over by so many people who were looking for a place with me, so I prefer people contacting me who already have a place and simply need another person to fill a room.

Also, I totally understand these places will be above 125th, I have tons of friends who live in the 140s, '60s, '80s and higher so I am fully aware =) Most of them I know pay $650 or less, so ideally I'd like to be in that range, but if not I can do up to $700.

The atmosphere in Göteborg, the music scene and the nature in entire Sweden really attracts me. Also, Sweden is said to have a huge IT sector.

Until now I've sent about 20 application letters to companies I found through work agencies, but only three were replied to. I think a part of the problem is not knowing anyone inside an IT business but only being able to communicate through those companies' outside mail addresses.

So, my question for you guys is, do you work at a company that does software development or something alike, do you know anyone who does or are you able to help me finding an internship in another way?
I'll send a traditional Haarlem beer (Jopenbier) and wooden shoes (if you'd like) to the person that helps me find the job. :D"

I am a very responsible college student who gets good grades, and is currently on summer break for one month before I leave for an internship. This one month out of this year I will not have anything to worry about. I enjoy relaxing in the evenings with friends or alone, toking up and listening to music. I also like to go crazy and party on select nights. Less than once a week.

The guy I have been seeing (I am a girl, by the way) is a huge drinker and partier, but HATES when girls smoke weed. He currently doesn't smoke (clean for 2 years) but before that, in high school, was a huge pothead. He sent to me two texts when I brought the subject up:

""Girls and weed just don't mix. I mean even when I smoked weed I still didn't like it. None of my girlfriends have smoked weed.""

and

""Idk just like a girl sitting there baked out of her mind. Not very attractive.""

Why does he feel this way, and what are some arguments I could use to suade him to being okay with my smoking?

hdy53,10,2011-05-18,My long term break so far.,ChronicElectronic,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hdy53/my_long_term_break_so_far/,"For the past two months I've been on a break from smoking. I thought sharing my experiences maybe able to help a few people.

First off, I am not quitting outright. I initially quit so that I could get clean for a drug test I may or may not have to take for a summer internship. One of the biggest challenges I faced initially was that I was still growing a few plants with my roommate (I have my medical recommendation). I also have a lot of friends that still smoke. There was just no way I would be able to avoid being around it.

This has definitely added to my cravings. The big things that helped me fight the cravings are: letting my friends know about my goal, keeping in mind my reasons for quitting, and my meditation practice. I began meditating about three weeks before I started my break. It has helped me deal with the withdrawal symptoms and the cravings immensely. It also gave me another reason not to smoke: having a clear head greatly improves my practice.

The hardest time I've had so far was 4/20. It was the day after my 21st birthday, so I was really hungover. I've learned to rely on marijuana to help with hangovers, so it took all my will power not to smoke that day. Hangovers are still my biggest trigger for cravings.

I am looking to start a side job to make some money this summer (my internship doesn’t start for a couple of weeks and doesn’t pay much). I want to start a cleaning and organizing service. I am also open to pet sitting and babysitting. Would appreciate advice on how to get this started.  I was thinking about posting on craigslist but was a bit concerned about who might respond :/ . So I thought I would start here and see if anyone could point me in the right direction or to see if any redditors were interested and in need of a home/office cleaning and/or organizing service.  The organizing aspect would include getting papers in order (i.e., for an estate), closets, desks, and basically anything you have been putting off because you just don’t know where to start!

Please let me know: if you are interested; how I can get started with this (i.e., if there is a website that caters to this); how much is usually charged in NYC and Brooklyn; and/or any other helpful info.

I may have a friend joining me as well but not quite sure yet.

I am meticulous, organized, trustworthy and ready to work so I can cover my expenses!

I would really appreciate any help you could give me :)

If you are interested or want more details PM me.

Tldr; trying to start a cleaning and organizing service (as well as pet sitting and babysitting) and wondering if anyone is interested or can give advice on getting started.

- I want to see other places and meet new people.
- I want to be more confident.
- I'm jealous of people who can say they've served.

I'd like to know if there is some branch where there are similar people to me. Also, I want to know if there is a branch where I can do computer related work, but also get to see other countries.

If I'm missing any vital details, let me know. Again, I barely have any concept for which branch does what, and I also can't really differentiate the different ranks.

heojg,6,2011-05-18,Is it possible to gauge sexual compatibility with someone who is a virgin?,GermanArmyHelmet,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/heojg/is_it_possible_to_gauge_sexual_compatibility_with/,"Hi! Not sure if this is the right place to post this question. Please redirect me if there’s somewhere better!

**TL;DR** - My girlfriend of about one year is a virgin. We get along great generally. Is it unfair to base thoughts about “sexual compatibility” on how we interact now, or should I wait until when/if we have sex?

Her age: 24
My age: 27

-----

Dear me... I seem to have lost track of how long this post is. Sorry if it’s too long!

Although intimacy is the primary topic of this question, it’s possible that any issues are elsewhere and this is a side effect. 

I’ve been dating this wonderful person for about a year now. We’d known each other for about two and a half years prior to this, so we certainly weren’t strangers when we started dating. 

We get along well. Fantastic is probably a better word. When we’re together every concern is forgotten and we don’t have a care in the world. We frequently lose track of time and are both happier when with each other. That is, until we go to my place to hang out or go to bed... She seems to stay the same, but I’m starting to get frustrated and bummed out when we’re at my place or in bed.

We talked about sex fairly early on after our make outs got more exploratory and physical. She’s a virgin, I’m not, and our idea of when sex should happen is fairly aligned (couple should be happy with each other and comfortable in the relationship). We don’t have sex, but that’s not to say we don’t do anything at all!

Physical interaction followed a natural progression of how far we went over time. Kissing, making out, touching, removal of shirts. Pants/etc have never come off, but we have “satisfied” each other despite this. This is where it starts to fall over though.

Maybe 8 or 9 times out of 10 she tells me she doesn’t want me to move my hand south when I make motion of it (obviously not in those words!). The times she has allowed it usually only last as long as it takes for her to satisfy me (obligation perhaps?). Only 3 times of those have I been able to pleasure her, at least as far as I can tell.

At first I thought this is fair enough. She’s a virgin, doesn’t want to rush, all that business. We were at this point about 4 months ago. It hasn’t progressed past this at all in any form, and if anything our physical interactions have decreased.

A couple weeks ago I was really in the mood to give her attention and satisfy her. Her satisfaction always comes before mine (which really bites when she doesn’t let me), but the feeling was particularly strong  this time. We’re making out on the couch and I take her in to the bedroom. I light a couple of candles so we can see what we’re doing, but so it’s not so bright she’s self conscious. I give attention to everything I can without rushing, and try my best to make her feel beautiful and special, and more importantly, comfortable. Things progress and I make motions towards satisfying her, and she asks me to stop after just a moment.   Massive buzz-kill. Regardless, she continues for me. 

As soon as it’s over, bed covers pulled up, her shirt back on.

As we’re getting ready for sleep a bit later on I ask her why she won’t let me do anything for her. She answered that she’s embarrassed at showing any signs of pleasure.  I try to empathise with that, but I don’t really understand it, especially after natural physical progression over a reasonable period of time. I don’t care if we don’t have sex, but nothing at all after what we’ve done? In the past I’ve also asked her if she’s physically interested in me, which she’s answered in the affirmative.

Since when I last asked her we’ve done nothing beyond hugs and basic kisses. Admittedly, I’ve backed off to give her some space in case she feels pressured, but also to see if she initiates anything. This is something else that is prominent in my mind and overlaps with intimacy. She never seems to initiate anything (intimacy/dates/outings/etc), is always keen to doze after work (she’s an intern at a hospital and works long days), and doesn’t really show any visible level of interest in general, despite being quite attached to me and telling me I mean a lot to her.

I have absolutely no interest in forcing or manipulating her to have sex with me, or do anything to get my own personal satisfaction via her. Obviously I have my own drive that wants satisfying, but more than anything else I want to satisfy her and make her feel awesome.

There are many thoughts that have risen over the last few months out of this, one of which is whether she’s genuinely interested in me in general (physical interaction can be a good litmus for other issues I guess), but there are two or three major things for me:

1 - I don’t know how I can satisfy her in any way (including non-physical things); she can’t suggest alternatives after discussion about this. I feel completely useless and unable to do anything to bring us closer as a result

2 - When she stays over I’m often awake until after 2am due to sex drive. I get grumpy and tired as a result, which affects work, fitness, social interactions, she thinks I’m upset and feels bad for me not sleeping (whether she’s aware it’s libido or not, I’m not sure), etc...

3 - Through the course of her satisfying me, and not letting me satisfy her, I’m starting to catch moments where I think only of my satisfaction. This **really** guts me, and thinking selfishly like this is the last place I want to be... I used to imagine all the things I wanted to try on her, but these thoughts far less frequently cross my mind now.


I have no intention of breaking up with her as a result of all this at this point in time, but if she has a naturally low sex drive or just isn’t interested in sex in general, it will cause issues down the track, especially if/after we have sex.  I feel a bit selfish saying that, but if I’m thinking these things now, what will it be like in the future?

So, after this small novel, my question.

Is it valid to gauge sexual compatibility with my girlfriend, a virgin, before we have sex? 

Secondary question: is it likely that this is an indication of where our relationship is at, or perhaps some confidence/esteem issues she might have?


If anything needs clarification, or more info, don’t hesitate to ask. Although this seems centered around sex (it’s certainly a very prevalent issue in mind), I would not be surprised if it’s a secondary thing resulting from something else."

She has an 8 year old son and I've become a father to him now, he's everything to me. Obviously it was a very strange situation at first, but I'm a great dad (I'd like to think) and I take care of both of them with everything I have.

We got together during my Sophmore year, dated for a year, then moved in together and have been ever since. I love her with every bit I have to give, but it seems she's always finding a reason to be unhappy with me. I'm not sure why. I honestly believe that from her past experiences, she doesn't believe she deserves to be happy, so she finds fault with anything she can, that's merely speculation though.

Well, lately she's been talking about being unhappy in our relationship, and I'm about to leave for 3 months for an internship 2 hours away. I'm worried that she's going to see it as the time to leave me.

I don't even know where to begin. I have Social Anxiety and don't deal well with stress and confrontation, I'm a very chilled out person so it's never been a huge problem except in situations like this.

Essentially I feel like the life I've woven together for the last 2 years is near it's end, and if it goes that way I won't know how to handle it. Moving out, leaving who is essentially my son of 2 years, and being alone for the first time in 2 years, out of college with no set plan.

I will do everything I can to keep her, I've always sacrificed everything I had for her and will do it all over again, but I'm afraid it might not be enough this time around.

Advice? I'm slightly scared.

Edit: Last night she came to me crying at 2am, saying that she just didn't know anymore and that she wanted time apart, I'm leaving soon for my internship so I'm thinking after a week or so of being gone she'll decide if she wants me or not. I'm slowly starting to get over the initial shock, and at this point I just want her to make a decision so I can get out of the hellish torture that is wondering if I'm going to have her or not. If not, I'd like to start getting over it, if so, I want to feel like my fiancee loves me again. Either or. Tired of the games."
hfhd4,15,2011-05-19,When to say when and when to hold on,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hfhd4/when_to_say_when_and_when_to_hold_on/,"Hey, I have been seeing my fiance for about 7 years, and we have been engaged for two years. We're young (26). 

The last three years have been long-distance (seeing each other every two months or so) and at least next year will be long distance as well (I am in school).

We've already had bumps along the way (he broke up with me for a summer, three years ago, when we first realized that we would have to be apart) and I know he has questioned the relationship at other times as well (earlier on). 

He has recently told me that he is again wondering if we are doing the right thing. He thinks all of the distance has caused us to grow apart/become different people. BUT he says he just isn't really sure. 

What makes it even harder right now, is that we are actually seeing each other every weekend for the whole summer (I am doing an internship in a nearby city). Things feel totally fine when we are together. I see his family all of the time too, and am really close with them. Unfortunately, people keep asking us when we're going to get married, which is awkward, considering he isn't even sure we should be together right now. 

He has left it at, ""lets see how the summer goes"" but I don't know how much more ""doubting"" I can take from him (even though I understand it, and appreciate that he is trying to be honest).

Is it a sign that we shouldn't be together, but its been so long that he's just having trouble ending it (he's so comfortable that it is confusing him)? Did we get together too young? Will he (and maybe even me) resent the other person for taking away so many of our ""carefree"" younger years, when we could be dating other people? Has anyone else ever bounced back from this kind of doubt to have a good relationship? 

I don't want to end up being his bitter ex-wife down the road....
But I did always picture being with him forever, and used to think I could handle anything for the both of us...

Didn't think about her much after that, since business is business. Bumped into her again a couple weeks later when we were both with our group of friends and I noticed two things:

* When I said hi, she shook my hand with her mouth agape. At the time, I asked her why she was so surprised to see me. 
* While we were both waiting for our friends, I sat down on the bench, and she turned her entire body towards me, sat cross-legged, and randomly suggested I try strawberry spinach yogurts, because they were the best things on earth.

Her: You know what you should try? Strawberry spinach yogurts. They're the best!

Me: Spinach? That sounds like one of the worst ideas I've heard all day. I'm going to file that one under ""bad ideas"".

Her: No! You defn have to try it. It's delicious.

And when we were done waiting for our friends, she mentioned it again as she was leaving. All the things together, I took as an IOI.

I don't like mixing business and pleasure, but I usually regret thing I don't do, rather than things that I do, so I shot off an email to her a week later, saying I thought strawberry spinach yogurts were a bad idea at first, but I wanted to try it and asked if she wanted to join me.

The answer came back yes. I can't take much credit for a pickup here. When she's interested, you just have to make sure you can read it, and pull the trigger, even if you're not 100% sure.

She invited me over to her place to cook together and make yogurts as a first date. She lives in a house with at least a dozen to two dozen other people with a large communal commercial kitchen, so I don't think it's what you're thinking.

I've been learning to keep my conversation lighter. I tend to ask about things that are more heavy in nature, like their jobs or their goals, when I let myself slip. You never want to have a girl talk about things that depress her mood, since she'll associate that feeling with you.

She was telling me about how there was a naked body painting party last night, and that's why there was a bra hanging from the ceiling. She said she didn't attend. Mistake here is that I could have done better here to escalate and tease her about lying about attending to start a push/pull

I did do some kino, mostly hand on the knee in brief for emphasis. I did find a way to kino when we were talking about allergies. 

Me: You got a cold? You're sniffling. 

Her: No, I have allergies.

Me: Have you ever had an allergen test done?

Her: No.

Me: here [takes her hand], they take your arm, [pushes up her sleeves], and then they poke you with different kinds of allergens, and see which one welts up. [pokes her forearm repeatedly]

It was just kino I made up on the spot, though I don't know if it's a good idea to associate my kino with allergies. In addition, she pulled her hand away first. I really should have dropped her hand first, akin to Mystery's kino advice.

In hindsight, I could have also added high-fives to the kinoing. When I tell her good news, she usually replies with 'alright!'. That's a good time for a high-five kino. lesson for next time.

We cooked and ate, and the funny thing about a communal kitchen is that the housemates will just gravitate towards prepared food. Hardly anyone was walking around when we were cooking, but when it was done, they just seem to come out of the woodwork. It ended up being a crowd of us and 4 others eating in the kitchen. I was able to talk and joke with them on various topics, all of which I was able to converse something about--which I assume is a DHV.

I was able to re-isolate her by mentioning that we should eat the (small) dessert that I brought, and we ended up sitting outside her place on another bench, and just talk and eat. Good convo, though I can't remember what we talked about.

Here, the only kino I managed to do was wipe some dessert off the corner of her mouth, and the usual arm and knee touches in conversation. 

No k-close, as I mistakenly kept walking with her back into the house and then decided to leave, rather than deciding to leave before we had entered her house at the end. She initiated a hug before I had much time to think. Then as I was walking away, she told me that I should give her a call and we should hang again. 

No yogurts were made, but I think overall, she had fun. And yes, I should have k-closed much earlier, esp with the dessert wiping off of her face. I need to stop thinking that the end is the only time one can k-close. Some texting back and forth since the date, and she's game for date #2. We're actually going to go get yogurts next time. And next time, I will escalate much faster."

We decided to make curry, and she wanted to put all sorts of vegetables that don't usually go into curry like asparagus, yams, and green peppers. That made it easy for me to tease her about her dubious taste, and that I wasn't sure that if her choice in curry vegetables were so abysmal that I could trust her taste in smoothies.

Cooking was fun, though there was far less kino cooking together than I thought there would be. At one point, I actually couldn't figure out how to work the can opener. If that was an intelligence test, I had definitely failed it. But I eventually got it open but managed to splash some all over and on to her pant leg as well.

I'm currently beginning a pretty severe personal financial audit. I've gone from good to bad to good financial habits over the last few years, and last year was really good for me - I worked a range of jobs with multiple income streams and went from 2.5k in credit card debt, to paying for moving overseas (4k flights / insurance / admin stuff), upgrading my camera gear (an earner for me but still pricey at 4k) and having a wee bit of a savings buffer.

This year, I am earning practically nothing, as I am undertaking a low paid internship where I'm trading off pay for developing skills, learning and experience in a field I'm really passionate about but have had limited experience with professionally (travel).

I've moved countries, and I'm using this as an opportunity to redesign my life. Consequently, I would like to create some good habits, and one of the things I foresee as being really beneficial for myself is backing up my bank statements and other important financial information from the last few years and creating cloud copies, so that if I encounter computing errors I have additional protection of this information. I was undertaking a business for the last few years within Australia as well as receiving business development grants and working a range of jobs, so my financial situation is complicated compared to a standard single employer worker.

What I'm not so certain about is security. I'm Australian, and last time I checked Mint.com wasn't available to me (although this may have changed). I'm currently living and working in Germany and now have bank accounts in Germany and Australia, with two forms of currencies.

What is a good option for this type of goal? I have a private web server and I can store quite a lot of information on that, but I'm unfamiliar with online security practices like password encryption and hiding this stuff from Google trawling. Would I be better off finding a site that's designed to take care of this type of stuff?

My main worry with something like this is the potential for identity theft - if someone could gain access to wherever I end up storing this information, there is a severe risk of basically handing all of this information to someone...

I plan that at some point within the next few years (sooner rather than later if I have any say in the matter) my earnings will go back up again, and at that point I will probably benefit from seeking financial advice from someone who is familiar with the complications of Australian/German accounting headaches, but for the short term there is no practical way that I can spend money on advice like that.

hh8x2,4,2011-05-22,Should I try to get back with my EX or move on?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hh8x2/should_i_try_to_get_back_with_my_ex_or_move_on/,"95% of the time I would agree that moving on is always the best decision.  It's part of how I am coping with it now but if you are willing to read all of it(I will do my best to not wall of text you to death), please let me know your opinion.

So here's some basic description of the two of us.
*Imo, she is basically your typical ""perfect girl.""  Stunningly beautiful(imo), great personality, smart.  She matched my personality very well.  Not extremely out going and not many close friends other than myself.

*She is 2 years older than I.

*Dated around 5-6 guys prior but each relationship lasting no longer than a year

*We have been dating for almost 3 years.  For the longest time it seemed that we were going to get married.  I wanted it, she wanted it(until now).  

*Already met the parents.  We get along very well and have had dinner many many times.  Pretty much had approval from the get go.

*The past year we moved into a 2 bedroom apartment and around the end of April she dumped me.  

*Reasons do not include seeing another guy, me cheating, her cheating, any sort of wrongdoing on both parts.  

*I still love her to death.

**Reasons why we broke up(that I can think of):**

**1.  Demand for Sex.**  
Before you make false assumptions, our sex is great.  We are very comfortable with each other and are able to get each other to climax with no problems.  We are both physically attracted to each other.  Now to get back on topic....I was often unhappy when she would continuously reject my requests for sex before we go to sleep.  Understandably she was tired because she has work, but I don't think I was overdoing it.  Usually I will never ask her after a 12 hour shift day of work for any fun time.  Normally I would not ask but if 2 or 3 days go by I will ask.  I don't think it's too unreasonable in that case to get some action.  When it goes on for a week I will noticeable be a little frustrated.    

**2.  Our living environment.  **

We are both pretty messy individuals so our place often times gets pretty messy fast.  We are both very tolerant of it but I sometimes think that if I had been more clean and provided a nicer living environment for her things may have been different.  

Also, in the past year we went and started raising 2 kittens and a puppy.  I did not know I would have a negative relationship with cats until we started raising two cats.  Since I was always more of a dog person I was not used to how cats were not as loyal and loving.  Quickly I began to hate the cats and often times was visibly frustrated at them.  The added on responsibilities of raising cats, housebreaking a puppy may have been too much for us to handle.  This definitely added on additional stress.

**3.  Relationship gone vanilla.  Got too comfortable.**  

In the past year we haven't had as much time to go out and do things and explore life.  She being a nursing student and also working full time during the weekends, it was hard finding time to spend time and have fun together.  Simply going out to dinner doesn't really cut it.  I'm talking more like going out hiking, traveling, trying new things, exploring life.  It's hard to blame this on either person as we are both college students with heavy workloads and the fire in all relationships eventually die down.  I was still very happy with the relationship as is.  In fact I was still very much in love with her.  I figured that when I graduated and started working I would be able to do this again.  It seems that she did not feel this way.

**4.  Age?  Inexperience?**

I am 21 and she is 23.  She has dated 5 people prior and me only 1.  Her stints last around 6-8 months normally and my previous gf also lasted around 2 years.  


**5.  I put too much responsibility on her to making me happy.**  

During one of our post-break up conversations she told me that she always felt pressure because she felt that I found nothing in life to make me happy other than her.  This is slightly true since most of my time is spent studying and going to classes, and coming home and seeing her does bring great joy in my life.  I don't see this as anything wrong.  I would have thought this was a plus.  Inversely, I haven't had as much time to pursue hobbies or do things together as stated above in #3.  I spend much of my time in front of a computer either surfing or doing homework.




**The Break-Up:**

Ever since March, she insisted that we should move back into separate 1 bed room apartments side by side to each other.  I did not understand the reason for this as we would have had to pay much more money.  This argument persisted until she blurted out that we should break up.  For some reason it did not occur to me that the reason why she wanted us to move out was that she probably did not enjoy living with me anymore.  


**Coping with the breakup:**
I will admit that it was excruciating.  Considering it was around the time I needed to really gear down and study for finals it was very difficult to harbor my emotions.  It also did not help that we had to still live together until 5/25/2011(next week).  It was very strange because during the day we would act as if everything was normal and we were good friends still.  But, when night time came and I had to sleep alone, I felt immense pain and felt very lonely.   It was a very difficult month but friends, exercise, and pursuing old hobbies has helped distract me.  I feel like I've survived the experience and have matured greatly from it.  I've begun to find more ways to enjoy life and myself instead of putting all my happiness into my girlfriend.






 Now, Reddit.  Here is where I want to get your opinion.  She has had some pretty interesting things which make me wonder if it means that she still has feelings for me or not.  Reddit girls, let me know what you think and what a typical girl is thinking when they do these things.  

**These events occur post break up**

**1.  She offered to let me live with her in her 1 bedroom apartment.**

She began to feel guilty about having to make me go live in a 1bed which is noticeably more expensive than splitting a 2 bed and making me and my dad pay more.  I would be sleeping in the living room while she took the bedroom.   Seemed kind of strange but I accepted and it seemed as if we were both very happy with this decision.  The next day she changed her mind and decided not to let me move in.  

**2.  Chasing me at school.**

One time I drove to school while she walked because she wanted exercise.  I arrived at school and parked in the parking lot.  Suddenly I notice someone tapping my shoulder and it ended up being my ex who had ran across the entire parking lot to catch up and walk with me.

**3.  Asking me to pin her at her nursing graduation pinning ceremony**

Usually this is considered more important than your typical graduation for nursing students.  Usually, students have their parents come up and put on a pin or medallion over their neck in diploma handing out fashion on stage.  She wanted me to do it for her because I was her ""rock"" through the past 3 years and she felt she couldn't have gotten through nursing school without me.  I ended up rejecting the offer and told her mom to do it considering her family was going to be present.  I ended up attending this event in one of my best suits with roses and she looked very happy and also complimented on how good I looked.  I told her that she looked amazing in her dress and she lit up when I told her this.  

**4.  Still having me over for dinner with the parents post breakup**

Her parents came up to school to attend her graduation and in the past couple of days I had been invited to all their dinners and activities.  It was definitely a bittersweet couple of days.  While I was very happy to be around them, it hurt that I wasn't spending time with her family as her boyfriend.  During the past couple of days I would look at her and feel extreme pain because she wasn't mine anymore.  

**5.  She wants me to move into a 1bedroom close to hers**

Self explanatory.  She still wants me to be near by.


*Overall, her actions have had a negative effect on me trying to get over her. *




Conclusion:
I will be working during the summer at an internship out of town and I  see this as a break for the both of us.  Should I shut off all contact with her and then continue to pursue her when I get back or should I start seeing other women?  Some of me wants to move on and see other girls but I also feel like if I let her go I will regret it for the rest of my life. I don't think that I am being blinded.  I really feel that she is everything I want in a woman. I am still head over heels in love with this girl.

So, reddit.  What do you think?  Should I?


TLDR version:

Perfect girl breaks up with me after 3 years.  I think she still likes me.  Should I use the summer as a break and try to slowly get back together with her again?

I've just finished my first year of grad school at NC State in computer science. I'm a contributor to many different free software projects: Linux Kernel, X.Org (X server, Mesa, pixman, drivers), ioquake3, ... (just google my username) and I'm a Gentoo developer.

I'm in Raleigh. Apartment's paid for through the summer, girlfriend has a job here. Can't really go very far.

Let me know if you've got any suggestions. Thanks!"
hh1e3,11,2011-05-21,"Girlfriend wants a poly relationship, I'm still uncomfortable with parts of it but willing to listen (x-post polyamory)",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hh1e3/girlfriend_wants_a_poly_relationship_im_still/,"First, let me apologize in advance for my lack of knowledge of proper terms: this is new to both of us and tend to explain ourselves at length for the sake of clarification.

**Us**: dating for 2+ months (feels like so much longer for both of us), extremely communicative of whatever the situation is. Both in college, she a grad-student(F/22), I going into my senior year(M/21).

**Present**: She is travelling in Israel in her birthright, with plans to extend the trip to England and Copenhagen to visit family, eventually going back home to visit family then coming back to where I am presently. I am up in between summer jobs, waiting to hear back from several places ranging from internships to day camp.

**Situation**:Before we started going out she had mentioned that she just got out of a serious monogamous relationship 3 months prior. And that never having been single since high school, had her first casual relationship in the interim. At that time, she told me that she could back out from that while still remaining friends (they had known each other for a year prior).
From the time we started going out, she had mentioned that she was interested in sexual relationships with other people. She would mention that she could go off and try other things, and then bring them back to us. I was adamant in that I felt uncomfortable with her having sex with other people, if just for that reason alone. Time goes by, usual relationship business (date nights, movie nights, Dr. Who with her friends) and she brings it up again. This time as a friends with benefits situation. I remained open to discussion, but couldn't properly express myself (I still feel I can't). Now it turns into ""I'd like a full fledged relationship"".

**Where she's coming from**: Sex is a logical extenuation of friendship. She has such deep bonds with several of her close friends that physical intimacy is the next step. She says she loves me, and that she's looking for an ""and"" rather than an ""or"", an addition to our relationship with the close friend/casual relationship she had back prior to me. That if anything were to get in the way of us, then she would not take that route because she is happy with me. When she says all these things, I trust her, through and through. She wants to reach a point where I'll be comfortable with this just so we can try it out.

**Me**: I'm open to listening to the idea of a poly relationship, but the truth of the matter is that I'm still uncomfortable with the idea of her having a sexual relationship with someone else. When she says that it's different than with me, I understand this; it still doesn't make the fact that I gag every time I picture her with another guy any easier. It's a non-issue as long as I'm uncomfortable, she says. But the fact of the matter is I'm torn because I know this is something she wants to try and that it will make her happy; meanwhile I keep picturing her with this other guy and it is literally driving me insane. It's not even the concept of her splitting her time between the two of us, just the sex. As a result of knowing that this is what she wants, but also understanding my limits, it's just one giant ball of stress on my end because it's affecting us. I'm not as happy as I was knowing that she wants to have sex with someone else.

**Note**: Not as much now, but the it bothers me that the other guy (prior casual relationship who wants this to happen) wants this to happen as much as her, leaving me as the odd man out.

**Now**: Just got off Skype with her via Israel. I feel like a dick because here I am back home being miserable and made her sad as a result. I just can't control my brain when it comes to this. She says it's not an issue at the moment because I'm uncomfortable with it, but it's still all I can think about. I'm open to listening about it, but I really don't feel much of anything will change my mind.
I've talked to my friends about it (all think I'll lose it), I've talked to her friends about it (who are all for it as they've done it before) and all in all I'm just unhappy.

**TL:DR** Girlfriend wants to try poly, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of her having sex with other guys. Can't stop thinking about it, affecting otherwise stable relationship.

I'm sure there's more to this than I'm explaining, feel free to ask. This just seems more of a rant than anything, but any advice from a third party would be helpful.

Cheers."

**5/24 Update** So what I've realized after talking with her further is that I'm uncomfortable with her physical aspect because it's something I don't want to know is happening with someone else. If the situation presents itself when she comes back from her trip, I said I would be willing to try it for some undetermined time. I can see this working: the only real difference between what's already happening now is the sex, and I've asked if she was ok with several caveats. Taking the next logical step in the progression, even if this does work out for all of us and I recognize this, but don't want it to continue anyway, what would you do?

I realize that we're dealing with something that may not even happen for another two-three months, so nothing definitive can be said. Also that there are a lot of variables that need to fall in place this summer for it to happen that much sooner (me getting job in her area, him also being in the area; none of which is definite at this point). This is just where my brain is at. To me this is something serious and I'm having trouble putting it on the back burner and focusing on other things. Shes going to talk with whom she wishes to start this with at some point this weekend and then he'll talk to me. As much as I don't want to know about their relationship, I'd like to know where he sees this going in the future, his end goals, and frankly how he feels about me. Because if this is something where he just wants to experiment and have fun, I'm not sure I could go through with it. Thanks for all your words of support, you all have been more than kind and for that I am truly grateful."

Her parents came up to school to attend her graduation and in the past couple of days I had been invited to all their dinners and activities.  It was definitely a bittersweet couple of days.  While I was very happy to be around them, it hurt that I wasn't spending time with her family as her boyfriend.  During the past couple of days I would look at her and feel extreme pain because she wasn't mine anymore.  

**5.  She wants me to move into a 1bedroom close to hers**

Self explanatory.  She still wants me to be near by.


*Overall, her actions have had a negative effect on me trying to get over her. *




Conclusion:
I will be working during the summer at an internship out of town and I  see this as a break for the both of us.  Should I shut off all contact with her and then continue to pursue her when I get back or should I start seeing other women?  Some of me wants to move on and see other girls but I also feel like if I let her go I will regret it for the rest of my life. I don't think that I am being blinded.  I really feel that she is everything I want in a woman. I am still head over heels in love with this girl.

So, reddit.  What do you think?  Should I?


TLDR version:

Perfect girl breaks up with me after 3 years.  I think she still likes me.  Should I use the summer as a break and try to slowly get back together with her again?

hhtdv,5,2011-05-23,To remember or not to remember...[tl;dr at bottom],youarealwaysthereMD,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/hhtdv/to_remember_or_not_to_remembertldr_at_bottom/,"For most of my youth I was pretty much alone, save a few friends that I barely saw off of the internet.  Senior year of high school I met an amazing (well, amazing then) girl, and after we both worked through our awkwardness we ended up in one of those relationships everyone envies.  But my depression and self-sabotaging tendencies got the worst of me, and slowly but surely our relationship tanked.  I was too good for her (in terms of gifts, willingness, ridiculous personal beliefs), and she was too complacent, too willing to do what I asked.  Eventually she became so ""indebted"" to me things got out of hand.  Add to that the fact that we spent 2/3 of the year apart due to school, things basically fell apart.  When I pushed her too far, she finally cheated on me to escape it all, and that's when she chose to end it (online, after 3 years, what a disrespectful end to rip all of my self-esteem and confidence away from me).  

Needless to say, I spent about a year to this day trying to get over her, and to be honest (and this is the most scary thing I've admitted), I'm still not over her.  I'm still not over that girl whose become a pot-head slut wannabe, who almost failed out of her grade and internship.

Lately I've been doing okay, but I always allow myself to relive all those memories, especially the breakup, right when I need to study for important exams or have projects to do.  This sends me tailspinning.  (Also, pretty sure I just messed up an opportunity to have sex with one of my few girl friends).  

But there were many good memories, those innocent memories. There will always be the memories of those days spent together, the nights spend exploring each other, and those moments when we just sat together, in love, needing nothing but closeness to one another.

So my question to you, FA (and reddit), is should I keep the memories I have of her (conversations, pictures, etc.), or should I finally purge my life of every living memory of her?  Be honest, and spare no judgement.

TL;DR: GF left me a year ago, and to my dismay I'm still trying to get over her and rebuild my life (a life I've spend alone beside from her).  Should I keep my memories of her (physical and emotional) or get rid of everything?  Spare no judgement and be brutally honest."
himcc,14,2011-05-24,Apple replaced my shattered iPhone 4 today free of charge.,fanel345,iphone,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/himcc/apple_replaced_my_shattered_iphone_4_today_free/,"So I was taking an intern out to lunch today when on the way back to my car I took out my iPhone to check if it was going to rain anymore. I guess today my fingers must have been made of butter and as I took it out of my pocket I ended up juggling it into the air. Well the juggling didn't make me catch it, instead it ended up going higher into the air until it came down flat on the ground and I heard an audible *POP*. 

Picking it up I knew I was screwed and sure enough the entire front screen was shattered. Even the corners looked like it had been mangled in a losing fight with a lawnmower and it had landed flat on it's face. Fortunately it was still usable even though it had small pieces of glass coming off it when I swiped across it. So I made an appointment at the local genius bar.

When I walked into the genius bar after checking in I had about a 30 minute wait until one of the Apple guys introduced me to a genius and told me he was going to be double tasking me with another person. He asked what was wrong and as soon as I took my iPhone out he cringed. I told him what had happened and before my first attempt at iPhone juggling it was working fine. That's when he told me it was going to be $200 to replace it and that's all they could do for me.

I told him I had to have it replaced as getting small fragments of glass in my finger every time I tried to answer a phone call wasn't an option. That's when he told me to hold on a minute and went into the back. When he came out he asked me if I thought I was lucky. I told him no since my career as an iPhone juggler was quickly coming to an end and that's when he dropped the kicker, he was going to replace my iPhone free of charge. I signed a piece of paper saying he gave me an iPhone and left.

I can't believe it. I don't know if this is Apple policy or the guy just was truly being nice. Whatever the case I know that Apple has cemented my business for future items.

**tl;dr** Dropped my iPhone, went to the Apple store and fessed up that it was my fault, amazingly got a new iPhone 4 free of charge.

Last summer, she was just about to start grad school and then her father passed away so she went back to Japan to take care of her mother for a little while. She was supposed to come back to the US and resume her studies, but now that looks like that isn't happening. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hjdiq/long_distance_relationship_with_girl_from_japan/) for details (Its long...).

Meanwhile, I'm one online class away from graduating with a Computer Science degree, and I'm in a pretty good position in my life to move to her instead. I also studied Japanese (never got a minor or anything, just took language classes) and I've been there a couple times now so its not going to be a giant shock for me to go to move there; I'm sure it will take time to adjust, but I really love learning the language and culture. 

However, I need a job. Specifically, one that will get me a visa so that I can live there. I have about 3 years of experience now working at various internships, and my Japanese ability is probably daily conversational (on a good day). I really don't care what it is- if I have to bite the bullet and teach English or something that would be tolerable- but since I have an actual skill thats in demand, it would be much preferred to do something in the IT industry. I'm hoping to visit her this summer for a few months and look for a job, but until then, I'm stuck here in the US so that probably makes it more difficult as well. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice?"

Here's the position description in general: 

A new IT project is looking for a full time IT Support person and intern, to provide support to the Senior Developer. The role would involve learning a lot of valuable skills, including web development, Salesforce Administration and general IT support.

What we're ideally wanting is someone with as much interest and exposure as possible to a range of IT tasks, including PHP, CSS, MySQL, Email Config, Office, Apple, Windows, cPanel, Reddit...

This position would suit a junior web developer who is willing to take on IT support work, or a skilled IT support person who is willing to learn web development.

Salary will be based on skill and experience, but within a fairly broad range.

SalesForce experience would be super highly regarded, but not an expectation for this role.

As said earlier, this is a full time role, and would not suit a current student.


The position (and also salary) is actually fairly vague in that we'd tailor the position to what we get, rather than looking for a really specific set of skills.

If you are (or know someone who is) a tech supporter with web dev experience, or a starting web developer who knows their stuff outside of the web dev environment (setting up laptops, doing data entry, etc) feel free to PM me.

This is a career starting entry level position in a fun and casual small company, not a step in a career for a proficient developer / programmer, so there's no need for years of experience or super high level skills.

Feel free to PM me (as I said before), or if you want to ask questions, abuse me for random things, or make a series of puns that distract from the point of the post... hey, it's reddit, that's what the comments are for!

Myself and some guys have had a version of this site internally in our job for a few years. We decided it was time to let it loose to the world and see what everyone thinks.
Sadly we had to take a large amount of the content off, as it was incriminating to us... and our employer.

Feedback is welcome. Hope you guys like it., Feel free to add to the list we've been making over the last week.

It all started one day as a joke because one intern wasn't doing shit, even though he would tell us otherwise.


We are all serverside developers, so its not pretty. It never was, so we just left it at that.

I’m a little nervous. 

I don’t want to admit that it’s my first time, but it is. I’m nineteen and a bit clumsy; I fumble in my wallet while her eyes stare holes into me. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a little scared, a little anxious, and a bit excited. There is a line behind me. I have to hurry I tell myself, and I finally find what I’m looking for within my wallet. I slide my trailpass through card reader and move backwards through the bus to find a seat next to a decrepit looking lady who seems either to have several cats, or killed her first husband and locked his mutilated body in the basement freezer. This is my first time on the bus, but it won’t be my last. My internship deep within the confines of Shallcross Bus Depot had just started and I would be making the almost two hour trip, daily, for the next six months.  

It’s November, and I knew I was about to get into it, a bad situation, the shit, nothing good. There are no seats except near the back of the bus where all the high school and remedial school kids sat. My IPod’s batteries died on the subway earlier, but I had learned to stick the ear buds into my ear just in case someone decides that I look like I’m interested in the fact that they used to live in Maryland, but they moved down here in 1995 with their ex husband, and now they work retail at the Franklin Mills Mall, but things are looking up because their youngest son just graduated high school, and their middle daughter is about to leave the correctional facility she was in for assaulting two other women at a corner store because they cut in line. There’s no music playing, but the illusion keeps the crazy away to point.
 
I take a seat behind a group of tattooed African American youth. I know they’re only starting high school or ending middle school because they can’t be much taller than my shoulder. Every one of them has a cacophony of tattoos. From their necks to their hands; stars, names, skulls, skylines, teardrops, chains, and other generally unsettling things I’m not used to seeing on a kids shorter than 5’3”.  At this point I’m feeling a little out of place. My khakis and tucked in Polo clearly mark me as an outsider here. I lack that generally menacing look in my eye, and this probably signals to these kids I’m not from around there. No one seems to mind my presence so far. No comments were made in indecipherable Ebonics in my direction and I took this as a good sign. Like a rabbit that had made a home among wolves I felt a little strange, but it’s either this or standing, and I was much too lazy for that. 

The bus stops. A large black man in hospital scrubs gets on and sits across from me. He ran into the same problem I did with the lack of space. He’s massive. At least 6’3” and severely built, his trapezius muscles look like they are trying to break free of his neck. The short sleeves he wears show off a mosaic. Tattoos that took years to acquire, some fading with age, others standing on edge, like they have just been placed there, years of intertwining ink blending into his skin. I try not to stare.
  
 Crack. Skittle. Skittle. Brush. Then the soft sound of cigar tobacco hitting the floor of the bus, followed by the sweet, sticky, slightly repulsive smell of marijuana. 

“Yo fool, you best roll that blunt right, nigga,” says a voice I’m not supposed to be hearing. 

“Shut up cuz, I got this shit,” replies another voice I’m not listening too. 

“ha ha you nigga’s better not spill any my fucking weed,” chimes in a third. 

“I can’t believe that nigga Trey, fucking bailing on Saturday. I had to run for like four blocks before I lost the cops,” Says another

“You still on that shit, cousin,” says a voice I think I have heard before. 

“Fuck him, If I ever see that nigga again, I’ll get J’s gun and lay that nigga out,” Says a voice I’m definitely not supposed to be hearing. 

“Yo nigga your rolling that jawn too tight!,” Erupts a voice.
“Chill cousin, chill,” soothes another. 

“How we going to fucking sort Trey out man,” inquires one of them. 

“Fuckin’ A, man I’ll swing by J’s and talk to him about a gun,” One of them not quite whispers. 

I’m at the edge of my seat. I’m pretending with all my might that I’m tuning into some music, because I’m clearly not supposed to be hearing this. It clearly sounds like these kids probably all less than 15 years old are planning to kill someone. Someone named Trey, who clearly bailed on Saturday. I try not to laugh at how simply ludicrous this seems. I put all of my effort into becoming scenery.

Then something unexpected happens. My fellow passenger, the man in the scrubs with all the arm tattoos and the bulging trapezius muscles leans forward. He is not wearing headphones. He is not pretending to listen to music. He looks like he has a lot more in common with these kids than I do. The look on his face is stern. As he shifts his massive body towards them, one of them catches his monolithic figure moving slightly towards the posse out of the corner of his eye and prompts the others silently to turn towards him. I catch all of their faces, I’m still wall paper. 

“If you’re going to do some shit like that, you tell no one,” says the man. 

He leans back. He has finished talking. The kids all stare at him for another minute. Some of them have their jaws visibly dropped. The one with the blunt has tucked it behind his ear. 

“Aw, sheet,” is the only thing one of them says as he pulls the line to signal the next stop. 

Then in an almost eerie silence they depart. Some with their heads low, other’s talking about sparking that shit. 

I continue to sit there, I’m still wallpaper. 

Only 45 more minutes to go.

I told my girlfriend I probably won't do it, and stay here for my internship. She then asked why I won't do it abroad

I told her I probably won't get selected either way (my grades aren't all that good), I can't handle it financially (I'm a student living on his own, got kicked out of my parents house/financial support) and that I don't think it's a good thing for our relationship to be apart for such a long time (I wouldn't be able to see her once during those 4 months)

She now keeps telling me I HAVE to do it, that it's an opportunity of a life time, and if she's such a big reason for me to say no, she would even leave me.

This makes me feel really uncomfortable/sad

hmr0l,1,2011-05-29,Request Advice to Avoid Ending It (wall o' text),kagiri,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hmr0l/request_advice_to_avoid_ending_it_wall_o_text/,"For the past few months, there's been a definite trend in my relationship with my girlfriend: she has become incredibly distant and without affection, to the point where it's a chore to talk to her at all about anything.

A bit of background: I'm 22, she's 23. We've known each other since 2006, but only in the last 10 months have we been together. Before we finally hooked up and became 'a thing' officially, she had been in nothing but shitty relationships, all of which were degrading to her (a couple even involving verbal abuse against her). Additionally, her life aside from bad boyfriends has been incredibly stressful and painful for her. I was her first ""good relationship"".

As far as me, I've had mostly good, if unremarkable relationships in the past. I'm pretty whitebread, and don't find many insecurities or baggage with myself.

We live in different states.

In the typical honeymoon phase, we got along so well that I could hardly believe what had happened, even despite her past and current troubles. There was an undeniable sense of great love on both of our parts - indeed, she even told me that she'd never said that she loved anyone as quickly as she had with me - and I couldn't believe our compatibility. We loved video games, had similar musical tastes, and could talk about anything and everything for hours, via phone or by texting.

A few months in, she graduated with her bachelor's degree and planned to hop into grad school. This was when she first visited. Every part of those few days was blissful and perfect. When she had to fly back home, we both ended up crying at the airport, and promised we'd visit again soon. In all, she's been over with me once, and I've visited twice, with the last being in January.

The trouble began in March of this year. Her graduate courses began stacking up and overloading her in adjunct with her terrible retail job and chronic illness. I tried to be there all the time, as often as I could, often getting in trouble at my own job for texting her and calling her when I shouldn't have had my phone out. She's a trouper, and made it through just about everything life had been throwing at her, all while maintaining our relationship.

We had an understanding of the importance of school in her life. It was essentially an all-encompassing effort to at the least better her chances of working within her field tenably. She had done so much, in fact, that she began to amplify her illness as a result of the stress. Ulcers, mystery illness, breakouts, near-meltdowns, the works. During all of this, I knew just how fragile she was at this stage in her life and did all I could to support and encourage her, and she continued being as sweet and lovely as she ever was.

Then, gradually, our text conversations shrank in volume and frequency, and began to contain less and less of the same affection there once was. Her sex drive had vanished since the beginning of March. Even still, we got along just about as well as we used to (it took very much rationalizing on my part to not confront her about what I took as a sign of distance). We then had our first real fight when I brought up that distance I felt.

She flipped her shit. Told me I didn't understand what she was going through, how disappointed in me she was because she was convinced that we were okay, and that I knew what she was putting up with. And, knowing how much shit had utterly buried her life, I relented. I agreed with her, asserting that I did understand her workload and that I was only worried about us.

We haven't had a phone call since sometime before that fight (which was expressed through texts). I've tried to initiate them, but every time I call her without us planning it first, she doesn't answer, excusing her way out of it; every time I try to plan with her, she evades it, or doesn't even acknowledge that I mentioned it at all. She never makes calls to me, either.

In the time since then (about the middle of April), she's finished her first semester of grad school, left her old, shit job, and even been accepted at a couple of internships. Life seems to be improving for her. Our relationship has very greatly stagnated, however. We've gone for about 1-2 days at a time without contact at a time. She has little or no apparent affection for me anymore (I haven't been told that she loves me in a week or so). I've lost sleep over it and have become an emotional wreck. I'm afraid to bring anything up with her, because she'll most likely either A) snap at me for not being understanding enough; or B) will completely ignore what I say.

As it is now: we haven't spoken in a day or two, our conversations are comparatively miniscule, and I feel extremely unloved and neglected. I'm torn between wanting to break up with her and move on, and not wanting it to end, but being unable to confront the issue with her since we have only ""spoken"" through texts for months now, and not wanting to lose her more than I've ever wanted not to lose anything in my life.

I'm on the brink, reddit. What can I do? What *should* I do? Thanks for reading.

**UPDORT** 6/4
Finally, after four days of no contact, I texted her again and told her everything that's been troubling me. I asked if she thought the relationship was tenable (she didn't know). I let her know that I felt neglected and that I didn't know if she still loved me. I explained that I understood her priorities, and was willing to work with her to format some sort of schedule so we could stay in contact while still respecting her very busy and demanding schedule.

She refused.

She told me that I was ""demanding everything"" from her, and that I was ""upset and angry"" about how her every waking moment was dedicated to me. After I said that wasn't so, she told me she needed to think and would talk to me later. 

What the fuck do I do, reddit? I want her to be happy, but we loved each other so much. I'm about to cry."

I have very little experience but I am extremely motivated and willing to work long hours and do whatever it takes to prove myself. Even work for free if it puts me in the right career track in ANY area of accounting. Does anyone have any advice? Are there unpaid internships or anything else that would put me on track?

hn8eg,181,2011-05-29,"IAMA convicted rapist, here's my sob story, AMA",TA54645,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hn8eg/iama_convicted_rapist_heres_my_sob_story_ama/,"In 2003 I was convicted of California penal code 261.3:
&gt;(3) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating
or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this
condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the
accused.

I was attending a local community college after high school, because my grades weren't good enough to get into any schools nearby, and my family is pretty broke. I had 2 classes with this girl Melinda who I had a huge crush on. I'm kind of nerdy and overweight, so I never had the balls to ask her out or even ask to hang out. (Plus this is before I realized she had a boyfriend)

A few weeks into summer I got a job at a Walgreens (It's a drug store for those of you not in the USA) where I worked full time. This girl Melinda came in one day and we bullshitted for a while, and somehow her broken PC got tossed into the conversation. As a nerd, this is one of the few openers that work, so I suggested to fix it. She agreed and we made plans to meet the next night at her house. She offered to pay me, I just said to get me a beer or something.

I went over there the night after the next because she was busy, and I fixed her PC in like 5 minutes because all it was was some simple spyware popup crap. We started drinking and smoking pot and just bullshitting. It was really great because I have NO game. She began going on and on and on about how she was always fighting with her boyfriend and what an asshole he was. I thought ""SCORE!"" We ended up drinking and smoking the entire night, and we ended up cuddling on the couch watching the Wizard of Oz. Up until that point, I hadn't even held hands with a girl.

After a while we started making out, and to my embarrassment I accidentally ejaculated in my pants. A LOT. I was so embarrassed, but she gave me a towel and I removed my pants. I couldn't drive because I was so hammered, so I crashed in her bed with her. A lot of kissing and grinding and such and before I knew it we were having sex.

The next day I heard nothing from her. The day after that she wasn't in class. She didn't answer my calls. I didn't quite understand it. I got home from class, and started getting ready for work. There was a LOUD knock at my door. A police officer asked me to come with them, and they needed to ask me some questions.

Not knowing my rights or anything, I told them the truth. We got drunk, we smoked pot, I stayed there and we had sex. I was arrested. It turns out after I told a few people, it got back to her boyfriend. The boyfriend confronted her, she said she didn't remember because she was so drunk. I could barely remember it either, but I know it had happened. I don't think anything can overwrite the memory of losing your virginity.

I was sentenced October 2004 after about a year of fighting my case. I was released November of 2009. When I was released Jessica's law was still active in California, so I couldn't live with my parents. They had bought me a 1996 Subaru Legacy Wagon, which I lived in slightly on the outskirts of the town I lived. I tried to go back to school, but you have to register as a sex offender at colleges you attend. when I registered the student security intern told a couple of girls he knew, and before I knew it the entire school was harassing me. So I left. I have had 3 jobs since my release. I was fired from all three when someone found my face online. I am currently on Social Security Disability for post traumatic stress disorder. According to my therapist I have it due to my prison experiences. (I saw a man die from a gang beating, I was stabbed [superficially] with a pencil because I'm a rapist)

I'm currently living with my parents again. I haven't gotten back to school, but I'm thinking of taking classes online. I don't know much else to talk about, AMA away. I'll try to keep up with this.

TL;DR I became a rapist when I lost my virginity, lost 5 years of my life, and I'm trying to get my life together.


Edit:
=====================
I have gotten alot of requests for verification of my story. I didn't know that worked until recently. I did however send the following to the mods:
&gt;I have a topic on iama talking about my experiences as someone convicted of rape. This is a throwaway account. I don't know how I can get confirmed or if I can even without exposing my identity. As someone who is a sex offender, what little privacy I have I protect fiercely. I wasn't careful in the past, and I had a few jerks on xbox live that tracked down my information and got my account banned. They also found my facebook and had that banned too, but not before saving all of my photos and posting them on 4chan. So is there any way to confirm myself without exposing myself? I have racked my brain trying to find a way to do so, but short of exposing myself (No pun intended) I have no idea how to do so.
Any suggestions would be wecomed!

I received a reply from a gentleman/woman named ""flyryan:""

&gt;There isn't a way to prove yourself without exposing yourself. As a reminder though, verification is totally optional. It is not a requirement.
So, if you don't to verify, you don't have to. However, if you do, I can promise that we take privacy seriously and anything you send would be kept confidential and used for verification only.

I have decided to not identify myself. I appreciate the curiosity, and I understand the desire to see behind the curtain, but the internet is a very mean and harsh place, and I don't trust people very easily. If you don't believe it, fine. If you do, fine. Whatever. If you don't feel this is authentic no one is forcing you to participate. Thank you"
hn4ih,3,2011-05-29,Temporary San Franciscan--motorcycle vs. bike,[deleted],sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/hn4ih/temporary_san_franciscanmotorcycle_vs_bike/,"Howdy,
I'm a new San Franciscan--going to be around for the summer for an internship and might be back in a year and a half for good. I'm trying to figure out transportation.

As it stands right now, I'm in the Mission and my place of work is about five blocks away, so I don't need something immediately. However, good groceries are a bit of a trek, I like being self-sufficient for transportation, and I have friends in North Beach, Oakland, Sonoma County, and will be paying occasional visits to Bolinas, so I need at least *something*. As it stands, I'm divided between a bike and a motorcycle.

I have a pretty good idea what I'm getting into with both--I'm an experienced bike rider (although more rural and mountain biking than urban riding), and have owned bikes before. Similarly, I'm a licensed motorcyclist, have taken MSF courses, have gone riding with my father and friends a few times--but I've never owned one.

They each have their pros and cons (bicycles don't need gas, motorcycles let me go further, I've wanted to ""make good"" on my licensing by getting a motorcycle, bikes are far cheaper (but I do have the money), bikes keep me fit, motorcycles are more fun &amp; more dangerous, etc.) but a pretty big part of it at the end of the day is how receptive the city is. Given that I'm new here, I don't really know the ins and outs--do any of you have any experience with either? Is San Francisco particularly welcoming or unwelcoming to bicyclists or motorcyclists? Have any stories to relate?

On some level, I'd love to have my desire for a motorcycle justified--they're fun, I like them, and I'm young, so it's a pretty good time to have a one-person means of getting around (vs. later when I'll need something more). On the other hand, I understand that a bicycle may make a lot more sense, so I don't want to spit in the face of reason. 

For what it's worth, I have a car on the east coast, where I'm going to school. Come the end of the summer, I can either ship whatever I buy back there, or leave it at my parents' house in Bolinas.

Anything would be helpful. Thanks!"
hokoo,1,2011-05-31,ADVICE NEEDED!: Vaginismus destructive to relationship/lives,[deleted],sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/hokoo/advice_needed_vaginismus_destructive_to/,"Hey guys, I need some help.

My lovely girlfriend of two years is having a problem known as ""vaginismus.""  We've always had this problem, but only about nine months ago did we figure out what it was.

I thought the diagnosis alongside knowledge that others suffered with her would help her face the problem, but so far things have become worse.  She curses the disorder and calls herself a freak, and even threatens suicide.  She blames me for not showing enough sexual interest.  Her plan is for me to pretend that things are working to make her feel better in bed, but this causes frustration, painful chafing, and tears.

She tried dialaters for a while, but was unable to insert any, or even a tampon.  She has never been able to touch herself without underwear (I have not been able to do this more than a couple of times).

We are trying to find knowledgeable therapists and resources in the Northern Virginia/Washington D.C. area, but neither of us know where to start, nor whether we can afford them since she is unemployed and I am working at a low-pay internship.  If I can convince her to tell her parents, we may be able to use their health insurance.

Does anybody have any advice?"
hog94,14,2011-05-31,In need of food,caer19,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hog94/in_need_of_food/,"Hey folks, 

I'm a grad student in RI. I'm waiting on my summer financial aid to come in (hopefully at the end of the week) but until then I have $2.14 in my bank account. My father just lost his job so I can't borrow any money from him and I don't qualify for food stamps because I'm not working (with the hours of my classes and internship I can't swing a job too). I'm posting from a throwaway because some of my friends use Reddit and I'd rather them not know how dire my situation is. My rent is due tomorrow and I can't pay that, but I've talked with my landlord and she'll work with me on that. The issue I'm having is that I haven't eaten a real meal in 2 days (I had a hamburger yesterday and some oatmeal today) and I was hoping that someone on here would either let me know where i can get free food or send me something to hold me over. I'm ashamed to be asking because I've never needed or asked for charity before, but I'm starting to get worried now.

I'd be happy to provide any information to establish my identity, etc. Oh, and I live in Bristol, RI.

Thanks so much!!
