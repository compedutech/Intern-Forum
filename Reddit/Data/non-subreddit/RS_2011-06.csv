I am a 22 year old college student, and I am calling out to the beautiful community of reddit for help. I am currently being assaulted by debt collectors over a sum that I was led to believe that I was paying off via monthly payments, but instead was only paying to extend payments. I have no money, I am not able to work a sufficient job to pay back this amount right now because I am busy working at an internship and applying for medical school, and my parents cannot help because my father recently lost his job and is having a hard time just getting by at the moment. 

I am not one to typically ask for help as I try to solve my problems myself, and I have never been one to beg for anything, but I am desperate at this point. I have seen amazing stories on here before describing people helping out their fellow redditors, and I am hoping that this can become one of them. Of course, any sort of contribution at all would be a huge help to me, and of course I would pay anyone back as soon as I am able. 

If you are interested in helping just send me a message and we can work out the details. 

Thank you so much my fellow redditors."
hr4a6,14,2011-06-03,Help... What do you do when you have a crazy and racist mother?,throwaway1419,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hr4a6/help_what_do_you_do_when_you_have_a_crazy_and/,"So this is what has been happening these past 3 weeks. I am 21 years old, currently on an internship. 

My mom found out I had a boyfriend 3 weeks ago. He is pakistani, I am chinese. I convinced her it was only a four month relationship, whereas it was actually 1.5 years so far. 

My dad freaked out and disowned me. His mother is now praying that I marry him soon so that I will get cheated on because he will for sure marry multiple wives and I will come crying back to my father in defeat. This isn't too much of a change for me because my dad has never really had much of a relationship with me, so it's like nothing happened between us basically. We just never talk to each other anymore. 

My mom is cursing my dad's mom for saying that, wanted to find a place to buy a gun so she could kill her and then herself so I won't be 'cursed'. Hopefully, this has passed and she isn't thinking about that anymore. At the time, she was threatening to also take my cat to a shelter, and I was so angry I said if she did that, I was going to move out. This prompted the following deal, where I agreed to her conditions of being ""open-minded"" and going out on dates secretly if a guy asks me out (behind my bf's back). She claims that she knows me so well and that I won't ever break up with him unless he breaks up with me, which is when he gets married. She says that women are disadvantaged because as they get older, they have a smaller pool of men to choose from so I better start now and not just fixate on one guy. I tell her I will date more guys eventually, she refuses to believe me. 

She continues to worry and cry over the fact that I was going to leave and then writes me a long email saying 'this is my last piece of advice for you, whenever you think of me, please read this'. She says she's going to leave the house so I don't leave because if I leave, I will most definitely get raped and killed living on my own. I tell her I was only going to leave because of a fit of madness and she was all relieved and glad to be able to stay and that I wasn't going to leave. But she still keeps saying that she's scared I'll leave to this day. 

Now, even though I agree to her conditions, she keeps lecturing me every day, about how pakistanis are bad, because they're poor and have large families and don't respect women etc etc. They have a law in which polygamy is okay, so he's going to have many wives and I will live a miserable life if I stay with him. She claims I've become a terrorist. This happens every day. She asks me when I come home where I've been, who I've been with. If I was with my bf, she will freak out and start lecturing me even further. She says she's researched assassins and knows how much they cost. However, she's been not working, has gotten a warning from her superiors to work because all she does is cry at work all day long. I thought she had stopped when I agreed to the conditions awhile back, but apparently she hasn't. She's lost weight, can't sleep properly... 

Then along with that, she's been monitoring my phone bill to see who I've been talking to etc and claims I've been ""webcamming"" with him at night. And that he will eventually make me ""take off my clothes"" for his base desires and then my life will be RUINED because they will get onto the internet and everyone will find out and my employers will fire me and nobody will ever hire me again.

Basically, she's controlled my entire life and these past few years, I've been trying to break out of it, quite unsuccessfully.

She said that because I've been ""webcamming"" with him, that she will HAVE to sleep in my room at night every night from now on. She will even sleep on the floor. At this point, I was just so angry from all the pent-up frustration of constraint from the past couple of weeks, I completely ignored her and slept on the couch while she waited in my room. She completely went nuts and started accusing my bf of putting me up to this. I wrote her a super long email about how she ruined my life (long story, basically she's cheap and overworked me, I turned out bad-tempered, cheap, self-conscious, no ambition, low self-esteem for a multitude of reasons that I don't feel like going into) and she should see a therapist/psychologist because of her irrational desire to control my life and my brother's life (she hovers over his shoulder all night to make sure he's working and not gaming or something. And he's almost finished Grade 10).

She reacted very negatively. Cried a lot, wrote me a response because she couldn't say it out loud or else she'd start crying. Basically her response blamed my boyfriend for everything. I told her about how good he was to me, how he is smart and caring, how he made me a better person, how he gave me confidence, self esteem, a goal in life. She shat on all of it, somehow twisting everything into a bad thing, and then additionally saying that he is poor.

She basically spent her entire life scrounging up money for me and my brother to go to med school. I broke out of that path like a year ago, which was ALSO a huge deal, with lots of crying and emotions. I told her it was all for naught and that she puts too big of an emphasis on money, and that relationships and happiness are more important. She just keeps saying that money is important and because he has a large family and they're poorer than us, I will just end up having to use all my money supporting his family.

I begged her to see things my way and to see that she was way overreacting for something like a boyfriend. It isn't working. She's about to lose her job. She says she doesn't care about her job anymore because she's lost her daughter.

I don't know what to do. The right thing to do would be to break up with him wouldn't it? But I've already made her miserable by telling her all that stuff about her ruining my life and being overly controlling. Even if I break up with him, she may still be miserable and still lose her job.

I also don't want her to win yet again. I really truly want her to see a therapist so she can stop worrying so much. She has more white hairs than her own mother because she worries so much. 

Please help, I'm just so confused and frustrated and cornered and I feel helpless. "
hr38f,5,2011-06-03,I have some sort of issue with my relationships...,[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/hr38f/i_have_some_sort_of_issue_with_my_relationships/,"Hello, I'm an 18 year old male and for a while now I have been reflecting on some of my issues. I seem to have a problem with maintaining my relationships (both platonic and romantic). 

When I was in my senior year of high-school I became very attached to my best friend L(18 year old female). L and I have always been close but towards the end of high-school I began developing a crush on her and soon discovered she had one on me. We began dating and spent a lot of time with each other during an internship we both were accepted into. We basically spent everyday after school together. At this point I started to become jealous when she would hang around with ANYBODY male or female. I also became suspicious of her actions, thinking that she was lying to me. We eventually broke up and haven't spoken since then. Lost a best friend because of immaturity.

Fast forward to my Freshman year of college. My roommate T is a friend from high-school I use to hang around with in a group. We got pretty close and as we did I noticed myself becoming attached to my GUY friend. I became just as jealous as I did in my relationship with my ex. I began thinking that he would ditch me for another friend at school that we knew and became upset/angry whenever I wasn't invited or included in the conversation. The thought of betrayal appeared in my mind constantly and would always upset me. Now that it is summer I feel even worse because T rarely wants to hang out and is always hanging out with his friends at home. Which I understand because we were just away at college for two full semesters, who wouldn't want to be hanging out with old friends all summer? But what about me? 

I feel as though with any type of relationship I get very jealous and clingy and I don't know why. Just to clarify, in case anybody thought so, I do not have romantic feelings for my male roommate T. i am a straight male. So I know it has nothing to do with me having romantic feelings for my guy friend. Its more of a general clinginess towards anyone who I become close to. 

It's beginning to affect me emotionally. I don't want to feel jealous and upset whenever I'm left out of a hangout or conversation when it comes to a friend. The way I'm acting is immature and I really just want to stop acting so negatively. And I definitely do not want to push my future significant others away because I'm too insecure. **So I'm asking for help and a constructive discussion on what I should do about this. And possibly an answer for why I'm like this.**

**Shortened:** 18 year old straight male who is clingy and becomes very jealous concerning his relationships both platonic and romantic.

**Also, I'm not willing to see a therapist at this time. I might reconsider after college is over and Ive moved into my own place, but for now, no therapy.**"

hrj32,5,2011-06-04,How do I tell her that this state of limbo of our relationship is unsustainable for me?,tickettoderide,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hrj32/how_do_i_tell_her_that_this_state_of_limbo_of_our/,"I was broken up with by a gf of almost 2.5 years in January. What followed was about 3 months of pain and confusion, caused by us staying close to one another on both emotional and physical levels, as well as by really shitty behavior on both of our parts. We eventually decided that we wanted to get back together, but this was at early April. Unfortunately she was going away for a summer internship, so we decided to put our plans on hold until she returned at the end of the summer.

So, basically we decided that while we wanted to be together, we should wait, and then give it a shot when we can have a real go at it.

I thought this would work fine, and would give me some time to get over some of the awful things we did to one another. Plus, I would finally have some distance so that I could actually sit back and evaluate everything that has happened.

so far, it is going terribly. I am putting on a happy face for her, so that she isn't constantly bothered by my insecurities and doubts. I don't want to scare her away by making her think that when she gets back together with me she will be greeted by a depressed version of myself. Who wants to be with someone like that? that is why from now on it is all smiles and telling her how awesome my summer is going.

We have made plans to visit each other, and I am going next weekend to see her. Basically I am constantly worried that she is hooking up with other people, and whenever I start putting myself out there, I feel guilty, thinking about how much it might hurt her if I was with someone else.

The whole thing seems unsustainable, looking forward to three months of constant doubt, pain, and distrust. I don't want to make her rush into things, because I really do want to make things work when we try again. She was always my closest friend and confidant, and now that I have to hide my pain from her for fear of scaring her away, it is torture. I fell like I am going to explode from all of the feeling swirling around in my head.

I can't work and I can barely get through the day without crying. I don't know what to do. Any advice on how to tell her how I am feeling, without coming off as an insecure wreck?

EDIT: I am 22, she is 21

EDIT2: I am getting some conflicting advice. Some say to talk with her about exclusivity, others say to bear the pain and focus on myself, and others say to walk away completely. Tough to know what to do here..."

(Throwaway account, for obvious reasons)",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hs4sv/i_just_found_a_journal_entry_from_2008_that/,"
I did do that bet mentioned above, and it won. I'm now also well passed the ""halfway to five figures"" debt I was concerned about. It's striking, it has put me in the sort of mood I guess where this will be therapeutic, but it's also confirmed the fact I've known about myself for the past 10 years or so, and that is I never really care about anything. Nothing really excites me, nothing ever really upsets me. Having said that, the last few weeks, I guess the last few months, haven't been particularly good. I finally moved house, and even though it's an awesome place and probably better than the previous joint, I still don't feel settled, I sleep on the couch more than my bed, I rarely cook and all I seem to do is play ps3 and watch tv. Not to mention the outrageousness of my betfair account. In all honesty, I think it's at 6.5k down, after this weekend's 1k splash where the idea was to make back last weekend's 0.5k loss (and then in all likelihood, ""go for profit""). Even though I have the aforementioned apathy/lack of extreme moods, I think it's affected me. 

Then there's where I'm at with women. I did have pictures in my head at the beginning of this year that kristy and I would be a thing. She was even making it pretty obvious that we should've been. I was complacent about it, then paid the price when that mofo scott came along. I still don't know their full story, I assume they met at the end of term party i didn't go to because of me going to canada, and the rest just followed. It truthfully probably doubly upset me because it was the same scott that seemed to effortlessly get emma at the end of last year. The cream on the cake of this secret angst was of course that he was working in ward 4 all term when I was doing gen med up there, which has just finished. Frankly I think that would've upset me even if the kristy thing didn't happen, I just can't get on with him. I had a moment last night or maybe even today, where I was thinking about Amy. Not that I terribly miss her or that i even have much guilt about how that all went down, but just thinking where I'd be in life had I have called her back and kept things going. I'd most likely be living here with her, I'd be all grown up, but instead I'm 25 and spending most weekends at home, drinking and gambling. Smoking the last couple of weeks too. It's really kinda pathetic, but it's this culmination that's prompted this “bent paperclip” this time around and frankly I think it's helping. 

Not to mention of course the necessary angst that goes with starting a new term tomorrow, that being respiratory med. I've of course landed myself on the team that has Curtwall in it, which concerns me because it was him last year that had a go at me in theatres for not knowing anything. Truth be told I've been lucky with consultants this year, where none of them have been particularly taxing or upsetting. Frankly, Tony was a barrel of laughs, and the only ones I was under regularly last term were the gastro ones, where peterson scratched the surface of me not knowing much but I just got away with it. Hollings was always into the questions too but cared more about george. I pulled out the toronto notes to have a look at the resp chapter, saw that it was 45 pages long, thought it quite reasonable, had the day to read it, and didn't. It's a motivation issue, I kind of knew in myself I wasn't going to touch it. It was all ps3, tv and a miniscule amount of the book “it”, which I'm only reading cos bec asked me the other day if i'd read it when she was going through my bookshelf. 

I should elaborate further, even just for my own benefit, on the girls situation. Two nights ago was the RMO changeover party, and I left before it kicked on at that nightclub nextdoor to it, with Pip, where it was music to my ears that she didn't want to go in when we were in the line. Pip's always been a bit of a nothing in all of this regard, but when we were at home again and going to put a dvd on, i really wanted her to sit on the couch with me, but she of course chose the other one. I don't know if it was just a drunken throwback to how emma and i would've watched something or if i was desperately lonely or if i have a thing for pip. Probably a mix of all three, come to think of it. Then there's old faithful, Laura. It truthfully surprises me that our one time of actual sex turned out to be the only time. She was keen for it the following weeks, but I can't recall why that didn't carry on. Fucking 18 months ago now, that's probably the longest I've been not having sex since i started. Which, who am i kidding, wasn't that long ago anyway. Anywho, I've brought her up because I was at john's for xmas eve last year, and she was straight up cold to me. Not like, playing hard to get, but just not interested. She was drunk and sitting next to me and felt uncomfortable when i was leaned up on her when we were watching that bizarre film on john's computer. So, I don't think i've seen her since then. She seems to be hitting up the clubs a lot more and basically talking about her sexting and various hook ups she's had going on, which is like, whatever. But the last couple of weeks, it's gone back to days of old where the fb chatting turns into who's coming to who's house for what meal. It was pretty full on yesterday for lunch, but I decided against it, frankly I'm not sure why, and just logged out of the chat. Is it fear? The general depression that i've got going on? I don't know. Maybe it'd kickstart me into caring about things again.  

I'll sum up some of the positives. I was reasonably convinced as a medical student that I'd make a bad intern, because I couldn't take bloods well, I basically had never done a cannula, I never really put the effort in and basically taking a history was an umm and ahhh process and I was always scared someone would ask me a question. The bloods and cannulas turned out to be no problem, the history taking hasn't really come up but just general confidence will take care of that, as well as constant exposure to it and I know what to ask and whatnot. It's to do with my lack of motivation/rise in query depression over the last few months, I have nights on end free and refuse to even read the basic ALS/BLS stuff in the on call book. I don't even know where that little gem is. And my car is a disgrace, needs to be cleaned thoroughly, and I just can't be bothered. A cheeky second glass of red out of a box courtesy of mike is helping me put all this down and order it and structure some sort of mentality behind what the heck I've been doing in 2008. Truthfully, that's what it should boil down to. 2008 will forever be my intern year as a medical doctor. How will I remember it? Unchecked gambling addiction, drinking alone, sliding into depression and lethargy, not making any meaningful new friendships/relationships? As it stands, that's what the situation is. There's four months left of the year, I aim to fix these things. It's easy talk though - what are the plans for fixing it? Firstly, I need to just suck it up and get that treadmill I have the illusion of that'll open things up. I don't really doubt it though, the endorphins of post exercising is good enough to motivate me to do anything. Secondly, my intern approach needs to improve. I've been slack in terms of reading after hours, I've dissolved two saturday shifts, spent a saturday and a sunday fearful of being called in because both times I was drunk and hungover, and basically never gotten comfortable with a beeping pager on overtime. 

The overwhelming irony of this admirably lengthy bent paperclip is that it's now midnight on sunday night when I have to be starting my new rotation tomorrow morning where rounds will no doubt start at 7am. Basically I'm doing the kind of thing which is the crux of the issues I've raised as above. I'm happy to write it off though as an investment, because this kind of thing clears the head, gets the ideas out into a totally honest and frank summary, and that's not something I've done for a while. I never really did that with emma last year, but she was someone to talk to. She always seemed to have bigger issues than I did anyway, so maybe it kept me in check as to whether I had issues or not. Jack's been talking about travelling at the end of this month, which I'm keen to do but it will involve getting out of work on the saturday. I've done that twice now, and have in fact only been rostered on for two saturdays, so i'm at a pretty poor strike rate of attendance. By fortune I have two relief weekend days to my name which didn't require me. I'm on this sunday, which I'll do. It's a long weekend too, which is kind of annoying, but as if i was going to do anything worthy of anything anyway. Hopefully means all the teams will sort out their patients extra carefully for the long weekend and they'll be smooth sailing for the sunday. Doubt it. It'll be a good one to get in the bag though, since it'll be my first weekend day shift, and that's a hurdle I still need to jump. Also why I was so happy to have julian take my saturday shift yesterday. The RMO party would've been a bit less fun if I knew i had to work, but the relief i had when he took the shift was more to do with the fact i wouldn't have to work, rather than the fact i could drink heavily on the friday night. The only way to sort that out is to do these weekend shifts, which is just as well, since I seem to have five or six this term, out of the 11 weeks. Seems overly proportional based on the number of RMOs but them's the breaks. Also means I shouldn't have any guilt of getting out of that saturday shift that's holding up the travelling. 

Strangely therapeutic, writing all that, good job."

So I'm in Boulder, CO for a summer internship, and I've had a hard time finding out about electronic music in the area.  Everyone always said 'Denver is where you need to look buddy,' but I didn't know the first place to look.

Out of the blue one of my friends from back in Wisconsin who is living in the area tells me that Paul Oakenfold is playing at this place called Beta in Denver.  OH SHIT, a flash back to Sr. High School, and the '99 Essential Mix World Tour.  Late nights, Guild Wars, and Home @ Space in Ibiza... all these years and I've never seen the guy who initially fueled my love for trance music.

Long story short, this guy put on a hell of a show.  I heard a good mix of classics I listened to in high school and some of the newer stuff I hear on the podcasts.  I wasn't sure if he still did trance, but he most certainly does.  I had a huge smile for a lot of the show, so I'm sure people thought I was crazy or something.  I don't think I've been this happy since I saw Above &amp; Beyond for the first time.

Great night, great music, and I'm glad I could finally see and contribute a bit to the guy that helped me love this genre.

At the beginning of the semester there was a glitch in the system and I was put up for academic dismissal even though I got straight 'A's. That got ironed out and I was able to continue my education.

That's just the beginning of my troubles. I don't have a job, car, place of my own. Currently I'm staying with my mom but things are getting a little dicey. I still love my mom but I need to get out. The job market in my area is little to none, I get bitched at for not having a job. My mom still thinks that you can just walk up to a business and get hired. It's not the 80's anymore. I've tried to calmly explain why the job market is lousy, but according to ""Fox New's"" every word that comes out of my mouth is liberal.

To be honest I really need a job. I put my search on hold during this last semester. I had a very full course load. I was/am taking AC theory, Tech Math II (there was no pre-reqs but it's equivalent would be trigonometry with basic calculus. I took Tech Math I last semester which I would liken to College Algebra. Other than that I haven't taken a math class since I was in High School), Real Estate Economics, and a survey of rock and roll class.

I have multiple skills, I've worked at a lot of different places and have accrued a lot of different skills. Everything from customer service to defusing altercations. So why is it so hard for a white male in his mid-20's to get a job? If I can't find one soon I'll be living out of my backpack. It's nothing new to me, 2 years ago I was homeless and living on the streets in Anchorage and then Seattle for close to year. To be honest it wasn't the proudest time of my life, there are things I've done and never wish to do again; but, if put back in a survival situation I would do it all over.

I have 2 more years of 12+ units to be able to transfer to Cal-Poly. What good is that? It's not like it's everyday somebody has aspirations to be a physicist. Math and science have always come easy to me and I enjoy figuring out puzzles. What better puzzle to solve than our universe. Who else is going to rebuild the world or find us a new one when SHTF? The main areas I want to focus in are Nanotechnology and Artificial Life Programming. Not your everyday goals. This isn't some random idea that I had. I had to think about it for a long time. I've come to the realization that I am going to spend the next 10-12 years taking classes and attending symposiums before I am done with school. It doesn't end there; I hope to be learning something new for the rest of my life.

In closing, I would like to know if there is any way I can get an internship that would pay me and help me continue to go to school? Like I said there isn't much left for me where I'm at, and I am willing to work for what I want.

TLDR: I'm going to college to be a physicist and the man keeps putting me down.
I need a job but there are none to be had. I bet if I was Mexican..."

I'm a Dutch student from Holland and plan on starting my graduation internship in Melbourne. At the moment I am trying to figure out where I should look to find cheap and simple student rooms in Melbourne.

I already found a couple of student accomodation company's but the prices are a bit too high for my monthly budget. The pricerange I am looking for is around $480 a month. Is it even possible to find a student room around this price in Melbourne, or is it just wishfull thinking? I don't mind sharing the house or room at all, I live that way in Holland at the moment too.

If you have any tips or advice on where I should look, like websites, or organisations, then please let me know. I would really appreciate that.

Thanks for your time!

Advice?,mikenike192,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/humex/thinking_of_switching_from_ps3_to_pc_gaming_for/,"I've been playing ps3 since its release back in 2006 and I had a ps2 before that.I love shooter games on ps3, I'm a big fan of using a controller with COD. I have a couple games on PC (L4D 2 and Portal 2) that I think are fantastic and really enjoy. However the pc style of controls mouse/keyboard are still challenging for me though I am getting better. Before playing these games this year I hadn't really played any shooters on PC since the days of Metal of Honor Allied Assault and Rainbow Six. I feel superior playing shooters on the ps3 because I am very fluent with the controller and everybody likes doing well in matches.

I imagine myself still playing a lot of games on the ps3 in the future like FIFA as well as 3rd person games like Assassins Creed as I feel dual analog sticks are superior for navigating a 3d world. 

But with games coming out this fall like Battlefield 3 and Elder Scrolls V, I am thinking about switching to PC because the experience I feel will be superior. I have Battlefield 2 for PS2 and loved it and Elder Scrolls IV for PS3 and also loved that. But for these games I feel they are better suited for playing on a PC as the graphics and gameplay will be better with a mouse and keyboard.

I have a macbook pro 2.8ghz core 2 duo 4gb ram and discrete graphics card which I play games on right now and its okay, no where near stellar in terms of performance as the OSX implementation of steam and the half life engine is not of the same quality as the Win 7 version. I've always wanted to build a pc as I think it'll be a very rewarding experience and being a CS major I like tinkering. 

I like the idea of consoles as every game will run perfectly smooth and there is no need to worry about whether it'll run a new game. However  PC's have the capabilities of having better graphics than a PS3. What should I be looking to spend on a custom machine that will run BF3 and Elder Scrolls V smoothly at 1920x1200 which is what my monitor is. How long do pc components stay relevant, how long before you typically need to upgrade your system? Should I go all out with something like an i7 to future proof myself or is that unnecessary? I am also interested in being able to add OSX to the machine (hackintosh) as I really like Xcode and if I have a pc that is more powerful that my MBP why not use that to develop on, though at my internship this summer I'm using Visual Studio which is also a phenomenal IDE as I am working with VB net. Any one have any other advice?"
hu923,0,2011-06-07,I told a girl I'd call her tonight to schedule a 'hang out' session.  Need some general tips please.  A little more info inside.,[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/hu923/i_told_a_girl_id_call_her_tonight_to_schedule_a/,"My wife and I have been trying to get a third for some time now (we've been in an open marriage for some time, but neither of us has actually had sex outside the marriage yet).  A really cute girl at school has been flirting like crazy with me.  I have my FB status set to where no one can see my relationship status, and I recently set it so that only she can see it (and it says 'open relationship').  After I did that, she contacted me saying we should 'hang out.'  That was over a week ago, (we had to leave town for a week).  I don't know if she wants to get together only to hang out, or if she's down for some fun, but I figure the only way to find out is to have her come over (the plan is for me, her, and my wife to all hang out).  I told her something like ""I'd say we should have some drinks, but you're probably a lightweight,"" to which she responded ""I'll drink you under the table.""

So, it could go either way.

I need immediate advice on two things:

1.  General tips on calling her tonight (to schedule a Fri. or Sat. night evening at our house).  Things to make sure to do.  Things to avoid.  (this one is the most prescient, b/c I have to call her soon).  I don't have AA or anything, but she is kind of the shy type and (1) I'm afraid of an awkward lull in conversation, and (2) don't want to just call her, schedule and then by all like 'bye, talk to you later.'  It seems like I should make sure to have at least a little bit of banter or something.  I guess I could talk about her internship she's doing right now or the American Constitution Society Convention in DC I'm going to next week, but I just wanted to fish for some general and/or specific thoughts here before I call.

2.  Any additional thoughts you have on how to approach her and/or conduct myself, (or basically any tips you can think of) on the actual night when she comes over.  So far, we're thinking we'll have dinner ready at 8pm when she gets here, put the 2 yr old to bed at 9pm, hang out, bust out the drinks and then see where the night takes us.

hvtt3,9,2011-06-09,"There are no decent jobs in Miami, our only public hospital is being defunded, and our public schools can't afford paper. Rally with us on June 6th at Bayfront Park!",[deleted],Miami,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/hvtt3/there_are_no_decent_jobs_in_miami_our_only_public/,"Hey /r/miami,

So I just started this internship with the oneMiami campaign and realized that a bunch of other redditors are interning here with me, so we decided it would be cool to give the call to action here. 
The oneMiami campaign is part of a broader grassroots campaign happening in cities across the country called Fight for a Fair Economy, and we have been organizing the lower income neighborhoods of Miami so that we can build a movement to counter the corrupt politics of Florida. 

Some Background: Carnival Cruise Line pays no taxes, and they only pay 200 dollars a YEAR to be able to use the Port of Miami (!). To top it off, none of the employees on their ships are from Miami, but they often send these employees to Jackson Hospital to get free/cheap treatment. Carnival is profiting off of our city, yet they aren't REALLY giving anything back. 
Wells Fargo is also guilty of not paying any taxes, despite having their gigantic building right in Downtown. 

Rick Scotts budget is going to eliminate almost 5000 state jobs and will force local governments to carry out thousands more layoffs in city and county jobs.

Over 13 percent of people in Miami are unemployed, and in lower income neighborhoods that statistic is as high as 30 percent. Meanwhile, unemployment benefits are being cut drastically.

Florida Lawmakers have made the deepest cuts to education in Florida's history, which will bring Miami's school district to a 90 million dollar budget deficit this year!

Politicians like Rick Scott continue to skirt the interests of the public good. The Miami-Dade School Board is corrupt as heck. Jackson is the only hospital in Miami where a lot of lower income families can expect to get cared for, and it is already going to have 130 million dollars cut from its funding, putting it at serious risk of being shut down or cut back. 

The gist of it is this: Miami isn't poor, yet for some reason our government never seems to have the money for the things that we NEED as citizens. Local businesses are getting taxed to high hell while big corporations continue to pay off both major political parties so that they can continue to screw us. I know, I know, I am preaching to the choir, but hear me out. There are more of US then there are of THEM, even though they have all the money. 

We have been organizing small meetings in churches and parks in over 20 locations in the lower income neighborhoods of Miami, such as Little Haiti and Hialeah, and gathering steam as a grassroots movement. This rally is going to be the kickoff to our big collective actions. I've been phonebanking nonstop for the past few days getting commitments from people to show up for Saturday and it's looking good.

We are meeting at Bayfront Park at 1 PM, and we will have people going up as ""witnesses"" to talk about their issues. There will also be a DJ present, and we will be providing water so that we can all beat the hot sun. We have a bunch of buses providing transportation to and from the event from the various community meeting spots that I mentioned earlier so that even people who can't afford to drive out to downtown or who are elderly/disabled can still come and voice their opinion.

Come and tell your story. Graduated with a college degree but you are waiting tables because theres no better job oppurtunity? Can't find a job at all for months? You rely on Jackson Hospital to help your child when he gets sick? Your tired of seeing your local highschool beg their students for reams of paper? Tired of seeing gigantic potholes all over Miami Beaches streets? Whatever it is, come and make it known. 

We will be holding a mock ""Grand Jury"" to ""indict"" Wells Fargo, Carnival, etc. and then marching together as a huge group to the Wells Fargo Building to deliver our letter of discontent. 

I created a new account so that our campaign can continue to use reddit in the future seperate from me as an individual, but I will post under my account later so you can see who I am and scrutinize me, etc. I'll also get the other redditors to do so as well.

onemiaminow.org


TL;DR: Come to Bayfront Park at 1 PM on Saturday, June 11th, so that we can make a statement as pissed off citizens of this damn city that we are strong and unified. 

Edit: I can't change the title, but it is indeed on Saturday, June 11th, not June 6th. Fail..."

hwhb9,22,2011-06-10,"Alright, r/Christianity, we need to talk.",[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/hwhb9/alright_rchristianity_we_need_to_talk/,"Mine is a story most... ridiculous, and way too large for just one self post.  However, I've been putting off talking about some of this stuff for far too long, so I figured I should at least somewhere, and here we are.

First and foremost, yes, I am a Christian, and not a troll. 

Secondly, I am angry. Spiteful even.  Here's why:

I got married roughly 5.5 years ago to what turned out to be a manipulative, co-dependent individual. She lied her way into my life, heart, and marriage. I was ministering at a large (3,000+) member church at the time in children's ministry and was working on my pastoral license after taking a year internship when we were wed.

As those in ministry know, it is critical to have a supportive spouse who has the same calling and purpose. There was no reason for me to believe otherwise in our relationship. Or I was too young or unwilling to see it. Hindsight and all that.

Shortly after we were wed, she gave me the 'Big 3' - a list of demands that came out of nowhere: 1) Kids. NAO. 2) She doesn't want to work. 3) Buy a house.

Completely blindsided, I did my best to please my wife and walk in my calling.  I took on a second job on top of my studies and working full time+ at church. It still wasn’t enough for her – she demanded I quit the ministry and get a ‘real’ job (since the church paid so little).  She refused to go to counseling or talk to any pastors at the church because they would ‘be on my side.’ Yet, when I went to talk to them myself, all they’d tell me was that I was a pastor; figure it out. Or that I need to lead better. Or that I need to man up and run my marriage.  And thousands of other unhelpful, broad Christian-ese sayings.

I had my pastoral license a week before I left the church. But that’s another story for another time, perhaps.

As it turned out, my wife came from a rather strict family with some pretty hefty traditions, including getting married young (great grandma was 16, grandma was 17, mom was 18, etc), and pregnant within the first year. My wife was 20 when we started dating, so she was already the black sheep, and her mother was sure making her feel like it.  Her younger sister though, who was a junior in high school, was already engaged and the pride of the family.

Once we started dating, she literally did everything in her power to learn what I wanted/needed in a spouse, pretended to be that, and we got married a few months before her sister in an effort to please the will of her mother (this is where her co-dependency kicks in).

More family tradition is to run a very matriarchal household, where the husband is naught but a ‘yes-man,’ doing whatever it takes to please every whim of his wife, regardless of cost, law, or common sense.  

What I have isn’t a marriage. It isn’t a partnership. It is nothing but a lie that I am trapped in and can’t escape.

I have become severely depressed, have anxiety attacks, and have no hope for anything. Everything was going perfect, then she came into my life and sucked all the joy out of it, and, as a Christian man/father with a 2 year old and another on the way, there’s not a whole lot I can do.

Feel free to AMA.  There are a lot of details I’m skipping on since this is already a novel.  I will answer every question to the best of my ability.

Yes, I still believe in Jesus. No, I don’t understand how I’m supposed to move on from here, how to forgive my spouse for what she’s done (boy have I tried), or how I could possibly have a happy life of anything other than going through the motions and waiting to die.

I am trapped between marriage, morals, convictions, depression, common sense, self-preservation, and the Bible. How do get my life back again? How do I become happy again? How do I become useful again?

**Tl:dr – ex pastor who got manipulated into marriage, is trapped, fighting severe depression, and has no positive outlook on life or hope whatsoever.**

I ended my relationship over something extremely stupid, but I felt like I needed to do it...",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx2tc/a_lie_is_a_lie_right_did_i_do_the_right_thing_i/,"I know this is long.. please bear with me.
This may sound ridiculous and I know that what I did was dumb and awful, so please, dont be so hard on the comments... :/

My boyfriend(20) and I(19), being in a serious long distance relationship for more than a year (been close friends ever since we were 14), made honesty our number one priority, but a couple days ago, he messed it up... for something extremely stupid. It bothers me so much, because HE was the one who used to make honesty such a big deal in this relationship and he told me that he absolutely HATES liars, and so I decided, after some wrongdoings that I did in the past, that I'll never make the mistake of lying to him again. 

I'll get to the point so this post doesn't end up extremely long.
Two nights ago, my boyfriend called me at midnight like he occasionally does every night. We talked for no more than 20 minutes when he told me that he was extremely exhausted and wanted to go to sleep. I wanted to talk to him longer because we havent really had a ""real"" conversation in such a long time, but I didn't want him to have to stay awake, hearing how ""tired"" he was. So we hung up. I was a bit sad because we didn't talk for too long... 

[Something I should note: usually, with our LDR, he lives in Pennsylvania and I live in California, so that's about a 3 hour difference. For the summer though, he got an intern in California, there's no difference in time.]

Anyways, two hours later, I go on my facebook and see a post that he made a few seconds before. It was a post of the very hot actress that I've been having jealousy problems with (see my previous/first note that explains this whole stupidity with the actress &gt;.&lt; shortlink: redd.it/hvfvt) and with that picture, a caption saying something like ""OMG. *fapfapfap*"" I seriously cannot explain the feeling I got in my chest. Note: my boyfriend KNOWS how much of a problem I have with this actress because of previous incidents, but for this time, I really felt like it wasn't just because of her. He truly sounded VERY tired over the phone. Even though I wanted to talk to him SO BADLY, I let him go BECAUSE he said he was going to sleep. Two hours later, I find this post and he is obviously not sleeping. He went to go watch his T.V. shows that this actresses was in, and decided to look at more pictures of her on the internet  instead of talking to me, his girlfriend who he hasn't spoken to for a while, a litte longer on the phone. 
After a few seconds, the post got deleted and my boyfriend posts a status update that said, ""stupid roommates...."" Knowing him, I knew it wasn't his roommates because 1.) he told me before that he was going to have his own room in his apartment and 2.) he is a very private person when it comes down to his computer and his accounts and rarely lets anyone else use it, so I knew something was up. I posted a comment saying ""sweetie, we all know it wasn't your roommates ;]"" and he replies something like ""darling, if I intended to post that picture myself, I would've worded the caption differently."" and after that I was just like ""watever lol."" 
After that, I stayed up all night because it was bothering me and I had to study for a test for school, and I also posted my first post on reddit. I didn't hear anything back from my boyfriend until that morning (the morning after the facebook post night) and he just texted me something stupid about a dream that he had, and didn't mention anything about what happened the previous night. I ignored it and didn't text anything back. 

After that, I didn't hear anything back or talk to him for two days. 

Earlier tonight, he finally called because he knew I was upset about something. He explained what happened that night because he knew I was upset and he told me and admitted that he lied to me just so he can keep his image on facebook and his friends. He told me he accidentally posted that picture on his wall when he intended to post it on his friend's, and that he tried to cover that up by putting the status about his ""stupid roommates"" and replied to my comment as another coverup. He thought that since I made the right assumption that his roommates didn't post that up on his wall, that I already knew what was going on and he didn't have to explain himself. He tried to tell me that he wasn't trying to lie to me, but he just trying to ""lie to the people on facebook""(those were is actual words). Well guess what, I was one of those people on facebook. He kept making excuses. He thinks this whole thing is stupid because it was on facebook. He hates facebook. He told me that he had every intention on telling me the truth after, but I did not get a phone call or a text after he lied to me, saying that he lied to cover up his mistake. Honestly, if he had told me that right after it happened, I'd be a bit more understandable and okay with it. 
I know it sounds stupid, but I cannot and don't know how much more emphasis to put when I say that he made HONESTY our NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. He has always been a decent guy. Trustworthy, supportive, everything a girl can ask for in a boyfriend, but he throws that all away on this stupid thing just so he can ""keep his image"" on facebook. Honestly, I don't care what kind of lie it was; a lie is a lie, right? 


I know this whole thing is stupid and we're both being immature, especially me. I know I should just be able to let this one pass and forget about it, and I want to so badly because I really did love him so much, but with the condition that I am in, I know I cant. I know I'm still young and immature. I am totally aware of that. That's why I ended things with him. Honestly, if I wasn't so dumb and messed up emotionally/mentally in the head, things would've worked out, but I have so many problems and trust issues that I know I shouldn't deal with having a relationship like this (especially a LDR). He knew how bad my issues with trust were, but he did this to me anyways. This hurts me so much. I am obviously not ready for a serious relationship like this one was and I am too stupidly young. 

I admit that I impulsively ended it with him, but I did the right thing, right? For the both of us?...
I'm sorry if you thought this was a waste of time to read... :/ I am still a foolish young lady. "

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, there was a fairly well established feral cat colony already established. I did not realize how big of a problem it was until after I was living here. I didn't know much about feral cat colonies at the time. I though we could ignore them and they would go away. Nope. They killed things and fought and got really really sickly. I felt bad so I started feeding them and trapping some of them to take the the vet. There, they were fixed, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch. I was told that even if I removed all of them or put them all down, once a property was used as a site for a feral colony, there would always be a colony there. This seems to be true. It doesn't matter how low the numbers get. More always show up. Early on, when the numbers were really low (three uncatchable feral cats), I started taking in rescues. At this point, people in my small town knew that I would do everything in my power to help sick, hurt, abused, neglected, or homeless animals. Someone would tell me about a cat that was living in a crack house and was being abused and I would show up and not leave until I had the cat. I would help rehab it and place it. People would drop cats off at my property and I would deal with them. At this time, I made decent money and could afford to help. Everything was under control. 

Today, things are very much out of control. At least, that is how I feel at the moment. A number of things happened all at once and everything is a mess. I had to help my mom out financially because my little sister started having severe mental health issues and we ended up with a ton of medical bills. My hours were cut at my job (same with the rest of the staff). I now make less than $3000 a year. I am in graduate school and have to finish an unpaid internship before I can graduate. I love it but it takes a lot of time. I made it through college with very little debt but now I am taking out student loans just to help with my cat/financial situation. I am the first person in my family to go to college. Graduate school is a huge freaking deal to them. I can't quit now when I am so close to being done. I recognize that some of this is just my own pride but I was the kid in town who came from the bad family and I wasn't supposed to amount to anything at all (but that is another story). 

Some of the oldest cats that couldn't be caught have had kittens. People keep dropping off cats without even talking to me. Fewer people are willing to take them in. I spend hundreds of dollars every month on food, vet bills, spaying/neutering, shots, flea meds, wormer, etc. I really can't afford it anymore but I do it. I've contacted cat houses, the humane society, and a few other organizations in Nebraska but I can't find any help outside of paying to have them put down or paying $70 a cat to put them in a shelter where they may or may not be put down. The Cat House is full. I do attend an annual spay and neuter clinic but even with the discount, it is expensive. Last month, my bill was about $400 for 5 cats (shots, wormer, 1 spayed, 4 neutered). Furthermore, people in my town have started doing horrible things to animals (not just mine). Animals are being shot, poisoned, tortured, drugged, drowned, and disappearing. I was in the process of building a cat fence before my financial situation fell apart but now I can't afford it. I'm really scared. I have a cat that needs surgery but I can't get it. It isn't a life or death situation but she needs her left eye removed and I just don't have the money. I feel bad. 

I regularly donate and help others IRL. When I work, I solicit donations from patrons to help with different causes. I have received some help from people in my community (e.g., bags of cat food, a vet bill paid) but I've run out of people to ask. This is a small town. Those who are willing to help with the cats already have and the rest are not willing. I'm not asking anyone to send me money or anything, I'm just looking for ideas on where to go or resources that I can look into. I did post on a different subreddit today where a person was offering help for people in need of pet food. I will be posting proof later. I'm not sure what all I should provide but I'm planning on posting pics of some of the cats, vet bills, a facebook post where I talked about animals being abused in town, a post offering kittens free to a good home, and a pic of one of my pay stubs. If you want anything else, let me know. 

TL;DR I tried to help cats when I was able to do so. I am no longer able to do as much and will be struggling for the next few months. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will return the favor when I am done with my internship and able to get a better job. 

If you want the town that I live in or my phone number or anything, please pm me. I am uncomfortable posting those things. 

**EDIT: PROOF:**
I have uploaded some photos of a few of the cats (more to follow because we have a ton now), a few of the vet bills (same), one of my most recent pay stubs, and some old facebook posts about the things being done to pets.

**Edit** - changed imgur to an album because I missed one person's information on facebook and can't delete the pic. So I made it private and put everything else in a public album - added a fixed version of that picture as well as screenshots of a donation I received today from a redditor who has just blown me away. I cannot thank this person enough.

**Edit**

I wanted to give some numbers in terms of how many cats are currently here and how many are feral. 

We have 5 feral cats left over from the original colony. These cats have been wormed but not fixed. 4 are females and 1 is male.

We have 2 black cats that were dropped off and are mostly tame They act like they really want to be pets. One of the black ones was pregnant when she was dropped off. She has had 3 kittens (the gray, black, and black and white ones in the photos). I am unsure about their vet history. They are not fixed so that is on the agenda. Same with shots and wormer.

We have 1 male black and white cat that was beaten pretty badly. He is learning to trust people again. He has his shots but isn't fixed. This is on the agenda.

We have 1 really old yellow tomcat that was left at a house after his owner was placed in a nursing home. Her children don't want him so now he is here. His face is messed up from a dog attack. We've been putting antibiotics on it but need to take him to a vet. 

We have 1 tame cat with a genetic eye problem. She has been fixed and has all shots. No one wants a cat who is going blind. 

We have 1 tame long haired black cat that lived in a meth house. He is fixed and has all of his shots. I'm also trying to find him a home. 

We have 1 Siamese mix. He was found when he was two weeks old and bottle fed. He has a bunch of anxiety problems and has been poisoned in the past. He can't be placed because he is neurotically attached to me. He has his shots and has been fixed.

We have 1 long hair gray and white cat that was literally stuck to the highway during winter. He has been fixed and has his shots.

We have 1 short hair siamese looking cat with an eye that needs removed. She came from the cat with the bad eye that was mentioned above. She will also go blind. She has all of her shots and has been fixed. 

We have 2 male tiger striped cats that have seizure disorders. They are fixed and have shots. They also came from a meth house. 

We have 1 big gray cat and 1 big long haired orange cat. They were my first cats. They're mother was hit by a car when they were kittens. The others from the litter died and my professor gave them to me to bottle feed. He was going to put them down. The gray one has rolling back syndrome. 

We also currently have 2 long hair gray/white siamese-ish kittens (6 weeks old and tame), 1 tiger striped/calico male kitten (6 weeks old and tame), 1 yellow male kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black female kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a white tip on his tale (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a calico face (tame and 8 weeks old), 3 tiger striped kittens and 1 yellow kitten that are special needs kittens. They were born in someone's basement and the mother disappeared. They were almost dead when they were brought over. They are being bottle fed at the moment. They will need a lot of attention. I think they are about 5 weeks old. I don't know if anyone will ever take them. All of these kittens need homes.

Someone suggested that I come to this subreddit. I am following any and all leads.

This is going to be a bit of a long story. I know that I am partially at fault so please don't go out of your way to point that out; I promise that will make me cry. Also, please please please don't tell me to just kill them all. I won't and that will also make me cry. I'm a bit of a baby lately.

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, there was a fairly well established feral cat colony already established. I did not realize how big of a problem it was until after I was living here. I didn't know much about feral cat colonies at the time. I though we could ignore them and they would go away. Nope. They killed things and fought and got really really sickly. I felt bad so I started feeding them and trapping some of them to take the the vet. There, they were fixed, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch.

hzq4k,8,2011-06-14,Dating my intern... help!,AltyMcAlterson,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hzq4k/dating_my_intern_help/,"Hey all, really need some advice here.  Ages: 24F (me), 22M.  About a month ago we got a new intern at work.  He and I hit it off immediately; we spent a lot of time talking and chatting over IM, discovering we had mutual interests.  I have always had one ironclad rule for work, and that is:  Never date someone you work with.  I've seen it go wrong so many times.  Well, it's great to have a rule in theory; it can be a lot harder in practice.  I was very attracted to our new intern and I thought he had a great personality, plus we have so many mutual interests and he is great at making me smile.  It was pretty clear he was interested in me too; he spent a lot of time in my office just talking, he would shower me with compliments (""you're awesome"" ""you're so fun"" ""you have a great smile"" etc), he'd wait for me after group meetings so he could walk and talk with me, and so on.  Within about 2 weeks, 3 different co-workers laughingly mentioned my ""new admirer"".  Another co-worker told me this morning that she overheard some people talking about it.  I work at a very small, close-knit site so gossip is rampant about stuff like this.  I tried to avoid showing interest, both to keep down the gossip and also because I was so adamant about not dating a co-worker, but apparently I wasn't wholly successful.

So this past weekend he and I hung out with a group of co-workers.  He ended up walking me home and confessed his feelings, and I told him I felt the same way.

Here's the problem:  At my company (ok, this is probably true at every company) it is DEFINITELY frowned upon to date an intern, as a full-time worker.  It is even frowned upon to date someone you work closely with, when there is no difference in rank/standing.  It's not like we have official company policies that say you can't do it, and it's not like there will even be a note left in my file, but it may leave a bad impression on those I work with.  On the bright side, I have nothing to do with the work assignments he's been given.  On the down side, he therefore has no reason to be in my office as much as he is so it looks very suspicious.

To complicate things, there are two people in my office - both of whom have offices just down the hall from me - who started dating about a year ago.  They attempted to keep it quiet at first but eventually got called out.  They endured a substantial amount of gossip, teasing, and general grief for it, but never any ""official"" problems (that I'm aware of).  However, right now they are going through a messy break-up and the drama has started to spill into work hours.  It's a nervewracking reminder of what could happen to me, if I'm not careful.

So, I have a bunch of questions:

- Should I be dating my intern?  Yes, he's younger than me; yes, I'm out of college while he is still in college and will need to return for one more year. (this is my friends' biggest argument against it)  I don't think there is a huge difference in maturity levels.

- What should I expect from this relationship, knowing he has to go back to school (halfway across the country) in 3 months?  I don't know if I necessarily need advice on this, as much as I need to wrap my head around the idea that if things go really really well, I may be getting myself into an LDR.  It's pretty clear that he is very interested in me and he's made it perfectly clear he wants to truly date - not just mess around.

- Should we attempt to hide this relationship from co-workers?  It's not going to be easy if we do.  Already there's been enough gossip that people are sensitive when they see us together.

- Should I mention anything to HR?  I realize that if things explode in my face, I want to make sure I keep HR informed, but it's very tempting to try to hide the whole thing altogether.

Thanks in advance for any help!"

If you are looking for internships at the Big4, I'm sure you'll find this information useful. 
All credits to Potatogun, he is an awesome guy!! 

Consider reading the [Big4 AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/glvzt/big_4_public_accounting_ama_qa_through_the_weekend/) for more information about the Big4. 


Question 1:

I will be a junior next year and will be taking intermediate accounting during the Fall semester (which is when I'm be applying). Is it common for juniors to get Big4 internships? B/c I heard from someone that you usually work for a mid-tier firm your junior yr, then a big4 in your senior year because Big4 wants to see accounting experience.

&gt;In the US if you aren't in a specific masters program (5 year), then during the 3rd year is normally when you apply for Big4 internships. The internship being the summer before your 4th year.
&gt;It is unnecessary to have prior accounting experience to land a Big4 internship. Rather you need the grades, and whatever varied life experiences and/or involvement. That could mean leadership, volunteering, part time work help pay the bills, or even sports/music hobbies that you're really involved in. It also is very dependent on your networking, because honestly internships are the hardest thing to land (compared to full time hiring). Big4 now probably source about 60-80% of their full time start classes via the internships. That means that these are the very best candidates in the eyes of the firm.

Question 2: 

Do you mind describing what interns do on a daily bases during the summer term? If I got an internship in assurance/audit, what would I be doing?

&gt;Interns usually have a couple weeks of training to introduce them to whatever audit/tax/advisory work they are going to be working in. Generally the idea is to expose you to as much client service work as possible. Time at the client site or client-facing roles will obviously differ from audit to tax to advisory.
&gt;You generally will help an engagement team by doing all sorts of misc tasks. This can range from help organizing data, copying, picking up food, 'rolling' forward documentation for the next review or audit or helping do some basic test work. This might not sound very exciting, and honestly the actual work part might not be, but you will feel the stress of wanting to do the best you can to make the best impression on your team. So it's your own little set of challenges. Talking to a client seems incredibly daunting of a task. It can be even as a first year starting out (okay, it definitely is at times). Even as an intern you will most likely feel out of your comfort zone. That's a good thing.

Question 3:

I know there are 2 interviews, the on-campus and the office. To get the on-campus interview, it's all based on how well the interviewers knows you and your resume. Do you remember how the interview goes? Is it like: I sit down, and the interviewer starts asking questions after question, then after he is finished, I walk out and calls on the next guy? Is the interview very structured or friendly conversation-like? Do you have any tips on how to do well on the interviews, specifically the behavior questions?

&gt;The interview process is generally what you mentioned. One on campus and 'one' in office. The in office may be multiple interviews but back to that in a bit. For on campus, it generally means you've gotten this interview because you meet the basic grade/experiences (remember not necessarily WORK experience) requirements and have probably networked a bit. If you are not the most stellar candidate then the networking plays a huge role in getting an interview. You want to interact with as many professionals you can where you can establish relationships. This doesn't just mean talking to EVERY single person. You want each person to remember a bit about you. Aside from the generic work questions, please don't start asking about accounting topics. Be a person. Talk about social life or activities out of work that might pique the interest of the professionals you're talking to. We take notes and compile them on candidates, but try to just keep it as conversation; professional with some slight touch of humor.
&gt;The on-campus interview interview is probably 30m with 1 or 2 people. Probably a Manager, sometimes a Partner or even recruiter if things are short staffed. Generally these questions are behavioral and more specific to your resume. Know what you have on your resume; be able to talk about whatever you've mentioned in any writing. I would say the structure depends on the person. However, it is generally more structured than an office interview with a partner. You will likely have a greeter who is an associate. They are there to break the ice. When you meet your interviewer, have a firm handshake and look them in the eye (or at their nose). Be confident but not arrogant. If at any point you are tripped up on a question just ask to think about it a moment. Do some research about your office location of interest. What's the industry there? What are some major clients? How big is the office? Know some about the firms' community service focus or programs such as sending people abroad. Show interest in how the firm develops its people and gives back to the community, etc.
&gt;The general advice I can give about behavioral questions is to think about all the scenarios you've been tired, worked hard, and accomplished something. Be very self reflective because there are probably a lot of things you don't think are impressive at all. They can be examples from school, to family, to work, to self projects. You always want to try to convey that you can be responsible, take charge, be a team player, be communicative, caring, innovative, and willing to push yourself and better yourself. Because remember the goal of the behavioral questions are to find if you fit the qualities of person who can work hard and long hours being an associate at a Big4 firm. If your time goes over the allotment or you go on a stretch one a single topic that you and your interviewer are passionate about, then you know things are going well.
&gt;When your interview ends, reiterate your interest in the internship and the firm after having spoken to the interviewer.


Question 4:

Is the office interview still all behavior questions? Is it round-robin style where you interview with the managers and HR people? I heard from people that the office interview is just to see if you have a good personality and are nice and not about your GPA/resume stats. So should my main goal be: smiling, be friendly, and just have a good time?


&gt;The office interviews are more like a day or two program/event. They generally have you stay the night before so you can go out to dinner with some fellow interviewees and some professionals. This helps ease you in and break the ice. You will likely have presentations and some group discussion/Q&amp;A with other students interviewing. Then you will probably interview with 2-3 people. At least a partner and probably a Sr. Manager or two. These are much more like conversations. But they are really behavioral in how you act and respond. You want to be calm, friendly, and likable. Get the person to talk about herself. Career, family, interests, travel experiences, etc. Try to find some common ground.
&gt;I highly doubt you'd interview with HR. Generally this isn't the process for college recruits. That might be more for experienced people trying to negotiate.
&gt;After all interviews send thank you emails.

After I hit my final straw, I came out and changed my major to Public Health Education, AND transferred to the school I wanted to go to.  I cut myself off financially from them and went out on my own.  I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota Duluth with my public health degree, WITH honors, the top graduating student award, and after receiving a full ride scholarship.  After applying to a million different internships and jobs, feeling defeated, and reading r/lgbt posts on people who have fought diversity and become successful (which kept me chugging along), I just got the final email today that I got a PHENOMENAL job at Boston Medical Center and will be moving there in September.  Coming out was the beginning to the best part of my life.  I am now successful and happy with who I am and where I am going.  Thanks Reddit for keepin' on the lgbt positive and giving me the motivation to keep on keepin' on :)

TL;DR: Came out, went out on my own, graduated and got my dream job. "
hzk17,2,2011-06-14,"Reddit, have you ever had to give up a pet?",nekoshii,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/hzk17/reddit_have_you_ever_had_to_give_up_a_pet/,"Hey Reddit,

So a little background:  I have a parrotlet named Cielo and I've had him since he was 5 weeks old.  He's 11 months old now, and recently started talking and can say, ""Kisses!"", ""Step up!"", and ""Hey, bird!"".

It goes without saying that we share a special bond;  I love my little guy!

The trouble is, however, I'm a recent college graduate.  I haven't been able to find any jobs or internships in the area and plan on moving wherever I find one.  It'd be difficult to take little Cielo with me because it's at least $100 to fly him with me one way, don't have a car, and plan on moving wherever I can find a job.  And there, the worry is whether I can find a place that would allow pets.

Having him during the year was a bit difficult, too, and I often gave up precious study time to come home and take him out of the cage to play.

I feel like at this life stage, I'm not exactly ready to have a pet.  I feel that I *should* give him to a family so that he could have a more stable life (not that I don't take great care of him!) and also 

But at the same time, I feel that I know him best and would love him best (cliche, I know).  He's also bonded to me, so I'm wondering how it would affect him.

In an ideal situation, I could find a fellow bird-lover who's experienced with parrots and is willing to take another bird under his wing.  So far, I've had no luck finding anyone :(

So what should I do, Reddit?  To be completely honest, I don't feel as though I have the time to devote to a pet and would love to find him a happy new home.  I think I'd just have trouble letting go and believing that others would take care of him as well as I did.

What's your opinion of the situation?  Have you ever had any similar experiences?


**TL;DR - Life circumstances are giving me doubts about my ability to keep my bird.  What should I do?  What are your opinions/experiences?**


Here are some photos of my little guy!  I just can't resist showing him off :)

We did not write our own vows and I'm not really the type to put my emotions in words or really speak them for that matter but this morning I started to think about our long journey. I thought getting it out in writing would help me remember it better and figured I would share it with you guys.

WALL OF TEXT

The first time I noticed you was in a class we had together our junior year . You were sitting there leaning on the desk not really paying attention and you seemed like you were deep in thought. I knew who you were because we had been in the same grade since middle school but I never really noticed you until that day. I could stop thinking about you and talked to my best friend how hot I thought you were and he took that as a challenge. He gave you my number in home room and you gave him your number for me. He told you to call me but you told him if I wanted to talk to you I would have to call you. I never ended up calling you but we did meet in the hall way before our respective sports practices. Over the next few days we talked to each other in the hall and that weekend I asked you on our first date. We saw a movie and got a drink at the fast food restaurant next door afterward. I was so nervous when I paid that I accidentally ripped the money in half before paying. You traded me the ripped money for a fresh bill. I was nervous and didn’t make a lot of eye contact but we sat and talked about whatever for a while and we parted ways. Over the next few weeks we started to hang out more, mostly watching movies and either of our parent’s houses. We had live less than ten minutes apart from each other most of our lives but never knew it. This made seeing each other much easier.  I eventually “officially“ asked you out and that began the real start to our relationship and ultimately our friendship. We spent the next year enjoying our senior year together and you were there for my victories and loses. We graduated that year. You were heading off to a local private college to study to be a nurse and I had gotten a job as an apprentice electrician with a local company. We tried to spend as much time together but college takes up a lot of time and some days I would just go to sleep early out of exhaustion but we made it work. I eventually decided I wanted to go to college and you supported me in my decision. I chose a local college that one of my high school buddies was attending so we would still be close to each other. I finally got an apartment with a few roommates and we were able to spend much more quality time together, well as alone as you could be with roommates. You cooked me meals and you helped me with the shopping and my laundry.  The next year we moved into a duplex and you live in the top apartment and I lived in the bottom. This way we appeased our parents but it gave us the chance to sort of live together. I was able to get an internship with a great company and started with them full time after I graduated. I vividly remember when they called me in to tell me they wanted to hire me full time. As soon as they told be the first thing that came to my mind was that I wanted to marry you. On the way home I stopped at Meijer’s and picked out the largest gaudiest fake ring I could find. That day in the car to your parents you kept pestering me about how it went at work and I couldn’t tell you because I wanted to surprise you.  While I was fixing your parents computer, you went into your room to get something.  I told you I had a surprise for you and told you to come over and close your eyes. My heart was going a mile a minute and in one breath without pauses I told you about the job and asked you to marry me. At first you thought I was kidding but then realized I wasn’t. We both had moved in with our parents to save money and you had one more year of school left. It was a tough year going from being able to spend so much time alone to have to be together with our parents but we made it though. We moved into an apartment together this past weekend and you are going to finally move in after we get married Saturday. Over the last six and a half years we have had good times and bad, we have lived, love, laughed, learned and grows together. I can’t imagine a life without you by my side and could not think of anyone I would rather grow old with. You were my first for, well everything and now you are just my everything and I can’t wait for this Saturday to start the next chapter in our lives together.

hyzpy,1,2011-06-13,"Reddit, what is your best/craziest ""wait, what just happened"" or ""how did that just work"" story???",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hyzpy/reddit_what_is_your_bestcraziest_wait_what_just/,"A few years back, my cousin was making an increasingly rare visit to see me and other family. After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

After I hastily semi-dry myself, I proceed to the closet to pick out some clothes. As I try to decide what to throw on, my mind is also racing trying to figure out what sort of explanation I am going to give as to my tardiness. Bingo. Got 'em coach.

When I arrive at the entrance of the office, I take a deep breath and put on a California afternoon smile. As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda or something like that. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking (Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated, and my friend mentioned that his company was hiring. Damn it, I'm going to punch my cousin.), the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

**tl;dr:**

   1. Drank like a fish
   2. Woke up late and threw on a suit
   3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting
   4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""
   5. got a raise

Also, granite countertops apparently look more comfortable than pillow-top mattresses when you are piss-drunk.

Has anyone here used JUCE in Android? It's supposed to work with it. Right now all our GUI is defined using JUCE. The company seems interested in creating mobile applications of the product but it almost seems as if we'll have to start from the ground up because much of the program is GUI driven. That is, unless we can use JUCE gui on an Android. Which I don't know if that is possible. Or even if it is, I don't know if handling input will be possible, or if there will be a multitude of other problems

I have a late 90's Raleigh R700 Competition with Shimano Ultegras that I started riding this past April. Before my summer job I was riding 5 days a week, about 25 miles each day with a long 60 miler on the weekend. Average speed I would say was 17mph.

I am currently working 60 hours a week (plus 20 hours of driving a week) as a Field Engineer Intern. This has severely crippled my time I have to ride. I have from 6:30-8pm M-F, 4:30-8pm Sat, all day Sun free.

There is a cycling event at my college very similar to IUs little 500. It is in April. Teams of 4 ride a single fixed gear bike around a 1/4 mile track for 40 miles, trading off when need be. Time trail speeds for 1/2 a mile are around 1:05 (~27 mph) and near the end of the race are about 1:20 (~23 mph). Normal strategy for most teams is to switch riders every 2 laps.

I would like to train for this event on my relatively little time schedule. I can go back to training 6 days a week in August. I really know nothing in terms of training for cycling. I do know that since these are fixed gear bikes that building a powerful high cadence is important. 

Most of my friends that have done the little 500 have told me to build up my hours on the bike in the fall (I would like to be up to at least 10 hours a week), then start working on intervals / cadence in the winter / spring (I have rollers it the weather is bad / under 35*F).

Any ideas on a good 6 day a week schedule?

Any ideas on a good 4 day a week schedule for my current time constraint? I am thinking: || Wed: medium intensity 1 hour || Fri: intervals / hills 1 hour || Sun: long ride 4 hours || Mon: recovery ride 1 hour

Get out of this industry as fast as you can!",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i22ia/im_a_programmer_just_started_internship_in/,"When I ask people why they chose this career, most just shrug their shoulders. There's no passion in the work. The business is very top-down, so on top developing for a small consumer base, no one even really understands how what they work on fits into the big picture. There is no team dynamic in the groups I've seen, and they don't use models that are an effective use of employees' time.

Every speaker, every event, has stressed how important it is to network. Everyone is so concerned with moving up the hierarchy so they make decisions based on that. No one makes career decisions based on what they like do to.

I know I only have a limited view, but the whole point of internships is to check out the business. Tech companies have shorter hour, more impact, and more fun times, and making slightly less seems worth that. On top of enjoying your work, you have more free time to enjoy your life.

tl;dr Investment banks are not for people that want to actually enjoy their lives. If you're a programmer take advantage of those tech companies."

Hi,

I'm by no means an experienced programmer (I'm a rising senior in college), but I've done my share of CS courses and have some real-world experience. I love teaching, and have helped TA students in the first three intro courses at my school, and am more than happy to help anyone who is just starting out or otherwise feels like I could help them.

I'm familiar with Java, C, Python, some web dev (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a little bit of SQL, and Django), and some Android development.

I'm currently doing a pretty intense internship (and loving it), so on weekdays I don't have too much time other than an hour or two in the evenings (US Pacific time), but I'm quite free on weekends :) Happy to help via PM, email, or IM."

I have an older Xbox 360 console (it's either a xenon [no hdmi, 20 GB HDD, 16.5V, prong in middle of power input] or an opus [I sent it in after it got RRoD]) and was wondering if I should trade this console in and spend the difference on a new 250 GB slim model. I was hoping that it would brick with the new firmware update so that Microsoft would have to send me a new one, but I wasn't so lucky. There are some factors to consider here:

* I'm currently borrowing my friend's wireless internet adapter, which I will have to return in a couple of days. I will need one in the new house that I'm moving into and they cost ~ $50.

* I am currently unemployed for the summer and am on a college budget. I've interviewed for a paid internship position and should be hearing back this Monday. I do want to save a money because I am going abroad next semester.

* I'm not sure if a newer model will play or run any better. My console does run a bit slow and has some frame-rate issues from time to time, but I don't know if it's the console or the games themselves.

So, r/gaming, what do you think I should do? Would it be worth the money or should I just stick with what I've got? Thanks in advance!

i4o2k,13,2011-06-20,"Thank you r/fitness. (long post, sorry.)",iwillnotgetaddicted,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/i4o2k/thank_you_rfitness_long_post_sorry/,"Sorry, no before/after pictures; it's not a dramatic physical change anyway! That's not the point...

I started lifting about 3 months ago, on the SL 5x5 program. I was trying to look good for an event that was about a month away. r/Fitness wasn't especially supportive, but one member did point me to SL5x5. It sounded okay.

Here's the thing: I never go in the weight room. I've been in shape most of my life, from basketball, running, and hitting some of the equipment in the hallways at the rec center. But I've always been intimidated by ""guy"" guys-- frat guys, jocks, gym rats, etc. I don't know why-- I've always imagined them brimming with confidence, having meaningful social lives with deep connections to many friends (don't ask, I don't know why I had these notions), and above all, being hugely judgmental of everyone who wasn't in their group of friends. Meanwhile, I've always had a bit of a self-esteem issue.

Reading people's comments on r/fitness motivated me to get to the gym, but also showed me something else: for the first time, I got to see the other side of those gym rats. A lot of them are friggin' reddit nerds, for christ's sake. But also, a lot of them are nervous about being in the gym, and a lot of them think anyone who is judgmental is an idiot who doesn't belong there. 

Now when I go in, I still feel like there must be someone judging me, but when I think of that, I also know this: if that person made his views known, there would probably be 5 other people telling him to STFU. Mostly, I realize most everyone in there is just lifting, and they don't care what I'm doing.

For such a small thing, this has had a huge impact on my life in just a small amount of time. First, one small thing: I've become a better basketball player than ever before. It's not because I've gotten stronger, it's the mental shift. I'm not bad at bball, but my style of play has always been really timid. I never ask for the ball. If I get it, I can usually score inside, but I'm always afraid I'll screw up, and that's especially damning if I called for it in the first place, so instead I post up and think ""I'm open, don't pass it to me."" I never shoot outside, even though I have a good shot; if I miss, everyone will be mad at me for taking the shot.

Anyway, that small mental shift that r/fitness gave me has, in this short time, made a huge difference. I've been playing ball 2-3x a week for 3 years in the same gym, and never met anyone. In the past 2 weeks, I've become friends with a handful of regulars who now pick me up if I walk into the gym and they're getting a team together. That never happened before.

This also factors into other areas of my life. I have this problem where if I screw up in front of people, I feel like it's an incredibly overwhelming task to face them again. This has actually led to some huge problems in my studies-- I'm a veterinary student, and in clinics we have to work closely with classmates, interns, and residents. Last year, at one point I literally didn't show up one day to clinics because I didn't think I could face my classmates and their judging me. It's stupid, and I failed the rotation because of it.

Well, that too has changed. Not like, black/white, night/day change-- it's still a problem-- but the transformation that started on r/fitness and continues each time I hit the gym or the basketball court is allowing me to have a much greater amount of self-confidence in every area of my life. And if you weren't aware, self-confidence is hugely beneficial, well out of proportion to what I previously suspected.

Anyway, I feel silly crediting a forum about working out for such a drastic change in my life, but there it is-- I think a lot of my recent transformation has been thanks to you guys. So, thank you r/fitness for making my life better in a hundred big and small ways."

I'm 22 and she's 21. I decided to do an internship in a neighboring state for the summer at a camp. This camp is in the woods and I have no cell phone reception. I do have access to the internet, obviously, but this job is a lot of work and very long hours. I've been here about a month, so I'm starting to get the hang of it and have more free time.

My girlfriend was very supportive of me coming here. The first few weeks were really rough in terms of communication. She's been showing a lot of frustration about our lack of communication. It's starting to reach a boiling point with her, I can tell. She's sent me several lengthy facebook messages on the subject. I've assured her that I'm figuring it all out and we'll be able to talk more.

While I've been working today, I saw she was on facebook and started chatting. She is working too, tutoring at school over the summer, so it's been a pretty constant back and forth. I was talking like normal, making jokes and trying to just talk, like she wants. Suddenly she tells her it's making her more sad and continues to bring up how frustrated she is. I tell her I'm trying and that I'm happy to be talking to her and how much I miss her and she says she won't say anything because it will just sound rude. I tell her I have no idea what to do, so she says she's taking her lunch and just logs off.

Additional information:

* While we are just a state away, it's Phoenix to Northern California and it's a two day drive. Plus, I have no car with which to get anywhere. 

* She has told me in the past that words don't mean anything. I've said all I can say on the subject to her, and I know repeating it doesn't do anything for her.

* I wrote her a letter and mailed it today. I didn't tell her because I was hoping it would surprise her in a good way. Should I mention it?

* It's so easy to just lose track of time here, and I have so little time with the other interns that I can get wrapped up in wanting to spend time with them.

So, that's where I'm at. What do you think?"
i5ipx,4,2011-06-21,Running with a weak ankle?,jel12,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/i5ipx/running_with_a_weak_ankle/,"I'm trying to get back into shape after a long winter of very little free time and an internship where I was constantly at the computer.  I'm hoping to lose about 10 pounds in the process, but really I just want to feel active and healthy again.  I have always preferred running, but have had to deal with a weak ankle that was brought on by an injury from years ago.  I have worn an ankle brace while working out for a while now, even when I was on my high school track team, but for some reason it isn't providing much relief when I run anymore.  Now, I can run for about a half a mile before I have to stop because of my ankle.  I'll walk until it feels more comfortable, run again for a little less than a half mile, and then I have to stop again.

I don't think that it's anything I need to get checked out by a doctor, since it only happens when I run (not on a day-to-day basis, or even when I go for a walk or a hike).  I know that exercise like bicycling or swimming will not put strain on my ankle -- and I am prepared to do that instead if need be -- but I really do prefer running.

I don't know who to ask in real life.. So i hope you all can provide helpful insight.

I am 23. At 18 I began my degree at Wilfrid Laurier ( Waterloo,Ontario) for Global Studies..It was a great program and I am still passionate about that kind of stuff but I wasn't happy at all-- All my family live abroad, I'm the only one here and everyone I knew was in Toronto or GTA.. whatever the reasons may be.. I wasn't happy. So after 2 years I dropped out.

Part 2 of my scholastic life : After dropping out I returned back to the country where all my family live( caribbean) and had a good year. I researched a lot on post-secondary options and finally decided between Film and Media production at Humber or Public Relations at another college. I was set on Film and Media..and i applied.. got all the required documentation together, but needed 2 references from school. I got the first one no problem, and then was given the run around for months from one of my old favourite teachers..finally gave up and asked my old RA from Res in Uni ( cuz i was on House council and stuff) and he obliged. But then his res burnt down ( no lie) along with all his shit..needless to say.. my letter wasn't priority.

He didnt let me know til 3 weeks later. 
The day i found out, I realized the program had closed. Depressed, i looked into my second option. PR. I am a musician, and I am very into social justice/politics. and media in general, so i thought this was a great medium between all my interests.

It was a great but intense accelerated program( 3 years in 2). In my final year (2nd) first semester, after organizing a concert for my perspective internship (throwing a concert series, and working with WarChild ( my dream)) I got and email over christmas from my prospective placement boss saying ""Really sorry to hear that we wont be working together"". Frantic, I email my program coordinator, to which she replied "" Sorry, you failed magazine design, you no longer qualify for placement or second semester"".

After meeting with student liason I realized my options were to withdraw ( and pay back all my osap for the year somehow, and Rent with no money) or stay in school a  a semester and get a 2 year general arts diploma . I chose the latter option. I now have a 2 year general arts diploma.. I am unemployed..could not even get hired at Mcdonalds for the summer.. and now i am not sure what I should do in College/Uni as this diploma is useless.

I am worred about wasting more money, and I am worried about choosing something that I cant get a job.

My passions are music (EVERYTHING), Politics/Social Justice (close second) Film, 


I Know this whole message must be confusing...

so long story short. I am 40 grand in debt, have about 9 Uni credits, a year and half of PR credits, which i transferred and got a 2 year GENERAL ARTS DIPLOMA. 

Should also note, I would just say fuckitall and be a hippy and live with my sister in AUS and see what happens..but i have a Gf who i love very much, and she has a great job as a nurse, making good money so I wanna stay in Canada for now..

This year, I have really gotten into web design on my own and am still working a bit on my [first site](http://www.fifaencyclopedia.com) to make it as best as possible. I know it's not all that impressive, but I tried to make it as much of a learning experience as possible, meaning I tried and am trying to implement things I would like to use in the future.

From this, I have gotten quite good at what I would classify ""intermediate"" HTML and CSS. I'm going to start learning some PHP and possibly MySQL (would it be needed?) My next point of action would be to begin working on some more self-owned sites and do as much freelancing as possible, but I'm not so sure I'm experienced enough to do freelancing yet.

In my town, there is a small local web design business that is a popular choice for a lot of local businesses. Looking at their Facebook page, the working environment seems awesome. Mostly younger, less serious guys who still work hard it seems. They have an employees page, and it says a few of the guys worked as interns before being hired full time, but most of them are in or have graduated from college already. 

Meanwhile, I'm only 16 and will be nearly 17 by the time I would be applying (after soccer season as it would be impossible to work during that time). I posted a question to their formspring page (what I'd be like at the time of applying, hopefully):

**Say a 17 year old with some experience in web design (namely HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL) had a decent resume of self-owned sites and some freelancing work, would you consider hiring them as an intern despite age?**

*OF COURSE WE WOULD! The younger the better! We would hire an 8 year old if they knew php WELL and they could CLOSE PROJECTS OUT! Really though, don't be shy! Apply!*

Should I apply for summer work now even if I'm not that experienced yet? What do you think of all this? I really just want a nice environment to get good experience in web design and possibly even be hired somewhere down the line."

M:21 F:21, I'm the male.

We've been dating for 2 years and 4 months. Over that period of time, we've had our ups and downs and have gotten through them. Recently (Past few months) we've been arguing a lot. Sometimes she says that she isn't attracted to me anymore and wants me to build muscle on my upper body. I'm not fat or overweight at all, I'm a little on the skinny side but I'm not lanky and I find myself to be quite attractive.

This past semester, my grades weren't up to my parent's standards and since I borrow a car from them, my privileges to use the car have been taken away. My girlfriend finds the lack of independence to be very unattractive and she says she doesn't want to be dating a kid and can't respect me. Also she is two months older than me and always makes it seem like I am younger than her by a large margin. She diminishes me in front of my friends and her friends as well. She thinks I'm an idiot and have no common sense or logic, which is completely false. She does get better grades than me (she is one of the best in her class) but I still get pretty good grades, I just have a very strict family (not of asian descent) We decided to take a break until I buy my own car to be able to visit her or get my car privileges back and get my life in order. We still talk a lot and still say 'I love you' back and forth but we've been on the break awhile now and I'm just on the verge of getting my car back. I am also saving money from my internship right now to buy a car and get an apartment for the next year. 

Today, we had a misunderstanding and a fight emerged because of it. She thought I was going to call her to wake up but I was going to call her after she woke up so that I would keep her from going back to sleep. She has insomnia so when she sleeps well it is a big deal, and she didn't have work today so she could sleep in. She said she was going to wake up around 9:30 am, so I texted her at that time to say good morning and see if she was up. She didn't respond so I figured she was able to sleep well so I let her sleep instead of calling and waking her up. Lunch time rolls around and I decided to give her a call. She picks up and gets mad at me for not calling her, I asked her if the alarm went off and she said yes, and she got my text but didn't wake up, respond or call back whatsoever. She says continues to say how dumb I am and have no logic etc. etc. Usually she gets this way just because she is mad so I throw back the counter-arguments ""It was a misunderstanding"" etc. She then says that her friends see my lack of common sense and logic too but I think she points it out to them and amplifies the situation every time something goes wrong. I try to be a wonderful boyfriend, be understanding. I am very patient and have put up with her short fuse and frustration for a long time, but this has gone too far. She's made it clear that she doesn't respect me, and finds me unattractive. 

I know break-ups are tough for almost all situations but I'm not a very assertive person. I still love this girl very much but it needs to end before it goes too far. I can't be in a relationship with a girl who treats me like this. Any words of advice about breaking it off would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR my girlfriend doesn't respect me, and finds me unattractive after 2 and a half years relationship, but continues to string me along. Need help with the mental hurdles of breaking up with a girl who I am still very much in love with.

edit: This is way longer than I expected it to be, ask any questions about anything I may have left out and I will include them in replies and further edits."

**[I am a failed entrepreneur. A little guy who lost to the big corporate bullies of the free market. Ask Me Anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c9iq1/i_am_a_failed_entrepreneur_a_little_guy_who_lost/)**  
  

Many years ago I created, developed, perfected and marketed Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise -- the richest, creamiest, wiggliest mayonnaise in the south.   
  

I made the mayonnaise myself; the first experimental batch I made in the bathtub turned out chunky and too yellow.  After that (and following my wife's accident), I was forced to move my mayonnaise lab down to the basement.  It was trial and error for the first couple of months as I tried to find new and exciting ways to improve and invigorate mayonnaise.  But once I perfected it and got it just right it was beautiful.  So thick you could lay on it.  I knew I had created a mayonnaise that would go far beyond being a condiment for food.  The applications of Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise would be endless...
  
I bottled it in mason jars and sold it out of my home.  Once word of mouth about my mouthwatering mayonnaise spread all around town, I started selling it at the farmer's market.  Soon I had the grocers and druggists begging me to let them sell my mayonnaise.  That meant I had to make much more mayonnaise.  
  
During the summer months I recruited some strapping young interns from the schoolhouse.  I couldn't pay those young lads much (a dollar a day plus all the mayonnaise they could carry home in their pockets) but I was able to give them the one thing they wanted most: Sense of Accomplishment.  For me, it was more than just male bonding and mayonnaise in my sweltering hot basement.  That was probably the best summer of their lives.  
  

Soon I worked out a distribution deal with Piggly Wiggly supermarkets to test out Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise at half a dozen of their stores in Tennessee and Kentucky.  They were even going to let me slather advertisements all over their stores from the windows to the walls.  Unfortunately, the Big Boys of Mayonnaise -- Hellmann's, Blueplate, Duke's, Zippy's, Gold Medal and, of course, the behemoth of them all: Kraft and their vile Miracle Whip* -- ran me out of town.  
  

The big food companies pretty much dictate how much supermarket shelf space is made available for all products, not just their own.  Especially mayonnaise!  I got about six inches on the bottom shelf, barely enough space for a single jar-wide row, and close enough to the floor where the cleaning crew's floor scrubbers and waxers would dirty up my mayonnaise mason jars on a nightly basis.  
  
I never had a fighting chance.  I only sold a few cases and after just three months Piggly Wiggly sent me packing.  That was the beginning of the end.  The dark days of mayonnaise had come.   
  

I still make mayonnaise for my own consumption and for gifts (look out Secret Santa!) but I'm out of the mayonnaise selling business for good.  Too many bad mayonnaise memories.  
  
Those were the golden days of mayonnaise, long before mayonnaise culture was sullied by cheap gimmicks like light mayonnaise, vegenaise (who could love you?), and wide-mouth jars.  Back then it was about the mayonnaise.  
  
Ask me anything about my mayonnaise business or about mayonnaise in general.  I consider myself an expert on the subject.  I'll even share my mayonnaise inclusive recipes (like my triple fudge mayonnaise cake made with real mayonnaise!).  Mayonnaise has limitless uses beyond food.  Ask me about what mayonnaise can do for you.

**UPDATE:** I will be going to bed shortly.  It is way past my usual bedtime.  I normally would be getting up in a few hours.  I have gotten so much enjoyment answering all of your curiosities about mayonnaise.  Many of you are so eager to learn about mayonnaise!  I'll be back in the morning...  
  
________
**Make your own Wiggly Mayonnaise at home.**  
(Although it's not authentically Wiggly without Grandpa Wiggly!)  

  

**INGREDIENTS**  

* half a cup of peanut oil (or a favorite flavorful nut oil of your choosing)
* half a cup one cup of corn oil
* one tablespoon of sesame oil (optional)
* two egg yolks (one egg yolk for every half cup of oil)
* one tablespoon of honey Dijon mustard
* one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar (or half of both)
* one small squeeze of indigenous honey
* one garlic clove, crushed (optional)
* a pinch of salt
* a pinch of pepper
* a pinch of paprika (optional)
* a pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)
* a pinch of onion powder (optional)
* a pinch of tarragon (optional)  



  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
  
* All of your ingredients should be at room temperature before you begin.  I prefer right at 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit).  
* Add the eggs and half of the lemon juice and vinegar together in a bowl and lightly mix together.
* Slowly add your half of your oil mixture while whisking (not folding) everything together.  It will start to thicken nicely, forming mayonnaise.  
* Add the remaining half of your lemon juice and vinegar.  Whisk.
* Add the remaining half of your oil.  Whisk.  The more you whisk, the thicker your mayonnaise will be.
* Add the honey Dijon mustard, honey and lard.  Incorporate them into the mixture.
* Add the salt, pepper and other spices.  Whisk.  Whisk.  Whisk.
* You now have Mayonnaise in its simplest form!  Resist the urge to eat it.  Your mayonnaise will have more of a creamy light yellow color than store bought mayonnaise.  That's how you know its homemade mayonnaise!
* Refrigerate your mayonnaise for at least two hours, allowing it to cool completely.  If you're planning on bottling your mayonnaise in mason jars still allow it to cool first. 
* Once your mayonnaise has cooled you can enjoy your mayonnaise.  But save Grandpa Wiggly some!
  

Some mayonnaise recipes call for sugar, not Wiggly Mayonnaise.  I prefer to add a little sweetness to my mayonnaise using a sweet honey Dijon mustard and a dash of honey.  Always use indigenous honey!  You should buy local honey and only eat honey that is indigenous to your area and climate.  No sugar means a healthier mayonnaise!  
  
Olive oil, especially EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) will make your mayonnaise tangy and too heavy.  Eventually the weight of the olive oil will cause it to separate from the egg and that's not mayonnaise. If you truly desire the taste of olive oil in your mayonnaise then substitute it for one-fourth (but no more than a half) of your corn oil.  
  
For extra EXTRA thick mayonnaise: Freeze your eggs over night and then allow them to thaw.  Make sure they cool to room temperature before you begin to make your mayonnaise.  
  
For a thinner mayonnaise: Add in heavy whipping cream, half and half, or milk.  The more you add, the thinner your mayonnaise will be.
  
If you want your mayonnaise to be extra rich use only egg yolks.  
  
Mayonnaise with just white wine vinegar and no lemon juice will have a longer shelf life.  Ideal if you're making mayonnaise for the season or for holiday/birthday gifts.

i76cl,1,2011-06-23,Is he rebounding?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i76cl/is_he_rebounding/,"I'm curious as to whether my ex (21m) is rebounding or not. I have no intention of getting back together with him, nor do I have any qualms about whether us breaking up was the best thing or not. I'd just like to see your opinion on this. At the end of the day, it would be nice to hear, ""He is hurt and trying to get over you,"" rather than ""He chose this girl over you because she is better than you."" I know this isn't 100% rational, but I'm sure everyone that has been through a breakup knows what I'm talking about. Certain thoughts keep playing through your head and it's nice to have an arsenal of nicer thoughts to replace them with. [Here is my post where I go into some details about what happened.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i6eza/i_have_never_been_so_pissed_ever/) 

Some details that make me think it might be: 

* Before he broke up with me, he was very emotionally distraught for a week or so. He couldn't really sleep or eat. He was really upset.
* He has called this girl a ""butterface"" on numerous occasions.
* She pursued him at a bar and was very forward about asking him to go back to her room with her. She made it very clear that she was interested and would sleep with him.
* He asked her on a date on Monday, and they were ""in a relationship"" by Wednesday.
* We were together for 3 years, but he's in a new relationship within 3 weeks. He's been talking to her the whole time.
* She is here for the summer only, for an internship. They work together. We live in Ohio, whereas she is from Pennsylvania.
* We are about to enter our senior year in college.
* I was his first girlfriend.
* He seems to be going out of his way to try to upset me. Sending me an e-mail titled, ""You're going to be mad but..."" or refusing to return a book that he said he would. It seems like he's doing things to ""get even"" with me, even though he ended it."
i6tv2,4,2011-06-22,The July Effect: You are no more at risk going to the hospital in July than any other month. Except for this year.,DocIrish,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i6tv2/the_july_effect_you_are_no_more_at_risk_going_to/,"The TIL community has [a sensationalist post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/i6n8y/til_deaths_due_to_medical_mistakes_increase_by_10/) up regarding the JULY EFFECT *Bum da dum!* and how going to the hospital this upcoming month will kill you. 

Every year the popular press gives us this topic, and every few years the medical community will publish a paper refuting it or supporting parts of it. The article that the CNN piece refers to was published last year in May [(Full text here)](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.cdn.turner.com%2Fcnn%2F2010%2Fimages%2F07%2F08%2Ffulltext.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=David%20P.%20Phillips%20jgim&amp;ei=paICTpPLN6bRiAKRq_ijBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGoB-X3K2YWY4UiI4WLgWSSGo9wQ&amp;sig2=oYkSC4aUbmy64Oi10dw7IA&amp;cad=rja) and is worth taking with a grain of salt for a number of reasons:


* 
as in all papers, it emphasizes the positive findings and minimizes the negatives.  The pertinent negative in this study was that [overall deaths were exactly as predicted in July](http://i.imgur.com/KBjkw.png), and that medication errors in July were also 4% higher in non-teaching hospitals although this failed to reach significance. 

* while the lay press and redditors have claimed that this means you shouldn't get a surgery in July, despite no evidence of this sort in all but one paper, surgical morbidity and mortality is [actually](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717044) [equivalent](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474693) (and actually non-significantly lower in the JGIM article) for both trauma and elective surgery at teaching hospitals in July. The oft-cited piece in favor of a July Effect is this [Annals of Surgery paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1959349/?tool=pubmed) which states that there is a seasonal variation in surgical morbidity, with [\(peaks in July and January.\)](http://imgur.com/sxFUp)This was hugely controversial when it was presented in 2007, and many discussants were not included in the writeup. However, as pointed out in the discussion by Dr. Lillemoe of Johns Hopkins, Indiana, and now Mass General fame, there are multiple peak months on that plot, which happen to coincide with peak vacation times of attending physicians, rather than peak months for new residents.

* other researchers have examined this phenomenon and found that a potential explanation for observed outcome differences is that [handoffs](http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/11/895.extract) increase in July (August in the article), due to the aforementioned vacations and new interns, leading to cross-coverage issues (taking care of a patient you are not familiar with for a partner). 

Now assuming for a moment that increasing handoffs/changeovers increases mortality (far more substantiated than the new intern July effect): Starting July 1, new work hour restrictions for interns present a double-edged sword for these issues. 

Interns can no longer be on call. They can only be in the hospital 16 hours at a time, and must have senior housestaff available in the hospital at all times. This is great for the supervision aspect of things. 

However, because they can only work 16 hours at a time, we now need 2 interns to cover a 30 hour call shift, whereas before this could be achieved with one. This doubles the number of changeovers in most cases, and can actually quadruple them depending on the services covered and the hospital. It reduces the amount of time a given physician gets to know a patient's status, and increases the number of times some bit of information about that patient's status can be lost in transmission.

So, in conclusion, to be safe in the hospital, get to know your surgeon if you're going for a planned operation, ask questions about your care and be a proactive patient if you can, but otherwise, try to ease your mind that while you are in a teaching hospital you will be receiving excellent care that is double checked by multiple layers of physicians (intern, resident, attending) and nurses who are watching our butts.


**tl;dr** Doctors suck and are actually trying to kill you.

i7nyh,8,2011-06-23,"Ladies, please help me interpret this (Warning: I hope you like reading), it's pretty perplexing.",throawayperson,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/i7nyh/ladies_please_help_me_interpret_this_warning_i/,"I'm sorry I can't make this shorter, ladies, but it would really be great if you could help me out. Before I start - this is out of sheer curiosity, I am not pursuing a relationship with the girl (anymore). I'd love to get some insight on this though, even though I’m aware no two people think exactly alike.

I met a nice girl at an internship of sorts, we are both college students. I was happy to find that she was a very pleasant person. It looked like she enjoyed talking to me, we really clicked. The strange part was that she is much more attractive as a woman than I am as a man IMO (but just like anyone, I can't realistically rate my appearance).
She did mention she had a boyfriend, but I invited her to the cinema despite that since I really enjoyed her company, she was a very fun person.
The next day my internship ended and I was going to the seaside. I sent her a short text saying good luck with the rest of her internship and that I enjoyed the movie. To my surprise, she immediately replied with a text, saying she enjoyed herself too, but as she had a boyfriend, she would like to stay just friends (a bit strange, I didn’t remember making any moves). 
But of course, that was logical, and I thought nothing of it, I wasn't really desperate anyway.

Fast forward two months, I invite her for coffee. I realized afterwards that she was now single (FB is weird isn't it) and proceeded to invite her two more times to the cinema. She wasn't making any suggestions, and as i was swamped with studying I couldn't find the energy to man up and tell her I am growing to like her a lot.

Then suddenly in February she invites me to her birthday. This was completely unexpected. I went clubbing with her and her best friend. Again, nothing from me or her. I decided she wasn't interested in me. As I had nothing to lose though, I invited her a month later for coffee. I told her I've fallen in love with her. She replies by saying that I am more than a friend to her and that my chances with her aren't bad at all, but that she cannot guarantee anything (or something in this manner, you can imagine I was pretty nervous). I said it was OK with, me, I won't be offended if we just stay friends. 

After I got home she sent me a text repeating that my chances with her aren’t bad because she values me as a person - that maybe we should hang out a bit more often and ‘see what happens’.

We meet two days later. I act as usual, as I didn’t want to push it. We drank some drinks, walked through town and talked. The usual. We part before shortly before midnight. I send her two texts, one before I go to sleep, and the next one in the morning, mostly talking about when we should meet next. Yes, the second text contained pretty much the same content. I was curious because she didn’t reply to the first one.

Now for the kicker;
The next day, out of the blue, she sends me a text saying she is actually still feeling love for an ex, even though she knows he was a bad person. She says she feels I am more like a brother to her. I am supposed to be her ideal, and her mind says yes, but her heart belongs to the ex (I am aware of how strange this sounds) - the obligatory it’s not you, it’s me comment was included.. I was a bit disappointed with that, obviously, but said I understand.
I didn’t really contact her for the next two months, I was afraid my response would be too emotional.

This week, I see her at the university and we chat for a while. I can’t deny it was fun to talk to her again, she is an interesting person, but as I crossed an emotional line, I decided not to contact her after that. 

Today, she sends me a text saying it was really fun to talk to me on Monday. She would like us to do it more often (if that’s OK with me).

And now you see why I am confused. Did I do something wrong? Is she trying to get something from me? Was she ever actually attracted to me (there are easier ways to get free drinks than to talk to a guy for three hours, mind you)? I know you probably don’t have enough data, but it would be cool if some of you ladies could at least point me in the right direction, by my actions you can probably see that I'm not very good with this. 

Feel free to ask for more info on anything.

Thanks!"

Here's the deal:

* Goal: Create a database of all case records (client list, about 2,000 records) by adding invoice data to each record.

* Current data: (1) MS Excel file of all clients, with basic contact and budget code data. (2) Physical file folders for each client, containing the invoices that need to be added to the electronic client records.

* My boss wants a database for all of the records that can be accessed, viewed, analyzed, and updated either (1) via the web (128 bit SSL encryption, password-protected); or, (2) via a shared network drive. I have no idea why we would need it accessible via the web, but he wants proposals for both options.

* I have a team of 5 summer interns who will have the job of updating all the records in the database. They are minimally skilled and minimally-trained, so the database will need to be extremely idiot-proof, so they cannot enter errant values in the record fields they update. There are about 75-100 individual fields that to be added to each record (or less, depending on how many invoices are associated with each record).

* I will have the job of using the updated record data to generate reports and to generate individual case data sheets for auditors.

The web-based database and web-form sites seem good in terms of ease of use and security, but none seem to allow a user to import existing data and then use web forms to update the imported records. 

The options I have come up with so far are: (1) create an MS Access database that the interns can access and update via the shared network drive; (2) Create a set of online web forms (e.g., Wufoo.com) for the interns to plug in the new data, then export it to an Excel sheet to use to update the existing spreadsheet; (3) Contract someone to build a custom web client that can be used by the interns to update the records.

I have a deadline of only a few days to figure out the best solution, and only a week or so to get it up and running. What do you think is the best way to go? Are there better solutions?"

I'm positive I'll be hired, but one thing scared me:

I am young and inexperienced for the most part, but they were impressed enough with the single site I've been updating for months since I got into web design/dev that they decided to hire me on as an intern as more of a learning experience.

While that site looks relatively nice and modern after a big redesign two months ago, I have a bit of trouble coding websites that don't look ""like Windows '95"". I've been practicing a bit so I can get used to the fundamentals of creating a modern site from scratch in one shot, but it's pretty tough.

What sort of advice can you give me that will aid me in this? Or could you recommend a book in particular? I want to design sites that impress them and clients - that opens up the door for being hired as a paid worker. I have no problem with working hard, but I just need to get the hang of producing modern looking, ""pretty"" sites.

Redditor Advantage: I think that some of these companies just throw resumes in a pile and pick at random. If you're an employee at the company, you could quite possibly help out redditors by 'referring' them as friends.  This isn't nepotism, companies do referrals all the time, and often give current employees bonuses for hired referrals.  I think many consider other redditors their friends, so this is A-OK.  Besides, don't other forums do this?

i9qz7,6,2011-06-26,I love him but the feeling of betrayal lingers,sounan,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i9qz7/i_love_him_but_the_feeling_of_betrayal_lingers/,"I've never gotten into a relationship with anyone until last October. I met him at a Reddit meetup and he was really into me. I was extremely excited that after so long, someone actually likes me back so I began to date him. Everything was lovely and felt like a dream come true. He is funny, intelligent but not so clever at times. He would introduce me to books, movies, tv series and so on. My interest on him grew more and more.

After the next few months, I've started to feel like I'm having a crush on him. This sounds very strange. It's the same old feeling I had all these years when I failed at getting a response from guys I like and I was afraid to call him, to talk to him all day because I want to be the perfect girlfriend. That problem was fixed after my best friend urged me to express my feelings. He said it's fine, don't worry and I am amazing as I am. 

Between we started dating and now, different events happened that made me worse than I felt before.  It started with a phone call. He told me he hasn't talked to a good friend for a while so he's going to do that. The person called first and I noticed the particular ringtone for the friend. It's a friend, just let him talk, I mean, I'll do that if it's an old friend I haven't talked to a long time. After hours, he came back with a pissed off face. I didn't want to bother him or cause him trouble so I didn't say anything, but he finally told me that he was talking to his ex and she already has a new boyfriend. He can't believe that she moved on so soon. Inside I felt extremely hurt, even though I wouldn't understand how a person feels about their ex, but the feeling that he is doing the exact thing he's angry about and disregarding me is really hurtful. I didn't do anything about that time.

My curiosity got the best of me after that and was bored one day to go on his facebook profile to understand bits and pieces of his past. I understand it's a stalker-ish thing to do, so I did not tell him about this. I got the name of the ex that he was talking about earlier and I also got the reason why they broke up. She is still in college and lives a couple of states away from he is so it was a hassle to get to her. One day he drove to visit her but because of terrible weather he has gotten himself into an accident thus, ending the relationship because of the distance. 

After that I tried to put it behind my head and continue my days. My love for him grew bigger and bigger and I wouldn't even have such feelings on other men. He has his flaws but he is well-rounded and is a kind of person that I would love to be with for a very very long time. I have classes during weekdays and everyday, I'm always looking forward to Friday the most because that's the day I visit him and stay with him for the weekend. I love the lazy days we spend lying on the couch relaxing and I also love the days when we go out and do fun activities or walk around the park. 

There were a couple of times we went to meetups at the bar and I get drunk. I would tell him how much I love him and I would sometimes accidentally tell him that in my mother tongue. He would always tell me, he ""likes"" me, he likes me a lot. It kind of bothered me at times. He would explain that he says ""love"" only when he means it and the only woman he ever loved was someone he dated for 3 years. When he explains it like that it saddened me and I would rather he not say anything at all. Sometimes if I were very drunk, I would cry when he says that and he would quiet me down by saying he loves me too. 

These were the build-ups for me, but what triggered me were two events. They might sounds minor and silly to consider as a big deal, but it's always on my mind. The first when we were shopping for furniture and he was calling me from afar but he called me by his ex's name. At that time, he didn't know that I know who his ex was yet. The second time was when I was on the meetup group page and I was just skimming through to see which ones I should go. I noticed in the newsfeed that there was a familiar name. It was her. In her introduction, she says that she will visit where we are during the summer for her internship. This alerted me so much I became worried and cried often. My best friend urged me again to confront my boyfriend if I wanted to solve this problem. After being timid and nervous for days, I finally did when we went to a bar again. 

I chose that day because I noticed if I get tipsy enough, I would be able to speak my mind and not be afraid. We went to get pizza as an intermission during the meetup and I finally told him. I told him all my worries and the two things that triggered me. The downside to my courage juice is that it also makes me cry easier. I felt scared again when I started tearing up while telling him because my dad told me that women shouldn't cry and crying would show her weaknesses and how vulnerable she is. He was very surprised how I know his ex's name. He then started telling me he can't help it and how much he still loves her. He says that if he needed to choose between her and me, he would choose both, how they promised they will be together 3 years later when she graduates if they're both single. I can't remember what happened next because I was crying too hard. 

It was fine for another few months until summer, I am now on my summer vacation and I got an internship. My best friend/roommate is leaving the country until August so I'll be all alone. I thought staying with my boyfriend would be nice because it would be more convenient for me to go to my internship office and no more loneliness. Fast forward to recent weeks, he went out twice for dinner with a ""friend"" the second time, the night before his ex called him thus I suspect it was probably dinner with her. I didn't say anything until one weekend when he was writing his retirement plans documents and under the benefactor or something (sorry, I don't really understand it) he fills in his ex's name and stuff. I became depressed all over again. He talked on the phone with her for a very long time until I went into the room with finished laundries. He noticed I was crying and I told him why. He kept on apologizing, how much he doesn't deserve me, how terrible he was and how pathetic he is that he can't cut off ties with his ex. I didn't say much. He says he was overwhelmed when I moved in for summer and so on. I understand my problem. I asked him if his ex, who has a boyfriend, feels the same way about him, he says he doesn't know.

The next few days was awkward. We went to another bar meetup and I got a bit tipsy again. I told him I was hungry and didn't eat all day, so we both left to get food. Along the way, he brought up our problem again. He starts to admit, he said, he can't see me being with him in the future married with kids. I started bawling on the streets. I asked him if he could see that with his ex. He says he can. I was very angry because seeing such things in the future just means he's dwelling in the past. He's unfairly comparing me, that he dated for 6 months to a person whom he dated for 3 years. It really hurts me a lot.  I cried so hard I couldn't stand straight. I told him I've lost all appetite and might vomit so we went back to his place. He complains that he wants to be married, have kids, and so on, but the problem is I've never discussed with him about my view on these! How would he know I'm not a children person?! How would he know I don't want to get married some day?! I calmed down a bit and he comforts me by telling me how amazing I am, what a good life I have and all the nonsense I hate hearing that doesn't solve our problem. He then told me another of our problem is that we have nothing in common. For 6 months, nothing in common? What an excuse, such bullshit.

In the end, after all the advice I got from my dad and my best friend, I still wanted to be with him. I asked him if he would give me a shot to let me change his mind and his ""future"" that he sees. He didn't refuse it but he became even more distant and cold to me each day. I am too stubborn and blinded by love that I am not going to break up with him. Sorry this was so long, but I thought writing in my blog where no one reads wouldn't help me and redditors would give me some good advice, or just inspiring comments to boost my confidence. (Sorry in advance if wording or grammar is strange, English is my second language)

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend still can't get his ex out of his head. Can't see me with him in the future married to him with kids. He is an ass and I'm an idiot that is too stubborn and love him too much to break up with him. "
i9pm6,10,2011-06-26,Where do I go from here?,linksyswrt54g,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i9pm6/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I'm 24, she's 22.  We've been dating for almost three years now.  We started dating when we were both in college, I'd been having a dry spell and I met her through some friends.  We hit it off.  She is beautiful, charming, intelligent, and funny.  

We continued to date after I graduated and moved about an hour away to get a job.  She did a semester abroad and we ""broke things off"" despite Skyping almost every day, and I went to visit her.  This seemed to rekindle things, as I was in love with this girl.  She came back from Europe and we continued to date, with lots of travel and a few rough patches.

She graduated the following spring, and moved about 4 hours away from me for an internship, having no luck finding a job.  The stress of her commute and financial situation took its toll on us, and I couldn't take it any more.  Every phone conversation started with, ""Oh my God.. this day is terrible.. you wouldn't believe what happened to me..""  I tried to be compassionate and helpful, but I really ran out of steam.  I told her that I couldn't handle my stress and her stress anymore, and that I didn't want to be together anymore. We didn't speak to eachother for a few months.

She got a better paying internship and was able to move closer to it, eliminating her commute.  We got to talking over the holidays and I apologized and we wound up going on a trip together.  Everything was great, and it was like nothing had happened.  She was in the process of getting a new apartment and internship and seemed like everything was pointing in the right direction.  Conversations were cheerful and bright, and the future looked good again.

She finally got an interview for a full time job, but this time on the other side of the country.  She's now a 5 hour flight from me.  She's disenchanted with the job, her apartment, her lack of friends, and her lack of anything to ""do"" in the evenings (she's never really been one to have any hobbies).  Our phone calls have returned to her rattling off a list of things that are going terrible in her life (no friends, overweight, hate my job, etc).

I'm across the country, and this is bogging me down.  Am I a jerk?  I try to help her out by being constructive and trying to help her find things to do.  She enjoys swimming, so I suggested that (no way!  too much money for suit/goggles/gym membership), okay what about a bike club (do you know how expensive bikes are?!).

I really don't know how to handle this anymore.  I'm flying out to visit her in a week, but she tells me she ""isn't excited to see me"" because she's so down in the dumps.

I know there are a lot of ins and outs with this story, and I'll gladly fill in details where necessary.  I feel like I used to love this girl, but between distance and her inability to cope with things on her own I'm growing increasingly stressed.

TL;DR:  I've dated a girl for a long time and she's now living really far away from me.  She's unhappy about her new job/lack of friends/general low self esteem.  What do I do?  It's dragging down my life and with the situation as it is, I don't intend to move to her, or vice versa."

The current owner lives there year-round and 3 of us interns are living with him this summer. Granted, we're leaving in about a month or so, but I can't stand going to that bathroom any longer.

One of the roommates and I already tried cleaning the floor with some solution and a mop, but that barely worked. There's like piss stains along the edge of the floor with hair and it's GODDAM IMPOSSIBLE to remove.

I heard vinegar and baking powder were a good solution combo?!?!? I don't even know what type of flooring it is, maybe laminated flooring? 

I don't even know where the black stripes are from...

Please help. There's sticky spots, piss stains, possibly 30+ year old hair on the floor...

ic91z,1,2011-06-29,Iama person thats always had it rough. ,deandraleigh8110,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ic91z/iama_person_thats_always_had_it_rough/,"I've seen a few posts about welfare lately and thought I'd mention my own story. 

I grew up on the edge of an incredibly small town, in PA.Country girl all my life. My real mother left for another guy, when I was 3, and had my sister. I grew up Daddy's girl/right hand man, I went with him everywhere, i worked side by side with him in the garage, went hunting, fishing, I was an all out little tomboy. Dads parents helped out a lot along with my dads Pap. Gram was and always will be the person I see as a mother figure. And I adored my great grandfather. Though I didn't know him long and have few memories they are some of the sweetest. 

All of this sounds alright so far.

It was also around the age of three I was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrome (WPWS). Over the years I had doctors visits, heart monitors, medicine. But It was manageable. The worst part was the sticky things for the monitor. It always tore at my skin and had to try and take them off after getting them wet in the bath. My gram used to put them on these 3 identical dolls that i had to help me. I would pretend to take care of them like she took care of me. (the only ones i've never been scared of) To this day I have Pediophobia which is a fear of dolls.

Dad remarried when I was 5. The always dreaded stepmother. This woman despised me. Intern I came to despise her. She was a spoiled woman who had always had everything handed to her and never had to do a thing for herself. What my dad saw and still sees in her I will never know. I still went with my dad everywhere, I didn't want to be around the nasty woman. But everyone now and then I couldn't go with dad. He had changed jobs in the last few years because the place he had been working at went out of business. So he had work and meetings and places he had to be from time to time. Before I would of always been with Gram but now ""she"" was here. She treated me like scum. Wouldn't let me out of my room. I would sneak out for snacks praying she wouldn't catch me. If she did I got drug back to my room by my hair. She also was in charge of bathing me. I couldn't stand it. She made fun of me. Pushed me around, also mostly by my hair. I also had and still do have natural curly hair which knots easily. She would purposely yang a comb through my hair and yell at me when it broke. I would be so angry but could do nothing. All I could ever do was cry. To this day half the time I become Angry i feel helpless and start to cry. Its like a defense mechanism I haven't been able to shake. 

I tried to tell my dad about this, but whey ""she"" was around him she acted all innocent and all my dad could think was that I was being a bratty kid and he listened to the ""adult"". 

It was't for a few years and a few times that he caught her that he finally learned I had been telling the truth. Though he still seemed to think that I always provoked her. I shouldn't been speaking to her that way or I should of done exactly what I was told. There was always some reason. But I could see that it was tearing my father apart trying to choose between his daughter and his wife. 

Then when I was 8 years old my brother was born. Yes he is technically my half-brother but I will never see him that way. I love him almost like a son. As stated before ""she"" didn't know how to do anything. So at 8yrs old, i'm the one thats up all night feeding him, changing him, burping him and holding him. While dad was there he loved doing it all and did most of the time because he thought he was ""relieving"" ""her"" for a few moments since ""she"" works so hard any other time. My dad was usually was home at nights but is a very heavy sleeper. Half the time you try to wake him you scare the both of you. HA!

I do remember the details of it though: as I said already it's a 2 year university, you intern with a big company in the last few quarters and work on programs that will be put to use.

Keeping and reducing the HST to 11% or 10% appears to be sound public policy. As an economics major, I can appreciate the comparative simplicity of the HST and the need for the province to increase their tax revenue to meet an aging and increasing population.

However, I feel very strongly that the BC Liberals need to be held accountable for their backroom dealing and the disgusting manner in which they forced through the HST. I don't want them to feel like this was AT ALL acceptable and expect that they can do this in unpopular legislation in the future.

I'm sure someone will say, ""Don't let your feelings about the Liberals distract from good public policy, there are other ways to hold them accountable."" I really doubt this. What would I do, write them an angry letter for some intern to toss in the recycling bin? Hold a rally that no one will pay attention to because the HST debate is ""over""? It seems like the only message the Liberals might actually listen to would be a majority vote to abolish the HST... but I think the HST is actually good policy in itself.

Any thoughts? Do you know how you'll be voting on the HST ballot?"

id02v,37,2011-06-30,"Here's the letter I wrote to my Congressman, if you're interested.",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/id02v/heres_the_letter_i_wrote_to_my_congressman_if/,"Rep. McCaul,

I'm writing tonight to urge you to consider your position with regards to the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011 (HR2306). Although I understand that it is extremely difficult, nigh impossible, to change someone's opinion on an issue, especially an opinion that has been entrenched and fomented over the course of an entire lifetime, I still feel obliged, as one of your constituents, to make my opinion known. 

My name is [Anonymous]. I turned 18 years old this year, and have been living in Austin my entire life. I love this city, and I plan to stay here to attend UT Austin this Fall in order to study engineering. I graduated in the top 10% of my class, scored a 2100 on the SAT, scored in the top 98% NMSQT/PSAT and graduated with honors. I tell you these things with the hope that you, or the intern that is likely reading this, will not disregard my opinion as one of a slacker, a doper, or whatever other ad-hom typically applied to anti-prohibitionists.

Our country is in a dangerous position. Today, Rep. Paul described the state of our nation in a way that both awakened and terrified me: Although our country contributes only 5% of the total population of our planet, we house 25% of its prisoners. This is not because Americans are especially violent, or lurid, or immoral, but because of the racist policies implemented in our country decades ago that we deceptively refer to as the War on Drugs. I say deceptively because, to date, the ""War on Drugs"" has only served to increase, not abate, national drug use. 

Henry J. Anslinger, engineer of the policies which shaped the War on Drugs, testified before Congress, saying, ""There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others."" If you believe that you are intelligent and informed enough to ignore my argument, you must also be intelligent enough to realize that the claims which founded marijuana prohibition are patently racist and, ergo, morally illegitimate. 

Furthermore, I have read that many of your fellow Republican Congressmen have argued that marijuana has a known substitute, called Marinol, which is a concentrated form of THC. Marijuana, on the other hand, is comprised of a complicated mix of multiple forms of THC and chemicals called cannabinoids, which interact with different receptors based on their structure. Many people have reported that Marinol makes them feel worse than the symptoms it claims to ease, and it is easy to see why after watching this video: http://youtu.be/8J7cZf2tFCQ You can see that any solution composed of pure THC is an improper replacement for the delicate mix of THC and cannabinoids found in marijuana. 

Furthermore, you should also be aware of the numerous social benefits of ending marijuana prohibition. Our police are stretched thin, made to enforce laws which have proven to be neither productive nor just, save for lining the pockets of the municipal court racket and the private prison industry. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would bring desperately needed funds to your constituency, free police forces to pursue real safety hazards and real violent crime, including drug-related violent crime. Let me repeat: legalizing marijuana does not mean legalizing drug-related violent crime. 

Finally, I also wish to address the argument that marijuana is a gateway drug. Marijuana is only considered a gateway drug because it is sold by drug dealers, who, in addition to selling marijuana, also tend to carry other wares: psilocybin mushrooms, powder cocaine, Xanax, ecstasy, et al. Legalizing marijuana would remove from these drug dealers a customer base and regulating marijuana would ensure that the chemicals which have historically been sprayed on marijuana by drug dealers, such as glass and green paint, would not make their way into the market again. If anything is a good example of this fact, of the benefits of regulation, it is the flesh-eating cocaine (sprayed with levamisole) that is currently wandering our country. 

Consider these facts, weigh them carefully in your mind, and decide what is right for the voters (and the Constitution) that you serve. Occasionally I find myself asking, ""Are politicians human beings? Do they worry, the way I do? Do they sense their mortality, the way I do? Do they have trouble falling asleep, the way I do? Are they depressed, hopeful, ambitious, perceptive, fearful - the way I am?""

Well, Congressman, are you? Prove me wrong.
