Im stuck in the 'chicken and the egg' problem. Every employer picks someone with more experience, even for internships.    
I have sent emails to almost every company in the south of UK, gone to many interviews (every time they went brilliantly). I have gotten alot of feedback on my portfolio, lots of advice, lots of compliments, I have been told that I have a very strong portfolio, but it doesn't seem to matter at all if someone else has 1 year of experience.    
They dont seem to care that I already have 3 years freelance experience (with excellent references!).    
**Anyone have any ideas?** What can I do? Iv basically got till the beginning of August before things get seriously desperate.    

&amp;nbsp;

This is what I have so far (if this helps):    
**Experience:**    
BA(Hons) Degree in 3D Design - Product Design 2:1,    
2.5 years of full time engineering manufacturing work,    
3 years of freelance product design,    
(both with excellent references),    

&amp;nbsp;

**Software:**    
Many years of professional experience with Solidworks, Keyshot, Adobe CC, Autodesk (Inventor, AutoCAD, Mudbox, Meshmixer, Fusion 360),    
Various other 3D printing related tools (I have a printer at home, in constant use), Meshlab, Eisenscript,    
MS Office, also a deep knowledge of computer systems and I.T,    

&amp;nbsp;

**Other Tangible skills:**    
A deep knowledge of manufacturing and engineering through experienced based learning, with knowledge of CNC, injection moulding, 3D printing, laser cutting and various other things    
A wide knowledge of other useful aspects; technology, computing, programming etc. through hobbies and freelance work,    
Highly creative and wise, and able to consistently think outside of the box,    
I have worked with 3D printers throughout my professional life, but also have my own printer at home which is in constant use,    
I am a British resident etc. I also have a drivers licence with no points,    
Lots of other stuff in my portfolio

6kk2mc,17,2017-06-30,my Orientation thoughts and Advice (Full-day Transfer Session),RevolutionZeal,SFSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFSU/comments/6kk2mc/my_orientation_thoughts_and_advice_fullday/,"There has been a lot of confusion on what Full-Day and Half-Day orientations are. For Freshman Students (coming from High School), all orientations will be Full-Day. For Transfer Students (coming from another university/college), you have the option to choose between Half-Day or Full-Day. Here is a link to more info on that: https://newstudentprograms.sfsu.edu/content/orientation-spring-2017

**Things you should bring:**

- Unofficial Transcript (If the enrollment system falsely thinks you don't meet the prerequisites of a class, you're going to need this for proof. Show it to the Advisers that help you during registration)

- Smartphone with Gator App (This has the actual schedule of the orientation. Even has GPS of where you need to go. Here’s a link to the App: https://guidebook.com/app/sfstate/guide/firstyeargators/)

- Immunization Records if you have a hold (For the most part, if you don’t have a hold specifically about this, you probably won’t need it. Don’t take my word for this though. You’d probably want to contact SFSU staff directly via email)

*NOTE: For the “Schedule” Section of this post, the info is based on a Full-Day Transfer Session experience. If you want a viewpoint from a Half-Day Transfer Session, read this https://www.reddit.com/r/SFSU/comments/6hq3q1/sfsu_transfer_orientation_2017_pros_conss/*


**Schedule:**

- 8:00AM – 9:00AM. Go to Caesar Chavez building. It won't open up until 8:00AM. Try to show up early. If you show up early enough, you will be able to get your Photo ID taken. They will tell you the cards will be ready by 1:30... but it was already for pick-up by 12:30.

- 9:30AM – 11:30AM. There is about a five-minute walk to the North-west section of the campus. Try to be there by 9:30AM. This is where you will listen to a welcome speech by the Vice-dean, and info on graduation requirements by an Academic Adviser. This will last up to 11:30AM

- 11:30AM – 5PM. The schedule order changes depending on which group you are. There are two groups: Group A and Group B. Group A goes to Lunch at 11:30AM and Registration Advising on 12:45PM, while Group B goes to Lunch at 12:30PM and Registration Advising on 2:30PM. First half of the Advising is a presentation, the second half is registering for classes. If you want to leave as soon as possible, you should hope you are Group A. If you are genuinely interested in workshops available (such as finances, campus recreation, Student Clubs, Studying Abroad), then you shouldn’t have a problem either way.


**More details about the events in the Schedule:**

- You can register for classes as soon as 8:00AM via smartphone during your scheduled orientation date if you know what you are doing. However, if you are not sure on what classes you should be taking, then you should probably wait for the advising.

- The Welcome Speech is half filler and half info on the Gator App. You will first watch a video, but you don’t really need to pay attention to that part. Heck, I already forgot what it was about. As for the Gator App Info, most of you probably already know the important aspects of the App already, so the presentation will be boring for you. However, for those of you who don't, this is probably useful to you.

- The speech by the Academic Advisers is where you can start actually paying attention. They will give you information on General Education Classes for Transfers, where to go for Advising, how to navigate the SFSU website, what exactly is transferred from your previous university/college, etc.

- For Academic Advising, this is when you should be giving absolute full attention. You will split up into groups based on your College (Business, Engineering, Arts, etc). This is also a presentation. They will go over all the classes you need for you Lower Division and Upper Division, the classes that are prerequisites for other classes, which classes from your previous university are counted towards your degree, information about what effects the Associate Degree for Transfer has on your Graduation Progress if you have one, Internship opportunities, who to contact for counseling, and other things. Oh, and of course, they teach you how to find and register the classes you need on SFSU Gateway

- For Workshops/Information Booths, there are a lot of them throughout the orientation. Refer to the Gator App on what is available. I didn’t go to any of them since I was Group A. If I was on Group B, I would probably check out “Finances and You!” and “Student Clubs, Organizations, and Greek Like”. But it’s all about your personal preference.

- There's a ""free"" lunch ticket (probably paid for by the $35 orientation fee). Basically, you have many choices and you don't have to use it at the orientation date. During the orientation, you will have the opportunity to eat lunch before Registration Advising.



**Short Version:**
Go to Caesar Chavez Building by 8AM to get info packet. Take photo for student ID (optional). Pick up at same place you got packet. Watch presentations about the University, Gator App, and Graduation Requirements. Do stuff like eat lunch until it’s your time for Registration Advising. Pay extra attention to Registration Advisement Presentation. Register for classes. Congrats you're done."
6kl1dr,4,2017-07-01,Plumbing work as a engineer/engineering student?,TractorHead346,Plumbing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/6kl1dr/plumbing_work_as_a_engineerengineering_student/,"So here's my story,

Am currently studying to get a BS in mechanical engineering, I have a 2 year associates of engineering. Currently working as a intern but am done at 4 in a town of ~50k and would like to earn some extra cash. I deal with plumbers/HVAC/electrical all the time at work and they have trouble getting people to stick around for more then a couple months. 

My experience in plumbing is I have done a lot of design/layout for a commercial plant in Autocad and have also spend a quite a bit of time doing plumbing at the last company I intered at (running likes, unclogging pumps and pipes, fixing leaking pipes and drains, swapped many facets,  etc).

I was wondering if there is a way I can break into the market and do basic plumbing work such as replacing facets and clearing drains. The industrial guys I deal with at work all say they barely have time to focus on industrial stuff and don't have time to deal with small residential jobs. 

Does having a 2 year degree help me at all in getting licensed as a plumber? Can I do any type of plumbing work at all without a license or at least without being a journeyman? I understand the basics very well but by no means could I plumb an entire house. 

I have talked to our guys at work and they only would want to hire me if I could work regular hours but that isn't really an option which is why I thought about going into it myself. 

Please give me any thoughts you may have and straight up tell me if its just a stupid idea. 

Thank you!"

**Random Thoughts**

- I loved George being Cristina and Meredith being Izzie in the elevator.
- I had forgotten that Bailey didn’t want Izzie back as her intern. 
- Nancy’s a little catty. Correction: Nancy’s a LOT catty.
- I can understand Burke’s frustration. Cristina is pushing too much on him too fast.
- I feel bad for twins dad. I know they were broken up but it still must really stink. It takes me months to move on after a serious relationship so I can understand why he was hurt to learn that she’d move on so quickly.
- Conceited much, Meredith? You can’t even listen to your friend’s observations about a patient. Glad she eventually changed her tune. Also, I liked how supportive she was of Cristina at the end of the episode.
- New lunch hang out. I like!
- What I also like? The song that was playing during that scene. [Young Folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIRE6iw-ws4)
- Sorry not sorry but I don’t feel bad for Meredith. She was trying to have her cake and eat it too with Finn and Derek. If she truly wanted a relationship with Derek, she shouldn’t have been playing games.
- This Cristina/Burke story line is getting so convoluted and tired. It started off with Cristina telling Burke she’d help him and keep it a secret. Then, she was getting all these cool surgeries and was happy about it. Now, it’s taking its toll on her. She just needs to tell Burke how she feels. It’s so frustrating watching them not communicate.









**Quotes**

- “Who does she think she is? Bailey?”
- “Oh uh, McDreamy was doing the McNasty with McHottie? That McBastard.”
- “Meredith is the boss of me.”
- “McDreamy’s sister is McBitchy…”
- “So two uteruses. That's pretty cool. And you're engaged...also cool.”
- “I called Callie a pig.”
- “Everything is not about you Meredith.”



**Questions**

- Which doctor do you think has the best bedside manner?
- How ready are you for this Cristina and Burke story line to be over?

6km5hb,0,2017-07-01,Spoilers Entire SM:H plot is online - READ ON YOUR OWN RISK,KlausLoganWard,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/6km5hb/spoilers_entire_smh_plot_is_online_read_on_your/,"After the Battle of New York 2012 , Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. ) creates the Department of Damage Control to clean up after superhuman battles, inadvertly forcing Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his salvage crew out of business. Toomes and his men then decide not to surrender the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to steal weapons and supply them to criminal enterprises.

6 Years later, after the Battle of Leipzig, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is eager to join the Avengers, but is told by Stark that he's not yet ready. Peter is then forced to return to his old life as a student of Midtown Science and Technology School alongside his friends Ned (Jacob Batalon ) and Michelle (Zendaya ), his rival Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori ) and his longtime crush Liz Allan (Laura Harrier ). They're members of the school's academic declathon team, but Peter has recently quit to focus on his ""internship"" at Stark Industries, a cover for his crimefighting activities, despite Aunt May's (Marisa Tomei) objections.

Spider-Man confronts a group of criminals using Chitauri weapons to rob an ATM, but they escape and Ned accidentally finds out his secret identity. Spider-Man later finds Toomes' associates Herman Shultz (Bokeem Woodbine) and Jackson Brice (Logan Marshall-Green) selling weapons to gangster Aaron Davis (Donald Glover) and intervenes, but Shultz and Brice escape while Peter is nearly killed by the Vulture and rescued by Stark.

Determined to stop the Vulture, Peter and Ned retrieve a Chitauri weapon that Brice had left behind and remove its power core. A tracking device leads Shultz and Brice to Midtown, but Peter and Ned evade them and Peter plants a spider-tracer on Shultz that leads back to Virginia. Peter then rejoins the declathon team and accompanies them to Nationals in Washington, D.C., to follow his lead on Shultz. Peter and Ned disable Peter's suit's tracker and unlock its secret features, including an A.I. interface. Spider-Man then locates Toomes, Shultz and their tinkerer, Phineas Mason (Michael Chernus ), intercepting a DODC truck to steal more weapons. Spider-Man confronts the Vulture, but is overpowered and trapped in the truck, missing Nationals and disappointing his friends.

Peter finds out that the Chitauri power core left with Ned is unstable and that his friends are in danger. He manages to escape from DODC's headquarters but is too late to prevent the core from exploding while the team is visiting the Washington Monument, leaving them trapped in a collapsing elevator. Spider-Man manages to climb to the top while evading the police and catch the elevator before it plummets, saving his classmates. Peter later invites Liz to the homecoming dance.

Returning to New York, Spider-Man locates Davis and persuades him to reveal the Vulture's whereabouts. Spider-Man then confronts the Vulture and his men at the Staten Island ferry and captures Brice, but the Vulture escapes by using one of the Chitauri weapons to tear the ferry apart. Iron Man arrives and saves the passengers, but reprimands Peter for his recklessness and takes his suit, forcing Peter to go back to the homemade version. Peter goes to pick up Liz and finds out that Toomes is her father. Toomes deduces that Peter is Spider-Man as well and threatens retaliation if he interferes in his plans again.

Peter realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a DODC plane transporting the Avengers' weaponry from Stark Tower to the team's new headquarters in upstate New York and is forced to leave Liz to stop him. He's ambushed by Shultz at the bus yard, but Shultz is then knocked out by Ned. Spider-Man confronts Toomes in his lair, where Toomes attempts to persuade Peter to his side, claiming that he created his operation to secure Liz's future. Spider-Man is resolute, so the Vulture destroys the building's support beams, trapping Spider-Man under the rubble. Spider-Man manages to wrest himself free and intercept the Vulture. The DODC plane is damaged, but Spider-Man manages to steer it towards an empty area near Coney Island, where he once again fights the Vulture. Toomes' suit is damaged in the process, trapping Toomes in a fire, but Spider-Man rescues him and leaves him for the police.

Liz tells Peter that her mother and her are moving away due to Toomes' arrest and names Michelle as the new president of the declathon team, reveaing her full name as Michelle Jones, although her friends call her ""MJ"". Peter later visits Stark and declines his invitation to join the Avengers, having realized the importance of being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Peter returns home to learn that Stark has made him a new Iron-Spider suit .Later in Queens Peter try to put on the Iron spider suit and Aunt May comes to Peter room and find out he is Spider-Man.

In a mid-credits scene, Toomes is locked up in the Raft prison and approached by another convict, Mac Gargan (Michael Mando ), who reveals that several criminals aprehended by Spider-Man are banding together to get revenge. Toomes, however, chooses not to exposes Spider-Man's secret identity.

In an after-credits scene, Captain America (Chris Evans) shoots another of several PSA videos that are shown to Midtown's students throughout the school year."

I believe it was brought on by her older sister leaving for an internship across the country. They're very close and shared a room at my house, but she sleeps alone at her dad's house. We just went to the dr to get blood work done to ensure nothing is hinky there, even though I'm positive it's an issue we need to see a counselor for (in the process of getting that started). Both her sister and I have had horrible reactions to melatonin and valerian so I'm hesitant to try those for her. I'm also highly allergic to lavender and since she has severe allergies and asthma I'm not willing to try it with her. 

At my house she's been sleeping with me and sleeping okay-ish, but I start a new job soon and she goes back to school soon so it's not the greatest solution. At her dad's she calls me in the night when she's panicking because I actually listen to her and try to help. Dad and his gf just tell her to go back to bed. 

Tonight she called me at midnight, 1:30am, and 3:30am. I'm exhausted but refuse to silence my phone because I know how horrible these panic attacks are and she shouldn't suffer alone if possible.

She's tried white noise apps, playing sudoku to exhaust her mind (works for me), classical music, and meditation apps. What else can we try so she can sleep at her dad's? 

Please forgive any mistakes, it's late/early and I'm exhausted. "
6kn9vc,7,2017-07-01,The 1000 Point Club-249/793,Ayoung8764,step1,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/6kn9vc/the_1000_point_club249793/,"Hey everyone. I thought I would post my experience as a DO student who did pretty well on the USMLE and COMLEX because I don't see a ton of comlex posts. I want to be detailed because I think those are the most helpful posts, so bear with me. I'll do USMLE first, then comlex.

Background: I got denied from every medical school (MD and DO) except one. Didn't even get any interviews except this one. Then was put on the waitlist. All through summer 2015 I heard nothing. I had another job lined up and everything, only to get in off the wait list ten days before classes started (and on my birthday. Great gift lol). So my kick in the ass was that. I studied very hard the first two years because I realized I almost lost my dream of being a doctor. I was in the top 10-15% of my class. 

Step 1/Level 1:
I started preparing as soon as M2 year started. I had an internship the summer between M1/M2, so I was busy with research then. I bought a year long uworld subscription and went to work as soon as classes started. 

Resources used: Uworld, Sketchy Micro, First aid, pathoma. I tried a bunch of other stuff (firecracker/anki/usmle-rx) and hated it. This was all I needed. 

Starting in September, I would do uworld tutor mode questions corresponding to the system we were studying (school organizes classes by system). If I finished the questions for a system and we weren't done learning it, I would go back and do stuff from last year (cardio/renal/pulm is taught at the end of first year). Along with the uworld questions, I read the appropriate first aid section, watched pathoma for that system, and watched sketchy if there was anything relevant (GI/GU/derm especially). I did this up through about March, which is when we start term 3 (on trimesters). 

Dedicated: At this point I had finished a first pass of uworld, first aid, pathoma, and sketchy. So technically our school gives us four weeks, but there is a weird class during the four weeks before that which is designed to be easy going, so I consider myself as having 6-8 weeks of dedicated. I started dedicated taking NBME 13 and scored a 200 baseline. I was a little nervous, but happy that I passed the exam. I started doing 3 x 40 blocks of uworld timed/random every day (three sessions morning/afternoon/night). It took about 45 minutes to do the block and an hour to review. I would spend about 3-4 hours a day reading FA. This isn't a popular activity, but honestly when I started to read the book instead of just try to memorize facts, my practice exam scores jumped significantly. I think reading FA is severely underrated. I would read the appropriate FA section, watch the pathoma and sketchy (if relevant), then move on to the next section when I was done. I took practice exams throughout, scheduled and scored like this:

NBME 13 (baseline) 8 weeks out: 200
NBME 15 6 weeks out: 221
NBME 18 5 weeks out: 238
COMSAE C 5 weeks out (school mandated): 620
UWSA1 4 weeks out: 238
NBME 19 3 weeks out: 235
UWSA2 2 weeks out: 252
NBME 17 1 week out: 242

Actual exam: 249

Test day: I took the day off before my exam. I didn't look at FA or do a uworld question. I worked out, watched a movie, read a book for fun, and relaxed. I had a beer and went to bed. I think this had huge influence over doing well. I was 100% relaxed going into it. I took a bunch of shorter breaks after each section instead of one long lunch break, which I think helped. When I walked out, I thought I totally bombed it, but I'm happy it worked out. 

Comlex notes: I didn't prepare any differently for comlex, other than OMM. For OMM, my school actually does a fantastic job preparing  us. We take a cumulative final in early May, and studying for that was really all I needed. I read through Sabastan's (the green book) during the two days between my exams, and did all the OMM questions in combank. My school also has mandated combank questions due throughout may. 

COMLEX score: 793. I did not expect to do this well. The OMM was simple, and the exam had a lot of repeat questions on it. 

Hope this helps some people! Feel free to ask any questions!"
6knkda,54,2017-07-01,The Unofficial Gimlet Reading List: Books About Making Good Radio/Podcasts,kneb,podcasts,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/6knkda/the_unofficial_gimlet_reading_list_books_about/,"The process of making a podcast can seem mysterious, if not impossible. And when it comes to tasks like finding the overall structuring of a story or selecting the very best audio from three-hour-long interviews, if you’re like me, you may be unsure where to even begin.

I have good news, it’s not magic, there is a method. Radio producers have been been making shows under the constraint of the hardest of deadlines (dead air, gasp!), so skilled producers have systematized the process of creating audio and written how-to guides, one even in comic book form! 

As an intern at Gimlet I made this unofficial Gimlet reading list. It has two parts: The first of books the Gimlet office keeps on hand for newbies like me and then a second of books on nonfiction writing and journalism that Gimlet colleagues recommended to me. 

*Books about audio storytelling / Books about making podcasts and radio stories:*

* Out one the Wire: The Storytelling Secrets of the New Masters of Radio by Jessica Abel (with a foreword by Ira Glass)
Comic-book writer and illustrator Jessica Abel extends and updates her classic, Radio an Illustrated Guide, interviewing the hosts and staff that create the hits This American Life, The Moth, Radiolab, Planet Money, Snap Judgement, Serial, Invisibilia, and other narrative radio shows. This book starts from the very beginning, and teaches you every step of the process of creating a story from start to finish, what sorts of big picture questions and details producers think about, and all of the weird jargon like ‘bounces,’ ‘logging,’ and ‘selects.’ And abel shows as well as telling–using the same techniques that are described in this book to make it feel more like a narrative than a dry how-to guide. Plus, it’s funny, cheap, and you’ll learn a bit about the idiosyncratic personalities who create the shows you love.

* Sound Reporting: the NPR guide to audio Journalism and Production – by Jonathon Kern
What Out on the Wire does for Gimlet-style narrative stories, Sound Reporting does for more tradional NPR journalism. (Though, unfortunately, more traditional also means no pictures.) However, Sound Reporting is an audio journalism textbook written in clear conversational language by the Executive Producer for Training at NPR, and as such explains every step of making an audio news story. Not only reporting, producing, and editing, but also the ethical considerations of journalism–including examples of journalism gone terribly wrong! (For example, did you know some journalists erred and published in the 1980s that 2 million children were abducted each year, probably contributing to the long-lasting ‘stranger danger’ that still worries people today?) Sound Reporting is full of interesting, concrete examples like this, that illustrate Kern’s points and make it easy to read and understand.

* Reality Radio: Telling True Stories in Sound – Edited by John Biewen and Alexa Dilworth
Reality Radio is a collection of 24 essays. The second edition is hot of the press (Feb., 2017) and includes up to date information about the rapidly changing world of radio: the ascendance of the podcast; greater cultural, racial, and topical variety; and the changing economics of radio itself.

Contributors include many of the familiar faces from Out on the Wire, and a wider group including radio-makers from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The contributers are: Jad Abumrad, Daniel Alarcon, Jay Allison, damali ayo, John Biewen, Emily Botein, Chris Brookes, Scott Carrier, Katie Davis, Sherre DeLys, Ira Glass, Alan Hall, Dave Isay, Natalie Kestecher, Starlee Kine, The Kitchen Sisters, Sarah Koenig and Julie Snyder, Maria Martin, Karen Michel, Joe Richman, Dmae Roberts, Stephen Smith, Alix Spiegel, Sandy Tolan, and Glynn Washington.

*Books about nonfiction writing and journalism more broadly:*

* Follow the story : How to Write Successful Nonfiction – by James B Stewart
follow the story
I took the fact that Follow the Story’s Amazon page recommends it alongside my favorite style guide Zinsser’s On Writing Well as a very good omen. Stewart is a former editor of the Wall Street Journal’s front page, and draws heavily on examples from his own writing. This may irk some, but hey, write what you know, right? As much as this is a step-by-step guide for researching and writing a story, it is a philosophy about how to following your curiosity, and then leading the reader/listener down that same journey.
I’m looking over the amazon reviews for this book and I don’t get them:
“Read this book if you want to be a journalist,” says Jen. Four Stars. I would have sworn a 5-star rating was coming after that unequivocal endorsement.

* Naked in Baghdad: The Iraq War and the Aftermath as Seen by NPR’s Correspondent Anne Garrels
A lot of times in radio and journalism there is no script–no one can tell you what you should be doing and that can be terrifying, and that’s without putting your life in danger. Naked in Baghdad is an example, of a journalist rising above the call of duty, who “as one of only sixteen non-embedded journalists who stayed in the now legendary Palestine Hotel throughout the American invasion she managed to deliver the most immediate, insightful and independent reports with unparalleled vividness and immediacy,” and the madness of Iraq are juxtaposed against  e-mails from her husband.
Naked in Baghdad is an inspiring piece of work that illustrates the types of dramatic and impactful work you can do if you learn the skills of creating radio. As Ron Franscell points out in an Amazon Review, audio journalists can get access where others can’t: “She had no cameras… no bulky notebooks to mark her as a reporter in a crowd. Only a tape recorder the size of a cigarette pack … and the sounds of war. She traveled lightly and discreetly, just under the radar of the gatekeepers.”

So there’s the start of a reading list for the aspiring radio journalist, podcaster, or audio storyteller. What books have helped or inspired you that I’m missing from the list? "

6ko0rw,1,2017-07-01,22[M4F] summer of sexy fun in #Connecticut,The_Ugliness_Man,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/6ko0rw/22m4f_summer_of_sexy_fun_in_connecticut/,"Summer's already half over, and there's still so much I want to do in this state. I'm here for what's turning out to be a great internship, but I don't want to miss out on experiencing this state because of work. I'm looking for someone to do the things I don't get to do with my coworkers. Some ideas I had include going hiking during the day and having sex under the stars at night; going to a nude beach/resort together and just relaxing in the sun; going to a club and being each other's wingman, then sharing our new friends with each other and going skinny dipping. If you're a little shy, I'd also be more than happy to keep our relationship more vanilla, fooling around at home and being ""normal"" when we go out.

I've posted to /ladybonersgonewild if you want to see what I look like. I can also send a face picture. Shoot me a message if you're interested. Tell me a little about yourself. Do you have anything you want to try but have no one to do it with?"
6ko32t,0,2017-07-01,Excellent credit sank to poor in 1.5 years time. Looking for a new job and worried this will get in the way. Car accident threw me for a loop. How can I get ahead?,kkthrowaway459,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ko32t/excellent_credit_sank_to_poor_in_15_years_time/,"Hey there, I've been a lurker here for a while and need some advice. I've scanned as many posts as I can but can't find a similar situation that's ""just right."" 

I graduated college in December 2015 and moved out of a place with roommates and into my own space. I had an internship paying $30K/year (pre-tax) and was approved for my place ($850 rent, $100 utilities) without a cosigner because of my excellent credit score of 795. Fast forward to just a month later in mid-January and I get rear ended by a semi truck on the interstate. Ouch. My car was totaled (obviously) and I was sent to ER followed by about 10 months of PT and I'm &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; dealing with doctors who may want to perform surgery to prevent the neck pain. 

Anyway, this led to a TON of medical debt (still haven't gotten the final bill but so far after insurance I'm looking at $7K+). Because of my relatively low income at the time, I started putting the payments on credit. 9 months ago I got promoted and now make $53K (pre-tax) per year. 

After taxes, benefits, retirement, etc. are taken out, I bring home about $2,700/month.

My post-accident car payment is $205/month. 

Rent + utilities comes out to $800/month (cheap for my city, moved in the month I got promoted). 

Student loans are $430/month. (Still owe $53K+). 

Food, gas, any additional expenses (new clothes, basic needs like shampoo, going out to eat on my lunch break if I don't have time/food to bring from home, fun like going to a movie) costs around $500-700/month. 

I have 2 credit cards that are both practically maxed out (~$60 available on each). 
One has a limit of $4,700 and a monthly interest charge of $68, minimum payment of $150. 
The second has a limit of $1000, no interest, minimum payment of $25. 

My parents generously pay for my cell phone and auto insurance. 

My small amount of savings got wiped out in February due to yet another car accident (also not my fault) with a $500 deductible plus owing on taxes (my fault for not updating my deductions post-graduation) about $650 and I haven't been able to replenish. 

This leaves me with about $390 (minimum) leftover each month. Or $200/check. Which I clear out and put straight towards my credit cards. Unfortunately, my med bills are on auto-pay from my CC and across all doctors and charges, I'm paying close to $300/month. My credit score is now 531. :'( 

I have a lawyer but we can't close my case until I'm done with treatment (which could be literal years). The guy in the semi never contacted me nor did his insurance. The other guy is 100% at fault, got a ticket for ""distracted driving"" and literally hit my car while I was at a stop because of another accident ahead. I know lawyers can't make promises about payouts but he's told me ""I can certainly anticipate a full reimbursement for medical and hopefully more."" So I'm banking on a minimum of $7K, no eyes set on a max, and plan to pay off my credit cards 100% and put whatever (if any) is left towards student debt. 

So now I've been approached by a few companies in my field (SEO marketing) and there's a high chance, based on multiple interviews, that I'll be getting an offer from at least one or more companies. They'd be paying to relocate out of state as well as giving me a raise to at least $60K (this has been discussed though I understand it's not on paper so I'm not assuming a raise until it's in writing. I wouldn't pick up and move unless that's the starting pay rate). I'd like to take whatever moving stipend they offer and do the moving myself (small amount of items, a day's worth of driving, would be able to complete a move with 1-2 friends/parents to help drive the uhaul and lift/move) and put it straight towards my credit card debt. I don't have a numerical value for what this would be. 

If I move I'll likely need a cosigner (thankfully my parents wouldn't hesitate). I'll get my deposit from my landlord in full (we've discussed this last time she was over) so there's $1000 I can put towards my next deposit. Plus whatever moving stipend is offered and they would also be paying the cost to break my lease (this has been discussed). That'll help contribute to rent. Plus I'll be selling some of my furniture and belongings simply because I don't absolutely need it all. There's a few hundred more in my pocket. 

I know employers run background checks and credit is a factor. If I honestly explain my situation, do you think they might even give me a chance? Or should I quit looking altogether and wait it out until I get reimbursed from the accident? Before the wreck I was paying off my credit each month in full. I used it to get gas and make any big purchases (like furniture) so I could build my credit to that sweet 795. Now I'm screwed with my 531. 

My questions are:

Do I tell the new company about my terrible credit ahead of time with an explanation?

Do I decline a background check and throw in the towel early?

Do I cross my fingers and hope it won't come up as an issue?

Should I beg my doctors to stop treatment so I can get moving towards my settlement? I've accepted I'll have lifelong discomfort and nothing is broken so is it really worth spinal injections that miiight clear some neck pain? (This is mostly just me thinking aloud, probably don't need answers to that). 

I really, really want this potential job offer. It's in an awesome city with a lower cost of living and the company is AMAZING. My current job is slowly being replaced by an agency and the company is for sale - we're on a sinking ship. 

TL;DR. My credit used to be fantastic until I got in a wreck and maxed out my cards on med bills that are still adding up. Now my credit is poor. Do I tell potential new employers? At what step in the interview process? Or do I accept my fate and stick it out? Help. 

Thanks for reading, sorry for offering so much length.

6komu8,30,2017-07-01,Advice on how to deal with anxiety on trains,hazelirises,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/6komu8/advice_on_how_to_deal_with_anxiety_on_trains/,"I have been having a lot of issues lately being on the trains in the city I live nearby, and I am hoping to get some advice on how to deal with it, as it is now affecting the job I just got.

It all started about 6 weeks ago. I had started an internship that I had to commute to using a bus and a train that took about an hour. I had absolutely no problems with this, besides having to leave at 7:30AM to get to work before 9:00AM. A week after I started my internship, which was doing IT for the Anesthesia department at a hospital, I passed out while my mentor was explaining how the anesthesia machine is used. I fell face-first and bit through my cheek, resulting in stitches being put in both my mouth and on the outside corner of my mouth. I now have a scar from it.

This happened on a Thursday, I was given Friday off, and I returned Monday. I managed to stay the whole day, but I felt sick multiple times and like I was going to pass out again once or twice. Tuesday was the worst day. While on the train, I was thinking about what happened, and suddenly started to feel dizzy and like I was going to pass out. I was a few stops away from my stop, so I managed to hold on and get off at my station, where I ran out and looked for a place to sit. I was panicking and terrified that I could have passed out while standing on the train and I would have been stuck, because what if no one helped me? 
I still went to work, but only lasted an hour and a half, I couldn't calm down. Someone had come over to ask how I was, and I told her I didn't feel well and needed to go home. She drove me home, and my supervisor said to get checked for a concussion.

Instead of a concussion, it was determined that I had anxiety after what happened. I was given Wednesday off to get better, and returned on Thursday (a week after the incident). I was there for four hours, and could not calm down. I had been nervous on the train and the whole time at work, so I talked to my mentor and we agreed that I should find something else where I felt safe.

After what happened that Tuesday on the train, I have had awful anxiety being on the trains. I have managed to get a seat everytime since then, which has helped a bit, but my heart is always beating very fast and sometimes I feel like I can't breathe. Another thing is that this usually only happens when I am riding inbound, when I am riding outbound either towards where my boyfriend lives or where I live, I don't really have any problems unless I'm thinking about the anesthesia machine. 

I've been on the trains a lot since I quit my internship, to visit my boyfriend and more recently to interview at my new retail job and going there Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and I was supposed to go today. I was slowly getting better being on the trains, and yesterday I don't think I even panicked once, which was nice. Then, at 3:00AM this morning, I woke up panicked, and was thinking about how much more time and how much longer my commute is going to be, since I was going to get a monthly pass tonight after work, and for some reason the bus that makes my commute an hour instead of an hour and a half does not allow the monthly pass for some reason. This made me panic about having to be on the trains for about an hour.

It took almost an hour but I was able to fall asleep again, then when I woke up to my alarm at 8:00AM my heart was still beating fast and I was still panicking. I spent until 11:00AM trying not to cry and freak out, telling myself that I was safe on the trains and that nothing would happen, and then I just broke and I couldn't stop crying. I called in sick to work, two days after starting. I was also supposed to find out my schedule for the next week today, so I will be calling later tonight to find out (its a 24 hour store). I thought I would be fired since I'm calling out after being there 2 days, and I wasn't. I'm still not sure if I can deal with the commute there though.

I talked to my boyfriend about it, who has been helping me through all of this, and he said I should try to keep working there until at least classes start again (since we and a friend are trying to find an apartment in the area, and the store I work out is also down the street from my college.). I said I would try to keep working there, but if this morning happens again then I'm going to find something on a train stop that is towards the middle of where I live right now and my school. The whole point of trying to get a job there though, was that it is so close to the college and open 24 hours, so I would be able to work enough hours to pay rent and my other bills each month once we find a place. 

So, my question is how can I deal with this anxiety? I don't want to quit after it took a month for me to find something (even though I wasn't trying very hard to find a job). When on the trains, I've been doing things to distract myself like listening to loud music on my phone, playing with the mouthpiece of my water bottle, and most recently, holding a small smooth rock my boyfriend found at the beach the last time I visited his house. 

I've dealt with bad anxiety while on the trains, but never hours before like what happened today. Does anyone have any advice?

TL;DR: Almost passed out on a train a few days after passing out for real and getting injured. Since then, I've had anxiety being on the trains. Today, I was panicking hard hours before I was supposed to leave for work, leading to me calling out, days after getting hired. I don't want to quit or get fired, but if this happens again I think I'll need to. Any advice to deal with this anxiety?"

In the past, there were some periods when I binged like crazy (my best friend was an addict and let me do his drugs for free. He overdosed and died), but also there were times where I didn't touch the stuff for like, four or five months straight.

I started doing coke because of my depression. It made me forget, even for a little while, what I was going through (even if it came back to bite me in the ass after the comedown).

Anyways, skipping to lately: I'm an university student living with my mother, and don't have any part-time jobs or internships at the moment. When I had them, I could resist the urge to use the money to buy drugs (don't know exactly why, but that's what happened). Nowadays I'm unemployed and the little money I have comes from some very cheap freelance works I do sporadically.

There's when happens. Even so I start doing the jobs thinking I'll use the money to do some other things, when I get my hands on it, the first thing I do is to buy coke.

Now, I don't know if it's because of how long I've been using it, if I'm getting old or whatever, but every time I do it, *it sucks*. When the comedown strikes, I get desperate for sleep, so I can stop feeling that way. Most of the times I have benzos to try and counteract the feeling, but lately, even with them, I try to find sharp objects to cut myself with, so I can alleviate my blood pressure and just pass out. My mother knows about my suicidal tendencies and hides the really sharp stuff (she works with scalpels). But even tough the feeling is dreadful, and I promise to myself that I won't do coke the next time, I ended up doing it anyways.

Before last night, I used it last month. It was a spur of the moment thing, because it was my birthday. I did something like 4 grams of the stuff. I ended up having to go to emergency after, because I was feeling like shit. I never felt like that before. I was cold, trembling, nothing I ate or drink stayed down, I puked a lot (even with an empty stomach), kept spitting and I had a splitting headache. When I got to the ER, the doctor said that I was experiencing withdrawal (I didn't know you could experience it right after you used it, but that's what he told me). They put me on a IV drip, gave me a pill to relax me and I stayed there for like two hours. They asked me if I had medical support, and I said no, because my parents didn't think it was necessary anymore, yadda yadda. The doctor that tended to me wanted me to talk to him after my IV finished, but he had to go address some emergency and it wasn't there, so I left.

I don't have support help. My family abominates drugs and, the last time I tried to reach out to them, I ended up forcibly going to one of those city-funded homes for the mentally-ill that also do drugs, but the focus isn't the drug use per se. Even the people responsible for running the place said I shouldn't be there.

I used to go to a psychiatrist and to a psychologist, but my mom made me stop going to them cold turkey, citing that she thought I was better and didn't need them anymore, and I was making her spend a lot of money (my family's not *poor*, but my mom doesn't know how to manage her earnings and we are in debt at all times).

Since my aforementioned friend overdosed, three years ago, I've been without friends. I do have some acquaintances at college, but none of them are close enough to the point where I can depend on them for this kind of stuff. Recently I reconnected with an old friend, and after that trip to the ER last month, asked him to help me in this matter. He said he would.

Last night I gave him all the signals that I'd do coke again. I basically straight up told him. He said he was busy with some other friends and couldn't be with me. Today he talked to me via IM and asked what was wrong (because I replied to him with a sad emoji). When I explained everything, he said he didn't think I was being serious that time before.

**TL;DR**: I want to stop doing coke because it's not worth it anymore, but the urge is bigger than myself. I don't have any support system and don't know what I can do alone to stop those urges, and one of these days, if I continue using it, I might end up killing myself when coming down.


Any words of advice, r/drugs?"

I'm a 22 years old german business informatics student, currently studying on a masters degree. I'm planning to stay in your beautiful city between september and early february together with my girlfriend. I'm looking for an internship or job (ideally in business or business informatics) to finance my stay. Unfortunately, I haven't had any luck in writing to companies and applying for internships, so far. 
Do you have any tips for me or know someone who knows someone and so on? I'm happy about every input or hint :)

Thanks in advance!

I've been on my feet most of the day at my new job. It's hard work, lots of standing and walking, but it pays well for an internship, and I actually get to do stuff. Not sit on my ass behind a fucking desk. 

I'm wore out. I tried to do homework while I was there after I clocked out, but the internet wasn't working, so I ended up driving back.

I kinda regret signing up for summer classes. I mean, I got to go to Chicago, which was pretty cool, but the grounds were that I had to take summer classes. I feel like I should have just taken HUM299L and called it quits. But no. I wanted to stack two more, because I'm sick of school. 

That's right. I'm going to be that guy who whines about being in college. Call me a snowflake. Call me entitled. Call me a whiny bitch. I don't care.

I'm so sick of being in school. If I could just quit and work full time doing job training, I would. At the very least, I wish I had just taken the summer off. I'm starting to not care again. Apathy creeping up on me again.

I've also been trying to help people on the Suicide Watch subreddit. Because I've been on meds and therapy, and I had a near attempt on my own life a few months ago. It hurt so much, and I didn't even go through with it. I still think about suicide sometimes. It stays in the back of my head, like an emergency exit from life. If you don't like what you see and don't see the need to change it, just open the door. Right?

Being in that place is painful sometimes. I've read multiple suicide notes, and the more I read, the more I think about my own experience with it. It hurts when you see people in the darkness like that, yet you don't even know how to help them properly. Or if they even want help.

I'm just so tired right now. Not depressed, just....tired."

Hello, everyone. First-timer here. I've already been lurking for a good week and feel ready to post. Reading everything here has been so validating and helped me process what I have gone through with my uBPD mother. This past year a whole string of events have made it especially difficult to deal with her lately.

Current situation: Single child, mid 20's. I graduated a year ago, but since I did not speak the language of the country I live in very well, I took classes to supplement this to prepare me for job searching. However, it's been a struggle to find a job and I have been living with my parents since. The struggle was due to the nature of my master study being hard to translate into jobs in my local country, my anxiety, and my father's severe illness. Now I am applying to a master that will let me get a certificate that's recognized throughout the country for jobs I know I will feel fulfilled in, so I'm excited.

A month ago my father (whom I loved a lot and felt safe with, though he was half enmeshed) passed away after a year long fight with cancer. It's been hard losing him, but we had a month after his cancer turned terminal to spend with him. So I had closure and now able to move on from his passing. However, this leaves me alone with my mother while I'm still in that fragile stage of job seeking while recently losing a close parent. On top of this, I struggled with severe anxiety during my studies abroad and it was a hard task to finish my master (it definitely impacted my ability to find a job or internship while I was still studying, I was too afraid and felt incompetent). Now I feel I have the resolve and willpower to properly finish a study while focusing on finding a job, and getting out.

Currently I'm in the process of applying to a master here which will really have me connect with the local job market and improve my language skills. The government refuses to pay me benefits as I went to an international school, so I really rely on my mother for finance while I get my life sorted. Luckily education here is very cheap, but paying rent for a studio or room compensates for that.

What really brings me down is dealing with my mother. All throughout my childhood she has been a constant source of fear for me. Now, she is a source of dread and hurt. I never really felt safe around her for fear of being yelled at for the smallest things, from not understanding how she meant something to making a mess as a kid. She'd yell at me as if I had intended to hurt her with making a mess. She always went out of her way to say how I was hindering her, how she made me feel guilty and responsible for her bad feelings. If my father was ill and I was showing concern for him, she'd get upset and tell me how I never show her the ""same amount of love"" for her whenever she was ""ill"". Or I'd be laying on the couch as an extremely ill child with flu, and she'd be feeling overworked and tell me how I'm making her take care of me while she's ""ill"" too. She's always felt ""ill"", but never bothers going to the doctor for it. In fact, she calls me ""boring"" and says how I am being pushy when I suggest for her to see a doctor each time she feels ill. Doesn't make sense.

I suspect her BPD was due to her family situation and a civil war she had to witness first-hand in her home country. I have caught my maternal grandma going through my mom's things before, my dad has caught her doing the same thing with their stuff when visiting us, so I can only imagine how life was like for my mom growing up. But, an explanation is never an excuse.

I'd feel guilty. It took me a long time to not feel guilty. On top of this, she is highly explosive whenever she is angry. I had to deal with verbal and emotional abuse as a child who didn't know any better. Nowadays I struggle with insecure attachment and trauma (due to my mother and extreme bullying in the past), and I am on the waiting list for EMDR. I'm told I will be starting anytime this summer. I really believe it's going to help me feel secure again.

What made me realize that she most definitely has borderline is when my counselor told me that my mother is showing all the hallmarks of BPD. After being skeptical and researching it more, I came across this sub and I could relate to so many people's stories here. I struggled with being independent, to feel not guilty whenever my mother started to split, to accept I will never receive true love from my mother. Now I'm happy to say that I've become more independent, but living with only my mother now is taking its toll on me. I'm going nuts. Everything from the casual insults to the explosive splitting. Driving me nuts.

Since I am financially dependent on my mother, I can't just move out. She knows I don't want to live with her on the long run due to her anger issues, and panics each time I try to investigate moving out. Since a few days ago, she's been splitting like hell onto me, calling me ""not-normal"" ""lazy"" ""fat"" and even during her good moods she's prone to insulting me still, by saying that I don't do anything (despite my clear efforts to not be jobless) and how I am being ""boring"". On top of this, each time I don't or can't immediately help her on a suddenly ""urgent"" request, she will start to tantrum and cry, and insult me. She focuses on how she's all alone, how I just, in other words, ""abandon"" her and ""ignore"" her. I've taken to just going upstairs to my room because there's no way I am going to deal with her tantrums. 1 hour later she acts like she's said nothing and is smiling again. Plus, each time I look into a city where a job is offered, she expresses intense interest in following me there too. I don't want her to follow me like a puppy, and I don't want to be in a situation (such as moving to the countryside) where she'd start to rely on me for driving too, as she can't drive. I will be ready to set boundaries once I get financial independence for sure and to mentally prepare myself for the inevitable drama when she tries to get closer to me.

Thank you for reading my story and rant. It was healing to put this all out there after going through the posts here. And my thanks to the existence of this subreddit."
6kqmbg,8,2017-07-01,Recommendations for a recent Business Administration Graduate,dafishmonger,businessanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalysis/comments/6kqmbg/recommendations_for_a_recent_business/,"Hi all,

I recently graduated from college in Seattle with a Business Administration degree focusing in International Business. I am interested in starting a business analyst career. I've been learning SQL and Tableau (any other data visualization I should learn?) while continuing to improve my MS office skills (excel, access, starting visio) as they seem to be common requirements. I would also like to get familiar with SAS or SPSS but I am not sure which to pursue.

Unfortunately, my degree had nothing to do with data or computer science/analysis so I do not have the credentials many business analyst positions are looking for. I have been reading Practical Analysis articles and listening to the Mastering Business Analysis podcast by Dave Saboe to increase my knowledge on the subject. At this point I am looking to just get my foot in the door at a company but my degree paired with lack of experience (my internship was an administrative position in higher education) in the field has been a hindrance. I have been looking into Business Analyst Masters program but would rather get into the work force before making that financial commitment. 

 I am wondering if it would be worth it to learn Python/R (both?). I can work decently with C++ so I am not too concerned about learning another coding language. Aside from networking (I'm aware of the importance) I am looking for any recommendations to beef up my resume and improve my marketable skills or simply advice to move me in the right direction.

Thank you!"
6kqzf2,0,2017-07-01,[31/m] My gf [32/f] has trouble adulting,hamburgerlerger,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6kqzf2/31m_my_gf_32f_has_trouble_adulting/,"My girlfriend struggles with depression, like many people, but it is accompanied by a general lack of adult skills.  She is smart, smarter than I am in some ways (she is excellent at math).  But she simply cannot deal with the large amounts of boredom/frustration that come with ""adulting"".  Example: surviving ""the grind"" of one's early 20's (having shitty jobs, working 40 hours per week, feeling dissatisfied, etc...I know that's not everyone's experience, but that of many).  Her parents have enabled this by providing her room and board for years at a time.  When we met, she had no job (and none for many prior years).  She told me she was working on starting her own business, so the living at home thing seemed smart in a sense.  But, as happens to many, she has pretty much stopped working on it.


Two years on, she has made some progress.  She moved in with me, and we agreed on a reduced rent for her based on our incomes at the time.  She had said that she would do some extra grocery shopping and/or some extra chores around the house to compensate.  She didn't do the extra shopping, so I listed all the chores and made her sit with me and decide who was doing what, with the stipulation that she do about 60% (it's a one-bedroom apartment and they were kept pretty sane I think...e.g., ""wipe down stove once a week"", ""take out trash"").  I didn't make her sign anything, and told her I knew shit happened, etc.  She said, ""I didn't think you'd actually hold me to that.""  She wasn't happy with it but at least agreed to it.  Weeks later, shit wasn't getting done (not 60% at all, maybe more like 10%) and she said she was feeling really depressed.  I told her it wasn't really about the chores, just a sense of fairness.  We discussed the solution of cleaning together once per week, which was fine.  We sometimes do this, but overall we've reverted to an irregular schedule where I do most of it and she does a little and it more or less gets done (with a few days of absolute squalor in there...I'm far from perfect myself).


Then there's the money issue.  I'm far from rich, but there's sort of the expectation that I'm winning most of the bread here.  She currently works part time and makes close to minimum wage in a job she pretty much hates.  At my insistence, she covers half the food and utilities (and some rent, as described above).  The thing that really drives me nuts is that she has been offered 40 hours/week with benefits at her job multiple times!  But she doesn't take it, because she doesn't want to work that much.  I do OK, but I cannot provide her with medical insurance or a retirement fund.  She is generally pretty healthy, but there is no planning for her future.  A while back, there was a tech internship w/a stipend for learning coding, which is not her passion, but she's a quick learner and that stuff is pretty intuitive to her.  I practically begged her to do it.  She expressed mild interest and then let the deadline go by.
 

As for the ""why don't you just talk to her?"" issue: When I ask her about planning her future and getting out of a job she hates, she clams up on me, staring straight ahead, tears coming down her face.  **By the way, what should I do when I get this reaction?!**  I'm not yelling at her, I'm using an even tone of voice, using ""I"" statements, describing concerns, etc.  But it has the effect of stopping the conversation in its tracks.  I believe it is both *very* manipulative and also not totally in her control, sort of like asking a toddler to stop her tantrum and speak reasonably.  It frustrates me to no end!


I have a lot of empathy for her.  I had a period of my 20's after I got my degree when I bummed around doing almost nothing, feeling depressed.  There are many days when getting out of bed feels pointless (I think most redditors can relate).  And I certainly waste a lot of time doing bullshit things like reddit and Facebook when I could be making my life more interesting/fulfilling.  But I also got my shit together somewhat, completing a rigorous grad program (so long, useless liberal arts degree) with excellent employability.  It WAS a lot of bullshit, and I wanted to quit at times, but I didn't, and now I have a future, just not one I'm sure I can share with her.  She has made progress: since we met, she's employed and has moved in with me.  But 1.5 years into her part-time retail job, she's plateaued again and I'm still paying part of her rent.  How do I:


a) get her to start paying her full share of the rent


b) get her to pick a viable employment track


c) deal with the tears?


TL;DR: GF is too depressed/lazy to build a future with me or take care of her interests"

So last summer I was on vacation in North Africa where I used Tinder to meet people because I knew no one my age. I matched with a guy who, like me, was there for vacation but lived in Europe (different country from mine though). The difference was he grew up there and only left for Europe for college. So all his friends &amp; family lived in North Africa.



Anyway, we hit it off pretty well and met a few time (4-5). I wasn't expecting anything because obviously this was only a summer thing and we had a lot of fun. Along the way, I met his friends, siblings and mother (we hung out at his parents' a lot). My last night there, we are having drinks with his brother and the latter asks me ""Are you going to miss him ?"", this took me by surprise and I just made a joke. When I left the country, I sent him kind of a goodbye text for some sort of closure and he never answered, he just wrote to me random stuff a few days later as if he hadn't gotten the text.




We didn't talk after that for months but then in January I went back there and he was there too, we only had one day overlap but got to meet. So we are having dinner and he asks me why I hadn't visited him in Europe and that he would love for me to come; even checking the price for plane tickets. I'm really surprised because we never talked about that before and I take it as him being polite. I tell him about my vacation plans in eastern europe for february with a friend and he wants to join... I personnaly would never consider making a trip with someone I barely know and at that point we've only met 5 times... In the end, he doesn't join us because it would make my friend uncomfortable as she kinda would be ""holding the candle"". 

So **question** **1)** Are guys usually fine with making a trip with a girl they only hooked up with a few times over summer ?




Fast forward a few months (we hadn't talked in the meantime) and it's summer again; he wrote to me recently asking if I was coming to North Africa. I wont be going this summer as I have an internship, but I must admit I would have been up to seeing him again. He seems really disappointed that we won't get to meet so I tell him that he can drop by my city if he wants (at this point I get the feeling that he wants more and I'm up for giving it a try). Only he says that the ""North African setting"" makes the whole thing really pleasant and fun. So I take it that he considers this to only be a summer thing and I dont prolong the conversation. However, a few days later, he asks me if I'll be in the city **if** he drops by in september. So basically, he **might** come in september for the sole reason of seeing me.

So **question** **2)** Would guys make a flight trip for the sole reason of hooking up ? And he does use the word if so I don't know how much credit I should give his words...




We live in different countries and they are 2 hours away by plane. We are both students so meeting would be difficult. The strangest thing is that on our first date, he made a point of telling me that for him physical closeness is very important and that he wants to be able to meet his girlfriend daily. It was a clear way of telling me this was going nowhere which was fine with me. Nonetheless, when we met in January, he told me about how ""he changed over the past few months and had been re-evaluating his way of seeing things. He now believes that having some space in a relationship is a good thing and that meeting daily isn't healthy..."" 

So **question** **3)** Is this an indirect way of telling me he would be fine with long distance ? 

I've always believed that when a man is truly interested in a woman, he'd be straightforward and direct about it but this all seems a bit ""wishy washy"" and so I don't really know how seriously I should consider him. I'm very bad at reading guys and hints so I wanted to ask for redditers' personal opinion on this and how they would react. 




Thank you for your insights and sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes !
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm still in contact with my summer love/fling of last year and I dont understand what he wants at this point.

Plus somethings are going to be a bit repetitive but I just want to let it out) (feel free to comment) (I'm not going to be careful with my grammar )


1- you fought with me right before my audition for the university's dance team (in front of everyone) over a pimple that I didn't let you pop and because I was ""nervous and distracted"". I cried before entering for my turn.
2- You called me an hypocrite because I took a picture with my friends out of boredom (because apparently I didn't took pictures with you). Then said that I was ignoring you because I didn't reply to an ""ok"".....when I already said that I was going to be busy with my friends. We fought till 5am while I stayed at my friends house.
3- You would insult me every time we had a fight and claimed that I deserved it... I asked and begged for you to stop for nearly a year for you to stop this bad habit ....you didn't stop till I had a mental breakdown.
4- Every ""mistake"" (which was nearly everything I did....even breathing was wrong for you) was always blamed on my anxiety and depression.
5- You fought with me for days because I accidentally left some gifts that you gave me at your house .... you claimed that I didn't love you or cared about you because I forgot when truth is I was excited to hang out with you. 
6- You fought with me because sometimes I was sad and you couldn't do anything about it. (When truth is all I needed was for you to listen)
7- You didn't believe in having our alone time. 
8- You screamed at me for ""failing"" at teaching you dance and then get mad because I gave up at teaching you.
9- You shaved your hair and then blamed it on me. (Because we broke up for a while and your hair ""reminded you of me"") 
10- Every wrong action you did was because ""I did something in the past""
11- you were paranoid because I kept doing everything wrong.
12-You could go to a Disney Internship but god forbid if I go to DCP (because ""DCP was for us and the Disney Internship was ""different"" &lt;--- doesn't make sense at all)
13-You fought with me nearly every weak. 
14- You didn't believed in stepping away to calm down to then solve a problem
15- You said that I have communication problems because I forgot to say that I stopped in a gas station while I was in another country.... you fought with me till 5am because of this. 
16-Many times I missed classes because of the fights... because you would say that ""we were a priority"" and still get mad at me if I said to talk about it at another time....you would even fight with me while I was trying to study.... I failed tests because of it. 
17-I ended up going to a psychologist and started taking anti-depressants because I was thinking that everything was my fault and I was the problem 
18- You would scream at me sometimes right in front of my face. 
19- You would get close to me while screaming and ""poke"" me hard on my chest or shoulder while you were fighting. 
20- You would follow me to my classrooms if I left before ""finishing a fight"". 
21- we couldn't go to bed after fighting for hours because the ""problem wasn't solved"" even when we had to wake up really early in the morning ....even when we fell asleep at 5am the day before because you were fighting. 
22-You always blamed me. 
23- Claimed that I was wasting time because ""I wasn't doing what I wanted"" (pretty hard to explain)
24-Get mad if I pointed something you did ...yeah ...you would say sorry but somehow I was to blame for your mistake. 
25- somehow every bad thing was pointed back to me. 
26- You fought with me the day of our anniversary because ""I didn't planned enough"" and because ""I wasn't doing what I wanted"". 
27- Got mad at me for being happy and chill because ""I wasn't planning our anniversary"" I did planned it and I did told you the plan .....still took me hours of me telling you and begging so you could believe that I did took the time to plan our anniversary. 
28- You would say that you trusted me but the fights said otherwise. 
29- You would question me if I spoke to a guy but get defensive if I looked ""off"" when you say that you were going to stay at a girl's apartment...for the third day in a row (I trusted him because it was an old friend of his but cmon) 
30- You would say that 8/9 ex girlfriends you've had were the ones to blame for the end of your relationship with them (hope this makes sense) 
31- Didn't believe in privacy. 
32- hit, or nearly break, stuff while fighting (like smashing the door of the car) 
33- You would criticize other people's relationships and say that ""they didn't love each other""
34- If you were mad you could ignore me or treat me coldly by if I was mad I needed to act normal ""because it was the right thing to do and because in the end it was my fault that he acted in a way that it made me mad"". 
35- I had to SC or message you good morning and good night everyday because it was my job to remember (because I need to do things right to make up for all ""the bad I did"" and because my anxiety was to blame if I forget) ....I would get a fight if I forget to message you. 
36- During fight you took my keys out of my hands and throw them and said that you would force me to stay to talk....I wanted to leave because I was scared of you and because you were screaming at my face. 
37- I arrived late many times to my rehearsals because you would hold me till the fight was over and get super upset if I tried to leave.  
38-You would ask me why I was so dense and stupid. 
39-my contact name on your phone was ""Be Careful"" because you needed to be careful of me because of ""all my mistakes""
40-You would only stop fighting and would hug me and comfort me when I end up having a panic attack during the fight. 
41- It was ok for you to leave if you were me but if I did I was wrong. 
42- I was scared of you. 
43- I was anxious all the time in the relationship 
44- I started self harming because ""everything was my fault"" 
45- the root to ""all my mistakes"" was a mistake that happened 2 years ago (I've been saying sorry for 2 years for something that I never did again ...yes I admit that I did that... The mistake was that while we were acquaintances/ friends I got so nervous to see you because I liked you that I didn't meet up with you after class ....I still feel horrible because of that)
46-You made me believe that I was weak and that you were the only one who could save me. 
47-You would remind me everyday that I was weak and that I was sick with depression and anxiety. 

*After I broke up with you* 
48- still believe that you only did one mistake and still don't know why I broke up with you after telling you all my reasons many times. 
49- You followed me to my classes and my car and you wouldn't let me leave (you would say that you weren't forcing me to talk while keeping a hand tight on the steering wheel) 
50-called me over 200 times and when I blocked your number you used your mother's phone. 
51- text me over 100 times to tell me why I was wrong. 
52- Told everyone that I had psychological problems (yes I'm open about mental illnesses but saying that my mental problem was the cause of the break is another story) 
53-Still believe to this day that my depression and anxiety broke us up and that I left you after only one mistake when you ""forgave"" all my mistakes. 
54-Came to my house a couple of times with gifts to get me back when I said many times to leave me alone. 
55-Told my parents that I needed help because I was mentally sick. 
56- Took our group chat for our class to speak to others about our problems and ""make me realize"" I was wrong 
57-My parents had to get involve so you would leave me alone 
58- When I sent you an email for a class project (you were the leader of the group ....sadly) You said that ""you were going to do the right thing unlike me"" and that you wouldn't leave the group because ""you weren't as destructive"" as me. 

Yes....this is super long ....if you came all this way thank you for reading my rant. 
Take care Redditors.

6kruaf,1,2017-07-02,I self sabotaged BIG TIME,magpiec,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/6kruaf/i_self_sabotaged_big_time/,"I started my dream job with a great pay a month ago. I moved states alone. I have no friends here. My first month I was put up in corporate housing, which I have overstayed by a week, despite having my permanent housing available. This is going to prove extremely expensive for me, $500 a night expensive on top of paying rent at my new place. I'm not in my native country from the past 3 years. 
When I started my job I was in the low / depressive part of my cycle when i can't really focus and everything is a little overwhelming but it's still better than my hypomania where i go on crazy shopping / hypersexual/ porn binges. It started okay. I think it all started going downhill with my first sip of coffee at work. I think I'm sensitive to caffeine and it makes me hyper.
The interns joined a day after me. In about a week, I didn't go to office for two whole days without informing anyone because I was really depressed, everything new was very overwhelming for me. A few days after that , my mania began. I got mad attracted to one of the interns. I decided to add him and then ask him out on facebook just because I was ""bored"". It was a rule of mine to never date in my workplace. We went out on a date the same night. Came back to my place for ice cream, went out got beer, had beer, made out. (Another bad idea because alcohol is absolute poison my BPD.). 
Since everything I do is adorable according to me when I'm manic, I started becoming very clingy. Despite him clearly asking me not to be. I think i was quite inappropriate at the workplace too. I started hanging out on the intern floor, had my lunches with the interns, even exchanged my desk with another intern to stay closer to him. I'm sure that made him pretty annoyed. It makes me furious thinking everything I did.
In two days of dating him, I went out and bought my first CAR and advertised my accomplishment all over Facebook and whatsapp, ugh. My license isn't even valid and the official lexus dealership won't even sell to me but I wanted a car so bad in that moment I bought it from another place that would. I then also proceeded to go on a $350 target run just because i got my first salary. On top of that, I online shopped at my workplace. Major regrets now.
In two weeks, he broke up with me. Since I was manic, i got very sad and very angry because every emotion is heightened. I texted all my friends, ""I just got dumped"" only looking for attention. I also texted  another intern who im pretty sure doesn't even like me and thinks I hit on him (I don't) just because I know he's rich. 
We decided to remain good friends, he was very civil about it. I acted absolutely crazy at work after that. I hinted three of our coworkers he broke up with me. That weekend he was supposed to help me move. That's when my low phase started. I didn't show up. I slept through the WHOLE weekend. I overstayed my corporate housing lease. 
This is just the beginning of my major blunder. Because of my major depression, I didn't show up at work on Monday. A coworker texted me at lunch time and I didn't reply. I got embarrassed and didn't show up on Tuesday either. On Tuesday  my phone was blowing up with calls. The whole office was calling me along with the people who handle corporate temporary housing. My boss's boss was visiting from the west coast and he was looking for me. I didn't pick up a single one and just lied in my bed, shaking, paralyzed. He tried emailing me on my personal email and I didn't reply. I proceeded to not go to work the whole week. I was scared that if I leave the house, they'll throw all my things out. I can't move all my things on my own and now I'm too proud and too embarrassed to ask that guy for help.
So basically, I went absolutely AWOL on everyone for a week and didn't return any calls or emails.
I don't want to lose this job. If I do, I will owe the company $10,000 on top of paying  all my rent and car payments.
Im too scared to face my boss's boss, specially because I've done it before once and promised him I won't not show up for work without informing. I wasted a lot of time of a lot of people and I don't think they think I'm a valuable resource anymore. And I'm clearly the running joke of the office, everyone keeps going ""where's she"" :(
Any advice would be helpful. What do I say to my boss? What do I say to my coworkers? Please help me!

TL/DR: I got manic and dated in my workplace, bought a car, shopped for $500. Then got dumped, got  depressed and went AWOL on everyone at work for 1 whole week. Also overstayed my lease. Please help me.

6ks4s5,4,2017-07-02,Who's willing to fight by my side?,bipolarwanderlust,bipolar2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/6ks4s5/whos_willing_to_fight_by_my_side/,"Okay so, I'm new here and I really hope what I'm about to share has some responses because I could use some input.

I was diagnosed with BP2 about two-three months ago. I'm taking equetro which seems to be working (?) I've had some bad depressive episodes where I have self harmed and had strong suicidal thoughts ( I've been told it takes a while for the medicine to have full effect). Anyways.

At first I felt it was kind of a relief to be diagnosed because that way many of the things I was struggling with in life ( I'm a college student, was having a hard time focusing in classes and staying motivated) , now has a root cause and I could fix them. And yeah, it has gotten better and I feel that I will be able to be super stable at some point. My dad has BP2 as well and he lives a completely normal life.

What I have been really struggling with is trying to figure out how much of this, makes part of my personality and decisions I have taken so far.

Am I that outgoing because I genuinely am or am I hypomaniac? Did I sell my car on a whim or do I genuinely care about the environment?

Along with this, I am not originally from the  US and I have been struggling to fit in. Last year I felt I was pretending to like certain things and behaving in certain ways just to fit in. I felt lost and took some time to discover myself. I am still in the process and happy with it. I have also learned to love myself a lot. This last part, has brought some conflict to my life though.

I used to (still have?) have a best friend whom I would be so close with, i would tell people he was like a brother to me. ( I'm a women in case that has not been picked up). We met two years ago and we are from the same country. We are able to connect in a unique way because we have the same culture and went through similar struggle moving to the states.

It was all good and we where every close, he would stay over at my apt and I would at his. We at the time where both single , we would sleep on the same bed and did some things together but we never got romantically involved, I even at some point thought that on paper it sounded like a good possibility but genuinely I just don't see him that way.

When I was diagnosed, I obviously told him. He was supportive and stood by my side as I started to learn about what I was dealing with. This guy was there for me pretty much 24/7. We live a block away, so if I was feeling bad at 3 am he would wake up and open his door for me. He didn't really know how to react to certain things, which I don't blame him, and seemed to be trying to help. I explained how I needed him to read about this to be better at being there for me because many times, during self harm episodes, he would yell at me out of being so nervous that it would make me feel worse and things would go worse too. He did improve a little bit but with time I started to feel he was getting tired of it. Which again, i understand but I was really trying hard. It was a tough spot because somehow i felt guilty of having this disease. I then met a guy, and for the first time in like 3-4 years , I hadn't felt like this before. I had an ex which was pretty serious and even wedding plans where discussed at a relatively short future back in the day. So between that break up and today, I had a hard time getting over him and I wasn't really ready to get I to another relationship.

This new guy showed up, I've gone through the whole loosing myself and loving myself phase, and I feel ready to open up again and trust someone again and really just fall for someone again. 

My best friend though, was not too happy with this. He wasn't the most friendly person when I introduce him to my guy and it took some time for him to kiiiindaa warm up to him. At the same time, my best friend d and I had been fighting more often. I think was a mix of stress from work and school and my bipolar episodes and him feeling very frustrated  about this girl he really liked but wasn't reciprocating feelings with him.

But then things got worse and worse. Our fights started to be quite harsh. We yelled and offended each other in ways we should never have. 

Timing wasn't the best and I moved to another state for a summer internship. Still talking to my guy and my best friend at the time I moved. However, a lot of tension between my best friend and I was growing.

I am a vegetarian, vegan in progress, and I am adapting a minimalist lifestyle which I love. These topics where causing some fights between my best friend and I because I felt he was not respecting my views. He is a jokester so we would make fun of each other but it really starts to bother me to the point where I was not feeling respected. It also got the point where I felt he was just being nice to me in order to keep me around  for whenever he needed someone to tutor him in a math class or simply someone to listen him out.

A big fight started one day when he said he was feeling happier ever since I left. I felt manipulated because he would do this thing where he'd say "" oh I want to tell you something but you are totally going to get mad"" and I would be like ""oh nono tell me I promise I won't get mad"" and then he'd say something like "" yeah I feel better now that I don't have to deal with you here "" and I would ended up feeling guilty for being mad at something that really shouldn't have been said . ( like seriously who says something like that?!). Anyways that's when hell broke and I decided to tell him how for a long time I hadn't feel he was respecting me and I felt used and manipulated. Ready for a fight back, to my surprise, his reaction was "" well, that's in the past so... what else do you want from me"". Rather than owning up to his rude behavior he would justify himself by sharing that we should not focus on the past and just chill. But I deserved an apology and I wanted to talk things out because I had them all bottled up and he just didn't give a fuck. This fight extended a day or two  until a point where I confronted him by saying that lately he has just been stated to be rude to me for no reason and he needed to better communicate to me and explain if I did something to get him so grudgy with me. He said nothing was wrong and he would not waste more time with something that wasn't worthy (our discussion) to what I replied that in that case I would not waste my time more with someone who didn't deserve me.


Three weeks and we haven't talked. Until three days ago.


I decided to have wine and watch a movie with a co worker. She blacked out drinking and I finished two bottles of wine by myself and felt pretty tipsy. As I walked back to my apartment I called my guy. Him and I so far had been doing great, talking everyday, calling each other, even having Skype dates where we would watch movies together. I drunk called him and I was being silly and cute ( from what I remember). We started to argue over a conversation I started by telling him that I was scared I was falling for him to hard. Things got heated and I started to feel very upset. I think I tried to end things and I remember him wanting to say something and me telling him that I didn't want s to hear it and I didn't care about his decision because I was sure that he would not like to be with someone like me.

I hung up with him and the suicidal thoughts started to kick in. I was feeling very stressed. I've been very disappointed at how my best friend simply gave up on our friendship and I blame it on my bipolar episodes. I was scared my guy would end up leaving me too because of that so that's why I thought it would be best if I ended things with him before I got to attached. I have no support system rn besides my family, which don't get my wrong my parents and sister are amazing, but in terms of friends my age I have no one. I am a very social person and I know a lot of people. I always have someone to hangout with and all, but I haven't found a friend which I could really open up to ever since I moved to the US. My best friend that isn't talking to me was that person.

Anyways, in a moment of distress and ashamed to show this bipolar side of me to my guy, whom at this point I've known for almost 3 months and while not official we are being exclusive, I called my best friend. He tried to calm me down and I remember I asked him to tell my parents that I loved them and that I was done. 

I hung up and I went for a kitchen knife. I was about to cut my wrist when I heard his voice asking for me. Apparently I didn't hang up the phone and he was still there in speaker.I sat down in the floor with the knife in my hand trying to fight those impulses in my head. I don't want to die. But I felt this dark inner me was in control. He proceeded to make the call a 3 way call and added my guy to it. They kept asking for me and I didn't reply. I didn't want to move or say anything because I was scared and impulse would take over and I would actually hurt myself. Somehow the call was over. I took the knife and stabbed it against my mattress several times. This allowed me to release the inner rage I had. I feel very uncomfortable with this memory.

Then my dad called. Seems like my best friend had alerted him of the situation. By then the worst was gone, I told my dad I was feeling anxious and bad. Btw I forgot to mention I had been off my meds because I ran out and sending the prescription from my home state has been a hassle. That on top of two bottles of wine was bad. I calmed down, said good night to my dad, called my guy and assured I was fine and went to bed.

To my disappointment my best friend at the next day didn't even text. Seems like he just dealt with me because he had to but didn't seem like he genuinely cared for me, or else he would have asked if I was ok.

The real advice I was looking for starts here .. sorry you guys needed all this info.

I talked to my guy after that night and he expressed that he was not okay with what had happened. He was very scared and would have felt responsable for my death if something like that would have happened. The way he said things made it sound like he wanted to end whatever we had. I was very sad and disappointed and mad at the fact that this guy and I have been talking about how what we have is real, and we care about people, but then the moment a bad moment comes around he wants to quit.

Before I screwed up I said i was mad at what he said and needed to hang up to cool down and discuss things with a clear mind. He agreed and I looked for my roomate for advice. She was great and made me realize of many things.

a) this was probably the first time he had dealt with something like this
B) it was something hard to deal with 
c) being bipolar is part of my life and do I really want to be with someone who can't embrace it or accept it?

Flash forward to a 30 min conversation with her and I call my guy back. I try my best to explain to him that I understand it was scary and that I was sorry he had to go through that with me. I also said that this was not usually this bad but alcohol and no meds made it worse. But I also said I was not excusing myself for something that I have no control over. I explained that for me relationships are very important, and that if it was me in his shoes, I would look for ways to support my significant other. I told him that's what I expect from a relationship , someone who can be there in the good and bad things. We had a nice calm and mature conversation whre he proceeded to tell me that he understands and doesn't want to end things but he also said that if something like this happened again, he would not be able to handle it. He said we wanted to still try things but he wanted me to commit to not drink excessively , take my meds and take any precaution needed to avoid this again. I obviously agreed and thanked him because that's a good influence in my life.

We resumed our happy times and it was all good until today. I still can't shake off that salty feeling of him saying that if it happens again he wouldn't handle it. I told him I can't promise it wouldn't because I'm still learning how to stay stable. But to be honest, it really dissapinted me that even before we had hay mature conversation , his first action was to cop out.

I feel unsure if I should continue things with him because , even thought we have great time together and genuinely it took me 4 years to feel like this with someone, it is a very salty feeling to think that he may not be there for me when I need him. Keep in mind that I told him I don't expect him to be my hero or therapist, but I do need someone to be by my side while I fight this fight.

To where my title ties in. Will I ever find someone who is willing to be there through my dark times? It has been clear hay my best friend couldn't handle it. This guy has stated he is not willing to do it... will I ever find someone who will? Is it unrealistic to expect a non bipolar person to be there for me ?

I feel like wanting to take some distance from my guy because, again, it just really hurt to hear from him that he doesn't want to deal with this kind of situations. I know, who wants to deal with something like this but like, I have bipolar disorder and its not something I can just choose to not have.

Any advice here? Anyone wants to share a similar story?

Sorry for the long post and I appreciate any response "

I was hoping somenody here could help me out with some advice. I've been learning programming by myself for some years now, and I wanted to take it to the next level. My few real life experiences with programming involved some Excel VBA scripts I wrote for a pharmacy department in a hospital where I worked, and a couple simulations and data analysis as part of my PhD courses. I wouldn't consider myself as a good programmer, and I'm sure I lack a lot of polish, but I believe that I've reached a point where I would benefit greatly from working on real projects and getting real feedback from programmers.

It might be too much to ask, but I was hoping that somebody could give me a chance to help out on a real project, as a sort of unpaid internship. I want to be able to eventually offer my services as a freelancer, and have an actual portfolio to showcase.

Regarding the languages, I usually turn to either Python or Javascript when I need to get anything done, but I'm also familiar with C++, C# and Excel VBA. I have dabbled in JQuery, PHP and SQL, but I'm far from experienced with them.

Here are some examples of my scripts, if that helps:

[Python script for AFM Force-distance curve measurements](https://pastebin.com/SDqKdWzj)

[Simple trianlge transform using HTML and Javascript](https://pastebin.com/vTq4hpxq)

[Python script for simple brownian motion simulation](https://pastebin.com/LAjnBcvL)

I'm currently doing research as part of my PhD program, and also working a part-time job to make ends meet, but I can safely assign around two hours daily to this endeavor. I know it's not much, but it's all I can do right now.

I (28) am at the beginning for the Bachelor for Science and want to reach Master of Science as well. I have to do 2 semesters abroad (my campus supports me to do them in america) but they said I can do them anywhere I want, as long I will do the applying stuff by my self.


Well, I have some questions:


0. Would it be possible to study two semesters Bachelor of Science at a university in Cuba?


1. I have to do a 24 weeks internship at any IT company in my fourth semester - Is this doable in Cuba?; Has someone worked for a IT company there and mind share his/her experience?


2. I had two years of school Spanish, so I would prefer English courses. Does anyone know if the semesters are in Cuban Spanish or English?


3. Is it possible to teach computer scientific stuff at a Middle school or High school in Cuba after I got my Master degree? I want to go for a doctorate at this point and in the meantime teaching new technology in Cuba.


have a nice day

6ktc9q,16,2017-07-02,"[No Regrets] I Love Her, but...",robbel,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6ktc9q/no_regrets_i_love_her_but/,"...She needs to get away from her family. She is such a sweet girl and the way her family causes so much psychological pain, is just so unfair. I want to move away and take her with me.

My gf and I met 2 1/2 years ago while we were both interns at a hospital. We are both in the same field, so amongst other things, after a few dates, it was pretty apparent we would be seeing each other for a long time. I love her. We are moving in together in the next few months and then possibly across the country to a different city for a slower pace of life. The problem is, is that she is hesitant to move due to her family and I am SO ready for a change of pace and would move yesterday if I could. Her family is fine, loving people, but I can only tolerate them for a little bit at a time. The mom experienced some psychological trauma as a kid and boy has it rubbed off on her kids, all four of the girls including my gf. Her 3 siblings ALL are extremely anxious and neurotic in so many ways.

Fast forward to last night: We were just talking about moving again, and how to plan for it, and she is SUPER ambivalent about it and played it off and it seems she's less interested than previous conversations. This convo happened on the way up to visit her one sister she is closest with. As I was hanging with her sisters kid, watching transformers, I could hear the two of them arguing in the other room. After an hour or so, she came into the living room crying sat down and said, ""Maybe we should move to xxxxx"". Being the supportive boyfriend I am, I consoled her, but when she said those words, inside me got SOOO excited to hear her say that and couldn't have been more happy! This might be shitty of me, but I feel like I don't need to really try to persuade her into moving anymore and just let her see that the move would be helpful for her to get away from her family, plus, I don't have to see her anxious sisters/mom as much anymore.

Sorry, but not sorry. I think its best for us both to move.

Not a throwaway."

Were you able to find internships and networking opportunities in these organizations?

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES tweeted a 28-second video of himself punching someone whose face is covered by the CNN logo. The altered video is from one of his appearances 10 years ago on WWE.

THE TWEET -- THE PRESIDENT at 9:21 a.m.: “#FraudNewsCNN #FNN” [http://bit.ly/2sfIASR](http://bit.ly/2sfIASR)

LET’S BE CLEAR -- The president has just sent his 33 million followers a video of himself pummeling a man covered by the CNN logo. CNN anchors and reporters -- indeed, anchors and reporters from many media outlets -- have been threatened and harassed. The president tweeted this message from the comfort of his summer golf home in New Jersey, surrounded by Secret Service. Meanwhile journalists are in the field, across the country and the world.

THE WHITE HOUSE keeps telling us the president wants to talk about policy, but the media doesn’t want to cover it. Since June 30, the president has tweeted once about health care -- and it was to suggest a new strategy for Republicans. He has tweeted eight times about the media.

CNN’s FIERY RESPONSE: “It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters. Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied when she said the President had never done so. Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill, he is instead involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office. We will keep doing our jobs. He should start doing his.”

THE WHITE HOUSE did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the tweet.

FROM A D.C. REPUBLICAN: “Lord almighty. It seriously gets worse every day.”

-- @NancyPelosi: “Violence &amp; violent imagery to bully the press must be rejected. This #July4th, celebrate freedom of the press, guardians to our democracy”.

TOM BOSSERT, the president’s homeland security adviser, walked onto Martha Raddatz’s set on ABC’s “This Week” just moments after the tweet posted. Jake showed him the video on his iPhone just as he was walking out of the green room. Raddatz asked him for his reaction on set. “There’s a lot of cable news shows that reach directly into hundreds of thousands of viewers that are really not very fair to the president. So I’m very proud of the president for developing a Twitter and social media platform where he can talk directly to the American people.” He said Trump is the most “genuine president” and “non-politician president” in our time. “No one would perceive that as a threat,” Bossert said.

BUZZFEED: “The edited version of the clip has circulated on Reddit’s r/The\_Donald -- which has become a hub for followers of alt-right, far-right, and Trump supporters -- over the last few days prior to the President tweeting it. It is not clear how the president became aware of the clip.” [http://bzfd.it/2uyuwVv](http://bzfd.it/2uyuwVv)

-- REMEMBER: A few weeks ago, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was shot and he now lays in a Washington hospital recovering. The president, at that time, called for the country to unify. He was roundly praised. Republicans and Democrats said it was time to ratchet down the political rhetoric.

ANA NAVARRO, on “This Week”: “It is an incitement to violence. He is going to get somebody killed in the media. Maybe that will stop him.”

KEEP IN MIND -- Ben Jacobs, a reporter from The Guardian, was recently bodyslammed by a congressional candidate.

BY THE WAY … The man whose face is covered up appears to be Vince McMahon, the husband of Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon. See the original clip from 10 years ago[http://bit.ly/2t5V2Yx](http://bit.ly/2t5V2Yx)

Good Sunday morning. TWO QUOTES THAT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION…

-- BARACK OBAMA in Jakarta, Indonesia, per the AP: “‘I wasn’t worried about what was in the newspapers today,’ former President Barack Obama said Saturday during a nostalgic visit to Indonesia's capital, his childhood home. ‘What I was worried about was, ‘What are they going to write about me 20 years from now when I look back?’” [http://bit.ly/2uxxI3E](http://bit.ly/2uxxI3E)

-- MITCH MCCONNELL, per the AP, in Kentucky: “‘If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!’ Trump wrote early Friday. Later that day, McConnell told reporters after an event in his home state of Kentucky that the health bill was challenging but ‘we are going to stick with that path.’ He added: ‘It’s not easy making America great again, is it?’” [http://bit.ly/2t5w6jF](http://bit.ly/2t5w6jF)

PRESIDENT TRUMP at the “Celebrate Freedom” rally honoring veterans last night at the Kennedy Center: “My administration is transferring power outside of Washington and returning it to where it belongs, the people. The fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them. The people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I’m president and they’re not. … “The fact is the press destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they used the hatchet and the people saw it right from the beginning. ... The dishonest media will not stop us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of the American people. Their agenda is not your agenda.”

-- DESPITE THE BLUSTER, we’d venture to say President Trump has given nearly as many interviews to the New York Times and Washington Post since winning the presidency in November than Barack Obama did in eight years. Right?

-- @maggieNYT: “POTUS used July 4 vets event to attack the press/first amendment: ‘The fact is the press destroyed themselves because they went too far.’”

-- QUICK NOTE: Imagine if Barack Obama used a veterans event to attack the press.

THE NEW WALL STREET JOURNAL -- SAM WALKER, the deputy enterprise editor at the WSJ (@samwalkers): “Are WH attacks on TV media ‘news’? I dunno... These @shaneharris scoops definitely are: [http://on.wsj.com/2sfE2vT](http://on.wsj.com/2sfE2vT) … [http://on.wsj.com/2tyk4QM](http://on.wsj.com/2tyk4QM)”

FOR POSTERITY --@realDonaldTrump at 3:41 p.m.: “My use of social media is not Presidential - it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!”
   
   
IVANKA WATCH -- “When Dad’s the president -- a look inside Ivanka Trump’s complicated world,” by WaPo’s Monica Hesse and Krissah Thompson: “Ivanka Trump’s office: clean, white, quiet. A zone of punctual start times and promptly-offered water bottles, and a conference table at which she conducts meetings. A short, winding walk away from her father’s Oval Office downstairs. She does not necessarily appreciate daily schedules. Neither does her father. When Ivanka needs to see the president, she stops by. When he needs to see her, he calls. When he wants her opinion, he asks for it and she gives it, but without expectation that it will be followed.She sees her role as not to persuade, but to inform and support ...

“Anyone who has invested in her the ability to change her father clearly doesn’t understand the dynamic that has always governed their relationship and also the dynamic of a president and his staff. After all, she works for him. ... When she disagrees with her dad, she asks herself whether the issue was a campaign promise or not. If it was, she readily suppresses her own wishes. She believes that doing otherwise would undermine what the American people voted for. She asks herself why her opinion is more right than the 46 percent of the country who put her father in office.” [http://wapo.st/2tzSAKq](http://wapo.st/2tzSAKq)

NOTHING TO SEE HERE -- “With health bill looming, senators aren’t rushing into the July Fourth spotlight,” by WaPo’s Paul Kane: “Sen. Susan Collins will celebrate the Fourth of July within view of the Canadian border, at a remote northeastern Maine town’s annual parade. Sen. Lisa Murkowski will appear on the other end of the continent in an old timber town on an isolated Alaskan island. These two Republican senators, critical swing votes in the debate over health-care legislation, are not exactly rushing into the public spotlight to engage their constituents on the controversial plan and their own decision-making about the proposal.

“Then again, at least they have released information about where they will be. That’s more than most Senate Republicans have done at the start of a 10-day break wrapped around the nation’s Independence Day celebration. This creates the belief among liberal activists that Republicans are trying to hide, which in turn primes every public moment to become that much more confrontational.” [http://wapo.st/2tzSYZ9](http://wapo.st/2tzSYZ9)

-- W.H. LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR MARC SHORT ON TIMING, to JOHN ROBERTS on “Fox News Sunday”: “Well, look, we’ve gone through a long process in the House and got it completed and passed in the House. We now are in the Senate where there’s been obviously a lot of procedural delays in this process. We are at the point of scoring two separate bills throughout the course of this recess this week. So, we hope that we come back the week after recess, we'll have a vote.”

WHAT BRAD PARSCALE IS READING -- “Pro-Trump Twitter operatives market paid tweets,” by Shawn Musgrave: “From the moment he declared his candidacy, President Trump commanded legions of online followers. Now, having helped win the White House, factions of self-made social media operatives are redirecting their skills and infrastructure to promote other candidates nationwide. Some are even vying to spin their experiences from the presidential race into new business models, seeking to promote other candidates by paying pro-Trump Twitter users to tweet and retweet scripted messages. Pro-Trump tweeters say they deserve at least partial credit for defeating Hillary Clinton, as well as for the string of Republican victories in recent special elections. A handful are pursuing paid gigs from aspiring conservative politicians, pitching their organized -- and often secretive -- follower networks to ‘America First’ candidates willing to pay.

“It’s an unproven concept, one viewed with skepticism from established campaign veterans and with varying levels of disdain from those who tweet Trump’s virtues for free. After all, Twitter derives its power from authentic, grass-roots messaging. But pay-to-tweet enthusiasts say they’re selling the future of social media strategy, and that candidates won’t have any choice but to pay.” [http://politi.co/2tEmwFV](http://politi.co/2tEmwFV)

MAUREEN DOWD in the NYT: “Cruella de Trump”: “The 71-year-old president’s pathological inability to let go of slights; his strongman reflex to be the aggressor and bite back like a cornered animal, without regard for societal norms; his lack of self-awareness about the power he commands and the proportionality of his responses; his grotesque hunger for flattery and taste for Tony Soprano tactics; his Pravda partnership with David Pecker, the head honcho at The National Enquirer, which has been giving Trump the Il Duce treatment while sliming his political opponents, the ‘Morning Joe’ anchors and Megyn Kelly -- these are all matters that should alarm men and women equally.

“Trump has moved his shallow kiddie wading pool of gossip and ridicule from Trump Tower to the White House, where it is so outlandishly out of place that it often feels like we have a Page Six reporter as our president. … Before he got to D.C., Trump was used to media that could be bought, sold and bartered with. He is not built for this hostile environment and it shows in his deteriorating psychological state. Even though he’s in the safest space of all, he’s not in a safe space.” [http://nyti.ms/2tye4rz](http://nyti.ms/2tye4rz)

THE WHITE HOUSE appears to be putting more of their aides on television to talk about the president’s agenda. They had Tom Bossert, the president’s homeland security adviser, on ABC and Marc Short, the president’s legislative affairs director, on Fox. The Trump administration has had no one on the Sunday shows on many occasions. A few weeks ago, Trump’s attorney Jay Sekulow went on the shows.

SUNDAY BEST -- HHS SECRETARY TOM PRICE to NBC’S CHUCK TODD on “MEET THE PRESS” -- TODD: “I’m just asking you as a father. If your son tweeted about a woman like that, what would you say to him?” PRICE: “Chuck, you know, this is really remarkable. You’ve got incredible challenges across this nation, incredible challenges around the world. The challenge that I've been given is to address the health care issues. And your program, a program with the incredible history of Meet the Press, and that’s what you want to talk about?” TODD: “I don’t.” PRICE:“Let me suggest to you that the American people want to talk about the challenges.”

TODD: “Mr. Secretary, I don’t. Mr. Secretary, with all due respect, you’re blaming me for what the president of the United States has spent his entire week focused on?” PRICE: “No. Listen to me, with all due respect. The American people are concerned about a health care system that is not providing choices, where premiums are going up, where insurance companies are vacating markets all across this land. And that’s what they want us to concentrate on. And that’s what they want us to fix. And that’s what I and the president are working on.”

TWO INTERESTING BITES FROM JAKE TAPPER’S interview of SEN. BEN SASSE (R-NEB.) on CNN’s “STATE OF THE UNION” …

-- CANCEL AUGUST RECESS: “Let's bring everybody into the room. Let’s do this full-time 18 hours a day, six days a week. Let’s cancel the August state work period, and let’s do it in full public view and have hearings and get to work on something that works better than Obamacare. We pledged that, and the American people deserve that.”

-- NO ANSWER ABOUT A 2020 CHALLENGE TO TRUMP: TAPPER: “So, senator, you're not taking that advice. In fact, you’re going to be crossing the Missouri on Friday, going to Iowa and speaking at the Judge Joseph Story Dinner. Is there any chance that you will challenge President Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020?”

SASSE: “Well, first of all, let’s be clear why I’m going to be in Iowa this weekend. I don’t want to admit it anywhere, let alone on national TV, but Nebraska lost to Iowa last year in a football game, and I lost a bet. So, I have to drive Uber in Iowa next weekend. So, that’s the reason I’m going to be in Iowa. It’s about Hawkeyes and Huskers’ bloodletting on the football field and the aftermath of that. But I don’t know who that guy is in your segment, but here’s what I believe.

“I believe that, on the Fourth of July weekend, we ought to have every kid in America having their moms and dads and aunts and uncles and grandmas and grandpas getting together and saying, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal, that they’re endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

“That’s what America is about. It’s not about Republicans and Democrats who have important differences on policy screaming at each other that the other side wants to kill somebody. Politics are subordinate to the things that are supposed to unite Americans. And this is a weekend that we should be celebrating all that.”

JOHN ROBERTS talks with SEN. JOE MANCHIN (D-W.VA.) on “FOX NEWS SUNDAY” -- “Manchin: Dems want to work with Trump on health care,” by Connor O’Brien: “Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin on Sunday said members of his party are willing to work with Republicans and President Donald Trump to find a bipartisan solution on health care. ... ‘I want him to know there are Democrats that want to work with him,’ Manchin said. ‘But right now, they can’t even repeal it. They can’t get 50 votes to repeal it because somebody’s getting hurt more than what they’re willing to sign on to.’ ‘Look at some of us. Work with us Democrats who are willing to meet you in the middle, who have always been willing to meet you in the middle,’ Manchin said.” [http://politi.co/2tF5tnp](http://politi.co/2tF5tnp)

JOHN DICKERSON talks with SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UTAH) on CBS's ""FACE THE NATION: DICKERSON: ""If Republicans can't agree on a replacement option at the moment why would they be able to agree on one in the future?"" LEE: ""Well, if we adopted a measure, if we passed a measure repealing Obamacare, and put a delayed implementation measure in there. With the understanding that at that point after passing the repeal measure we would undertake the step by step process of deciding what comes next. I think it's easier, sometimes when you lump too many things into one piece of legislation, you doom its likelihood of success and I fear that that might be where we are today and i think that explains a lot of what President Trump was talking about in his tweet the other day. What Senator Sasse mentioned in his series of communications on Friday and I think it’s very much worth considering, it’s consistent with what I thought would be better, a more likely to succeed legislative strategy over the last six months.""

REMEMBER THIS GUY? -- “Christie adds government shutdown to his legacy: The move comes after New Jersey lawmakers failed to pass a budget by the annual deadline,” by New Jersey Playbooker Matt Friedman: “Chris Christie is heading into his final six months as governor presiding over New Jersey’s biggest government crisis in more than a decade: A shutdown that will literally turn the lights out in Trenton. New Jersey lawmakers failed to pass a budget by the annual deadline at midnight last night, and Christie promptly issued an order sparking the closure of government offices and services deemed non-essential. State parks and beaches will likely be closed this morning, just in time for the holiday, as will motor vehicle offices. Courts could be closed come Monday. Tens of thousands of state government employees will be furloughed. …

“‘It’s all going to come down to when folks get up tomorrow for the July 4th weekend and drive down to Island Beach State Park to spend the day and a sign says it’s closed,’ said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ‘They’re going to blame Gov.

THE CABINET -- NYT A1, “E.P.A. Chief Voids Obama-Era Rules in Blazing Start,” by Coral Davenport (online headline: “Counseled by Industry, Not Staff, E.P.A. Chief Is Off to a Blazing Start”): “In the four months since he took office as the Environmental Protection Agency’s administrator, Scott Pruitt has moved to undo, delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules, a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency’s 47-year history, according to experts in environmental law. Mr. Pruitt’s supporters, including President Trump, have hailed his moves as an uprooting of the administrative state and a clearing of onerous regulations that have stymied American business. Environmental advocates have watched in horror as Mr. Pruitt has worked to disable the authority of the agency charged with protecting the nation’s air, water and public health.” [http://nyti.ms/2svjtzB](http://nyti.ms/2svjtzB)

The latest move would involve greatly reducing publication of its print newspaper in Europe … That includes eliminating free copies and reducing hotel distribution deals that are not profitable.

SPOTTED IN NANTUCKET: Greta Van Susteren and John Coale walking on the island’s Straight Wharf dock on Friday night.

OUT AND ABOUT IN THE HAMPTONS -- LALLY WEYMOUTH held her annual summer party last night at her house in Southampton. There was a long gold carpet entrance from where the parking was to a big tent next to her house. She served champagne, rare filet, fried chicken, cornbread, a big chocolate cake, ice cream and cookies decorated as American flags. Brother Don Graham did a big tribute to toast Lally (whose birthday is tomorrow) and shouted out Steven Spielberg’s upcoming film about how Ben Bradlee and Katharine Graham challenged the government for the right to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971 (Tom Hanks is playing Bradlee and Meryl Streep is playing Graham). Don made a big deal that Spielberg was there and jokingly conceived a Spielberg movie about Lally and described the cast (some actors and some in the room).

Things may be a bit awkward because I never really dated or been with anyone...period. But I'm trying to break out of my shell more. 

I'm currently an IT student with the chance of getting an internship soon within the following weeks. I'm a bit nerdy, a gamer, and quite a big anime fan. I am also laid back with a dry sense of humor. What I'm looking for is someone probably just as nerdy or more outgoing. Generally, a fun and nice person."
6kumiz,15,2017-07-02,ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS A RACKET,Chemspiration,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6kumiz/illegal_immigration_is_a_racket/,"The reasons nothing ever gets done about illegal immigration;

The left wants to keep illegal immigration going because more people on welfare, more people burdening our healthcare system and more people ""seeking a better life"" is good for their emotional policy platform. To democrats and leftists, it's all about kickbacks and image. Government programs for illegal immigrants cost taxpayers massive amounts of money which go to private companies who then kickback funds to Democrat officials and everyone except the taxpayer wins. They get to shout down opposition as being ""xenophobic"" and ""racist"" touting their moral superiority which herds the left's sheeple into a moral dilemma where they are told that paying more taxes helps those people seek a better life. Behind the scenes, democrats are paying themselves in the form of campaign donations using the very money that is supposed to help those people. But here's the thing, republicans have secretly agreed to go along with this because it enables them to use their own for-profit backers to do the same.

Republicans make their money and bolster their image by publicly opposing illegal immigration. They claim these people are violent criminals (stats show they by and large are not) and so use the image of an impasse on border security to pass things like mandatory minimums and run deportation schemes where their private prison backers can then make vast sums of money off of the taxpayers and take kickbacks just like the democrats do for their campaigns. Again, everybody wins except the ordinary taxpayer. 

Republican establishment types don't actually care about stopping illegal immigration and democrats certainly don't care about helping people. It's all about power and maintaining the power structure that enables them to have never held a job outside of public office except being a staffer or an intern. People like this are a small part of the swamp, but it's also got a lot to do with private industry swamp creatures. And to be sure, the sheeple on the right buy into it all the same.

The clear solution is to both build a wall and grant amnesty to every person who is illegal this side of the border the day it is completed. We give them 30 days to come clean and after that being undocumented results in immediate deportation and a bar from ever being allowed on American soil again. We pass a comprehensive set of reforms that severely punish business owners who hire illegal aliens with felony crimes and also enable the taxpayers to seek recourse against those companies for doing so as well in the form of job discrimination criminal lawsuits. Essentially, we say that if you hire illegals, your business goes under. Such a solution also means illegals can no longer take advantage of reduced tuition and scholarships and all of them must pay their taxes under threat of being audited and garnished just like every other American citizen. 

Amnesty in this case does not necessarily mean citizenship, but it does mean we grant permanent residence status. In addition to the aforementioned possible solutions, we also have a period of harsh penalties for anyone crossing the border illegally while the wall is being built such as complete forfeiture of any and all assets on American soil coupled with jail time for the duration of the wall building timeframe wherein upon its completion everyone caught during such a period is deported. 

It would be essential to do all of this concurrently and to pass these measures concurrently. 

Of course the elite class of the swamp will never go along with this so it is up to us, the taxpayer, to do it ourselves at the ballot box. We did it by electing Trump. We can and will do it in 2018 I'd we remain vigilant. The very first step, however, is to back Trumps voter fraud investigation with memes like never before and to force the passing of voter ID laws using whatever civil means we have left. 

It's going to be a fight pedes, but the solution is clear. Please comment your thoughts if you would like to debate this. My knowledge is but a snippet of what is out there so let's take our might as meme warriors and true defenders of our nation and apply it to this issue. If we win on this, the swamp gets drained and our nation once again becomes the beacon of true freedom, true progress and true humanist values. I love my country and I know you all do too. Bless the United States and its citizenry. Fuck the deep state and fuck Congress. They are not and never will be on our side. That constitution is what we must use to win and win we shall. The founders engrained winning into our blood. So let's do right by them and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!"

**Alternate Friends Title** - The One Where Everyone Yells

**Random Thoughts**

- Ellis with those zingers straight to Meredith’s heart!
- Aw, Karev just wants some breakfast. That was cold, Bailey.
- Bailey is appealing to my sense of justice this episode (even though I feel her anger is a little personal).
- Mark misses being Derek’s buddy. :-(
- Izzie sticking up to Mark. I’m digging that.
- Meredith helped deliver her niece. 
- Oh, this girl is in love with non-glasses twin.
- I love everything about this conjoined twins story line. 
- Izzie’s mad because she feels like she and Cristina are on the same level but Cristina still gets to scrub in. Hmmm, I’m not sure about my thoughts on that.
- The actor who play’s George’s dad is really good.
- I love George and Burke’s friendship. It is definitely strained right now, but it’s clear they still care about each other.
- Bailey’s pep talk to Derek. Heart eyes. In my opinion, Derek is his most likable around Bailey.
- Meredith is good on family. Doesn’t need anymore. LOL. Then, they all just start coming out of the woodwork.
- **Season 13 Spoiler/Mini Rant:** After watching the earlier seasons, I’m having a really hard time with why all the attendings have trouble with Minnick’s philosophy on how to teach interns/residents. Yang is basically doing surgeries solo (with Burke watching from the sidelines) her first year as an intern. Maybe I’m more opinionated about this because I am a teacher, but I know my kiddos learn a lot more when they do the work than me just babbling or showing them how to do it. I have no problem with what Minnick was trying to implement. HOW she tried to implement and her as a person highly annoyed me but that’s a whole other story. That’s why I think the whole drama amongst the attendings because of her was so stupid. I hated how they were attacking each other over so-called “loyalty.” Letting the interns/residents be more hands on during procedures was just the right thing to do. You can still love and look up to people (cough Webber cough) while realizing they’re wrong. It didn’t have to be such a divisive thing. The writing in season 13 was just the worst. 
- Meredith’s stepmom actually seems really nice.
- Cristina getting on that elevator with Burke is giving me all the feels.







**Tearjerker Moment**

- Papa O’Malley pouring his heart out to George.




**Quotes**

- “If you three thumb suckers don't stop whining I swear I will not show you what's behind this door. And trust me. You want to see what's behind this door.”
- “I have two brothers. I feel their pain.”
- “I passed the torch to you and you blew it out!”
- “Georgie does not work here in this hospital! My name is Dr. O’Malley!”
- “If you want me to respect you, you have to do something worth respecting.” - motto of my life 
- “Sometimes that invasion of personal space...it can be exactly what you need.”


**Questions**


- What do you think should have happened to Cristina and Burke or do you agree with Webber’s decision?
- Why do you think Meredith doesn’t want to get to know her other family? Loyalty to her mom? Feeling hurt and betrayed by her dad?

6kw2x8,3,2017-07-02,Switch from Computer Science to Management Information Systems or Information Technology?,zenix97,computers,https://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/6kw2x8/switch_from_computer_science_to_management/,"So I'm a junior transfer student at University of Florida currently in my under grad pursuing a degree in Computer Science in the college of engineering. I've completed all of my Math courses required for CS. I just have two years of core courses and a few electives. Ever since I started college was aim was to become a Systems Analyst (Computer Systems Analyst/Business Systems Analyst). Navie as I was, I decided to go with Computer Science. I powered through all my math classes, I took entry level Java &amp; C++. I didn't struggle with them, intact I was ahead of most people. I don't hate program nor do I enjoy it. To put it on a scale, I dislike it but not much. However, I like the idea of relaying information to developers, creating queries, databases, etc. I like the people interaction. I don't see my self infront of a cheap monitor everyday with a disorganized office. I thought the typical Software Developer's office would be better since it'll be the place you'll spend majority of your career there. Realistically I'm not expecting to get into a great company at the starting of my career. So here are the options I formulated. Switch to MIS and minor in CS. Thing is I'm not confident about landing a job as an Analyst with a MIS degree. I'm afraid the CS candidates will get priority over me. Although I feel like MIS would better prepare me for the work field that I'm interested in. Secondly, major in IT and minor in CS. I'm not a fan of this one. It's an option but I'm neutral about it. The last option is to major in CS and minor in Business Administration. I'm second in favor of this, however like I said, I wouldn't feel prepared for the work force. I'm afraid I'll have to learn everything while I'm on the job, I get that's the point of internships, but with this option, I would have no foundation except the technical ones from CS. Lastly my thing to consider as a deciding factor, the core hard classes like operating systems, data structures, etc are shying me away from CS. I heard they're extremely hard. I'm not a hard worker, I just happened to be good at math. I think my knack for these courses won't last long. I rather the MIS route with a minor in Computer Science or Business Administration. As mentioned before, I'm just afraid I'll be unemployed or under employed. I don't mind taking a semester or two to get the 18 credits out of the way for MIS. I'm 19 years old, to me it's not a major set back. What are your thoughts?"
6kw6wh,6,2017-07-02,"Combining shrooms, meth and manic depression: case study of a really bad idea.",icequeen15,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6kw6wh/combining_shrooms_meth_and_manic_depression_case/,"This happened to me something like 6-8 months ago. Something just reminded me of it today and I thought I'd sit down and write out the whole experience. Hopefully it illustrates the importance of being in a good state of mind before using shrooms (or psychedelics in general probably).

Never again would I want the disconnect from reality that ensued. I feel so bad that my SO (fiance then, now husband) had to sober up real fast just to take care of me of the blubbering idiot junkie on his couch.
 
So, my husband and I had done shrooms twice before, and both times had a blast and felt better for a while after too. It had been a few months, and we both had a free weekend so we decided to do it again. I took about 3 grams, him about 3.5 and things started out going smoothly. We listened to music and laid on the carpet watching the ceiling kaleidoscope and talking about our good feelings and love of music. 
 
Then, the song Blackbird, by the Beatles came on. For whatever reason, it made me think of my grandma (who was bipolar like me), who had died by jumping off a bridge the previous year. When it happened, I was in NYC for a summer internship, so my parents when offered to fly me back for her funeral, which she asked me to sing at before she died. I didn’t go. I didn’t want to miss any of my internship. I buried both the regret for this and the grief itself, but it all came out when that song started playing. I have no idea how much time I spent curled up against an ottoman sobbing. I literally used every tissue and napkin in the house on this day, mostly at this point. As the cryfest progressed, I moved from thinking about my grandma, to thinking about that whole side of my family. I told my husband about my fear that even though I couldn’t imagine why, I would someday take my own life like so many family members have done/tried to do. He consoled me some, but then he started going off into his own world of thinking about his childhood (this was making him very happy and I didn’t mind because I wanted some time to myself to cry it out a little more.) 
 
But then another wave hit and I got thinking about my own depression. Apparently I kept repeating “I’m so sad. Just so sad. Why am I so sad? I miss her. I’m so sad.” I remember feeling the gaping cavern in my chest where someone else was supposed to be desperately. I couldn’t tell whether it was for my grandma or for my other self, the happy, stable me. Maybe both.
 
After I cried my tears (though not the last tears of the night) over the death of my grandma and my past self, I went to the bathroom to wipe my face and pee. I saw myself in the mirror and I looked like death. Like a horribly strung out junkie, who'd take another hit even if it was guaranteed death, maybe even because it was. My smeared mascara on my cheeks started swirling around and off of my face like evil serpents, and my eyes pupils felt like they were heavy, pulling my eyeballs deeper into my skull. The mascara demons twisted around each other and glared at me from the mirror, but I couldn’t look away. They were part of me.
 
You see, I was addicted to meth at the time and was in denial.
 
I was even on some during this trip (50 mg +/-? Idk I was an eyeballer). The day before I had even promised myself not to use on the day of tripping in order to avoid exactly the kind of thing that happened next. Self-fulfilling prophecy there I guess.
 
There was no way to stop the paranoia that hit then. My meth abuse was a secret from my SO, and the severity of it a secret to myself. Hell, I still couldn’t bring myself to say the word “addict” until after I confessed and made my man hide the stash from me. Anyway, I was terrified he would find out, and almost more terrified that I had already lost control of myself. The secret burned a hole in my soul.
 
I couldn’t hide what I was feeling physically, though. For the rest of the trip, I oscillated between thinking I was having a heart attack, that my hands and feet were going to fall off, that my skin was turning purple and black and sliding away in bloody chunks, that my hands were swelling and going to explode, that my fingers would get so cold they’d turn to ice (pun intended), that my hair was falling out, and that I was going dig holes through my body (even though I had no urge to do so haha). I felt like I was going to pass out, and that if I did I would die. I almost wish I did pass out, so I wouldn’t have had to endure however long this state lasted. 
 
Because the meth problem was a secret from my SO, I just kept asking him vaguely if I looked okay, if my hands were a normal color, if I looked like I was going to die. He always said I looked fine, asked me to explain more, but I never did. Because he was trying his best to help, he thought he'd play some happy-sounding music that he knows I love. So he put on ""Semi-charmed life"" by Third Eye Blind. Normally that song has me smiling and dancing like I'll live forever, but at that point it was the worst possible thing (think about the lines, ""doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break/ it won't stop/ I won't come down/ I keep stock ..."" kinda hard to listen to that and ignore your own problem when you are in a state with no walls to hide from yourself). So I hid, and cried, and believed I would die. He was confused and hurt because he was only trying to help. I thought my fingers were swelling and falling off, so I yanked off my rings and dropped them haphazardly onto the table, even my engagement ring. That hurt him even more, but he didn't say so. 
 
I tried to act normal. I felt like I was passing out but tried my best to actually enjoy the ceiling kaleidoscope made from the shadowy peripherals I'd gotten used to recently. I knew that was of course a hallucinate, and a pretty innocuous one at that, but the feelings in my body were terrifying. I'd done mushrooms before and knew that it confused bodily sensations with feeling sometimes (in a previous trip, I started feeling a sadness which was relieved by simply burping). I tried using the bathroom, drinking, and having a snack to stop the impending death. I tried to rationalize that these feelings of serious physical problems must be hallucinations. But I couldn't stop the paranoia about limb pain and heart trouble stemming from the very real fact that I'd been abusing meth daily for months. I couldn't say any of this. 
 
Keeping my secret was more important than getting help. Towards the end, I just had to lay on the couch with a blanket, fearing that if I fell asleep I would die, that if I got off the couch my legs would collapse, that even if I survived this I would surely kill myself anyway. 
 
I just laid on that couch and completely lost touch with reality. I have a mental illness, and I feared that I had just set off a permanent descent into true insanity. Time didn’t move in a linear way, and I couldn't trust my own mind or body. The only thing I knew was real was the hand of my husband clinging to mine. He was my tether to Earth. He dialed up 911 but didn't press call because I asked him not to. That struck more fear in me than death. I didn't want to get police or paramedics involved. 
 
If I died, so what. I didn't deserve to live.
 
As the mushrooms wore off, I calmed down to the baseline shakiness of both meth and ""surviving a near-death experience."" Slowly the almighty amphetamine cheer returned to chase away the fear and guilt. 
 
But when I sobered up (down?) later, the whole experience made me realize I was lying to myself about everything. I was burying my fear of succumbing to the same illness that made my grandma finally jump. I was lin an impressive state of denial about my addiction. And lying to myself meant lying to my (future)husband, who I knew would love me and want to help, but would leave me first because he couldn't be with a someday-suicidal junkie.
 
So, I guess in the end it was good for me and I'm ""glad"" it happened because it made me face my problems. However, I would never wish the fear of death or the feeling of total insanity from that trip on my worst enemy. 
 
**TLDR:** More so than any other drugs, don’t mix psychedelics with lies.

Sorry for the novel haha

Looking for opinions.,3_putt_for_10,golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/6kwds5/looking_for_midhandicap_irons_looking_for_opinions/,"So I've always been familiar with golf and played a lot one year in middle school and have played about one time a summer until last year. Got an internship that paid enough for me to buy clubs and start to golf more. 

I started off probably 30-35 handicap with Ping G25's and have gotten it down to 15-20. (I don't have an official number but I shoot low 90's-mid to high 80's.) I got lessons and my coach said I should look into more of a players iron and he had me hit the Apex and Steelhead pros. I hit the heavier iron much better but my mis hits were much more apparent. Today I tried the Mizuno Mp H5 just to see what I could do with them (I didn't expect great results). I struggled to get distance with them and I think they're (obviously) too much of a players iron for me right now. 

Anyways, I have my good days where my ball striking is almost too good (if that is a thing) for my ""super game improvement"" irons (launches superrrrr high and if there is wind it just hangs out and I have to guess at what club to use. Even if I try to keep it low and move the ball back, etc. it is very hard to keep it low). I still have my bad days where I shank a few and hit a lot of thin shots. 

Anyhow, I want to move into a mid handicap/players/game improvement iron...any suggestions on sets I could get for ~400 or less (used, older models obviously)? 

Thanks everyone"

I had been promising to visit Rick (the boyfriend) since he had moved to the country about a year ago, as Me and Rick had been friends since before my friendship with Linda started it was a super normal situation.
Linda and him have been doing long distance as she was first on study exchange and is currently on internship, so its probably been over a year.
Through out this time they ave maybe seen each other for a span of a month or two, and I've maybe seen her 3 times.
As me and Rick chatted about the good old times, current drama in the friend group, my ex(whom is Lindas brother), we landed on the topic of Linda.
Me and Linda had grown apart as we lived in different parts of the country, I felt as though I was putting so much into the friendship, being there whenever she needed me for anything and getting  no effort in return so as I reached a turning point I decide to stop and so I would only text once or twice a month to made sure everything was going okay, but the friendship still felt different.
I explained all of this to Rick, how i felt that we've grown apart and that I cant really consider her a 'best' friend anymore due to it all feeling so odd.
surprisingly he had been going through similar feelings, saying he felt that he was too young (being 20) to be waiting and I quote 'with his dick in his hand' for someone he barely gets a chance to talk to anymore.
we started drinking at his house, but 3 beers in we decided to head out to a bar.
we sat and talked for over 2 hours about how sex deprived we were as he was convinced that when I headed back home I would start hooking up with my ex, I denied that possibility, we laughed, we complained and it all just felt so platonic.
He then suggested we check out the club scene, we headed straight to the bar and started taking shot and we continued to drink.
As we started dancing I felt us continuing to push the line, I felt his hand around my waist as I continued to harshly grind on him, ending up giving him a lap dance as his hand laid on my crotch..

around 2:30am we decided to start heading home, he told me to come to his place and then he would drive me to the train station.
So we got to his place and he convinces me to shot this new whiskey he got.
we head down to get the car, and as hes driving his hand starts traveling over my tits and crotch.
""We're crossing the line"" I say to which he replied ""We've already crossed it""
All he needed to say was ""suck it"", and I was unbuttoning his jeans and sucking him off has he drove,
no resistance, no restraint.
He pulled in to an alley and parked the car, took of my shirt and was kissing me all over.
""jump to the back"" he groaned in to my ear
and I did.
he followed pulling of my jeans and his, as he was going down on me I pulled his shirt off and again he was back to my tits kissing and sucking, as I moaned.
He sat up straight and I climbed on his lap and rode him as if there was no tomorrow, he fucked me in positions I didn't know were possible in the back of a car. it lasted for over an hour.
As we climbed back in front and drove to the train station, all we kept repeating to each other was how the night never happened and how no one can know.
The next morning  he texted saying that as much as the night never happened how good of a fuck it was and that he really needed that, he raved about my boobs and I raved about how long he could last.
He asked if he needed to get me a morning after, to which i told him I had already taken one.

To conclude, 
While this might have been the hottest fuck of my life it will most likely be marked as the biggest mistake of my teen years.
I'm filled with guilt but still turned on by the idea of him which makes me feel even guiltier.
This was a one time thing, and it can never be spoken about again and I know that i am the one who's made this mistake and I'm going to have to live with it.

As I cant speak of this to anyone else, I wanted to share it here, I want to be judged, I deserve to be.

Ive decided to continue to grow apart from Linda and just let it stay as a fond pre-college memory 
and I hope to be able to maintain my friendship with Rick even though I know it could never be the same.
the last couple of days we've continued to speak as if it never happened which gives me hope.

signing out,
Girl filled with regret

I’m a 25 years old hardworking and ambitious dreamer. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering (second class lower) but I don’t enjoy the discipline so I switched careers to software/web development (self-taught developer with no certificate), which I enjoy and like very much.

Here is my situation, I live somewhere in Africa and finding a decent job has been very, very difficult for me. In truth, I have applied for more than a 100 jobs (including internships) in the past 4 months and still unemployed. I even went as far as begging some of these companies to employ me as an intern and offer me something little to cover my transportation and feeding.

I’ve tried my best to find a job and change my situation, but am tired already and frustrated with the situation of things here and the hardship in my country. The only thing I could think of right now is to move abroad, possibly NZ and maybe marry a kiwi girl, get a job, have kids in a country where I can guarantee my kids a better future and live a peaceful life after. Yes I want to run away from my country.

I wish I could emigrate to NZ as I know life is much, much better in NZ, and maybe do a post graduate diploma or master’s degree in web development, but I’m not financially capable to handle that or know anyone in NZ who could guide me on what steps to take.  That is why I came here to seek for positive opinions.

Now that you must have understood my situation, here is my question. Is it possible to find employment in NZ, maybe in a mine, farm or anywhere, where I can work for some time, save up some money and further my education in NZ? 

Are there immigration agencies that can help me emigrate to NZ and I repay with commission after I must have settled?

Thank you for reading

I have no friends and stay home all day. Ever since I’ve graduated college in May 2016, I’ve pretty much had trouble seeing how I could ever become a normal adult. I’ve never had a job before, which sucks because even if I wanted to get a job now, they’ll look and me and wonder “how the fuck have you gone this long without having a job”. Even so, I don’t think I have the social skills to be able to have a job and not make a fool of myself. 

I was supposed to go to med school, it was my dream but I fucked it up because I was too shy to apply for internships and research positions. On top of this, I let my depression get the best of me and my gpa ended up being a 3.0 which, according to med schools, sucks. 

I feel like I’m stuck in this catch 22 of not being able to have a normal social life because I don’t have social skills and not being able to develop social skills because I don’t have a social life. The older I get, the more I fear it’ll only get worse. I’ll Wake up one day and I’ll be 49 years old, still living with my parents and still never having gotten a job or made any friends. I’m letting what’s supposed to be the best years of my life pass me by and I’m never gonna get it back. I don’t know how to wake up every morning only to have reality hit me in the face that I’m a loser with no life, that I’ll never have the chance to experience “young love” or going out and partying with friends. I just don’t see how things will ever change for me. I don’t feel like a man: I still feel like a teenager without any sense of responsibility. Hell, my little brother is 17 and he has a group of friends, drives, has a job,  and will probably get a gf before I do. My parents and siblings all compare me to him and ask why I don’t “go out more” or “be more like (little brother)”. 

I just don’t know what to do to fix my timidness about going out and experiencing life. Hell, I have had my drivers license since I was 18 but I didn’t even use it once ever since I passed my drivers test because I’ve been to afraid to drive on the road because I’m afraid I have too shitty a driver to be on the road. Plus, not having a social life I don’t have anywhere to drive anyway. There’s also the issue that I don’t have a car that’s mine, given that I don’t have a job, that I can drive without fear of ruining someone else’s car (my parents and/or siblings cars). 
I just wish I knew how to be like those other guys that are just naturally confident and know how to just experience life. With me, every little thing is a mountain to climb and it makes me feel like a pathetic excuse for a man. I’m jealous of other guys that can just walk up to a girl and be confident that if things escalate he can handle the date, the sex, and just social situations in general. I can’t seem to do that. 
For starters I have no confidence in my appearance or my ability to handle being alone one on one with a girl. It scares me to death that even if I managed to attract a girl, once we are alone on the date I won’t be able to hold the conversation, and even if I make it past that, what if it escalates to sex and I’m so anxious that I’m not able to even get it up. How fucking emberassingw will that be. It’s even worse that I’m 23 and most girls expect a guy my age to have at least some experience in this area. 

How will I ever get over these things? I haven’t been able to in the past so how the hell am I supposed to change my entire personality to be able to get over hear things?it all feels so hopeless, like I’ll never be cut out for this life. A lot of you guys here may not have luck with woman but at least you guys try. You try because you know you’d be able to handle it once it happens because you’re not a timid man-child like me. 

Anyways, Sorry for this jumbled mess I guess I’m just writing the thoughts as they come to me. "
6kwqg7,5,2017-07-02,emotions+hormones+menopause maybe?=ugh (this will be long...),couthycouthy,xxketo,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/6kwqg7/emotionshormonesmenopause_maybeugh_this_will_be/,"Hi ladies--

I've posted on the keto sub before, just lurked here, but feel like this topic is more lady-centric.  I hope it's ok to be a bit open!--typing all this out is kind of therapeutic and WOW do I need it.  Sometimes you just need sisters!!!

Stress has always been my main trigger for eating/gaining, and the past couple of months have been majorly stressful.  I've been eating keto and loving it, but noticed myself eating when I'm not hungry (and even though it was keto-friendly, that doesn't help w/weight loss or treating my body well), and then it was like I pretty much said F*ck it and just went crazy.  So I've gained about 15 pounds and am starting a water-only fast tomorrow.  That's just a little info on the diet-y part of things.

Ever since I was little I used food to control my emotions--to kind of numb me so I would be nice.  I was lonely, different people messed w/me sexually along the way, my parents had their own stuff so they didn't notice my stuff I guess, and for some reason it seemed really really important that I stay ""nice"".  So food was my friend and comfort and way to push down everything that was scary.  I was an ok weight through elementary/middle/high school, but my parents wanted me to be thin, I did Nutri-System, lost weight, but was drugged &amp; assaulted not long after.  To stay thin but deal with the pain I started drinking and partying, heavily.  My parents were happy I was finally going out and not being a ""mary poppins"" anymore, so they didn't notice the pain and I didn't tell them because I knew it would make them sad.  

College I gained a little, got married, was told I wasn't attractive (even though he had thought me attractive enough to have sex with before the marriage), and promptly gained weight because why the f*ck not.  4 kids, homeschooling, divorce (finallyyyy), death of my mom, trouble with one kid, lots of weight gain, almost empty nest and I am STRUGGLING SO HARD with sadness I feel like if I let myself cry my face would break.

I've been going to school and applied for and got this amazingggg internship, but I've had to put in notice at my job and for reasons it's taking forever to fully leave the one and immerse myself in the other, mostly the nice thing rearing its ugly head and yes I do realize it's my choice.  I will very much miss the ladies I work with, they're the first friends I've had in quite a while, and even though I'll see a few of them after I leave I know that most of them will soon only be good memories.

I'm 48, will be 49 in October, and think that maybe just maybe I'm entering into that time before menopause hits?, because my periods are becoming a little unpredictable and all of this sadness used to be relegated to just that week prior.  My life is good and I have much to be thankful for, but I keep thinking about when the kids were young and enjoyed me, and I miss them so much.  I miss my mom.  I'm scared of leaving my very secure job, but I want to be brave and this internship is crazy awesome.  I don't miss my ex at all, but I do miss sharing my life with someone (or what I think that would be like haha).  And I've been consciously pushing this sadness down with food.

So I don't want to keep doing that obviously, but am scared to death of feeling the feelings that I won't be numbing.  Logically I know I won't die or anything, but fasting does kind of make things a little raw, and I'll have to actually deal with all of this.  I've been reading a lot to gear up mentally for this fast and was reminded that crappy eating can really throw your hormones out of whack so what I'm hoping is that some days of crying plus my body cleaning itself out a bit will help even out the emotions somewhat.  I've fasted before, this will be another long one and I'll eat keto after, so I think this will be great for my hormones.  But I would lo0o0o0ove to hear from anyone who has been through similar things, because this is just a theory based on things I've read and knowing how great fasting/keto has made me feel before.

TL;DR....Do any of you have any experience with the hormones/perimenopause/crazy emotions/keto thing?"
6kwqhd,36,2017-07-02,I'm not sure how to proceed,secretsquirrel1324,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/6kwqhd/im_not_sure_how_to_proceed/,"This is my first post on Reddit. Hello, all. I'm posting today because I am unsure of what to do and looking for an outside perspective on things. 

My husband recently graduated with his Bachelor's degree. After searching for a degree in his field (Public Health) for a few months, he wasn't able to find anything so took a seasonal job because we needed money asap. At the time we were living off of school loans while he finished up hid internship which was required before graduating.

Our lease is up in September, and it was assumed that by then he would have already been working at a job in his field. As of now, we are living paycheck to paycheck. It took me months to find the place we currently live in because we have two (big) dogs, and live in an area where you are lucky if there is one pet friendly home for rent in the entire town for under $950/month. I do not think we will be able to extend our lease, because it looks like our home will be put up for sale once our lease ends. 

I currently stay home with our daughter (under a year old). I am finishing up my degree, which is the same as his and I will be done in May. 

My husband has been smoking pot. He has been trying to stop, but will go hang out with fiends, or be in another situation where he ends up smoking. Since his field is Public Health he will be applying for jobs at hospitals and will almost certainly be drug tested when the time comes. 

Just this weekend he went up to his families cabin with his parents. He ended up smoking pot with his father. I had to ask him which I didn't want to even do because before leaving he said he wasn't going to.

He has completely stopped applying for jobs since he wants to wait to apply until he is clean and can pass a drug test. I have been working on his resume and cover letter, getting it as perfect as can be but he has specifically told me not to apply for any jobs yet. 

I am freaking out. I don't know what to do. When he told me he smoked this weekend, I froze. I am just so shocked that he would engage in such juvenile behavior when so much is riding on him finding a position right now. 

Before we found our current place, we were living with his parents. They have told us that we can move back in with them if we need to once our lease ends. I feel like because he knows this, he isn't feeling pressured to find something because he has this option as a plan B. I have told him living with his parents is not an option. My FIL and my husband and his dad would go and get high pretty often when we lived there. This was before our daughter was born, and obviously that wouldn't fly now. However, I'm trying to show that it would not be a good environment for him, nor me. His mother, although very sweet can be overbearing with my daughter.

This has become much longer than expected but I felt as though the background was necessary. What should my next steps be with my husband? He is the type who has always had a vice (it was cigarettes and chewing, which he both quit) and I don't know how to get through to him as a non-smoker. He already thinks that I am not sensitive/caring enough as it is so I want to be gentle, even though it is the opposite of how I actually feel. 

Also I think I should mention that I have suggested therapy. He has told me we don't need to tell our problems to a stranger and should be able to work it out ourselves.

Thank you in advance for reading this!"
6kwuzy,1,2017-07-02,Switch from CS to CE?,surafel911,KSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/KSU/comments/6kwuzy/switch_from_cs_to_ce/,"I've been teaching myself a ton about computer science and software development for a long time. Started when I was about 10. Right now DegreeWorks says I'm already 63% done with my degree and I haven't learned anything new other than software methodologies (AGILE, SCRUM, etc.). I'm thinking that if I'm going to spend so much money for college, I should be learning something new, not affirming something I already know a decent but about and could probably teach myself at home and through work experience (I have some internships under my belt).

I'm a big fan of C and I'm really interested in embedded systems and I have been browsing osdev and programming streams about those streams. I realize that my knowledge on hardware is significantly lacking compared to my knowledge on software (I'm not bragging by no means, and there are certainly people my age better than I am, but I feel as though I get the jist of everything, just need the details). I'm thinking about switching to computer engineering.

I wanted to ask if anyone is already in this degree path? How is it? What kind of classes do you take? I read the description saying it included things like physics, electrical engineering, and math. I don't mind doing those, but I see myself doing systems development.

I'm asking here because I'm out of the country right now and it's inconvenient for me to call the offices. I could send an email to my adviser, but I prefer real world experiences. Thanks!"

**Random Thoughts**


- Oh, yeah, the check! It hasn’t been spent yet.
- I love the O’Malley’s family!
- [Her?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUaAbsGbz2w)
- What is up with all these babies and their hyphenated names? 
- Playing Uncle or Chicken or the quiet game (whatever you want to call it) is stupid, Burke.
- Izzie ratting Derek out on how he copes with Mer’s snoring. He sleeps on the couch with an alarm clock.
- That almost (ship name = Addex?) kiss. And then the REAL one.
- I’m glad Meredith gave her dad a chance.
- Another man that looks good in jeans? Alex.
- I love how everyone is there to support George.
- I get where Meredith is coming from with wanting to have Derek sleep with her, but my uncle snores so loud he has to sleep on another floor of his house. My aunt and uncle have been married for over 30 years. You know, whatever works for your life.
- They don’t ride ferries anymore in the newer seasons.
- The music in season 3 is so good!
- Callie leaves surgery to be with George. That chick is ride or die.
- Ouch, Addison going in for the kill. Yeah, he’s not cut out for commitment, but you have no basis to judge him on his parenting skills.
- Oh my word, I just thought about George and Callie having a kid. Yikes!
- The attendings on this show love themselves some interns.


**Tearjerker Moment**

- George’s freak out about his dad not knowing any better
- George’s dad dying 
- the teenage girl walking upright



**Quotes**

- “Death is not the worst thing.”
- “Is that why you wanted to go into plastics? Cause people sign up for the pain they get?”
- “You are in a relationship with no words. And you are a millionaire in $20 shoes. Whatever.”
- “That neighbor kid? Mike Wilden? I did hit him in the face with a stick. And when his dad came over and he was yelling, and you asked me if it was true...I lied. And you thought I'd never lied. So you took my side. And you and his dad got in this big fight. And then his kids egged our house, and then Ronny and Jerry went over and blew up his lawn mower. Anyway...I did it. He was teasing me and he was bigger than me so I needed a stick to reach his face.”
- “I stayed up baking and cleaning the bathroom floor in case George wants to lay down on it.”
- “There's a club...the dead dad's club. And you can't be in it until you're in it. You can try and understand...you can sympathize. But until you feel that loss...my dad died when I was 9. George...I'm really sorry you had to join the club.”

**Questions**

- The Dead Dads Club moment between George and Cristina is definitely one of my Top 20 Favorite Moments on Grey’s. What moments so far in the series are your all time favorites?
- Do you think Addison was honest or too harsh with Mark?
- Also, why do you think Addison is attracted to Alex?

I don’t know how many mouths I’ve sucked on and some how I don’t know how I haven’t caught an STD. I don’t know whether or not I want to tell you all the details, but I know writing them out here will help me decide what I want to say to you. I don’t know if I’ll post this or not, if I post it, it’s because I decided I won’t tell you unless you ask, which I know you never will because you don’t care about the details of my past.
 
I hadn’t seen a dick of a man until my second year of university, when I was newly 19. I was high and he was drunk and some how we ended up in the bushes in the night with his pants down and me touching my first dick. He asked if he could touch me too but I was too scared and said no. I gave him a few pumps but my nerves got to me and I was so scared that God will hate me that I made up my excuse that my hand was tired and left with him an unsatisfied boner.

I touched my second dick 5 months after that in a hotel room at a conference under the sheets but again quickly stopped because there were other people in the room. He was also my first kiss. 

I can recall the instant that caused me to go off the wire and become a slut and that’s on my 20th birthday when my good friend decided to take me out and again somehow we ended up on a couch that night with me giving him a handjob and stopping because our friends were also sleeping in that room. I remember the next day looking forward to hanging out and then seeing him with another girl and introducing her as his girlfriend. I felt a little betrayed, and I know we talked about it later but that really hurt. We try to be friends again, but the damage is done, and I don’t think we can ever be close again. 

After that, I went out clubbing for the first time. To get my mind off of the friend. Met a cute Italian, he gave me his number and told me to come over for a movie sometime. So I did go over naively thinking it was a movie. It wasn’t. We had Scary Movie part whatever playing in the back but no one was watching. That was the first time I had a guy go down on me and try to finger me. I tried to give him a blowjob but he was uncut and I think I pulled the foreskin too far down so he made me stop. He asked me to have sex but I didn’t want to admit I was a virgin so I said no. 

He was a TA at my uni, so we met up after his office hours one day and he fingered me on his desk and asked again for sex and I said no. So we stopped talking after that. I never came from him fingering me. 

For Halloween my friend and I decided to go to Boston Pizza and we hung out with another group of guys. A couple of them invited my and my friend home to smoke some weed with them, and we said yes. On the way back home, one of them grabbed me and starting making out by the fences. Then tried to finger me in public and I said no. And he said, ok lets wait till we get home. And I looked at my friend who seemed to be having fun with the other guy and didn’t wanna intrude on their good time so I said yes and we went back to their place. He wanted to have sex right away and tried to go down on me but I didn’t want to so he fingered me instead, it was very hard and I remember bleeding on his white sheets. I don’t think he noticed but he kept insisting on sex and I said no and knocked on the other guys door to grab my friend and we left. The guys weren’t too happy and didn’t even let us wait inside for our cabs. 

I went to some bars and pubs with friends and made out with random guys, I don’t even know their names. One of them was my classmates cousin. This went on till the summer that year. 

I moved to a new city temporarily for my summer job and the first month I was pretty focused on work. But then I was curious, and I was bored and I was lonely. I posted to gonewild and I would chat with guys and I really liked the attention. It was all always hidden from my friends and family. I never used my name, I never posted my location and I was very secretive. I never showed my face. 

Then I got the bright idea to post to craigslist. I liked the attention guys gave me and I wanted to get better at sucking a dick. That’s how I found myself parked in a deserted street in a random guys truck who responded to my ad. I sucked his dick and he fingered me, I didn’t come, and that was that. After that I would meet up with multiple guys all from craigslist during different times of the week. 

I met with a guy who I played tennis with. We would do this regularly; play tennis and then go back to his place and fool around while his dog barked at me. I would fake coming when I had enough. I stopped seeing him when he threatened not to take me home after I kept refusing to have sex with him. 

Then I met this guy that would drive an hour to come see me. We would fool around but he was so nice, he wanted to take me out and drove me to some nice landmarks. We would even hold hands sometimes. He was okay with me refusing to have sex, he knew I was a virgin and was happy with eating me out and letting me suck him off. Until one day things got too heated and his dick was so close my pussy and I was so wet and he just slid himself in. And it just went in, I thought there would be more resistance or blood but no he just slid right in. I freaked out and made him pull out and he asked me if I was okay and if he can do that again. I said no, lets pretend it didn’t happen, I am not ready. Faked coming with him too. He stopped replying to my texts after that and then I never heard from him again. 

I was so devastated that I had let a dick enter me, to a guy who I didn’t even love, who I wasn’t married to, that I cried every night for a week. I deleted every guy in my phone and I distanced myself from guys in general. 

I was doing well until a guy at work 25 years my senior starting being friendly with me, I thought at first he was just being nice but then he asked me if I wanted to go for a ride on his motorbikes and I love motorbikes so I said yes. He drove us around for a few hours and it was the thrill of the ride or rush of the wind or just something about the bike that really got to me and he kissed me after it was done and then dropped me home and fingered me in the driveway and it was feeling good until he then asked me to take a video of myself masturbating and send it to him and I thought that was really weird so I stopped talking to him. 

I found myself talking to another guy I was seeing as well from my craigslist post. He was in the same field I was in university, and he was so charming. He never pushed me for sex and was quite content making out, fooling around and letting me suck him. He had the biggest cock I’ve ever seen; honestly so huge I couldn’t fit him in my mouth. And he was aggressive in just the right way, he would choke me, pull my hands down and pull my hair when it was perfect. For some reason, I still would never finish with him, but would fake it so he didn’t feel bad. He also thought that I was a virgin. He told me about this app called Tinder which was easier than craigslist and I can see the people I would be interested in. 

So I got it, and boy oh boy did it open up another whole world for me. 

I had three dates lined up with three different guys in one week. The first guy and I went to the park, came home and I sucked him off. We never talked again. The second guy and I went to sushi and he wouldn’t come home with me and told me he wanted to take it slow, so we just made plans to hang out again some other time. 

The third guy was a impulse decision. I bussed to another city to meet him, he picked me up from the station and drove me to his house, we were going to watch a movie and “cuddle”. I actually thought we were going to cuddle but when we got on his bed, he just wanted to fuck. When I said no, he got skeptical and asked me if I really bussed all the way just to cuddle and I don’t know why, I honestly don’t know why I didn’t say yes, but I said okay, no I didn’t. And then he fucked me. I had no idea what to do, and it kind of hurt so I just laid there. He would go really fast, pound me, then come on my stomach, wipe it off with a shirt, then lay rest for a bit and be ready to go again. Before each time he would ask me to blow him to get him ready and when I asked him to go down on me, he said he doesn’t like doing that so he would finger me instead. I don’t remember how many times he fucked me, but it did hurt. I didn’t bleed and he never knew he was my “first” if we’re not counting the accidental dick slip from before. He never tried to make me come. He dropped me at the station the next morning and I never replied to his texts. 

I figured now I am no longer a virgin, and that deserves more insanity in meeting guys, but before that I needed to fuck the big cock aggressive guy. So I told him I wanted him to be my first because he still thought I was a virgin, and he came over and very slowly put his big dick deep inside me and stretched me out. It felt really good and I might have come but he had to stop because he was going to come and then I started bleeding a lot, I guess that was when maybe my hymen actually broke or something because there was a lot of bright blood and it wasn’t my period. 

I met up with sushi guy again, we actually became really good friends. We started hanging out a lot, going to parks, going to restaurants. He would eat me out, I would pretend to get off, I would suck him and swallow his cum. I tried to initiate sex with him, but wanted to take it slow and would always get soft when I tried to put him in. So we just never had sex. I stopped seeing him because I felt that it was starting to become very close to dating and I didn’t want to date anyone. I was having too much fun. 

I had sex with a random guy I met at a bus station in his car, parked off to the side after he messaged me on tinder asking me if I cleaned pipe. I had no idea what that meant but he was hot so I said ok. 

I had sex with a half arab guy who after eating me out told me when I came because he could taste it which I thought was hilarious because I never came. 

I had sex with a really hot guy who knew what he was doing and gave me my first doggy style experience. It felt so good but not enough to push me over the edge so I faked it again. I got really good at faking coming because although sex felt really good, it never pushed me over and I didn’t know what else do to. 

I had sex with a guy with a bent dick who I had no idea what he looked like when we matched because he had a motorcycle helmet on and I had a thing for motorcycles. 

I didn’t have sex with the guy that owned a lot of snakes because he gave me a bad vibe but we still made out. 

For some reason, I found myself back on craigslist replying to an ad for someone who wanted someone to go get sushi with. I didn’t have any friends and I really wanted sushi so I met up with his guy. He was like 400lbs easy and really tall. He was such a charmer, and I could be myself because I wasn’t intimidated by his looks and wasn’t looking to attract him for sex. Being funny does have a charm though, because we hung out a few times after that and then one day found myself in his bed with him eating me out. That was the first time a guy has ever made me come. And never again has a guy made me come from eating me out. We stopped talking after I moved away from that internship. 

Before I moved away for internship, I fucked a guy that drove a mazda. He definitely had some ADHD or something he was so hyper but he smiled really big when I kissed him and I thought that was enough for me to fuck him. I fucked a guy that drove 2 hours to come over and fuck me, he was a total geek and I know he didn’t have much luck with girls but I found him endearing. I fucked a guy who stopped by my city on his way to the casino and he told me I gave him the best blowjob he ever had, he still messages me sometime but don’t worry, I don’t plan on meeting him again.

I came back to school after those 4 months. I made a fake account on tinder, not using my real name and not using any face pics so no one finds me out and fucked a few more guys. It was harder to make time with school and sneaking around home and not having my own place, but the slut in me still managed. 

I fucked a guy who used me as a rebound for his breakup. He was really strong and fucked me standing up. 

I gave a blowjob and had a guy eat me out who was honestly the most creepy guy ever and his apartment smelt like cigarettes. He put his dick inside me and when he pulled it out he was bleeding and it freaked me out so much I left. 

I fucked a guy who was apparently a pro golfer. We drove to middle of the fields and tried to fuck outside but the mosquitoes made my back look like bubble wrap so we fucked in my van instead. 

Fucked a guy on the tennis courts after the sun went down. 
Tried to fuck a guy who was really cute but everytime I would touch his dick, he would just come so that got old really fast. 

Had a guy bail on me halfway through sucking his dick because he was so nervous he told me to leave. I felt a little bit like a whore there. 

Had sushi with a really really really hot guy who drove a Silverado, and we went back to his place and smoked some weed, and fucked in his shower. I was sad he didn’t call me back but that’s okay. 

Fucked a guy that was doing his PhD at my university but quickly bailed on meeting up again when I realised his supervisor is one of my professors and didn’t want my secret cover blown. 

Fucked a doctor in his off hours. He had such a nice apartment, we fucked facing his mirror and it was like watching a porno of yourself. 

Snuck out of my house in the middle of the night to meet this guy who I thought was a cop but wasn’t, he was just training to be a cop. And he used a toy on me that made me actually squirt. Only ever time I’ve squirted in my life, hasn’t happened again. But I stopped seeing that guy because sneaking out of my house was too much effort. 

Fucked a guy on my old highschool track. 

Then I met my first boyfriend. It was January of my 4th year at university. He was tall and really handsome, and there was instant physical attraction. He said I love you to me the second week of dating and we broke up 4 months later because his personality was too bland for me. 

In that time period before we first met and started dating, I fucked 3 more guys; a volleyball player, some aspiring musician, and a guy who just returned from a trip to the Fiji. We went to a drive in, and he pulled in and out of me while Jake Gyllenhaal was being creepy in Nightcrawler. 

When we broke up, I had moved to another city for my next internship. As soon as we broke up, I redownloaded Tinder and went at it again. Didn’t even wait a week after the breakup. 

I fucked a lacrosse player who sweat so much while on top of me that I couldn’t grip his shoulders.

I fucked a guy that shaved right before meeting up with me that his hair was growing back all over the place, he was a hairy dude and left my skin red. It was like being exfoliated everywhere and it was not comfortable. 

Met a really cute guy, and we kissed at the side of the beach before taking him back to my place and fucking him a few times. 

Met an army vet, who got really sad that he couldn’t make me cum through oral and didn’t like wearing a condom because it numbed the sensation. 

Fucked a guy that worked with me, that was a mistake. He was really nice and good looking but then he started treating me different at work and people were becoming suspicious so I had to cut it off. We still talk sometimes as friends but it’s a little awkward. He was half black so his dick was huge too. 

Fucked two more guys for fun before I met my second boyfriend. 
He was 8 years my senior and we just clicked. He was so funny and he was so charming, we dated for almost 6 months. He said I love you to me on Valentines of last year and I took him out somewhere really special for his birthday. We never made it to my birthday but I’m sure he would have done something really nice. I loved him back, I imagined we would be together a while and maybe be together forever. But it was a dream, as much as our personalities clicked and we enjoyed each other physically, we had no future together. He had no post secondary education, and I was looking for a career. He didn’t hold a stable job and I could not bring home and atheist to meet my parents. There was too much against us to justify what was for us. So we broke up. 

You and I hooked up 3 months after I broke up with my ex and we started dating. Now we are almost a year in to our relationship and I feel so satisfied with you both physically and personality wise. I think you are so special to me. You haven’t said I love you to me, and I’m kind of frustrated it’s taken you so long. But I think I am starting to really fall for you, and that’s why I wanted to get this out in words so I can move on from my past and focus on my present and future with you. 

I told you that I was a slut in my past, and you didn’t care and you never brought it up because that’s just not you. I don’t know if you realise just how big of a slut I was but those days are behind me. I don’t seek gratification from men like I did before. I’ve learned to love myself and to have standards. I have goals now, I have aspirations and I know my life is more than how many guys I can attract. 

I am happy with you, and I am satisfied with you and even if we were to not work out, I will not go back to these old ways. I want something more stable and I want something more permanent. Its not just about sex to me anymore, I want a life partner. "
6kyvg6,1,2017-07-03,IJW: Spider-man: Homecoming (2017),filmgamegeek,Ijustwatched,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/6kyvg6/ijw_spiderman_homecoming_2017/,"Source: http://www.reeladvice.net/2017/07/spider-man-homecoming-movie-review.html

After a flurry of films and reboots in less than two decades, Spider-man is one hero that clearly needs no introduction. Luckily, “Spider-man: Homecoming” foregoes the typical origin story with one that is just balls out fun. It introduces a teeny, boppy, immature Spider-man that we have never seen before that turns out to be the most memorable one yet.

Right off his thrilling experience in “Captain America: Civil War”, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns home and becomes an official Stark intern where he waits for his next mission as part of the Avengers team. Unfortunately, this never happens and Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine while trying to prove himself to Tony that he can be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. But when Peter accidentally stumbles into the illegal operations of the Vulture (Michael Keaton), his moment may have just arrived as he is instantly challenged to become the hero he is supposed to be.

“Spider-man: Homecoming” presents a Spider-man like no other seen on the big screen. This immature, fur ball of energy is one that will frustrate with his antics but also shows why this film works as a reboot. The film was never scared criticizing its superhero’s limitations. In fact, this is where much of the comedy comes from. May it be the time where Spidey runs through a golf course (because there are no buildings to web-swing around with) or the time where he literally destroys a neighborhood due to his clumsiness, it’s both cheeky and outright fun. It also helps that Tom Holland’s rendition of Spidey is downright awesome and iconic and validates why we needed this reboot. The Vulture and Michael Keaton as the villain was up to the task. It does the job as a great narrative counterpoint and it had a surprising revelation somewhere in there that completely caught us off guard. As for Peter’s development as a teenager trying to cope with his superhero status, there’s nothing really new and this is where also our biggest gripes from the film come from. While we love how the film tackles the juvenile nature of Spider-man, we also cannot discount that Spidey himself is the cause of much mayhem for the citizens of New York. After struggling with themes on how superheroes have destroyed cities in previous films, it seems in “Homecoming”, these are completely forgotten. Overall, “Spider-man: Homecoming” even with its faults is another compelling addition to the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s a fresh and exciting take on a superhero that has had so much success before.

6kyvtn,6,2017-07-03,Ativan gave me drug induced psychosis.,Me_398,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6kyvtn/ativan_gave_me_drug_induced_psychosis/,"So this story is around two years old and is based on the accouts of my family as I for the most part do not remember this occuring.

Back in 2015, I was prescribed (if I can remember correctly) Geodon along with Lexapro in order to deal with depression and anxiety. I was also taking Nexium for GERD. Geodon made me feel very angry and I would have episodes in which I would just yell and cry. So during one of these episodes, my parents took me to my doctor who injected me with something (don't know what) and gave me half a pill Ativan. After this, I remember going home and then to bed.

So according to my family, the next day I woke up I was experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations e.g. seeing my dad in my room while he was at work as well as confusion. I was making inappropriate remarks and was utterly delusional.

My mom got worried and phoned my psychiatrist who told her that it would resolve in a day. He didn't tell her why and how it happened. I switched doctors after this day.

So the next day after this incident, I woke up with no memory of what had happened to me a day before. I was completely fine afterwards.

Ever since then, I have been terrified of using any sorts of drugs - whether weed, alcohol or even prescription drugs. However, I have sleep issues and recently began working as an intern. So in order to remain awake during the day I planned on taking Provigil - but again I fear going insane again.

In my opinion, i feel like the meds already present in my system interacted with the Ativan. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

tl;dr: I took Ativan and got psychosis."
6kz8ak,5,2017-07-03,Even Tragic Stories Have a Happy Ending,huskynow,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6kz8ak/even_tragic_stories_have_a_happy_ending/,"So I saw ""Redditors who had sex with someone they worked with, how did it happen and what was the end result?"" on AskReddit, and wrote a response, it was too long to post it there. I wanted to share my story with someone, so I thought I would post it here and hopefully help others going through a rough breakup realize that there's a happy ending waiting for you too, even if it hasn't happened yet.

I started my 6 month internship (plus a 7th month after just hanging out without working) at a company abroad from my university (important later on), and became really close friends with a couple of people there. One guy was in a different apartment, and we hung out outside of work almost every single day. He confessed pretty early on that he had feelings for me, but I told him nothing could happen because we worked together, especially because I was the intern. He accepted that, and we continued to see each other every day outside of work. 

Eventually I got really comfortable around him, we started holding hands in the car and other little things, and it was hard to ignore that I began to care for him. One night when he was driving me home, he kissed me. I told him I had feelings for him but hadn't been with anyone in a long time, so we needed to take things slow. Queue the next day... I sleep with him. At the time I thought we were more of good friends hooking up, and things would just end amicably when I went back home to finish my degree (this was maybe 3.5-4 months into my internship).

He ended up telling me he loved me, I returned his feelings a few weeks later, and we started a full-blown relationship. Only a few of our very close friends at the company knew as they hung out with us outside of work and we traveled together. 

I ended up really falling in love with him, and he loved me. My company ended up telling me there would be a job waiting for me when I graduated, and I loved my internship so I told them I would take it. Before I left -- I needed to return to the states for at least 10 months to finish my degree -- I gave him an out. I told him long distance wouldn't be easy, and if he wasn't 100% sure then we should just part amicably and remain friends. He said he was in this. Totally.

We proceeded to do long distance. I paid 1.5k+ to come visit for 10 days after Christmas (halfway through my time being home) to see him and confirm my job. While I was visiting, I saw messages between him and other girls. Explicit messages. This was one day after  I told him I was going to meet a friend, went to the bar alone, and got shitfaced because I couldn't handle the emotional turmoil. After awhile I called him and he came to get me, I ended up screaming at him and crying in the car. He swore on his mother's life that the messages were from before he met me (even though they were timestamped one week before I came to visit). Blamed it on faulty technology and his computer backing up to an old version. I let myself believe him. A) I loved him, and B) I'm an idiot when it comes to men. 

I went home, decided to let the messages thing go even though logically I knew he cheated on me. I came to the point where I accepted starting fresh when I moved to his country, and letting the past be the past.

One month before I moved things started getting weird from him. We used to talk twice a day on the phone, and he would go 3-5 days without even sending me a message. He said weird things like ""You're not always going to have me"", ""You should break up with me, I'm not good for you."" I was in love, so this shocked and confused me, and I said ""No babe you're great""... blah blah blah. 

The week I moved, I was throwing up from anxiety 4-5 times a day. Because I knew the relationship was ending and that fucked me up, and also because I was moving. Last minute he tells me he's not going to pick me up from the airport when I arrive. I'm pissed, but I deal with it because I figure he has work and my Airbnb offered to pick me up for free. While the Airbnb driver is driving me from the airport, I borrow his phone to call my boyfriend. I tell him I'm in our city and I arrived safely, and ask when I will see him. He tells me he's not available until 10pm....*because he's playing soccer with his friends*. I tell him okay, but hang up and I'm livid. I ask the driver, ""If your girlfriend was coming from the States after 5 months, would you be playing soccer with your friends, or would you want to see her right away?"" He said, ""Honey... If my girlfriend was coming after 5 months, or even 1, I would be in the airport picking her up. This guy is an asshole."" Now, all my friends had told me he was an asshole, but coming from a stranger... it really hits you.

We lasted...maybe a week after that. After we had sex once he told me he didn't want to do it again. ????? I was thrown by that, and when I asked why he said, ""I just don't want to have sex with anyone right now. It's not you."" Okay... maybe he has some medical issue right now, or something else? I let it go. A few days later he tells me we have to break up and he ""just doesn't want to be in a relationship anymore"". What. The. Fuck. 10 months of long distance and suddenly you just don't want to be in a relationship?? That makes no sense.

The next day I made him see me to talk, and pushed him to tell me why he was doing this. To beg him not to do this. To cry and tell him I would do anything to be with him. He finally tells me that after I came to visit in January, he realized things were so serious between us and he wanted to marry me. He talked to his (Muslim) family about it, and they threatened to excommunicate him from the family and never speak to him again if he continued things with me. Why? Because I'm ""Christian"" (Atheist) and because of that our children would be fucked up. I begged, *begged*, him to not give up and let us find a way. He said he didn't want to end things and this broke his heart too, but there was no way. I offered to convert for appearances sake, and he said no it wouldn't work. So that's it, right?

The next evening, I had to go to a dinner party to celebrate the engagement of two of my coworkers to each other. Salt. on. the. wound. Even better, I was sat next to him. And had to keep going to the bathroom because I was still throwing up constantly from anxiety, made worse by his crushing my heart.

I still wanted to work things out. I still believed we could work things out and be happy. After the dinner party, I asked him to come over so we can talk. He ends up spending the night, we act like everything is normal and ignore the elephant in the room, and we have sex. The next morning we have sex again and he tells me that was the last time and we're really over. I get on my knees, sobbing and beg him to give us more time. He walks out.

A few days later I started work, but serendipitously my company moved my department to a new office building a few days after I started, so I didn't have to see him at work. I spend the next two weeks at bars with my friends getting drunk and having fun. They're *amazing* and make me realize that a lot of things my ex did to me while we were together was fucked up. I gave up a lot of things for him, and he fucked around on me and treated me like a fool. Our cheers when we did shots ended up being ""Happy independence day!"" Because the day my ex ended things for the last time, happened to be independence day for his country. When he was breaking up with me, he said: ""Happy independence day to my country and to you."" While I was sobbing. Classy guy.

There was a friend of my friend who joined our group at the bars. We didn't talk much, but I found him incredibly attractive. I dismissed it though, because he was far out of my league and I didn't think there was any way he would be attracted to me. After a few nights, we had a particularly big night at the bar with our friends and got completely drunk, and were having lots of fun. He offered to drive me home, and we stayed for awhile after everyone left. 

We had been talking and flirting all night, and I wondered if he was going to try something. He asks to use my bathroom when we get to my apartment. Comes up, uses the bathroom...hugs me and leaves. A perfect gentleman (considering I was totally wasted). The next day he calls me to check on me and asks if I'll be going to our friend's BBQ the next evening. I confirm, and he's going as well. 

After the BBQ, he's going to meet some of his friends and a bar and asks me if I want to join. I do, of course -- always up for a drink. We proceed to get totally wasted, *again*. His friends love me and tell him that he should marry me. **He shrugs and says okay**. *He then takes the silver wrapper out of my cigarette packet, gets down on one knee, and proposes in the middle of the bar*. I laugh, tell him he's crazy, and to keep his ""ring"". We all have a fun rest of the evening, and he drives me home without incident. 

A few days later we go to a house party for one of his friends. We all get fucked up -- booze and some light pills (that I abstained from). Him and I end up making out in the kitchen, and I'm like *finally*. This guy is so fucking hot, I've only ever been in two serious relationships that were both awful, and I just want to have some fun. 

He ends up coming home with me, and we hook up that night and the next morning. *Holy*. *Fucking*. *Shit*. I always just thought sex was ""okay"" and that was because of my hormones and body or whatever, but it was still good, whatever. **No.** It turns out I had just been having shitty sex all my life and never knew the difference, because this guy *blew my mind*.

We continue hooking up that week, he ends up telling me that he loves me, I tell him I don't want anything serious right now. We saw each other every day for these past three weeks, and he only gets more and more amazing. I've managed to injure myself and get sick multiple times in that period (really should stop drinking), and he's been by my side taking care of me every time even though I tell him not to. He's one of the kindest people I've ever met, and has treated me better than I could ever imagine based on my past relationships. I love him. I told him I loved him a little over a week ago, and the look on his face when I said it made my heart explode. As of two days ago, we're officially dating. I've met his friends, siblings, nieces, and he wants me to meet his parents (I told him I need more time for that).

**I am *so fucking happy*. I can't believe I'm so happy. It's amazing.**

Sidenote: My ex lost his shit and decided he wanted me back soon after I got with my current boyfriend (he didn't and doesn't know we're together -- and this was before we made things official). He saw a picture of the two of us at the bar on snapchat, just sitting together, and lost his shit on me. Insinuated I was a slut, I never loved him, etc... Started calling and messaging me, basically harassing me. I told him I wanted us to remain friends, but not if he continued to be disrespectful towards me and trying to create conflict between us. He continued anyways, and I thanked him for breaking up with me and saving me from making the biggest mistake of my life (marrying him) and blocked him. Haven't talked to or seen him since.

I haven't really shared this story with anyone besides my friends who have been there for it, and it was extremely cathartic to write it out. Even if no one reads this.

**TL;DR: Slept with a coworker, dated said coworker, got heartbroken through a serious of hilariously unfortunate events, and end up with an amazing guy and happier than I've ever been one month later.**"
6kzdeu,7,2017-07-03,Moving from China to Rotterdam – any advice would be greatly appreciated,theglobalgirl,Rotterdam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rotterdam/comments/6kzdeu/moving_from_china_to_rotterdam_any_advice_would/,"Hi r/Rotterdam,
 
I’m a Hungarian national moving to Rotterdam this fall with my husband who is from the States. We are currently trying to set up the details of our new life in the Netherlands, and I was wondering whether anyone could help us with some information.
 
------HOUSING-----
 
As I will be completing my MSc at Erasmus, I have been checking out student housing options but it seems like that this is not really meant for couples. And although the offerings of housing websites are better suited, some agencies’ requirements (employer acting as guarantor, copy of the previous 3-months of paychecks, etc.) sound almost impossible to fulfill as a student. What housing options do we have? How flexible agencies willing to be about such requirements? (eg. we have substantial amount of savings to kick-start our Dutch life until we find a job – would a copy of bank statement be enough to prove our financial stability?)
 
Also, I have seen some lower priced accommodations with less strict tenant requirements, but based on other post in this subreddit, these are all in “bad” parts of town, such as Feijenoord, Delfshaven, Charlois, etc. How bad are these neighborhoods? My husband used to study in Chicago, I’m, well, from Hungary, and we spent the last 6 years in China – so a little bit of roughness would not bother us much as long as we are not talking about being constantly worried about our physical safety or whether there will be a break-in as soon we leave the house.
 
-----WORK------
 
What should we expect looking for a job? We both would like to work – my husband full and me part-time. It will take him around 6 month to get the required paperwork for a residence permit. Is there anything he can do during that time to earn money?  What are my chances finding a well-paying part-time or internship position next to my studies? We both have BSc in Finance from one of China’s top schools and speak fluent Mandarin (our program was taught in Chinese). He just finished his undergrad; I have worked for a British firm in Tokyo for a while. We started learning Dutch after we found out that I was accepted to Erasmus to boost our chances in the Dutch job market.


 
I appreciate any information that can point us in the right direction. Veel dank!"

6l0kfx,188,2017-07-03,My first weekend with the Switch (or how I spent my first paycheck buying one),Dairunt,NintendoSwitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/6l0kfx/my_first_weekend_with_the_switch_or_how_i_spent/,"I don't know if random rambling is allowed here anymore but I just wanted to share I got my first job last month as a Software Engineer for an IT company. I've been studying Computer Engineering since four years ago and I'm thrilled to work in what I love - - programming. However, one of the main reasons I was so excited was that I would finally buy my most expected console, maybe of all time. 

Last time I was this excited was over ten years ago, when me and my best friend at the time were designing weird mockups for this mysterious console called Revolution and how it would change gaming as we know it. We went through every idea a 12-year old kid would imagine, and when I finally got one I adored it.. for a couple of years. 

I'm almost exclusively a ""portable gamer"", specially during college when I would just take my 3DS, play whenever I can, and take it to my parents' house on weekends. This also meant I skipped the Wii U as there was nothing that would convince me I needed one (Smash also released on 3DS so in theory the only game I would look forward was Splatoon, and that was late into the console's life) so when Iwata confirmed development for the NX and there were rumors about a hybrid console I was curious. 


Eventually I joined Reddit and inevitably /r/NintendoNX and that relived my days of speculating and looking for details, rumors and leaks as I did buying game magazines and searching in forums back in the day. 


The wait went from being fun to being part of my daily life. For months I would wait for ""Tomorrow"" and try to dig any information from Directs and stakeholder meetings. It was quite a ride for everyone who were there, but it paid off when Nintendo announced a teaser was coming ""Tomorrow"". Reading the comments and the little confetti popping out of the /r/'s header was easily the happiest moment in my time on Reddit. I was an intern when the teaser released and I snuck my smartphone to see it live. My hype was though the roof and I had to keep a straight face. And how was it? Pretty much everything I've wanted out of a console, and the culmination of most rumors and leaks that had me so excited for months. 


A console that I would take with me everywhere I want, but not relegated to ""smaller games and Pokemon"" like other Nintendo handhelds. Something I can easily bring with me to my parents' or on vacation, and the most innovative and ambitious games Nintendo has made in years. With the newest game from my favorite franchise (Zelda) at launch, with a reception rivaling Ocarina of Time, for some people the greatest game for all time. 

After a few months of rest I finally got my real job and last Friday, the last day of the month, I had everything set. I've pinpoint every major and minor retailer around my office, I called them to make sure which ones had stock and how much it costs -- I was ready to go. I bought the console with Zelda on my lunch break and, after the day was over I went to my parents', set the console and was in awe. 

We went to the beach for the day (my treat) and the battery lasted the whole trip back and forth (4 hours with airplane mode and brightness alternating between low and medium), we took turns with my younger brother and even played the Puyo Puyo Tetris demo with my mother. My father (who loved playing Wii Sports Boxing) was hyped when I showed him the ARMS trailer and my grandfather, who loved paragliding when he was younger (he actually was one of the first ""birdmen"" in my country) , was in awe as I made Link jump off a cliff and paraglide across Hyrule. It was an amazing feeling I got so much from a console in only two days. 

The next game is Sonic Mania - - another game I waited for a while now and with the news of a Splatoon Direct I have my fingers crossed for a new Splatfest. Quoting a YouTuber named Arlo (he makes good videos about the Switch) ""Nintendo. Is. Back""

6l0vld,6,2017-07-03,Am i really that bad of a son? (LONG POST),redsko79,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6l0vld/am_i_really_that_bad_of_a_son_long_post/,"Throwaway for Privacy Reasons

Hey all, I've only recently discovered this subreddit, and have been struggling internally for quite a while now. I am 21 years old, one summer class away from graduating debt free with a 3.7 GPA in a great business program/school. I have also completed several internships during my four years with each of my supervisors offering references. 

From the beginning: I've struggled with loneliness, low self-esteem and depression for most of my life. Ever since the beginning my parents strived for us to become as educated as possible. My parents don’t go to church, have no adult friends in our city, and thus have always been absorbed with their work and their kids; and absolutely NEVER had a social life of their own. Thus my mom would always project her struggles and experiences into my life. She dislikes the social settings of America and would never understand how it feels when you constantly want to compare your social life to others. She would always say to never compare yourself others and strive to be educated as possible and to save money and to have a rigid life structure.

Ironically, she constantly compares myself to my brothers and to her own life experiences, who incidentally, had more social childhoods than I had. My brothers and I took tests as young kids and our scores would reflect what sort of program we would be in. You would be in this program and stuck with the same kids from Kindergarten to 8th grade. Both my brothers got into it, I didn't. I never had a stable friend or a best friend into the latter parts of high school as we had to move homes and I went to three separate elementary schools. 

The way she and my father dealt with this was to throw money at programs, clubs, and other things where I would be forced to attend. I already had trouble making friends in my own neighborhood, as families that lived here had already known each other for years, whereas we remained isolated. My failure to make friends meant that I never really enjoyed these programs and thus would tell my parents that I wanted to leave. 

The only way I could have managed my loneliness was through school work and video games. This is where my parents would accuse me for having a lack of passion in life. I wasted their money because I didn’t enjoy nor appreciate the amount of money they threw into making sure I had some sort of thing outside school and home. 

Nowadays, my mom would accuse me of never getting to where I am right now without her. She spent the money on the test prep courses. She was the one that pushed me to work at an early age. She constantly reminds me of the shitty childhood she had and that I should be grateful of the conditions I live in. She thinks anyone who smokes weed (i.e. many of my friends) are lazy pieces of shit that have addiction issues. (I don’t smoke nor drink btw) 
Now that I have decent friends and a girlfriend, it’s literally impossible to have some sort of social life. I have to be home by 11 PM, doesn’t matter the day (whether it’s a weekend or such). If I tell her I’d be home around 8, then call her and tell her I’d be home around 10 (say at 7), she accuses me of lying. She accuses me of tearing the structure of the family apart because me coming home at late means I disrupt any rest my parents get before they go to work the next day. 

Remember that one summer class away I mentioned in the beginning? Yea she got upset at that too. I didn’t want to tell her about my situation until I had no choice. She said she feels embarrassed for feeling proud of herself to push me to finish on college on time. I constantly tell her that many of my friends are finishing a semester or year later, then of course she tells me not to compare myself to worse people. Then, as predicted, she would compare me to my older brother and remind me of how much of a fuckup I am. Then she called my a liar for not directly telling her that I am not finishing on time and assuming that I did. She refused to attend the graduation ceremony.

I’m thinking of moving in with my girlfriend soon, but I feel incredibly guilty that I’m the black sheep of the family and thus have disappointed everyone. 

TL;DR: My privileged background makes me think I failed my family in some way. Everything has to be done in a certain way and any deviation means I am a trouble maker."
6l14xs,20,2017-07-03,Just a list of coworkers I've fucked,curls-and-pearls,SexLists,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexLists/comments/6l14xs/just_a_list_of_coworkers_ive_fucked/,"Hey! I made a list over at r/sluttyconfessions and it seems like people liked it, so I guess I'll share a new one here! The theme is coworkers!

1) Starbucks: I was 15/16 and it was my first job. Ryan was 19/20 and heading off to college. He was 5’8-ish and well-toned. He had spent the past year since graduating high school saving up money to at least BEGIN paying for college. Can work ethic be sexy? We would flirt during every shift, but we finally exchanged numbers after we closed one night and he walked me to my car (maybe a week and a half after I started). Our first date, we ate thai — then we parked behind a Target and got more acquainted in his back seat (which would be a true friend that summer). We got so used to fucking in his back seat that our manager wouldn’t let us take breaks together after a while — we’d always be late and come back smelling like sex. We didn’t see each other properly naked (in person, anyway) ’til a month in when my parents were out of town and we finally fucked in a bed.


2) Chipotle: Another summer job. I was 16, going on 17. Decided to work at Chipotle for one reason: free burritos. Found a reason to stay: options. There were 5 high school kids on the roster that summer: two girls, three boys. Now, all three were cute, funny guys, but I wanted Tyler: 6 foot, fit, with some seriously well-developed facial hair (which I always thought was a statement of pride because it was hot as fuck that summer). He was already 17 when I started and after a shift or two flirting, we started hooking up. He was way less of a romantic than Ryan — and his parents were out of the house more. I’d stay over at his place on the weekends his parents were gone. We’d hole up and eat junk and fuck everywhere we could.


3) Dining Hall: Skipped working the summer before college to travel and hangout with friends and family — but that meant I definitely needed a job freshman year. The dining hall was not as glam as chipotle, but the principle was the same and it was the best I could do at the time. The dining hall attracted a lot of random people (a lot of them became some of my best friends) and it was rare to keep anyone too long. But James was an anomaly. The man was 26 and working his way through school, taking a semester off, then on. When he was on, he always came back to the same dining hall. He was also perhaps the most handsome black man this white, suburban girl had ever seen! And covered in tattoos (another thing I hadn’t seen at that point). And while we did flirt A LOT, he flirted with every girl. I didn’t think hooking up with him was a possibility — until I went to one of the few house parties I was invited to freshman year. I had come dressed to impress (and hopefully fuck) the guy who invited me, but apparently James was his neighbor and showed up a few hours after I did. He was just swarmed by women. Eventually we made eye contact and shouted drunken hellos at each other. He made his way over, to the dismay of the other ladies. We talked, and I could tell that my outfit had impressed him instead. It wasn’t long before a hand was on my hip, creeping towards my ass. We took shots and he went to talk with other people. Sufficiently hot and bothered, I went in search of more men. Several flirty encounters and number exchanges later and James was back. We sat on a couch together, talking about nothing the way drunk people trying to hookup do (“please drop an innuendo so we can start talking about sex!”). Finally he had his in: I mentioned how nice it was to see him outside of the dining hall. Then he said something about how, had he known I was hiding such a tremendous body underneath my uniform, he would’ve made a move sooner. Then his hand was on my thigh, making its way up my dress. It was scandalously short, so it didn’t take long for him to hit pussy as we started to makeout on the couch. Once I got to the point where I absolutely needed him inside me, I suggested we walk back to his place. We did. There was a small party at his place. We said hi to everyone. Someone made a comment about him bringing home another white girl. Another said I’d be better off with him than James. I asked to test that theory, but James smacked my ass and we rushed upstairs. Our clothes came off quick and easy and I finally got to see just how many tattoos he had. It was impressive! More impressive was his cock: a good, girthy 7 inches. He did me doggy twice, leaving nail marks in my ass when he came. I rode him and finally came, myself. We passed out, and I woke up around 8 am with a hard-on pressing against my ass and we started up again. We hooked up a handful more times that year before I quit when summer came.


4) Bookstore 1: Sophomore year I traded up from the dining hall for the bookstore and stayed there ’til I graduated. There were a handful of hookups there. The first was Will, another Sophomore. He was cute and goofy and nerdy and had a ton of self-confidence in that, which I love. We started hanging out outside of work, chilling in each other’s dorms, etc. It was like 10 am one morning and I stopped by his room to hangout for a bit, then get lunch with him before our mutual 1pm lectures. We were sitting on his bed, watching episodes of Parks and Rec. He kept doing that thing, where you try to get closer and closer to someone you’re interested in? Maybe touch them and get something started? Well we touched and things got started. We started making out, sitting up, then he was on me, between my legs. We stopped. I asked him what he wanted to do next. He said he’d never actually gotten this far before. That sealed his fate. He had condoms — the shitty free kind they give away on campus — so we stripped and fucked. It was short and sweet and I gave him his first blowjob after as an added bonus. It was not my first v-card and it wouldn’t be my last — I always make it an amazing experience :p


5) Bookstore 2: Still Sophomore year. Upperclassman, 22. Handsome face, but not the fittest guy in the world. Fun though! And I thought he was pretty cool when he offered to buy me alcohol. The first few exchanges were simple: I’d give him the money at work and he’d swing by my dorm and drop stuff off. But one Saturday night, my friends and I were desperate. It was a cold night in February and none of us wanted to go out, so we stayed in our suite and dorm-drank. By 10pm, we had finished our stock but wanted to keep the party going. I texted my contact to see if he could make an emergency run, joking that, of the 7 drunk bitches here, someone was bound to make it worth his while. He was in! By 11:15 we had a handle of vodka, sprite, a box of wine and two upperclassman boys (my contact and his roommate), each with a bottle of whiskey. The party continued! I think we all agreed to flash them as part of their compensation. The friend eventually left with my friend Bridgette, so I assume he got the rest of his. To make things even with my contact, I pulled him into my room and gave him an extremely sloppy BJ, then we went back to the party. We would end up keeping this deal going ’til he graduated. I didn’t pay for a drop of alcohol the rest of the year.


6) Bookstore 3: Junior year. Another 22-year-old, but this time he was my manager. At this point we’d known each other for a year. We flirted, but he had a girlfriend… until the tail-end of the year. He asked me out and after some really heavy making out in his car outside my apartment, I was like, 
“what the fuck are we doing? Let’s go inside.” We did. Then he rode bareback and came inside me. He realized there was one positive thing about breaking up with your girlfriend of 2 and a half years: a horny girl from work will let you fuck her raw.


7) Internship: My first internship started right after I graduated. And while I really wanted to fuck my mentor (he was 24 and wonderful; we still keep in touch, so fingers crossed!), I decided to keep SOME discipline and fuck a man from another department instead. Nick was 33, handsome and charismatic. We met at the intern welcome party at the end of our first week, and we seemed to run into each other every day after that. After a few weeks, I asked if we could get coffee one morning so I could “pick his brain about the industry.” He said yes. We barely talked about the industry and coffee dates became drinks after work. Then drinks after work became drinks on weekends, and before you know it, he’s ruining one of my favorite dresses. It was quite the summer. He’s married now. We’re still friends on social media and he seems to only Like my selfies…


8) First Job 1: I actually wrote about this before! Check it out: https://redd.it/3zn790


9) First Job 2: He was my age-ish (maybe a year older). We became friends when we stayed late together a few times. We started to joke that, if fucking in the office was on your bucket list, now would be the time. A few weeks of joking like that, and the next thing you know, we’re fucking on my desk. We fucked all over that office, during the day and night. We became fuck buddies for a few months.


10) First Job 3: Company party fling. We were drunk. I don’t think his girlfriend would’ve approved.


11) First Job 4: This one barely counts, but when I put in my two weeks at my first job, I aggressively came on to a guy on my team. We had flirted before, but kept things professional since we worked together everyday. He was 29, handsome and hilarious. He knew what I was up to and THAT DAY, we got drinks after work and fucked until 3am. What a Tuesday!


13) Second Job 1: I’ve only been at my second job for a few months now, but I’ve made a few mistakes already. The first was after, you guessed it, a company party. Only a few weeks after I started. He’s in his late 20s, called me terrible things in bed, and hasn’t looked me in the eye since — as if I was going to report him to HR or something :p


14) Second Job 2: Happy Hour got a little crazy one day, and it ended up being me and a mid-thirties coworker sitting alone on a patio at 9pm on a thursday. He said he had an awesome porch if I wanted to keep drinking. I did. We carefully drove to his place and sipped whiskey ’til 11. We talked and listened to music, and I started dancing for him. First as a joke. And then it wasn’t a joke. Soon I was straddling him, grinding on him, and we kissed. I fucked him right on that chair, then he took me inside and returned the favor. We’ve hooked up a few times since, but nothing serious.


15) Second Job 3: Last one! 4 of us were on a business trip and got a little rowdy one night. We started talking about sex and I was laying it on thick, teasing my three male coworkers. Two were married. One isn’t. The next night was not so rowdy and the married boys turned in early, leaving me and the single man alone at a bar. He started talking about how much I turned him on and how he was curious to see that crazy side of me. He’s cute and I was down, but I toyed with him a bit more. Soon he was bargaining: what do I have to do to get you in my room tonight? I told him he could have me tonight and any other time we were traveling together. This wasn’t going to be an out-of-work thing. So I showed him that crazy side of me, and he’s kept his word to keep it professional at home.


BONUS) Ex-Boss: This one doesn’t really count, but I love it anyway. My boss at my first job left a few months before I did, getting a new job in town. We stayed in touch and got drinks a few times. We were friendly at work, but we got closer once he left. Finally, after 4 or 5 happy hours, he said something to me about my career like, “you’re hot, you’re gonna be fine.” I asked him what being hot had to do with anything and he said with a wink, “I hired you, didn’t I?” He admitted that, while my work was great, he knew he was leaving soon when I interviewed and he wanted something nice to look at. “You interviewed in that black pencil skirt and the buttons of your shirt were barely hanging on…” I was laughing hysterically at this point. He always struck me as a dirty old man type, but he was always respectful to me. We didn’t hookup that night, but after that, our texts were more frequent and flirty. The next time we met, the sexual tension was thick. After a couple, he invited me back to his place to drink there — it was a friday and the bar was filling up. He uncorked a bottle of wine, filled the glasses, and they sat on the table as he uncorked a year-or-so’s worth of sexual frustration. THAT was a fun night — and there were many more to come. "

I will be living in Klong Luang and have already planned lots of stuff in Bangkok. 

I would like to visit Laos-likely near the end of my trip however, I'm not sure if I would be allowed back in Thailand since my visa is single entry? Was hoping someone would confirm what I thought.

Also would like to visit some other places in Thailand on the weekends (internship in Klong Luang during the week). The islands are a bit expensive to fly too (£150ish). Phuket was another option although from what I have read it is pointless going during rain season. Chiang Mai is another option and I will likely visit it. Any other places outside of Bangkok and Chiang Mai worth going too during rain season?

Thanks in advanced! Can't wait to visit.

For those of you that have gone through this process, what are your tips? Are there any particularly good resources out there for finding internships, or should I just look at the website of each company I am interested in? Feel free to share any other info you think would be useful. Thanks!

I know it is frowned upon to be in your mid-late twenties and live with family because it means that you are a pathetic loser... at that age you should have a place and be married, and that is why I am stressing myself out to try and get a house or at least an apartment and have the ""traditional american lifestyle"" because I don't want the stigma... but it seems so hard on one income. 

It's not like I live with family b/c I am a video game nerd that needs ""mommy"" to do everything for me, it's a matter of cost of living and finances. How does someone like myself who's truly trying in life avoid this stigma? I dont want to be viewed as the loser/ lazy twenty something year old. Is it because times were different when our paren't were growing up? So how do modern folks avoid it?

I am stressing myself out to the point where I am depressed and have to see a therapist (not asking for sympathy, just stating how it is) but I feel like no matter how much I try I'm not good enough compared to other people though... that's why I'm back in school furthering my education so I can get ahead... I have a bachelor's in psychology and can't find a job making more than 37,000 a year.

But because of my salary, the fact that I'm in school, had to cut back to 32 hours due to school (16 hours next semester to accommodate clinical and internship), and have tons of loans... I cant afford a house or even rent on my own right now in this area which is why I reside with family, until I finish school at least and get a higher and thats why I feel like a failure, because im ""a man"" and as a man I am supposed to be invincible and have a house and my life mapped out by now.

Im a simple person, save money, rarely go out, haven't been to the movies, bought a pair of shoes or gone to bar in over a year so I don't spend much money on nonessential things.

I just wish I could be like my other friends who are in relationships/ married, and as as a result have two incomes, have each other for support (moral, not just financial) and therefore are able to afford big apartments or houses... and because they have two incomes are able to effectively work less hours a week to focus on school with no problems... and then I get so annoyed because everyone then looks at them like, ""omg look at them what a good kid they, have their life together, have a nice home have this, have that, yada yada."" And then I'm over here strugglin to get somewhere and everyone just glances over me because since I'm not that ""young homeowner"" and stuff, there's nothing to get any credit for... and I just think to myself, ""gee if I had two incomes coming in and someone to help me through school, I could have a house too!"""

6l3n1q,8,2017-07-03,My Thank You to The Creatures.,ControversyCover1332,TheCreatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/6l3n1q/my_thank_you_to_the_creatures/,"Before I get started I would like to just say that this is in no way going to pry on rumors of any kind. Im and going to be citing what they have said over the years to us. Nothing more nothing less. Second I will not be belittiling any of the creatures. They are all great people. I hope that the mods take the time to read this before they ban me for bringing up old creatures, as this is much more a tribute to what once was. And its sad to see that it would seem to the community thst the creatures are going to be no more soon. 

I'm going to start off with this question. Which Creature set did you fall in love with? I remember being 18 when the creatures moved in to the first house. How ambitious it all was. People like nova rarely showed his face at this time which is funny to think, seeing how open he is about it now. Ssohpkc was also known at the time for uploading a crap ton and the thought of seamus not uploading for a day was so far out that if you had told 2012 me that seamus would have left youtube, I wouldnt believe you. Kootra was still a young man with no beard. Dan was still known for being ""the batman guy."" Above all else. And at the time slyfox hound was the biggest channel they had. (Irony at its finest.) Gassy mexican was also one of the smaller channels that was well known for his deep voice. Sp00n and ze were creatures I never really watched so I cant speak for how they were. Especially since they always seemed to distance themselves from the main guys. But this was it. 5 guys living in a house playing games. However the first change and first crack in the foundation of the creatures was when Gassy was Ousted out of the creatures. At the time it was said that it was a falling out between gassy and the rest of the creatures. Which was an accepted fact. I remember catching the twitch stream the day after it happened. Gassy didnt seem angry. He had known that in a lot of ways he may have had it coming. Thinking back on it now this would be the only time that the creatures made super clear why someone was leaving. Every time after that it felt like they didnt know how to communicate it on there end. But as time went on more cracks were made to that foundation. People started leaving for personal reasons which couldnt be helped by the creatures. Sly left, Seamus left, sp00n and ze left. But like a well oiled machine the hub continued on.bringing in three new youtubers during this period. BlackHawk, aleks, and dex. This was a good thing as all these people were great at being a creature in a lot of ways. On camera they seemed to all be friends which was great. They also had more interns showing up in their videos. Im not going to debate whether this decision was bad or not because frankly it is a matter of opinion. The interns all brought funny content to the channel and after a little adjusting it was almost like they had been there all along. Then after a while both dex and blackhawk left. The reasons given varied from enviroment, to it not being what dex was expecting. So the creatures were down to 3 originals, aleks, and a few interns, this seemed to still be fine but the cracks in the foundation were starting to become way more visible. Until finally the foundation couldnt support the massive statue it could at one point so easily hold up. In one foul swoop 4 creatures left to go make cowchop. Making the office they had been using for quite a while not sustainable, they were forced to move their office into a small house in colorado. Its not my place to talk about why cowchop was created so I wont. But i will say it is sad that that was a year ago and sense then whats left of the creatures have tried to keep that statue up. But over the course of one short year the channel looks like it has finally been killed. The hub hasnt had anything uploaded to it in two weeks and dan, the co owner, said he has no idea whats happening to the creatures. There is no RTX panel for a rooster teeth channel with a million subs, as well as every peice of creature merch going on sale on the rt store.It seems the statue has finally toppled over. 

If this is the indeed end then it is with a heavy heart I say on behalf of all the community that the creatures have amassed over the years, I say thank you to all the people that have ever took part in the creatures. Thank you for over 7 years of entertainment. Thank you for always staying light hearted on camera no matter what was happening behind the scenes. Thank you for making my life less stressful by giving me the ability to watch funny content when i got home. Thank you for all you guys have ever done to make sure people were entertained. There is so much I could thank every person involved with the creatures for but the truth is I am grateful beyond words. My sense of humor was shaped by you guys. And if the channel does get ressurected again with one less person or with everyone still there this thank you still stands. You guys took a group of friends playing games and made it into some of the most entertaining stuff on the site. Thank you."

They heard that five-second musical flourish that was becoming familiar, and Ash dropped back into SLUM. Having tried it a couple times by now, it didn't feel as strange as it had at first, but still they weren't sure how they felt about it. It still felt largely unnecessary. 

Ash's home street loaded. It was still mostly barren, but there were a few favourite locations that had been added. The Sharpe &amp; Steele site loomed ahead first and foremost, so they could keep an eye on the company's SLUM presence. After all the publicity surrounding the Mercier case they had gained popularity around town. There was much to do, and this sojourn into SLUM seemed like a bit of a needless distraction. But Abner promised he would introduce them to an important contact, and that was worth checking out. So Ash found themselves walking toward the bright and extravagant sign of M0lly Mill10ns.

Abner was waiting at the front gate in his usual SLUM avatar. Tall, dark, handsome, muscular, and speaking with that same Hispanic dialect that he uses for his voice modulator in the real world. Ash was once again looking androgynous, dressed in a dark suit with a red tie and bowler hat.

“Glad you could make it,” said Abner, and they started walking through the winding courtyard of electric neon trees. “We should probably talk about customizing your avatar a little more. And we could move you up to a level 2 connection.”

“Not interested,” Ash replies. “You can keep this domain for yourself. I'll stick to the real world. I'm just here to meet your informant. There is a lot to do these days.”

“Yes, of course. I can see us getting busier. I'm still shaking trees here as fast as I can. I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help in those tunnels, but it seemed Jerusalem performed admirably under pressure. Those upgrades I made were worth it. And … what about you?”

Ash didn't need to ask for clarification. They had been taken out of action by a serious headache at a very inconvenient time. They could remember losing a sense of physical identity and slipping almost into a coma before Cash brought them back. “I'm going to talk to Red, find out what's going on and how to fix it.”

“Keeping this secret is just going to get harder,” Abner warned as they approached the front door. “They are detectives, after all.”

“Thank you, Abner. That will be all. Are there any tits we can distract ourselves with?”

“Welcome to M0lly Mill10ns, where we give away one million Capeks every single night.” M0lly materialized in front of them, delivering her greeting in all its sultry, pre-recorded glory. She had the same pink hair, shimmering in sundry vibrant wavelengths, but this time she was dressed in a short negligée so sheer as to be almost invisible, with nothing underneath but for a garter belt and fishnet stockings. She arched her back against the doorframe, thrusting her breasts forward. “Feel free to name your pleasure, ladies and gentlemen.”

M0lly vanished and Abner took the lead down a flight of stairs. At least Ash had the sensation of descending a flight of stairs, but hundreds all sped by, swirling around them, until one surged upwards and they took a step off the stairs onto the landing. Then the new room was all around them.

It looked like a typical casino floor, except that the hundreds of people around them were silent, grey, and semi-transparent. Ash stepped up to a roulette table, and as soon as they entered the perimeter, the other people came to life in full colour, talking and shouting. One man was screaming curses after a presumably disappointing result. He started pounding his fists against the table. They slipped through harmlessly, but judging by the look of satisfaction on his face, Ash could guess that from his perspective he just broke the table in half.

That was one aspect of SLUM Ash had a hard time getting their mind around. Personal reality vs communal reality. As a detective, it was an uncomfortable thought that the world would present itself differently to each individual person.

But they broke away from roulette and followed Abner through the sprawling casino. “This all seems a bit normal,” Ash remarked.

“Well, this is casino classic. There are plenty of others.”

Suddenly there was a door in front of them. Abner led the way through it and they were following a sort of walkway hanging over blackness. Every few steps a new room would materialize next to them, with a step that would allow them to enter it.

The first room to appear looked like a small jungle, and a crowd of people were cheering as they watched two dinosaurs battle each other. Ash had to admit it looked fun. Then they walked on, and the next room contained what appeared to be a giant chessboard. Except on one side were young, beautiful, scantily clad women, and on the other side were towering Gornish mutants. The chessboard they stood upon was awash with blood. A bishop from the stripper side moved up to check a Gornish pawn. She draw a sword nearly as tall as herself, and with a few strokes she dismembered the mutant and tossed its sundry parts aside. Then a Gornish knight moved in to check the bishop. He didn't draw a sword. He knocked her to the ground. Abner quickly kept walking and the room disappeared just as the screaming started.

“This is a nice place, Crane.”

“As if the places you visit in Alporte looking for information are always so wholesome.”

“Speaking of information....”

“We're getting there. I'm taking a circumspect route.”

“Why?”

Another room coalesced next to them. There was a crowd of people in this one. At one end of the room was a spinning wheel. Tied to the wheel was an extraordinarily lifelike representation of Ellen Machida, naked and bloody. As she spun around and around, participants stepped up to throw knifes at her. There were at least 11 sticking in her already, but she continued to scream curses and promises of retribution upon everyone there.

“Wait for it.” Abner held out his arm, keeping Ash back.

Then two identical men in dark suits appeared in the room. All the participants started to panic and flee at the sight of them, but the room quickly blinked into static and then vanished.

“I knew that room wasn't going to last long. The Weavers will be busy for a little while.” Abner grabbed Ash's arm and jumped off the walkway. They fell through blackness and landed in another hallway.

“And who are the Weavers, anyway?” asked Ash, finding the surreal navigations of SLUM to be less alarming as time went by.

“Supposedly an automated defense system to prevent malicious coding from affecting other users, and putting a stop to illegal activities. But since the early days people have suspected they operate in the interests of Alporte City Hall. There is a lot of illegal shit that happens in SLUM, but it's always those things that pose a danger to Alporte's government that goes down first. I can only imagine what Allegra must think of all this.”

“But what do they do?”

“No one knows. They don't carry weapons. They target a site and that site ceases to be. The people caught in those sites when they get deleted have reported that they got force-quit and woke up feeling like they had just had a horrific nightmare. Sometimes. Sometimes we don't hear anything from the people at all.” 

Abner paused and seemed to be thinking back to something. He led the way through a door, and they were in what appeared to be the corridor at a cinema, with doors branching off into various auditoria.

“This is the general entertainment floor. You can access pretty much any movie that's available on the OmniWeb. It's a good place for SLUM date nights, both real and simulated. You can also catch up on news, blogs, and play some video games.”

“Video games *inside* SLUM?” Ash asked with a raised virtual eyebrow.

“Sure. Why not?”

Ash was about to make another comment about something being needless when he recalled that Abner can't even hold a regular controller in the real world and thought the better of it.

A moment later, they were moving through another door. It opened to an auditorium a hundred times larger than Ash would have expected. The seats were packed with people, sprawling out in both directions. At the centre of the massive crowd was a stage. On it there were two women playing musical instruments that attached to their own robotic limbs.

“The Kuiper Sisters,” said Abner. “Live in concert, and the OmniWeb broadcast is exclusive to M0lly Mill10ns. That's why it's so busy. I'm not a huge fan, personally.”

Ash had never heard of the Kuiper Sisters. But when Abner led the way along, pushing through the rows of spectators, they got a little concerned. “Aren't people going to be bothered by us?”

“They don't even notice us. Everyone here is in the front row from their own perspective. Now come on. I think the exit is right about here.”

Abner stamped his foot and the floor fell away beneath them. Suddenly, they were on a staircase going upwards. Ash had to pause and re-orient themselves but Abner was already on the move.

“Can you please explain why you have to take me through this goddamn labyrinth to meet your contact?”

“M0lly Mill10ns tracks every user inside and sees what rooms we go to. But their system only looks at frequency and not duration. So at the end of the night they will think you were just in here sampling.”

The explanation made sense and Ash had to accept it. They followed up the stairs, with blank and monotone grey walls on both sides. Nothing interrupted the smooth surface, until something did. Something caught Ash's eye and they glanced upwards to see an outline of an old-fashioned key etched into the wall, with the word “kestrel” written beneath it.

“Hey, Abner. What's that?” They pointed upwards.

Abner glanced back and got a look of confusion on his face for the first time all night. “I have no idea.”

They kept moving and when Ash glanced back they couldn't tell where the carving had been.

Then another door opened and they found themselves in a room that was familiar to Ash from their first visit here. Luxuriant purple flooring spread out in all directions, lit up with rich lighting. It extended on a curve so there was no wall or ceiling. They were enclosed inside a sphere, beating with electronic pop music and littered with small stages that had poles and spires which connected in the centre. Everywhere there was naked flesh on display. Dancers gyrated on their stages while thousands of spectators shifted in and out. Hot young women, mainly, but there were also some cyborgs and mutants in the mix.

There was one user sitting at a distance from anything else, rigid in his chair, eyes staring blankly forward at nothing in particular.

“Is that the contact?”

Abner laughed. “Yeah, that's the sort of person you would assume, isn't it? There is still a lot for you to learn.” Abner walked forward toward a small stage that was cycling through dancers at a rate of one every five seconds. “Angel 8,” he said.

The massive room dropped away, and the two of them were standing before a circular stage. They were alone, it seemed. They took seats in the two chairs that had materialized for them. Then there was a flash and a woman appeared on the stage.

She was young, lithe, and mostly naked. Wavy, sky-blue hair cascaded onto her shoulders. Soft pale skin glowed under the moon-like lighting. Her firm breasts were bare and they bounced as she danced her liquid tango with the pole. Her hips rocked from side to side, clad only in a tight black pair of panties. She rose from the floor almost like an ocean wave and her silver eyes fell on them.

“Hi, Klein. You're just in time.”

She rose to her feet and turned around, bending over until her fingers caressed the stage floor. With a slow, fluid motion, her fingers gripped her panties and lowered them from her waist down to her ankles. Then when they reached the floor they simply disappeared. And she held that position, letting her firm, round ass sway from side to side, smooth pale flesh broken up by the pink lips peeking out from between her legs.

Ash glanced over at Abner, but his face here was as unreadable as it was in the real world. Ash wasn't about to cast any moral judgements on someone's interest in erotic entertainment, but they still didn't understand how this was getting them any closer to Abner's elusive contact.

She crawled across the floor, rising up like a cobra and perching on her knees. She moved like a lava lamp, hands running the length of her body, slender fingers reaching the crevice between her legs and slipping inside her.

Ash shook their head. They had enjoyed similar entertainment on many occasions before, but this felt odd. Distant. Though, they mused, it was probably due to the level 1 connection they had.

Eyes following every movement of the woman, Abner asked, “Can I take you private?”

“Isn't this … private?” asked Ash, looking around at the darkness that encompassed their staging area.

“Not exactly.” Abner snapped his fingers and suddenly the room was full of the ghostly images of hundreds of other users sitting in chairs just like them. And there were hundreds of transparent echoes of the dancer moving in front of them just as she was in front of Abner.

“This is confusing,” Ash muttered.

“Sure,” the dancer said. “There's a lack of good conversation in this room anyway.” She looked upward, the timbre of her voice changing slightly. “A gentleman is taking me private. Sorry. But meet me on floor 403 for blackjack.” The hundreds of other users all disappeared. “I can only stay for half an hour,” she said to Abner. “I'm dealing erotic blackjack downstairs. It's really fun. It's like normal blackjack, except every time I bust I have to … well, I won't ruin the surprise.”

“Maybe,” said Abner. “But I'm here on business.”

She laughed. “When do we ever not talk business?” She leaned over his chair, her breasts hanging just in front of his face, a finger trailing along his jawline.

“I … uhh, *ahem*. I'd like you to meet Ash, my boss. Ash, this is Angel 8.”

Abner stayed frozen in his chair, jaw quivering nervously, when she pulled away from him. Ash caught sight of a counter, suspended in the air, that was counting up Capeks as the minutes ticked by.

“Oh, you're treating your boss. That's quite nice of you. Is this because that big guy won employee of the month?” She turned her eyes on Ash and slinked toward them, lissome and naked, moving like blood in water. “Nice to meet you. But don't tell me. I always like to size up a new patron. What are you into? Slick and nubile” There was a shimmering over her body and her look changed a bit. The pale skin took on a more tanned hue. She was covered in a sheen of oil that shone in the light. She was petite and waif-like, and her body utterly hairless. “Hmmm. No, not that. You like something a bit more classic.” There was another shimmer and the oil sheen disappeared. Her skin turned a bit paler again, with slightly more pronounced curves and rounder breasts, and a wedge of dark pubic hair trimmed above her lips.

“This really isn't necessary,” Ash said. “I'm not even sure why I'm—”

“Oh, I know. I bet you like all natural.” There was another shimmer. Her hair took on a wilder, messier look from the perfectly coiffed do she had just had. Her other hair changed too. Pubic hair grew thick and wild between her legs, and as she crawled forward there were tufts that peeked out from under her arms. “And maybe a little bit dirty.” Her skin took on a sheen of sweat and was streaked with dirt, like she'd been doing an army crawl in the hot sun.

Ash continued to feel very strange when she climbed on top of them. They felt a pressure on their legs, yes. And they felt the sensation of hands running along their torso. And just the sight of Angel 8 would surely have sent their head spinning in any real Alporte stripclub, but here it still felt they were being mounted by a mannequin.

“You're not going to get anywhere with them,” said Abner. “They're only on a level one connection.”

“What the fuck?” Angel 8 jumped back to her feet. “How long were you going to let me embarrass myself? What would possess you to bring your boss here on a level one. That's so mean, for him and for me.” She turned back to Ash. “Sorry for him, babe. He's a certified genius but he doesn't like to think. Of course it wasn't so bad back in the old days. In SLUM 1.0 everyone was on level one connections and it was fine. In the old rigs you could just disconnect everything but the visor and jack off manually. But they introduced the neural interface and downgraded the level one connection, so now level ones are just wandering around like Ken dolls.”

She raised her foot and pressed it hard into Ash's crotch. They could see it there, but it didn't provoke any sensation for them at all.

“It's a damn shame, but … hey, wait a second.” She leaned in and looked at Ash's eyes. “Oh, fuck, you're a woman. I'm sorry. I didn't realize.”

“Don't worry about it,” Abner cut in.

“No, I can tell, you're looking at my tits knowingly. Don't worry. They're not real.” She laughed. “Remember when being real was such a prized attribute among females?” She headed back to the stage, spinning slowly around the pole as she talked. “When I started at Slut Salon, everyone was still totally legit. We set up 3D omnicams in our room and projected them into SLUM. We were in the flesh; everything we did we did for real. I caught a lot of flak just for using a facial augment to disguise my identity. And the guys just watched. Communicated with text or voice if we were feeling generous. But people started demanding more interactivity and the girls started going full virtual. The good news is that styling an avatar is less work then getting ready in real life. But I feel like some of the pride has gone out of performance. And the fact that things aren't as real means that guys start getting a lot more expectations. Maybe reality isn't so bad. I try to keep a little reality going. I can make minor cosmetic tweaks to my body, maybe add some ears and a fox tail if I'm feeling really adventurous. But I keep things overall pretty consistent. Some of the girls here have fifteen or sixteen completely different skins they'll put on at anyone's request. I won't. I like to keep some semblance of an actual identity in here, you know?”

Ash knew.

And Angel 8 started slinking back toward them, unabashedly naked. She jumped into Abner's lap, settling into him, breasts thrust outward and her back arched, so she could whisper in his ear. “I hope you like me dirty, Klein, because I don't feel like changing again.”

“OK, what the fuck?” Ash finally stood up. “I'm sorry. You seem very nice and I'm sure I could have had a lovely virtual evening with you in different circumstances, but I'm only here because Ab— Klein promised to introduce me to his informant.”

Both Angel 8 and Abner started to laugh. The nude woman jumped back to her feet and headed to Ash, walking tight circles around him. “What do you want to know, honey? Information passes through my room like shit passes through a Gornish market. It's everywhere and it stinks”

“Her performing name is Angel 8,” Abner said. “You might know her better as Ellis Robertson.”

Ash coughed. “Ellis Robertson? From CityWatch?”

“Formerly of CityWatch, yes.” She stepped back onto the stage, stretching out her back and falling into the splits. “I started there as a plucky young intern when they were still reporting real news. Then the butterfly moved in and everything went to shit. Some people resisted for a while, but once heads started to roll I decided it was more respectable to be a virtual whore in SLUM than a propaganda whore for Alporte government.”

“And now you're an informant?”

“I both disseminate and acquire valuable pieces of information. Spit and swallow, if you will. Your employee Klein here is one of my trusted allies. He helps me set up proxies to keep my blog posts untraceable. Machida's goons are always falling over themselves trying to find me. In return, I give him some juicy bits of intel when we have our alone time.”

She crawled forward from the stage and then climbed up Abner to perch in his lap.

“Isn't this a bit of an odd set-up, though?”

“Why would it be odd? Are you telling me you've never hit up a stripper or prossie for information out on the streets? They get info by the score and so do we. Guys like to talk when they're with a hot woman, and when they have tits in their face they don't care so much to curate what they are talking about. From there it's just a game of patience.”

Ash couldn't argue with that.

“And besides, we're standing on tradition here. When the Weavers first started attacking the street corner blogs, people were looking for a covert place to talk politics. Alporte politics, specifically. Slut Salon was it. Cranberry led the charge, with me and a couple others. There was a trusted cabal of patrons we would do special shows for. We'd get naked quick and then talk for hours. The salon got larger as we were able to coax other members into it. They placed enough love and trust in us that they listened. We had a good run. SLUM's banquet days.”

“Slut Salon got shut down, didn't it?”

“Oh yes,” said Abner. “And residents were none too happy about it. That was rough.”

“I'm not sure if you even know the whole story, Klein. It was Cranberry. Cranberry Nixon. She created us and she brought us down. As time went on, she was less satisfied with just talking. She wanted to take more action. You see, she was a girl of particular skills. She got into some really extreme shit in her performances. And she counted among her patrons two prominent members of City Council. She was ready to blow the lid on them and their unique proclivities, hoping it would tear them down. But someone blabbed something to someone. The next thing we knew the Weavers moved in and Slut Salon got iced. All of us girls were booted, with two week suspensions. Just long enough to keep us from getting together in the immediate aftermath. Cranberry … no one knows.”

“Aren't you worried about the same thing happening here?”

“The good news is that there is no way to shut down M0lly Mill10ns without shutting down SLUM entirely, and the Weavers don't have that much power. The other good news is that they don't notice me since I got Allegra's magic pill.”

“Wait.” said Abner. “You got the mod  to conceal yourself from Weavers? Did it actually come from Allegra?”

“I know the story, but I won't pretend to follow the Allegra mystery better than you. All I know is it works.”

“So what are you doing now, beyond … this?” asked Ash as Angel 8 gyrated against Abner in his chair.

“I'm long gone from Alporte, but I keep my ear to the ground in here and publish my blog posts as needed. There is one coming out for Citizens Day about the clusterfuck of Brushwells SOMA housing project.”

“What about?”

“One building with a rampant black mould problem. Shady maintenance workers shook down the tenants twice and still never fixed it. One family had their infant son die. There isn't much being said about that because Brushwell paid them off and moved them uptown.”

“Their son died and they just took a pay-off?” Abner asked.

“They have three other kids they need to feed, clothe, and put through school. The parents are PopGorn sewage workers who couldn't even afford to keep a bank account open. It was either accept a life-changing payout from the man who killed your son or embark on a lawsuit that will ruin you before it begins. What would you do?”

They sat in silence for a moment before Ash asked, “Anything else?”

“I'm chasing a story about something called the Red House. It's also located down there in the SOMA housing project. It connects to a brothel that operates in the inner circle. What I've learned so far is … disturbing. They snatch up women. Derelict, disfigured, mutated. Ones too poor and misfortunate to have anyone or anything of value on the outside. Ones too ugly to work a street corner in the real world. But they hook them up the SLUM rigs and they can doll them up nice and pretty. They do full service on the worst shitbags you can find in SLUM. They are kept in level three and aren't allowed to exit until they reach their quota. Rumour has it the Red House also holds some political prisoners that Brushwell doesn't want to get out.”

“Holy fuck.”

“I know.”

“Have you heard anything about the Drake case?”

“Drake? I probably know as much as you. Ellen Machida had him killed but there is currently no way to prove it. There are rumours of this former spec-ops agent in the city. Scary motherfuckers. Supposedly Ellen met with him. At least I think it was a him. I'll let you know if I hear anything else.  Anyway, I have to get ready for blackjack, but feel free to hit me up at any time. And you had better be on a level two connection when you do. And Klein, it's always a pleasure.” 

She pecked Abner on the lips and then disappeared. The floating counter next to Abner's charge froze at 75.

“Did you just spend 75 Capeks on this session?” asked Ash.

“... Yes,” Abner replied meekly.

“Well, don't forget to fill out an expense report.”"
6l51op,8,2017-07-04,Am I too old for her?,PutThisInTheTraaaash,AskParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/6l51op/am_i_too_old_for_her/,"Hi, parents. I'm hoping you can give me some advice about something, but if I'm being honest, I'm pretty sure I already know the answer. This may just be thinking out loud, but I would really value some advice from you folks.

I met a girl recently. We've been talking the last few days, we connect really well, we have a lot of personality in common and she is a really, genuinely, sincerely kind person. The issue is, it turns out she's 17, going into her senior year, and I'm 20, going into my junior year of University. As clever as she is, I know there can be quite a maturity difference between 17 and 20.

I have no bad intentions, I study computer science, I have solid grades and an internship. By all accounts, I'm a good guy with some cool stuff going on, but also, I've been out of high school a while. I can handle a lot more than I could when I was 17, I'm a lot more comfortable with things I wasn't before, and I don't want to be a bad influence or make her life more complex than it needs to be while she finishes up school.

What do you think? On the one hand, 3 years doesn't sound like a big deal, she's really smart, and if she were going into her first year of university I kind of doubt I'd think as much about it. On the other hand, we're simply in different places in life, and I'm worried I'd be a negative presence, I guess. Am I right on here, or am I not giving her enough credit?

Lastly, to be clear, sex isn't even on the table here. We're both of legal age in our state, but I'm not interested in putting that pressure on someone who may respond based on my age or whatever, but aside from that, I personally am a little shy about it."
6l54fn,1,2017-07-04,Branding and hospitality: What’s your differentiation?,Swiss_17,HospitalInc,https://www.reddit.com/r/HospitalInc/comments/6l54fn/branding_and_hospitality_whats_your/,"Not a week appears to go by without the opening of a luxury hotel somewhere in the world. Just take a look a consumer travel magazine and you'll see all sorts of new concepts and offerings flooding the market. Until about 15 years ago, the differentiation between luxury hotel brands was clear. Guests knew who was who and what was what. Today, the market is saturated with many different hotels, brands and offerings. If you factor in the disruption of new entrants due to technology, it is not surprising that customers are confused. As client demands are also changing, is it any wonder then that many luxury hotels are struggling to maintain their competitive edge?
 
Faced with so much choice, how can consumers decide what is right for them? And how can hotel businesses distinguish their offering to attract clients? Business case studies across the years have proven that focusing solely on product – room type, facilities, etc. – is not sufficient. They do not leave a lasting imprint in consumer's minds. Experience is everything – and that is why branding is back on the table for luxury hotels.
 
Hotel or brand?
Based on a series of interviews with 18 international hotel managers, my research into the topic has aimed to obtain first-hand insights into the challenges hoteliers are currently facing and the strategies they are adopting to attract clients and maintain a competitive advantage. But when I asked about their brand differentiator, many of them talked in the context of a hotel operation or its service offering, yet only a few managers were able to explain their differentiation. The more I probed, the more it became clear that the hotel itself was unsure about its brand positioning. If the hotel manager is unable to articulate the differentiator – or worse, does not even see it on his or her radar – how can we expect customers to be clear about the offer?
 
The question is - are you a hotel or a brand? Many large, medium and small hotels offer very similar product offerings. Often there is not a great deal of individual personality either. When customer choice depends solely on products that are instantly comparable in terms of price and features, it leaves hotels vulnerable. But a brand has longevity. A brand can weather market storms. What makes a true brand that will stay with the consumer forever?
 
Service or hospitality?
Luxury hotels are in the business of taking care of people. This goes beyond service. In a Tedx Talk on hospitality, restaurateur Bobby Stuckey describing. In essence, creating a brand personality is about defining your offering. Of course there is the tangible offering - the quality of the rooms, the spa, the dining rooms, for example. These have to be first class. And of course, there is quality of service and how it is perceived by your guests, and that is why hotel managers spend so long drilling its importance into their staff. But the best hotels, those that are succeeding, stretch their definition beyond these two elements to incorporate the concept of hospitality.
 
Luxury hotels are in the business of taking care of people. This goes beyond service.
 
luxury hospitality – it needs to be a transformative experience. It should change something in each person. It should create cherished memories, enrich their experience and become part of their life story.
 
Guests arrive from all around the world. It is vital to go beyond cultural difference by not judging the difference, but to deliver the care even before the guests know they are in need. Hospitality in Asia is different than in the west. 
 
Service is action-orientated. Care is universal. As Bobby Stuckey defines it, service is 'what you do to someone', hospitality is 'how you make someone feel'. When care is offered, it provokes a feeling. The feeling transmits between people. True care changes the emotion. And the impact spreads. This is hospitality. True luxury hotel brands develop and nurture hospitality and integrate it into a brand DNA.

As you all know by now, the 2017 Regional Convention released a new film called ""Remember the Wife of Lot"". It was divided into three parts, with one part shown each day. This movie covers the story of an Asian sister named Gloria and her family's ""struggle"" with trying to balance finances with spirituality. This film is as rancid as it gets, I'd definitely put it as one of the shittier films that have been excreted out of Watchtower's anus. So, without further ado, let us get into ""Stereotypes: The Movie"".

**Part 1**

When I say stereotypes, I MEAN stereotypes. I don't know what kind of racial agenda Tight Pants Tony and his crew are trying to push here, but they didn't do a very good job of hiding it. The Asian family has their daughters practice piano, has an insistance on shoes being taken off when entering the house (a fact that is mentioned twice in the film), and Gloria's mother being a ""tiger mom"", an overbearing Asian mother who demands that her offspring become rich and successful, so as not to ""DISHONA DA FAMIRY!"". Gloria's husband, Brian, has a bible study and co-worker named Joe. Joe is a hot headed construction worker who happens to be a Catholic (or Christian of some kind) and loves tacos. Did I mention he's Mexican? All he needs now is a sombrero and a donkey to complete the look!

In all seriousness, this movie is a load of horseshit for one other reason: the wife of Lot theme. The wife of Lot a minor character in the bible, without even a name to identify her. If you recall the biblical account, Lot and his family had to flee the wicked city of Sodom and Gomorrah as it was being blown to smithereens by Jehovah. Even though they were instructed not to look back, Lot's wife turned her head 180 degrees and transformed into a pillar of salt as punishment. Lot and his two remaining daughters find refuge up in a mountain and start getting freaky with eachother. Incest? More like wincest! (vomits) Not only this story disturbing as fuck, it goes to show how cruel and unfair Jehovah is in his judgements. King Manasseh ruled Jerusalem, and corrupted the good spiritual values of the people and even murdered the prophet Isaiah. Jehovah, angered by this, sent the Assyrian army (ASSYRIANS AT THE GATE!) to capture King Manasseh. King Manasseh begged Jehovah for forgiveness in prayer and he was indeed forgiven and released. He went on to tear down the idols and rebuild God's temple until he died and was succeeded by his son Amon. So apparently, even if you kill a fucking prophet (y'know, the literal MESSENGERS OF GOD) you can be absolved of your sins. But glance in the wrong direction? YOUR ASS IS GRASS, PREPARE TO DIE.

So the movie starts with an overly sappy piano instrumental, and shows Gloria talking to some real estate clients and narrating about we cannot serve two master. We go into a flashback to two years earlier as we see Gloria teaching one of her daughters, Tina, how to play the piano (take a shot for every stereotype). She gets up to help her other daughter, Anna, prepare dinner. The father Brian comes through the door after a long day of work. Brian tells her about his new bible study Joe, and she coos at how wonderful it is that they get to indoctrinate another poor soul into their cult. 

We cut to a shot of Joe pulling up in front of their home, with the daughters and Gloria looking concerned about the unfamiliar car. He rings their doorbell and is let in by Brian. Brian asks him to take his shoes off, with an irritated Joe bitterly complying (come on man it's just shoes, it takes like 2 seconds). Brian introduces Joe to his family and then they go into his office and gives him a copy of the NWT and What Does the Bible Really Teach book, with Brian hitting all the marks in his sales pitch. Joe rants about how nobody is honest anymore, especially in his workplace, while the women eavesdrop outside the door. Brian calms Joe down and tells him that the best way to cope is with scriptural principles, to which Joe replies ""I can't help it man, I was BORN angry!"" (cue audience laughter). Brian, continuing with the pitch, tells him that in order to please God, we must ~~get brainwashed~~ put on the new personality. Joe yells that he cannot be somebody that he's not, and to be honest he makes a good point. We should not have to force ourselves to change our way of thinking in order to swallow what is supposedly ""the truth"". Brian offers to study with Joe at his home, and on his way to the door is stopped by Gloria who offers tea and gross foreign Asian snacks!!!!! How dare she try to be hospitable!!!

We are now in Joe's home, his two sons Ricky and Arthur playing video games and his wife preparing dinner (like a woman should! /s). Joe comes home and greets his family, and his wife notices the publications in his hands. She questions his wherabouts as Joe sheepishly tells him about Brian and his family. They sit down for dinner (TACOS!) and begin to pray as the camera pans to a cross hanging on the wall. One thing I want to say about Joe is that I'm just not convinced he's ""that bad"". Everyone talks about how Joe has extreme temper problems, but I just don't see anything that convinces me of that. He does get kinda angry over little things and is rude sometimes, but isn't that the purpose of an etiquette course? It really isn't necessary to convert to a tiny doomsday religion to solve that, just google ""anger managements classes near me"" and you'll be golden.

We are then introduced to Gloria's mother Ruby and her uncle (simply named uncle). Uncle is mad at Ruby for her daughter not being successful and joining his real estate company, so Ruby takes Gloria to a nail salon (OF COURSE the nail salon is owned by Asians) and tells her the story of how she grew up in poverty (*old grandpa voice* BACK IN MY DAY) and that she had to share her sisters hole-riddled shoes. She continues to guilt trip Gloria about her decision to pioneer over working, and although Gloria is not convinced on the spot, it slowly gets to her. To be fair, I do sympathize with Gloria and her struggles. Many Asian families put status over everything, and that a good appearance is key to acceptance in society. But these values are reflected in Watchtower, too. Watchtower takes the same extreme of constantly berating you for not contributing as much as possible, and even Tony Baloney said that sisters should strive to marry a ministerial servant. Is that not putting status and appearance as an unhealthily high priority like Ruby is doing to Gloria? In fact, if Gloria's family weren't Jehovah's Witnesses, everything would be PERFECT. Brian and Gloria's marriage don't suffer because of her job, they buy a nice new apartment, and Uncle even gives Gloria's daughter Anna a pharmaceutical internship. The ONLY reason why all of this falls through is because of the guilt and shame that Gloria's family get from not serving Watchtower faithfully. It reminds me how often Jehovah's Witnesses, young and old, give up incredible opportunities to believe in nothing more than smoke and mirrors because of the indoctrination that is so strong in them.

One thing I want to note is the transitions. When they transition to a new part of the story, they have these drawings of the characters and cheesy guitar music. It really is like a sitcom. Even during the scene where Uncle is talking to Ruby, there's a comedic Seinfeld-esque background music to accompany it. This whole movie is actually very comedic, a sort of light heartedness in between all the angst.

Brian and Gloria are out cart witnessing, and Brian notices that Gloria is bothered. Gloria expresses her worry of having a stable income. She believes that the real estate job offered by her Uncle is the answer to her prayers, but that she may have to stop pioneering for a while until she settles into it. Brian reassures her that they have enough, and that Jehobo would take care of them. Gloria wants to provide the best for her children and support their family. A man passes by their cart and Gloria smiles and stops talking immediately, which goes to show the whole appearance thing I was talking about (and providing some laughs for the audience). Brian is very obviously the voice of Watchtower in the movie, with Gloria being the voice of the ""world"". 

Brian remembers his bible study with Joe, and they go to Joe's home to talk with him and his wife. Joe's wife Mary is concerned with giving up their own religion and culture, but Gloria says that they never had to give up any traditions of their ethnicity (because this is how people of color talk, right? C'mon Sam, couldn't you give the rest of the old out of touch white dudes some insight into that?). Brian says that they still respect their culture, but avoid the parts that don't please Big Brother, like giving food to their dead ancestors. Mary says she would never do something like that, and apparently forgets that Dia de los Muertos exists. Joe's sons Ricky and Arthur come home and are introduced to Brian and Gloria, and find out that they go to the same school as Tina and Anna. I'll give a quote from Arthur: ""Oh yeah, I've definitely seen them around. They're both so... uh.... really brainy!"" And comedic music and laughter ensues. Brian invites the family to the meetings; Mary shows some hesitation but would consider going.

Gloria and Brian continue to bicker about the real estate job and Ruby's influence. Gloria wants her daughters to have good jobs, but Brian continues to be the good WT drone and resist Gloria's ideas of getting a career, for both her and her girls.

Anna and Tina talk about Ricky and Arthur, and make fun of how their parents would never let them date eachother because the boys aren't in the truth. Gloria steps in and gives a speech about how they need to date someone with the same standards about career and education as them, and Anna cracks a joke about they should only marry in the lord instead of social class. Brian gets mad at Gloria for allowing the girls to study for a test instead of going to the meetings, while the girls are at the door getting ready to head out (somewhere). Gloria flies off the handle when Anna tries to wear a pair of Tina's shoes, obviously traumatized by her mother's story of poverty. This scene is just fucking stupid, and you have to see it to really understand.

Meanwhile, Joe and Mary argue about going to the meetings. Mary does not want to go to the meetings because she believes it would be just like her experiences at church, where everyone ignores her. Mary agrees to go, but doesn't make any promises about attending more than once. This brings me to the other slew of shit Watchtower throws at us - bashing religions that aren't them. The film makes references to Mary's lack of bible education and the failure of mainstream Christianity, that all Christians are cold and don't show the warm brotherly affection (barf) that we get at the meetings. But may I remind you of the harsh shunning policy that forces other witnesses not to talk to those that dissent or break the rules? At least many churches do not implement this kind of abuse to its believers, and are much more godly in this way. I'm surprised Joe and Mary have such a good first impression of the meetings, weren't there a couple of people sitting in the back row that would leave early or no one would talk to?

So Joe and Mary come to the meetings, and CONVIENTLY, the talk given is called ""No One Can Slave for Two Masters"". The speaker says that many people today are enslaved, but do not know (much like Watchtower followers!). If you ever heard of a talk on the two masters shit, it's basically what he said while once again, CONVIENTLY touching on all the things Gloria is going through. He gives the example of Lot, who at first lived near the city of Sodom but eventually moved into the city. The speaker uses the tactic of what I call ""gap filling"", or filling in parts of the bible that aren't specifically explained with your own ideas about what happened (making the process of spinning bible stories to fit your own narratibe much easier), saying that Lot **may** have been pressured by his wife or culture. And as well all know, Lot's wife looked back, **possibly** because of her attachment to the material things she left behind (OR MAYBE BECAUSE THE CITY THEY LEFT IS BEING BLOWN UP, AND YOU TEND TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU START HEARING EXPLOSIONS). Of course Gloria is thoroughly guilt tripped and she starts having visions of her being turned into salt in these bizarre, almost horror movie like scenes that probably scared the shit out of all the kids in the audience.

Brian introduced Joe and Mary to the speaker after the meeting, who enjoyed the talk very much. Joe asks where the speaker's wife is and finds out he's a widower, and Brian wastes no time in injecting the resurrection faith, taking advantage of the story of a man's dead wife to further WT's propaganda. Joe asks how much the speaker (who I forgot to mention is a CO) makes, to which Brian replies that he's a volunteer, and that all his expenses are paid by the congregation. Joe freaks out and gets mad that the CO doesn't have a job like him and Brian, but Brian tells him that he does a lot of preaching and teaching work (y'know, important stuff!). Joe and Brian's families part ways and Gloria, although enjoying the talk, wonders why the brothers don't just have a good job AND be a faithful servant, to which Brian says that those who pursued material things left and haven't come back (or maybe they just got tired of being micromanaged by a cult). Gloria, not having any witty retorts to make to her husband, says to start walking faster cause she doesn't want to miss her TV show (cue laughtrack).

Mary is talking to her boys about her experience at the meeting, saying how much she loved it and that she didn't even know the bible had so many books! (fml) Ricky and Arthur mock their mother and Mary gets angry. She resolves to continue going to meetings and sitting in on Joe's bible studies.

At home, Gloria and her mother watch what is presumably a comedy show, to which Gloria remarks that the main characters are gay couple (NO, THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!) and that it would've bothered Ruby only a few years ago, but Ruby says that times are changing and it's not a big deal. I'm honestly proud of Ruby, despite her pressuring her daughter so much. So many old people hate homosexuality because it's ""just the time they were raised in"". But I don't think for a second that that's a good excuse, everyone can take the responsibility of choosing whether or not to hate. It's 2017, there aren't anymore excuses a person could make to hate a whole group of people. Ruby starts nagging her daughter again about getting a real estate job, saying how much DISHONA she brings onto their family. Gloria doesn't understand why her mother is trying to impress relatives she doesn't even like, and her mother utters a simple ""nevermind"". All of a sudden, Gloria reveals that she is going to take real estate classes and asks Ruby to get her a job at her Uncle's company. Ruby, absolutely delighted, says that Gloria is now ""talking like a good daughter"".

And of course, the video bafflingly ends with, no joke, ""NEXT TIME ON REMEMBER THE WIFE OF LOT."" I just... wow. I wasn't joking when I said this movie was like a sitcom.

So this ends my Part 1 Commentary on Remember the Wife of Lot. I give it a -100000000000/10. ""NEXT TIME ON THE REMEMBER THE WIFE OF LOT COMMENTARY, I TACKLE THE WORST PART OF THE FILM. HOMOPHOBIA, GREED, LIES, AND SEX (okay not really sex, this is a family picture) ARE PACKED INTO A 30 MINUTE VIDEO IN WHICH I WILL WATCH IN CRINGE AND HORROR. TUNE IN NEXT TIME!."""
6l5wd3,6,2017-07-04,Which job title to pick? Business Analyst or Business intelligence Analyst,AFCSentinel,BusinessIntelligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessIntelligence/comments/6l5wd3/which_job_title_to_pick_business_analyst_or/,"I started out with a company as an intern and now they have decided to hire me. Since I was working a lot on a BI project I was assuming they would hire me as a Business Intelligence Analyst. However on the contract they offered me my role is titled as Business Analyst. Does this make much of a difference? A quick Google search seems to point towards Business Analyst being a less hands-on role with more focus on acting as an interface between IT and business, ""translating"" their requirements. The role description on the other hand is very much focused on me working on the DWH, designing reports and so on. I'd say it's about 80% SQL coding or working in our new BI tool. 

Therefore I am wondering if I should inquire to have my role title changed and if it really matters. Would people, if they see Business Analyst on my CV rate me as less capable than a Business Intelligence Analyst? "
6l5wve,8,2017-07-04,My girlfriend thinks she may be bisexual - What can I do to support her?,JDPhipps,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/6l5wve/my_girlfriend_thinks_she_may_be_bisexual_what_can/,"This seemed like the place to ask this question.

I've been with my girlfriend for over three and a half years now. She thought she was a lesbian when she was much younger (I'm talking pre-teens, around there) because she had never felt an attraction for men. However, she figured she was straight when she started getting crushes on men. In college though, when we would drink she would start to display some bisexual tendencies. I certainly know of the stereotypes--girls will experiment in college, or whatever--but over time they became a little more overt and came out with less alcohol. Unbeknownst to me at first, she started to question her own sexuality. She eventually told me this toward the end of senior year, and we talked about it. I told her I wasn't upset with her or anything, and that I wanted her to figure this out about herself. It didn't really come up again, though, until kind of recently.

She's out of the country for an internship and her female roommate asked her if she wanted to make out. She was interested, but she didn't want to do anything without double-checking with me. I gave her the go-ahead--again, I want her to know this about herself--but it hasn't happened yet. The initial encounter occurred while she was drinking, but even when stone sober she's still interested in giving this a shot next time an opportunity arises. I gave her a few ground rules, but otherwise told her that I was fine with it. I told her she didn't need to ask me again if the opportunity came up but that I would appreciate it if she could text me to give me a heads up, and that afterward I would like to talk about it to see how she was feeling. The only other thing I asked was that for right now, she keep it limited to making out; basically, I didn't want her to go beyond kissing and maybe them getting a little handsy if it came to that. She agreed to this stuff. Her and some other Americans there for the internship are having a party tomorrow night for Independence Day, and I have a feeling the opportunity will come up. I have no doubt that when it does, she'll take it. I don't know what will come of it, but a number of my other friends who are non-straight said that she seemed like she may be more than a drunk straight girl. I haven't told any of our friends about this because she asked me not to, but none of our friends use Reddit and I figured this would be a safe spot to ask questions.

Basically, assuming she isn't turned off of the whole thing by making out with another girl, how else can I support her? I truly just want to give her the chance to experiment with her sexuality and figure this whole thing out for herself. I know that she loves me and is really just confused about her sexuality, and I trust her implicitly; after all, even while drunk her first thought was to text me and make sure I was okay with it. I knew when we first talked about this that it might happen, and I was alright with it. However, I don't know if there's anything else I can do to support her and make her feel loved and accepted while she figures this out. If it comes to it, I think I'm even okay with her going farther with another girl while we're in this relationship, but for right now we both agreed she would just kind of dip her toes in, so to speak. I was a little uncomfortable with her jumping to anything overtly sexual right away, and she says she doesn't want to do that with anyone else. If that changes though, I think I'll be okay with giving her that go ahead.

What else can I do? I have been looking for stuff on the internet, but most of it is a lot of homophobia and other stuff on men's websites. To people who may have been in this situation before, what happened that helped or is something I should try to avoid? Other than consenting to her experimenting with her bisexuality, are there other direct actions I can take that will make her feel more comfortable in doing this? I apologize for the long post, but any advice you fine folks can give me is appreciated. I love her so much, and I want to help her with this as much as I possibly can.

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend thinks she may be bisexual, and (with my consent) is almost definitely going to end up making out with her female roommate tomorrow. What else can I do to help her as she tries to figure this out?"
6l60s6,8,2017-07-04,[NeedAdvice] I just fucked up my masterstudy and have no idea what to do.,Candytorro,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/6l60s6/needadvice_i_just_fucked_up_my_masterstudy_and/,"Hey,
I will try to keep it as short as possible, but here are several things coming together, so it might take a while. I am from Germany and studied psychology in the Netherlands, at first with the idea to become a therapist sometime. I started my study in 2009 and finished my bachelor degree in 2013. I wasn't an A-grade student or something, but it went ok overall. 
Then I did my masterstudy and first I failed at some subject. I had to repeat them and did it, but then I failed at my first attempt for my masterthesis. I then started an internship as a part of my study which went horribly wrong. They basicly told me after a few weeks that I have no business in this field. They saw me personality-wise as someone who can't deal with people. I was crushed. The internship was finished shortly after and with that I completely lost my confidence. My relationship failed one week after that. That was in 2015. Since then I started another masterthesis and failed with deadlines regarding that, as well. I think I was scared of failure like I failed with my internship. After that went bad, I fell into a hole. 
Last year in June, I got diagnosed with cancer in my balls. Of course it was a shock at first. But it's weird. Dealing with cancer was easier for me than dealing with my study, my future and the question what I am good at. I followed the plan, had an operation and chemotherapy. It all worked out. I figured if I can beat cancer like that I can also get my fucking masterdegree, right?
Well, wrong. Active selfdiscipline and planning are different issues than passively following a treatment other people are responsible for. I started my new and last attempt for a thesis in March, fucked up again. They gave me a last chance with that topic if I would follow a strict plan. At first it seemed to finally work. Somehow I managed to get the first two deadlines done. 

However, I didn't manage to get my shit done for this new deadline, so here I am now: all subjects done for years, money wasted and nothing to show for it. Looking back, all my failures came down to a lack of discipline and selfdoubts since my internship. There were times that I didn't know why I would do my study since my boss at my internship told me I am not capable of working with people in that way. For some reason I believed that person and let her shatter my confidence instead of asking myself if this one judgement of this one person is really true.

Well, my go-to strategy for these kind of situations would be hiding and denying that things are bad and waiting things out until they get better themselves. Since this hasn't worked out over the last 4 years, I thought I would try a different approach this time. I want to ask for help and get myself engaged with my situation by talking about it and doing something about it. However, I am afraid. I don't feel like an independent person who knows a lot about life and how to manage myself. And I would like to learn something about that. I want to be active and proud and independent about what I do with my life. But in the last years, I feel like I was all talk and no act.

I am feeling empty right know, I got kicked out an hour ago, so I am sorry if things aren't formulated in a coherent way."
6l6flr,2468,2017-07-04,"Jagex, we need to talk.",OctoberOSRS,2007scape,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/6l6flr/jagex_we_need_to_talk/,"A short while ago Jagex made the difficult decision of nerfing Zulrah. As a result, the price of most PVM gear took a nosedive and a lot of players had to change the way they play. While there were many players opposed to this decision, it was done with two things in mind, long-term sustainability and the integrity of the game. 

&amp;nbsp;


Now we find ourselves facing a familiar issue, botting. It has gotten to the point where they are interfering with legitimate players’ runescape experience and needs to be addressed by Jagex. 

&amp;nbsp;


As soon as a new player leaves tutorial island, they are competing with hundreds of bots for basic resources, get constantly spammed by phishing and gold selling websites, and are inhibited from experiencing the early joys of runescape. Now you may say ""this is only for low level bots that get caught early by jagex so once you get past the early f2p experience you’ll be fine”, but even now when I visit rimmington to plant some berries, I see numerous bots using the house portal, then on my way to buy daily staffs, I will see 2-3 bots hopping through to buy out Zaff’s stock within the 2 seconds I use the store, then of course the spamming bots in ge when I go to sell the staffs. But it doesn’t stop there. Recently I decided to go for 99 mining and have been persistently chasing this goal. I put up a few hundred k xp/day and would watch my rank hardly climb at all as I went from level 87-97. How could this be? Do you mean to tell me that ~5k other players happen to be grinding as hard as I’ve been for the past 2 months? I took to the highscores and this is what I found: [thisisnotgood](http://imgur.com/a/JRnlw)

&amp;nbsp;


Not only is it incredibly demoralizing to know that while I’m slaving away in these mines, there are thousands of bots levelling right next to me, but it is appalling to see how many bots are making it to the top 50 rank completely unscathed. Now this is just my experience. I see posts almost daily [example](ex: https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/41eo61/seriously_fuck_bots_every_world_is_full_of_bots/)
identifying other areas where bots are inhibiting a player from enjoying the game and it is widely known to be an issue with OSRS.

&amp;nbsp;


I understand that bots are constantly evolving and it is a challenge for Jagex to stay on top of them, but it really feels like this issue is being, and will continue to be swept under the rug for the foreseeable future. I’m sure I am not alone in saying that I would really appreciate if Jagex could at least recognize this as a problem they will work towards resolving and share their intentions for doing so in the near and long-term future. Why not work with your player base to find a solution?

&amp;nbsp;


If the reason bots still exist is that they bring in so much revenue from membership fees, work with us to address this. Do you need to charge us an extra $2 a month to make up for it? Show us what it’ll realistically take. If gold farming bots are dealt with, players will be forced to buy gp through bonds instead of gold farming sites, so the money lost from those subscriptions would come right back to Jagex in the form of bond revenue. Can you not hire a couple bot busting interns full-time to deal with them? How about player mods that will cost you nothing? Or is this just something I will need to deal with because ""they're too big of a problem to solve""? I mean can we at least deal with these bots with rank as shown above?

&amp;nbsp;


I apologize for the long post, but all this is to say that I hope we can have this difficult conversation in an open manner to get to a solution, so that we can all continue to play OSRS for another 10 years. Thank you for reading this and I hope love and serenity can be a catalyst for change and everlasting fulfillment. 

&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR  Bots are literally everywhere, including high ranked on the highscores and it’s ruining the enjoyment of many: [see here](http://imgur.com/a/JRnlw). Jagex, please allow for an open discussion on working towards resolving the bot problem, and address it, don’t just acknowledge it** 

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: It seems like a lot of comments below suggest that Jagex is at the mercy of those macroing. This isn't really a fair answer considering if we all realize we are competing with bots, people will stop playing, which brings me back to long-term sustainability and integrity of the game. 

&amp;nbsp;

If the problem is overwhelming now because of F2P, maybe we take another look at F2P. Should we introduce a new highly interactive (20 min long), unique to each account quest that all F2P players must complete as an extension of tutorial island? Should F2P be a members only feature with it's own F2P highscores so that those craving the F2P experience can still enjoy it while removing it as a breeding ground for bots? Let's take a critical look at the issues and dig a bit deeper to sort this out.

I'm thinking of moving into the downtown core (student on an internship) and I'm thinking of finding an apartment to live in close to work.
Does anyone have any reviews or have  heard anything about onlowing apartments: Terrace Gardens (6th Ave SW) or Prince's Island Place (4th Ave SW)? 

I'm new to the city, so I am not sure if there is a catch or bad rep with these places.

6l7s5e,3,2017-07-04,Fucked up story about my father's drinking problem,Joestig,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6l7s5e/fucked_up_story_about_my_fathers_drinking_problem/,"The reason that I have a severe dislike for alcohol is my father's alcohol abuse. I thought I'd discuss that here, because I still find it hard to .

He drank most evenings that I saw him during my teens and twenties, and when he drank he always drank too much. His poison was wine. I needed my father to be there, to guide me, and I often found myself talking with him, but as the evening progressed he would become more and more drunk. This made me feel very angry, but I could do nothing about it, since he was my father and I found it hard to confront him. Looking back I should have destroyed his wine storage. I should have insulted him in his face every time he was drunk. I should have insisted that my mother would talk with him every time he was drunk.

When he was drunk, he would always start talking about religion. He would become very manipulative. He would always tell the same stories, some of which I have heard many hundreds of times and he always told them like he thought I never heard it. Probably remembers very little about it.

One time, just before I went to Africa for internship and I had a goodbye party, he became psychotic because the alcohol and the medicine messed up his brain. I had to stay up that night to protect the rest of the family from him. My mother had cancer at the time as well (which made it hard to go for me already), and he said some pretty weird things about that. We wanted to call the ambulance, but my mother stopped us out of fear that it would destroy his reputation. I did go to Africa, but it was very rough, I was worried about my brothers and I didn't drink for months when I was there.

Afterwards he said that it would never happen again, and that's all he said (it did happen at least one more time, so I have heard from my brothers). I tried to discuss this incident, but he always would become angry with me. Discussing his past alcoholism in general is also not possible.

Now he is sober, he drinks very little, and he thinks that everything is ok now. But I have very little respect for him now. If he just would be open for conversation we could heal our relationship, I am open to that, but he is too weak for that. I wish I could say that I don't care, but I do, I find it quite hard and that's why I write this.

I understand that he had hard times in his life at the time, but he was an adult and he could have looked for help if he found it hard to cope with his issues. But it would be easier to let go of this if we could just discuss this, but this is not a possibility at all, believe me, I have tried it often.

Quitting alcohol myself now. I don't want it in my life. Will look for a psychologist to help me get over this. I want to heal myself, so that I can be a better father to my future children. Advice on how to do this is welcome.

I know that it could be worse than this, I am amazed by the tough situations some people survive (such as violent alcoholic fathers), but I found this pretty hard myself. Thanks for reading, let me know what you think about this."

just want this pain and suffring to end and have lost the will to live.

I am 22 years old male had crohn's disease since I was 12 but due to lack of proper medical care I was never diagnosed specifically
with crohn's disease and was misdiagnosed everytime and because of which I stopped going to doctor(being from a third world country, my options and knowledge about this disease was very limited).

My entire time in college was and is painful experience for me. In my life I wanted to do so much, be social,
improve my writing,travel abroad etcetera. but due to my disease everyday I have brainfog, constipation and severe fatigue which seriously hampered my
social skill and critical thinking I find it very hard to think straight and feel's like a wierdo all the time and don't have enough energy nor courage to deal with anything at all.

Right now I am among one of the bottom five of my engineering batch in college. I am a faliure and just can't find will to deal with so much regrets, feeling of remorse and hopelessness anymore. 
Everyday on Facebook seing my batchmates doing Internship abroad in tech companies having great social life, Living the life which I wanted to have,
while I have nothing just this disablility which won't go anytime soon. It's not that I never liked studying infact I am among top 10 colleges of my country but now I find it hard to continue
I just feel like I can't do anything anymore lost so much of the valuable time doing nothing just don't feel like doing anything anymore.

I feel like garbage, waste of space
and can't do anything I just am sick of everything want to end this but can't find the courage to go for suicide."
6l86l0,1,2017-07-04,[M4A] Sedcued By Rooster Teeth,Nmarshall273,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6l86l0/m4a_sedcued_by_rooster_teeth/,"Hey DPP! I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

6l8aa2,0,2017-07-04,"A coworker (23F) and myself (27m) both clearly like each other and have feelings for each other, but nothing is happening because we work together and are afraid of things getting weird at work. What do I do?",Pronk89,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6l8aa2/a_coworker_23f_and_myself_27m_both_clearly_like/,"Hi everyone, first post on here....I've been working with this girl for nearly a year now, and for the last several months we've been spending a lot more time together, always gravitate toward each other at work (we're both full time as well so we're around each other quite a bit each week), have similar interests /sense of humor, and personality wise are very similar as well. We flirt all the time, always catch each other glancing at the other across the room, and are a lot closer to each other than we are to anyone else at work. Some coworkers/interns have even picked up on this, teasing by saying things like ""awww you guys parked next to each other,"" or ""you guys look like a couple sitting there together."" Pretty much everyone knows we have a thing for each other.

Neither of us have any extensive dating experience - I was with a girl for six years, and she was with a guy for four, but those are really the only partners either of us have had. This makes navigating this whole situation a bit weird for her and I as we've never really been in this position before. On three different occasions since March we've sat down and had an awkward conversation about how dating or taking things any further than just being good friends has the potential to make things really weird at work (which I do somewhat agree with, you don't dip your pen in company ink or so they say).

The most recent ""talk"" was last Thursday. She was over my apartment with one of the interns from work (also a girl), and we were just watching a movie. It was super late, we were all tired, but we ended up cuddling/holding hands, she laid her head on my shoulder, all that. Then after the night was over we were both kind of awkward about it and she left. Since we both work together on Saturdays it was pretty awkward as well, but before we left for the day I brought it up, saying ""Ok I have to make things weird,"" which is pretty much what we say whenever we start bringing this whole situation up.

It ended up like pretty much every other time - she stated she had feelings for me, I told her I liked her, heck she even said that she'd be bummed if I were to date someone outside of work, but again that she doesn't want to date someone at work because of the potential issues it could bring etc. We work at a very small company, we are on the same three-person team at work, etc.  To compound all of this we can both be pretty indecisive people, so our conversations about this are usually a whole lot of ""I don't knows.""

We went out with a friend last night and initially, until the other friend got there, were super awkward about it. So we brought it up again, and I don't know why we keep talking about it. If it's as easy as ""no we don't want to do anything because we work together,"" then why does it come up every few weeks/months? To me it feels like we're just fighting against the fact that we have feelings for each other. I don't necessarily want to date someone at work, because yes that has potential to get ugly if things don't work out, but as time goes on we keep getting closer and closer. We're definitely not just friends, but we're definitely not at that next level, and I'm almost to the point where I want to say ""screw it, let's just date and if it doesn't work I'll find another job.""

I'm just not sure what to do. I really do like this girl, and I know for a fact she likes me as well. She's mentioned we could try to distance ourselves from each other to keep things from escalating, but then states that she doesn't want to do that because she wants to be around me.  It's incredibly frustrating because here's a girl that I know fairly well, know for a fact we're fairly compatible, and the one time this happens it's with a coworker. It's enough to make me want to change jobs - not so that I can date her, just so that I don't have to see her every single day because when I do all I can think about is how much it sucks that she's RIGHT THERE, I know how she feels, but nothing will ever happen. As time goes on we just keep getting more and more attracted to each other, which just makes it harder.

What should I do? Since I work directly with her it's not as simple as ignoring her. I don't want to suggest we date either, as I don't want to be pushy, and I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable at all. On the other hand, I know for a fact that if we didn't work together we would be a thing.

If you read all of this, thanks very much as I know it is pretty long. If anything it feels good to just talk about it, as nobody else knows about this whole situation. Any advice from anyone is welcomed. Thanks!

TLDR: I like a girl from work, she likes me, we both know it, we hang out often and have to see each other pretty much every day, but aren't going to escalate to any type of relationship because we don't want to ""make work weird."" I'm struggling because I have feelings for her, I'm not sure if I should just ""get over it,"" but it's not as simple as not seeing her anymore since I work with her...so do I ""get over it,"" or bite the bullet and suggest we date?

EDIT: there's no employer policy that would prevent anything.. Only between superiors and team members, and we are both more or less equals at work. "

I went to the University of Edinburgh in Scotland which is at an ivy-league level. I studied a master of arts in political science and philosophy with my dissertation focusing on terrorism in the North Caucasus. I have good familiarity with contemporary Russian politics and a big interest in political economy. I currently live in London but I am looking to relocating back to the US. DC is my main target.

I have some journalism experience in helping with a venture that my sister started up. It gained traction and now receives thousands of hits. 

I also was a research intern for Senator Marco Rubio and drafted a press release for him. 

I also founded the largest Israel student society in the UK and worked in coordination with the Israeli government to promote the state of Israel in the United Kingdom.

I have good contacts for my age in politics, but I am not ready for an easy hand at life. I think this would especially be beneficial in the political consulting business.

I speak Spanish at a bilingual level, can speak elementary French, and understand Italian very well.

I have also lived in four countries so have a very international character which may be good in some ways.

Anyway just leave a message here or directly to me and I will forward my CV.

I'm currently an intern and will make around $11k this summer. Of those, according to my budget, I expect to take home $5k. I plan to spend close to $2k paying off my student loan with the highest interest rate (4.45%), and place the leftover $3k into a Vanguard Roth IRA. This would leave me with two student loans left to pay off from my freshman year and my upcoming sophomore year ($5.5k @ 3.76% and $1.5k @ 0%). I am not too worried about being unable to pay off my student loans after I graduate, but I was wondering if there were any other options to grow my money from this summer that I should consider? "
6l8jjf,1,2017-07-04,"A story of opportunities lost,yet with a,hopefully,motivating aftertaste.",Throwawaylicious,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6l8jjf/a_story_of_opportunities_lostyet_with/,"Posted this initially on r/socialskills,but it feels it rather belongs here instead.

Before i start,this is going to be a long wall of text.The last few months were kinda hard on me and my self confidence,and yesterday was a crucial moment-both my lowest moment,but perhaps,a way out of the tunnel.

I am 32 years old,and i havent ever done anything romantic whatsoever.I have never,NEVER done anything of such sort-never asked a girl out,never even tried to communicate any sort of such interest.The reason?Addiction to videogames/nerdy stuff.I am mature enough to admit it now-for 31 out of my 32 years of life i was too fucking hopped on dopamine from playing-console jrpg's at first,the yugioh trading card game afterwards,MMORPG's after that,and anime sprinkled all in between.I didnt honestly care-i clearly remember that at some point,an attractive girl i was talking to during university suggested we go out for coffee together,and i didnt really pay attention-i had other things to think about.

However,as with all addictions,at some point during last year,i started being more alone.Most of my friends finding work as well,i started not being able to go out as easily as before-and to top it off,my addictions started to not fulfill me anymore.Sure,i could watch some anime or play some progression-driven games,but the thrill got over fast.REALLY fast.And i started,like a normal human being,needing a romantic partner.

So,we have an intern at work,which i work closely with.Much younger than me-10 years younger,although people say i look younger than i am as well,so i thought that it wasnt so ill-fitting.Cute.Extremely social and cheerful.I start noticing her and crushing on her.

And then reality hits me hard.This girl has had 3-4 relationships already,being a normal girl her age.She's a heavy user of social media-instagram,facebook,the whole shebang.Often participating in nightlife,where she's probably showered with attention-little social recluse-no experience me doesnt have a chance in hell.

Still,i couldnt help approaching her.I start talking to her,making jokes with her,trying to get her to talk to me.She starts responding-she constantly sits next to me,even though there isnt any work to do.She doesnt really initiate talking to me,but she's responsive when i do,although our senses of humour and tastes in music don't match.At some point,she shows me pictures of her ex-boyfriend-one of these neohipster bearded tattooed types,really good looking,barman.

Although i realize she's single and i could theoretically make my move,my feelings of inferiority,and more importantly,the crushing fear of the awkwardness that would ensue for the months left until her internship ends stop me from doing such a thing.Despite the obvious signs that she was interested in me-she kept sitting next to me,suggesting we play tic-tac-toe,battleship,taboo.Whenever all this situation crashed into my head too hard and i was crushed by depression she was hellbent on trying to cheer me up,her subtly asking if she could join me on my way to work when i had some paperwork to deliver at some point.3 weeks ago,when work was slow and we were sitting together,she puts a rnb sensual song with the lyrics on video,right in front of me-when i saw it,i was immediately stricken by a maelstrom of negative thoughts about the situation,and she asked me""what are you thinking""?And i obviously dodged the question instead of doing anything.

So a couple of weeks ago,she suddenly stopped really interacting with me.Just the minimal interactions needed for work-not even saying hello,or goodbye-constantly on her phone.After a while i hear her calling a man she met on facebook and giving him her number-the ship sailed.

And then that's when the revelation of the whole situation hit me hard.This girl was charmed by me for a couple weeks-she was certainly not going to make any sort of direct move herself,but she was piling on the signs.I just did nothing about it,paralyzed by shame,feelings of inferiority and dreading the awkwardness that would follow a possible rejection.Naturally,she got disinterested and seeked something else.Felt like an awfully painful punch in the kidneys-it still feels like there's a razor grinding away at my stomach.

However,just like Pandora's box,i think there's a positive thing left inside. I had managed to charm this girl.For 2-3 weeks only,but i had done it.Little old nerdy uninteresting me,managing to charm a beautiful girl,showered with attention from everywhere,just by talking to her,being humorous with her,and being himself-not even ""traditionally flirting"",like complimenting her-too scared for that.This means that im not as hopeless as i constantly think i am-i can be an attractive,charming person to the opposite sex.I just need to relax,and be myself.

I hope i can get some sleep tonight,because my head feels like a volcano right now.

Episode no.: **S03E08**

&amp;nbsp;

Notable trivia about this episode:

6l99nm,5,2017-07-04,No place in the world for my obsessive thinking patterns,obsdep-throwaway,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6l99nm/no_place_in_the_world_for_my_obsessive_thinking/,"All of my life has been a joke, I just obsess over one thing for a few months or years and then drop it. In the earlier years it was things like drawing fake maps, Rollercoaster Tycoon, Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, magic tricks, collecting rocks.

Then my obsessiveness turned into something productive and I started to get obsessed with web design, maintaining a Pokémon website, and later when I took my first CS class it turned focus to programming. Everything was so shiny and new and I wanted to learn all of it. I was creating web applications, mobile apps, hobby electronics projects, and eventually I made it to several internships and a full time job offer.

Problem is at that point it stopped being shiny and new, just like everything else in the world. I had moved on to romance, discovering I was gay and finding my first boyfriend, as well as Smash Bros and I would think about these things nonstop. Even while in a tech job I couldn't think about the actual subject for long, just performed when I needed to, and eventually my interest declined into hate. My entire last year at school I couldn't stand code or electronics anymore. I dropped leadership positions for all the tech clubs I was in and stopped talking to all the friends I made there because I no longer had anything in common with them. And when my romantic endeavors failed I really crashed.

Now I've graduated and made it through school with the help of a university counselor, but I hate my job, I can't focus on it, every minute I'm there I think about quitting or suicide to not have to deal with it. And I can't see myself pursuing any other career path or hobby because by the time I learn the skills required to be successful that the obsession will have run dry too.

It just doesn't seem like there's any point in living anymore if I have to keep going through this. I look back at my $500 of hobby electronics I have interest in anymore or all the code that I've written that feels like a chore now, or my pile of video games that I'll never finish and can only feel regret. Things that I was previously always able to focus on like music don't feel the same.  I can't even make friends because I have no interest in anything that they might have interest in. Now my obsessiveness has turned to my condition, and every waking minute I think about what's wrong with me and why I'm so messed up, I don't see any place in the world for someone who operates like this, jumping between single minded topics and to the next shiny and new thing. Eventually the shininess and newness is going to run out and I'll have nothing. No happiness, no friends, no hobbies, no career aspirations. With my current fixation it already seems like there's no point in living because thinking about my condition only makes me upset. Has anyone else ever experienced this or am I all alone in my obsessiveness?"
6l9pn7,0,2017-07-04,"Co-worker (23f) and I (27m) have feelings for each other, but haven't taken a step toward dating as we don't want to make work ""weird."" I'm not sure what to do moving forward.",Pronk89,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6l9pn7/coworker_23f_and_i_27m_have_feelings_for_each/,"Hi everyone....I've been working with this girl for nearly a year now, and for the last several months we've been spending a lot more time together, always gravitate toward each other at work (we're both full time as well so we're around each other quite a bit each week), have similar interests /sense of humor, and personality wise are very similar as well. We flirt all the time, always catch each other glancing at the other across the room, and are a lot closer to each other than we are to anyone else at work. Some coworkers/interns have even picked up on this, teasing by saying things like ""awww you guys parked next to each other,"" or ""you guys look like a couple sitting there together."" Pretty much everyone knows we have a thing for each other.


Neither of us have any extensive dating experience - I was with a girl for six years, and she was with a guy for four, but those are really the only partners either of us have had. This makes navigating this whole situation a bit weird for her and I as we've never really been in this position before. On three different occasions since March we've sat down and had an awkward conversation about how dating or taking things any further than just being good friends has the potential to make things really weird at work (which I do somewhat agree with, you don't dip your pen in company ink or so they say).


The most recent ""incident"" was last Thursday. She was over my apartment with one of the interns from work (also a girl), and we were just watching a movie. It was super late, we were all tired, but we ended up cuddling/holding hands, she laid her head on my shoulder, all that. Then after the night was over we were both kind of awkward about it and she left. Since we both work together on Saturdays it was pretty awkward as well, but before we left for the day I brought it up, saying ""Ok I have to make things weird,"" which is pretty much what we say whenever we start bringing this whole situation up.


It ended up like pretty much every other time - she stated she had feelings for me, I told her I liked her, heck she even said that she'd be bummed if I were to date someone outside of work, but again that she doesn't want to date someone at work because of the potential issues it could bring etc. We work at a very small company, we are on the same three-person team at work, etc. To compound all of this we can both be pretty indecisive people, so our conversations about this are usually a whole lot of ""I don't knows.""


We went out with a friend last night and initially, until the other friend got there, were super awkward about it. So we brought it up again, and I don't know why we keep talking about it. If it's as easy as ""no we don't want to do anything because we work together,"" then why does it come up every few weeks/months? To me it feels like we're just fighting against the fact that we have feelings for each other. I don't necessarily want to date someone at work, because yes that has potential to get ugly if things don't work out, but as time goes on we keep getting closer and closer. We're definitely not just friends, but we're definitely not at that next level, and I'm almost to the point where I want to say ""screw it, let's just date and if it doesn't work I'll find another job.""


I'm just not sure what to do. I really do like this girl, and I know for a fact she likes me as well. She's mentioned we could try to distance ourselves from each other to keep things from escalating, but then states that she doesn't want to do that because she wants to be around me. It's incredibly frustrating because here's a girl that I know fairly well, know for a fact we're fairly compatible, and the one time this happens it's with a coworker. It's enough to make me want to change jobs - not so that I can date her, just so that I don't have to see her every single day because when I do all I can think about is how much it sucks that she's RIGHT THERE, I know how she feels, but nothing will ever happen. As time goes on we just keep getting more and more attracted to each other, which just makes it harder.


What should I do? Since I work directly with her it's not as simple as ignoring her. I don't know if I want to suggest we date either, as I don't want to be pushy, and I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable at all. On the other hand, I'm fairly certain that if we didn't work together we would be a thing.


If you read all of this, thanks very much as I know it is pretty long. If anything it feels good to just talk about it, as nobody else knows about this whole situation. Any advice from anyone is welcomed. Thanks!


TLDR: I like a girl from work, she likes me, we both know it, we hang out often and have to see each other pretty much every day, but aren't going to escalate to any type of relationship because we don't want to ""make work weird."" I'm struggling because I have feelings for her, I'm not sure if I should just ""get over it,"" but it's not as simple as not seeing her anymore since I work with her...so do I ""get over it,"" or bite the bullet and suggest we date? There's no employer policy that would prevent anything.. Only between superiors and team members, and we are both more or less equals at work."
6l9r0r,8,2017-07-04,Boyfriend texted his ex,Leyah3,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6l9r0r/boyfriend_texted_his_ex/,"Well.
This is my first time doing this so I'm curious.
My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 months now and I'm really happy with him. I wouldn't want to leave him for the world.
Problem is; I went to spain on this internship for 6 weeks. It was really hard on both of us, because went from seeing each other day and night to njet for six weeks..
All went good (or so I thought), 6 weeks later, we're happy to see each other again and we remain together.

Now I recently found out that he texted his ex while I was gone, after 4 weeks..
I won't elaborate on what was said but I can say that what they sent was NOT okay. This happened maybe two times when I was away, she initiated the conversation and a week before my return he told her to fuck off and leave him alone, that he isn't interested, etc.

I told him I found out about this and he started crying, saying he knows there's nothing he could possibly say to make up for that but that he loves me and doesn't want to lose me, etc etc. It was an intense night for both of us, I was really mad.

I've forgiven him for it, but I don't know. I feel like I lost my trust in him. Why would he have to text his ex those kind of things when he has me?

Maybe important to mention; during my internship I had to sleep in an appartment with over 7 boys.. I knew he was jealous but we talked about it, I texted him daily when I could, we facetimed all the time,...

I don't even know what I want from you.. maybe an opinion? If it's wrong for me to feel like I lost trust in him..

Thanks!"

Not the best title for this post, but it's what came to mind; and it's been on my mind for many, many years.  

""Don't you want to take a leap of faith? Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone!""  
When I watched Inception that line *really* resonated with me.  
Believe it or not but I've been afraid of that since I was just 12 years old.  
I couldn't do the things I wanted and I couldn't accomplish anything really and I couldn't understand why.  

Now I'm an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone.  
Maybe I'm taking a leap of faith now...

I grew up with horrible mother, and two half-brothers (they had another father), with my father who was just a shadow; a constant threat.  
I do believe he was a dangerous person, but I don't believe all that they said; especially since they lied so much about everything.  

He kidnapped me once, although, I don't know if it's kidnapping when it's your own child.  
I do have memories from when I was little, and at his house, I must've been 3 - 4 years old so the memory is distorted; but I don't remember the kidnapping.  
But it was said I was locked inside a dark room with no windows.  

So I was kept inside a lot during my childhood, being told stories of the boogeyman. He sued for custody and they ruled in his favor so my mother had to pay fine, every week or so, for not handing me over; he showed up on Saturdays, with people, ringing the door bell while I sat there in the dark.  
That of course led us to not having any money.  
However, the government wouldn't starve a child, but I don't know; I grew up on a steady diet of lies and I know money was wasted.  
I couldn't reveal how bad things were at home because then everyone would, according to her, blame my mother.  
We didn't have food, sometimes no electricity, and the home was a mess.  
""Don't tell anyone! They'll put you in Foster care and who knows what kind of creeps will do things to you!"" Says the whole family, always trying to brainwash me.  
I was called names at home because I tried to go out and play but my clothes were worn out and so the neighbours would see how bad it is.  
I had to ""testify"" every now and then, to them and the courts, that I didn't want to see my father.  
It was of course true, what with everything they told me, but they coached me *a lot*.  
Like they would play a tape from the court with my father saying that I only get ketchup and macaroni at home, while they bought me a pizza and say ""Seeee, it's not true!"", while I didn't get food other days; as a kid you go along with it.  


My mother smoked a couple of packs a day, that didn't help with the finances, and she sent me out to neighbours to ask to loan money.  
We had tons of animals; fish, mice, birds, cats, dogs, rabbit, I don't even know.  
It was more important to give them a home and food than it was to give me that.  
She did start to blame me very early on, and so did my half-brothers, for ruining their lives.  
I just had to accept it and how grateful I should be towards them for taking care of me and not handing me out to the boogeyman; because we could do it! Remember that!.  
At the same time they put the responsibility on me to ""save them""; how I had to make it.  
One day if put butter and some spice on a piece of bread, I was to become a Master Chef!; then the next day, or the same, I was told that I should've never been born.  
It tore me apart...   

The half-brothers left the home early, they're 10 and 15 years older than me, and I was left alone with her... Night or day, the door could just open like an explosion with a woman standing there crying and screaming her lungs out: You should never have been born, you should've given you away, I sacrificed so much, I should never have had kids, you've destroyed this whole family.  
When I tried hiding, not looking, she would force my eyes open so I couldn't escape it...  
They did suck up to me a lot just before 12 years old because at the age of 12 the courts said I was old enough to decide if I wanted to see my father or not.  
After that they didn't have to put in effort.  

Money was always an issue but, the times that I could have someone over (when it was semi-clean), I don't think anyone would've noticed. During the years I had a Commodore 64, I got a Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear, a SNES, I think I got three bicycles, a playstation.  
One half-brother wanted to do something with the C64 and broke it. (I later bought a used one for $10)  
Sega Genesis? Nope, wasn't mine it turned out, so the games I've got from other people, or managed to buy myself, was taken or sold.  
""Look how good people we are by giving you this stuff""; however, now we're starving so we're just going to sell your stuff so we can buy food for the 20 animals we have and also cigarettes so you won't have your stuff but you'll still be starving.  
They sold my stuff, my toys, games. I even started getting bills in my name so I was just the garbage bin that you could treat however you wanted.  
So they told, over and over again, how spoiled I was for having all that nice stuff, even though I didn't have it, after they sold it... yeah...  
One bicycle I got was for my 15th birthday; they told me they hadn't bought me anything or done any preparation so at the end of the day one of the half-brothers put it a bike on his credit card.  
That was it. We didn't eat or celebrate anything. They didn't want to.

On our version of Americas Funniest Homevideos (AFV) they had a competition at the end of the show where you could vote for your favourite clip by calling in, which I did, and I won a traveling check for $1500 (probably more at the time); I was 13 or 14 at the time.  
So we sold it, paid of late rent, and sold the apartment so my mother could pay off her debts and buy stuff; I never got that money.  
Well, I did get to pay for my own bed, since they threw mine away when we moved, that I still have to this day which is broken after 20 years.  
I later saved up some money and bought a Playstation but that was somehow their gift to me. I had gotten a WipeOut for one of my birthdays: ""We could afford the game; but not the console.""  

And when we moved, out of the I don't know how many animals, we had to put down the kitten I had; Fifi.
-No...  
-Oh yes, she's not housebroken, and it's your fault.  
How many times didn't my mother care about the cats, and dogs, pissing and shitting everywhere?  
Over the years we had at least 20 cats and 3 dogs, birds, fish, mice, etc.
She was featured in the newspaper (before the move) because she was so nice and took care of so many animals.  
The newspaper wanted me to be in the picture with my kitten; but noooooo...  
The boogeyman could probably make a passport out of that picture; only I can be in the picture.
Yeah...  
I couldn't even be in the same room.  

She smoked like a chimney. She told me she smoked while pregnant with me; but not when she was pregnant with the half-brothers.  
She did quit when I was older (or so she said).
She drank, not unreasonably as far as I could tell, but she always claimed she ""didn't really"" and had only been drunk once; but I know that wasn't true since I had seen her drunk.  
She traveled to other countries!  
Brought in animals from outside to take care of!
Always tried to be the center of attention!  
I've never been to any other country.
I was stuck and I'm still stuck; but not for long.
I was promised so many times that would travel here and there.

I did some door-to-door selling as a kid, selling books and magazines every Christmas, and I also sold snacks/candy during the summers. One time I made $70 and the family was drooling for that money.  
Again, I bought games and such. I think I bought the used SNES with that money.  
I was a Sega fanboy, and their magazine was really good, but I also wanted to play some Nintendo.  
They sold it.  
""You don't want us to starve? Riiiiiiight?"" While buying cartons of cigarettes.

Most of the stuff I had was sold. They rented tables at place where you could sell your stuff.  
I did keep some things that I wouldn't let go of (or they didn't manage to sell; because they tried).  
I still have my Spider-man trading cards, that I worked so hard for, and I was going to make a video of it, but...  
I'll try to do it.

I guess I'm explaining myself because I don't want anyone to think that everything was great because I could show them a picture of a SNES or Playstation.   
My birthdays weren't better; one birthday I had friends over, when I was 10 or 11, and we didn't have anything. So they cut a loaf in half, put whipped cream in between, stuck some salty snacks (I guess it's straight pretzel), on it with some M&amp;M's.
No one wanted to eat it... 

Like I said, after 12 they didn't have to pretend anymore or put in effort to keep me ""happy"".
One half-brother had a job and got a girlfriend and some kids; he inherited his mothers ways.
The other half-brother moved back home when we sold the apartment when I was 14.  
They started ignoring me because ""You don't have anything interesting to say"".  
They said that of course they lied about us traveling (although they traveled) so I would have something to look forward too; so many lies.

I never partied, I never drank, to this day I have never tried smoking or nicotine or done drugs.  
But growing up with a smoker, and her smoking friends, I probably inhaled cartoons of cigarettes.  
I lost the friends who did that, who became teenagers, and who wasn't as naive as I was.  
Being sheltered and inside being told what the truth is you miss a lot of development.  
Then I had the issues with home...

I was of course bullied basically my whole time in school and it only sort of stopped in 9th grade when I finally struck back; but I'm not a violent person.  
The bullygroups and counseling didn't help.
I was supposed to keep myself together and be the bigger person.
A garbage bin everywhere I went.  
I don't believe anyone didn't notice; they just didn't do anything.  
I know some teachers noticed my belly was big (I was starving) and at home they thought it was funny that I looked just like a ""starved African child"".  

When I was in kindergarten there was some problems with not affording the care, or not enough room, but I got to be there; but I didn't get to eat.
I remember sitting in the hallway on the bench for shoes, crying, because the other children were eating.  
In school, took as much food as I could, and was always thinking of the lunchbreak.  
I too much food they said, you're wasting the food they said, so they had a horrible woman assigned to put food on my plate. She put soooo much food each and every time.  
I couldn't go out to play so I had to sit inside while the other kids were playing; forced to eat until I had eaten it all. They stopped after awhile.

The days that were fieldtrips or outside activity I had to stay at home so no one would know we didn't have food; or I got two dry pieces of bread with some ketchup on it and a thermos with water. Summerbreaks were horrible because while I didn't like school; I wouldn't get food and I wouldn't get away from home.  
I have many memories I don't want...  
Lying on the bathroom floor, puking water, because I haven't anything else to eat.
Sometimes she made bread out of flour and water, took some leafs from dandelions, and put mustard on it; everything a growing child needs.
I still (but I'm *reaaaally* trying) have problem with olive oil since I had to eat a flour, olive oil, cocoa powder mix for like a week.  
She couldn't/wouldn't cook, clean, or anything; but don't forget that it's my fault.
They did put up a schedule when I was younger and I would get like 20 cents to take out the garbage or do the dishes, so I did; and I would get paid at the end of the month.  
After a couple of months I was told ""We don't have any money so how could we pay you? You should be doing these things anyway!"" from people that keeps the place a mess...

So, with everything going on, I was supposed to get grades and I couldn't do it; I couldn't focus.  
I had to sit with extra help with maths and many times more when I was failing a subject; I even had to sit with teachers to reach the next grade (for older kids).

Around the 9th grade I stopped talking.
I know some people who approached me later saying that they thought I was a weirdo, etc., since I didn't say anything.
I had the problems in school, and at home; and they ignored me, as I said.
When we sold the apartment, as I mentioned, one half-brother moved back home; the new apartment. Then he found a girlfriend and moved out so we had to move again.

I didn't get any food at home but my mother started giving me the states childcare money; so I had that; I think it was $90.  
I still had at least one friend left that I hung out with that was two years younger than me.
Part of the money I got, I saved (hid) and I bought the used Playstation I mentioned.  
When I was 14 or 15 Social Services said: You're big now! You have to provide for the household!  
So I had to work during the summers, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., for $4 an hour to support the household.  
I did get to keep some of that and I bought another used Playstation.  
I bought some games, ex: Parasite Eve, Final Fantasy VII, VIII, and Tactics, I had WipeOut and got the other games; almost everything was used.  
I loved Final Fantasy and I have ideas that I wanted to share with Square/Enix (back then it was Squaresoft). Someone borrowed VII and never returned it; claimed he lent it to someone that didn't return it to him. I never got it back.  I suspect my mother stole VIII and sold it; it just vanished.  
Of course, my mother, the half-brother, and his girlfriend comes to me and.. oh.. we're starving..  

Yeah, you know where this is going..

I never got to finished Tactics; I've thought many times about giving it a go, but I don't know, I guess the thought of it takes me back there.

Like I said, I was the sacrifice, these people didn't sell their stuff.  
My half-brother didn't sell his consoles.  
-Do you really want us to starve?

Now I didn't have any games, and they shut off the electricity, I stopped talking.  
I was locked in room with no escape.  
Trapped.

I failed school of course.  
The teacher promised me a passing grade in maths but she lied it turned out.  
So I was 15 and just before I stopped talking completely the other half-brother who had a girlfriend, a house, a job, said he wanted us to go to Italy and visit their cousin there.  
We were going to ride on a motorcycle there.  
We made plans and we looked at the route through the countries.  
I had tried turning to him when I was bullied but he said ""Maybe you're the problem; not them.""  
But you're hit in the head over and over that ""It's family! You got be there for each other!"".  
So he laughs at me and says:  
-I can't go to Italy!  
-But... you said you wanted us to go; we started making plans?  
-I have a girlfriend and kids; of course I can't go to Italy! Don't be stupid!  

I cut him out of my life then and there.  
He came into my room once and wanted to talk to me and told him:  
-I was serious; I'm never speaking to you ever again.  
-You don't mean that.  
-Yes, I do...

I have never spoken to him again.  
Of course my mother and the other half-brother blamed me, and I was called the devil and many other names; and all the screaming and crying escalated. She was going to kill herself all the time.  
Taking scissors to her wrists and telling me to leave or she'll kill herself or kill herself this way or that way.  
I didn't talk to her.  
Another example that also happened several times, though the one remember strongest, was I walking towards the bathroom and she was standing in the hallway.  
She was smiling and looked at me and said:  
-I should never have had kids; you only ruined my life.  
One time went into the kitchen and she was there.  
She took a kitchen knife and dragged it across her stomach and said:
-I should have cut you out while I was pregnant with you; you're nothing but a torment to this family......   
I didn't hear the rest because I walked away.  
Fairly early on she stopped talking to her friends, I think because she envied their lives, and she stopped working; I guess you figured that out since I mentioned Social Services.  
So she was always at home...


So, like I said, I stopped speaking.  
I tried to speak in school and I did talk (but not much) to the friend I had.
The family had their drama and even though I didn't utter a word my mother was either blaming me for destroying the family and not talking to my half-brother or she came in and said he was horrible and how I was right all along.
  

I think she was worried that people would blame her for my behavior so she contacted Social Services when I was 16, I think.  
I tried talking.  
I told the state worker that we didn't have electricity and no food.  
-Then you can read books or go for a walk!

They switched state workers and you can believe I had problems talking to that person...  
But she said:  
-This isn't good; I think it's best we get you out of there.

So at 17 I got to live at a ""Collective"" for troubled youths; drugs, violence, etc.; since I wasn't 18 I couldn't have my own apartment.  
There were people working there from morning to night and they walked in on me naked several times and didn't give a shit about my privacy; just unlocked the door and walked in just because they had the right to.  
I just needed to be left alone for awhile.  
Of course they kept pestering me about ""It's family! Your mom loves you soooo much! Talk to her!""  
It all became too much and I left; didn't care if I was homeless.  I've been threatened with it so much growing up and throughout the years.  
  
Someone that was friends with one of my half-brothers was a really nice guy and he was moving to another city and he said that I could stay in his apartment; he left a bed, tv, movies, and food.  
Then as I was approaching 18 I could get an apartment, not in my name, but with the state on the lease.  
So I moved into that place.  

Before that you can go to something that's like High School but you have to have a passing grades in specific three subjects; I think I failed math only (might be two subjects I failed).  
With everything going on at home, I didn't care, but I went to school to get the grades; as long as I wasn't at home. I was still very childish at that point; well, more childish.  
I got interested in music but had another one of many horrible teachers that didn't teach me anything; he told me not to sing ""Because you can't; you'll embarrass yourself"" but other people told me to sing. ""You're too old to start learning guitar at 16; you need to start when you're like 5 - 6"".  
I think he was annoyed because I was going to class for painting/art, having the music on the side, but I was doing better than his students.  

So, usually people go to the High School thing for 3 years and I went for 1 year that I didn't care about anything; didn't get the grades. Then I thought that I have to do something with my life; I need to get out of this.  
So I went a second year there and got my grades while I moved to the collective.   
Then I got accepted into a full 3 year program while living there and moved when I turned 18.   


At that time, with everyone pressuring me, I started talking to my mother and half-brother.  
Yeah, she sent letters and messages that I didn't respond to.  
Always negative stuff.

I made music, I got played on radio, I got some good reviews (but the quality was horrible).  
I made the music on a AMD 233Mhz with the on-board soundcard.  
Hey, you got to work with what you've got.
I performed some stuff live.  
Even though I feel hollow and rotten; it was brightness in my life.   
The school turned to be horrible and I tried changing but was denied.  
One teacher told me the other teachers don't like me and I said I already knew that.  
He didn't know why and neither did I; but I have my suspicions.  

So music was the way to go, but I wanted to paint and do artistic stuff, before music (and very much still) I wanted to make movies.  
But I can't practice, I can't do homework, I can't concentrate, I can't function; I never could... why?  
I was yet again (as always) failing in school, what I did, and wanted to do.  
I grew up knowing how spoiled I was and how good I had it; even though it was all bad.  
I must be lazy, why am I lazy?

As I said, I did start talking to my half-brother, and mother.  
Drama, drama, drama.  
None in the family had finished ""High School"" and my mother was screaming and crying about how I can't fail, etc., that negativity didn't help me, of course.  
He said; she said.
Mother and half-brother with his girlfriend and now they had a child, going:  
-Can you loan us money? Well, can you sell something?  
If I said no, well then, how could I? After everything they've done!


I finished school; I passed.  
I didn't have the grades so they took the grades I had from the two earlier years and combined them with the new grades.  
I had a lot of problems with the teachers.  
One subject I put a lot of effort into I was hoping for the highest grade (Best, Middle, Passed, and failed).  
The teacher put out a bowl of candy for everyone while we individually went into another room to talk about our grades with the teacher.   
We were alone and she smiled:  
-You've been failing this subject; but I'm giving you the passing grade.  
-What...?  
-You've been failing this subject; but I'm giving you the passing grade.  
-This is ridiculous.   
So I went into the classroom, poured most of the candy from the big bowl into a bag I had with me and I sad:  
-I should at least get something.  
When I received the grades I saw I got a middle grade.  
Just something I thought of.


The final day in school was horrible.  
I didn't have a suit, any money, and.. some other stuff happened.
Some people just have to say hurtful things about you and I got remarks about my clothing of course.  
I didn't want to speak to one of my horrible teachers and she actually took it as I was just too sad that school was over; I tried switching schools!  
So my mothers brother and his wife came to visit.  
We went to the place I escaped, where my mother still lived, and...
Of course we can't come in because she hasn't cleaned.  
All the screaming and crying about how I have to pass...
She said: 
-I know you probably expected ""food item I like"" but we don't have any money.  
So she had made soup.  
It definitely had water in it, might've seen a piece of carrot or something.  
No one ate it because what we all could see was that it was full of dog hair.  
Didn't really matter that she tried to scoop it out; it never ended.
Her brother and his wife drove me home.  
Gave me a bottle of distilled blackcurrant wine, or something, and a $50.  
I declined the money, but.. they saw how bad it was and just put in my hand.


Anyway, after that I did military service which lasts for 7,5 months.  
I had issues there as well and the boogeyman, my father, died while I was on some guard duty while we were training for conflict in a city.

I had had no contact with him other than he walked up to me while one time when I was 19 maybe and told him in a very colorful way to stay away from.  
He also sent me some letter saying his relatives wanted to meet me or something.  
So now I get leave from the military service to see the dead boogeyman on the table, at the morgue, but I can't let it go.  
With all the threats, and having to flee to live at women's shelter as a kid, and.. just.. everything..
I can't let it go.  
The fears are still there and I think I will see him when I pass every corner or look outside.

I went back to continue my service, but after just a week or two, I was contacted because I was his only child. Now the burden is on me to take care of his stuff.  
So I have to go inside the apartment of the boogeyman and... move stuff out and dig through everything.  
It was a horrible experience and I didn't want to do it.  
It took me a couple of weeks and my mother was so sorry he was dead...
But she and and my half-brother loved the idea of going through his stuff.  
I let the vultures do what they want.  
I didn't want anything.  
He had a baby photo of me, a very old video camera in great condition, and a really thick roll of plastic, I guess floor covering, that still haven't run out; I kept that. I also kept a soldering iron, but that's about it I think. I sold the old video camera.    
Of course my mother made me keep keep more stuff that I didn't want; computers, drives, CD's, floppies, and vhs-tapes.  
There could be important information on them! DRAMA!
I've since then thrown everything out except for the picture and roll of plastic.  
I didn't check what was on them.  
There was a cassette-tape hidden in the vacuum-cleaner that I sent to the police but they didn't find anything of interest on them.

I finished my military service and I was about 22, I think.  

Since I didn't speak to the other half-brother, which I constantly was given crap for, they spent every Christmas with him and his family and some Christmases they ""celebrated"" with me afterwards.  
I think I was 15 when they gave me the Alien Trilogy for Christmas and they told me:  
-You're not a child anymore so you won't get anymore nice presents.  
It's not that I've ever been ungrateful; but it shows you how spoiled they thought I was.  

Like I said they gave me crap for not talking to the half-brother and they totally understood why I didn't the next moment.  I was told he was diagnosed with ""Borderline"".  
And as also said; he inherited her behavior.  
I had to babysit his kids at his house all day while he and his girlfriend were working; but I wasn't allowed to eat.  
One time he said:  
-Okay, you can eat.  
He gave me an egg, a potato, and a tomato.  
And his girlfriend had to supervise so I didn't take anything else.  
He did stuff like play with a keyboard but I was only allowed to watch because it was his stuff.  
He often said he was the center of the family and the relatives; the one holding everything together.
One night he was going to kill us (me, his brother, his daughter, and our mother) and started driving in the wrong lane. I was asleep and was suddenly pulled out of a vehicle in the middle of nowhere.  
I think I was 11 or 12.  
He was trying to kill my mother another time when he tried to push a big cupboard, or something, on her.  
Anyway, a long walk all night.    
We reached a town early morning and broke into a hotel, stole ice-cream, and spent money on a train to get home.  

""But it's faaaamily! You're a bad person if you don't talk to them!""

Again, there's so much stuff that has happened and it's just too much; including all the manipulations and mind-games and horrible things I can't mention.  

So, back at Christmas at 22.  
My mother, in front of my half-brother, gives me a ""World's Best Son"" book.  
The other half-brother has been bad overall; this one has tried to be there for mother aaaaall the time. He wanted to make her happy and all that.  
I get the ""World's Best Son"".  
He was not happy at all.  
He gave me a replica of the ring and necklace from Lord of The Rings; because I too have had heavy burden to carry.  
I tried spending time with him since he had no friends and stayed at his place when he first moved out when I was younger, but when he got a girlfriend that became everything; my purpose was fulfilled. He told me.  

On my birthday, I think it was when I turned 23, I was over at his place but he didn't want to talk to me. He made clear earlier that he has a girlfriend and a child, etc.  
He watched TV and so did his girlfriend.  
I got an old used Ericsson cellphone that they still had laying around since the middle of the 90's, that I'm pretty sure was mine at one time, and half a pizza.  
-Can't afford a whole pizza.  
Then my mother started complaining about her life and how bad it is and how everyone is out to get her and...  
I had enough.  
Stop.  
I told them then and there that I don't view them as my family; they're just people.  
Half-brother didn't care; mother went crazy.  
She started screaming of how bad her life is and how much she's sacrificed but then I started screaming.  
Told them about how much shit they've put me through.  
Didn't matter, no one cared, and mother was going to kill herself, for real this time, sure.
She ran out.

Since he didn't speak to me because, he has a family, his girlfriend gave me a framed picture of their daughter; I kept that.  
It was night, the rain was pouring down, and I walked home; around 8-10km.  
A week or so later I was waiting for someone downtown and my mother came out of a restaurant and approached me saying that I know how much she loves me.  
I told her to never speak to me again.  

I haven't spoken to her since.  
She's sent letters blaming me for everything and so forth; but I'll never respond.
I knew we were done but I still tried and wish the half-brother a happy birthday.  
He didn't want to speak to me so I told his girlfriend to tell him; she did.
-What did he say?
-He heard it. 

Every last one of my so called family have blamed me for their problems and told me I ruined their lives; all of them. Like I said; him and his chain-smoking girlfriend sold my stuff before selling their own.

Now...
Moving on with my life.  
I've got friends and yeah, I don't feel good about anything, but I'm trying.  
I will not end up like them.  

But, you know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start...

So I've tried working, studying, gone through every available political program for the job market, I have a million ideas but I can't finish anything; I'm broken.  
I don't understand what's wrong.  

You know, I have a problem with emotions in a way.  
I can take the bad criticism; but I can't the take good.  
I don't want anyone to end up like me and I want to help people; I really, really do.
But I can't help myself...
I went through a job market program that guaranteed me a place at the university to become a teacher; first I had to complete a one year internship in every class from kindergarten to the 9th grade.  
I wanted to become a better teacher than the ones I had.
Maybe I could help the ones who had it difficult to get through school; I don't want anyone to become who I am.
I lasted like a month or two. I started in the 5th and 6th grade and the teachers didn't accept me.  I dropped out when I was at the kindergarten; but it was great there. Reading stories, playing with Lego, doing creative stuff.  
But kids are good at noticing stuff sometimes, they can also be brutally honest,  and I didn't want them to notice that I wasn't happy; the last thing I want to do what has been done to me.
What finally pulled me under was a letter from my mother again blaming me and talking about how bad her life is.

What has happened a lot of times... I can shower, shave, make myself ready.
I stand at the door, fully dresses and ready, but I can't open it.
There's an invisible wall in front of me.
So, I go back to bed.  

I didn't go back to the program.
They kindergarten called them and said they wanted me back, but..

What is wrong...

Social services treat me like shit..
They deny me social security, they make mistakes, and I have to take it.
So many times.  
I have to send papers and stuff to the courts that handled social cases.  
If you're denied by social services, and you appeal it, it's sent to the courts and you can send along papers.

I was in dire need of food, applied for emergency food-money; denied.
4 months later the courts rule that I did was entitled to get that money.
It's much stuff here that I'm not getting into but I have not been treated well.  
I'm close to getting evicted several times.  
It's not fun to come home with a notice on your door that says they're locking the door to your apartment that same week and you have nowhere else to go.

I've been bailed out by friends several times, but why am I so lazy? Why can't I just work?  
Why is this happening? I can't keep the jobs I get.

After I've tried and failed so many times.  
I managed to do something I never thought I would; I got accepted to the university.  
I was learning music production.  
Failing... but I managed to get to the third semester and I got good feedback on my work.
That was in 2010.  
Suddenly, everything came to a stop.  

I couldn't pretend anymore.
I can't do it.
When I was going to one of those political job programs, when I was 23 - 24, I told them that I think I need to talk to someone; a psychologist.  
They said they knew of one I could call; but stuff happened at the program, we had a falling out, and I left.

Now, it's 2010, I think I was still 27.  
Along the way I had lost my friends, girlfriends, and some people took more energy than what they gave.  
I was alone.  
Sometimes I couldn't afford food or internet so I was stuck with my never ending pondering (if that's the right word; negative thoughts) for months at a time and starving. 

I couldn't go on.  
I always fail; but my ideas are good.
Songs I've written (hundreds), I have ideas for movies, for tv-shows, for video games; I just want to create.  
I just stopped going; no one called to see what happened.  
No one.  
In a class of 10 people.

I finally ask for help from my health center.  
The doctor tells me I'm fine; no problems.  
I tell him no... but I'm wrong.  
I'm just so depleted and I tell him I have no idea what to do.  
So he sends me to their counselor.

I shit you not, she tells I'm fine and I should read a book and go for walk; just as when I was 16.
That didn't help me and I get to see another doctor who also tells me I'm fine.
He told me that I didn't need to see anyone ""Go to church!"", he told me.
I said I need to talk to someone; I need help because I'm not okay.
He told me that they don't offer that kind of help and the only thing I could do was to go to the emergency psychiatric unit. I said that it's not what I need.
So he gave me anti-depressants. I haven't done drugs, etc. I don't want that. But he says that's his treatment; take them.  
Fine, this is what my life as become. I take them, and I get severe cramps, the information says that if you get cramps from the medication to contact your doctor.  
He tells me I'm making it all up because I read in the information.  
I tell him no and that I won't take them anymore; so he gives me something else.  
Nothing gets better.

I continue to ask him if I could see a psychologist or something. It ends with him screaming ""FINE! I'LL SEND YOU TO ONE!""  
So, it's 2011, and I get to see a psychologist, two or three times, at the Psychiatric ward (Psychiatry).

You have to realize that everything above is not something that I've told people; not everything.  
And there is so much stuff that I still can't talk about; I can't do it.
I have always believed that I was spoiled and I ruined their lives and every time I try to get out of it and think differently I get pulled back in.

However, I tell the psychologist some things and she determines that I need to see a therapist.  
There's a guarantee that when they make a decision, when you contact them the first time, they have to do it within 3 months.  
It was march..  
April, may, june, juli, august... I call them at the end of august and wondering why I'm not getting help.  
-Oh? Well, there's no queue or anything; we just forgot you!

So in september they hastily send me to a therapist who's contract with the municipality was just about to end.  
So not only was it difficult because of that, it's difficult to open up about things when you've been told over and over again that you can't do it because bad things will happen; you're not allowed too.

I started explaining my problems.  
I think it was the same meeting that I told her about a game I played (Final Fantasy VII) and when you encounter an enemy in the game the image freezes and breaks like glass, and how as a kid I started doing that with every horrible memories I can't keep out, that she told me that I have PTSD.  
It was a coping mechanism, but... it doesn't work.  
She gave me the diagnosis of Dysthymia and PTSD.
Time's up, the year has ended, and so has her contract.

She sent a recommendation to the Psychiatry that I need more help.  
I have to wait.
And they give me anti-depressants like it was candy.  
With one doctor I entered his office, he sat at the computer, and while I was in the motion of sitting down he said; Let's try Lyrica.
-That's it, bye! 
I literally sat down, got back up, he told me to try the medication, and I walked.  
Couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes.

They send me to another therapist to start all over.
She gives me the diagnosis of Dysthymia and PTSD.
She also told me that I need to learn how to be angry.
In all my years and all my anger and sorrow I want to be better than what I'm expected to be.
I don't want to become a stereotype because of everything that's happened.
When you spend years alone without leaving your apartment for weeks at a time and you have no internet; you think.  
I'm stuck with my thoughts and can't escape them.

Time's up, you're only allowed a certain amount of hours.  
I've been told that it's only 10h today because ""People shouldn't become dependent on their psychiatrist"". 

It's the end of 2013 and now we're in 2014.  
The state is still on the lease for my apartment and they want to get rid of me.  
I considered applying for a investigation; so I can find out if there's something else wrong with me.
The state workers that check in on the people live in the apartments have helped me out and I now tell them about my problems.  
One of them tells me that what I'm describing sounds just like her kids that have ADHD.
They encourage me to apply for the investigation.

I meet someone at the Psychiatry in march of 2014.  
She tells me ""You should be grateful if you get the investigation because not everyone gets one.""; everyone tells me how grateful I should be while I still get shitty letters from my mother telling me how good of a person she is and I judged her too hard because she was such a good mother to me, and she gave up her life, and so forth.

I don't know if I'll get an investigation.  
After nearly one and a half years I get a letter from the Psychiatry saying that I get the investigation.  
I stopped eating anti-depressants and immediately felt better. I put on a lot of weight.  
Some of them just made me eat, and eat, I could've won an eating competition against The Blob.
I weighed 85kg when I started, and because the starving growing up and not learning cooking or about calories, etc., I already had a problem with food.
In spring of 2015 I had reached 120kg; that was it.  
No more medication.  
I did feel much better and in under two weeks I went down to 106kg; I know it isn't healthy.
I ate supplements, drank a ton of water, and walked 11km every day.

Candy-depressants...
To solve all my problems; I was given:
Citalopram, one I can't remember the name of, Mirtazapin, Sertralin, Lyrica, Voxra, Lergigan, Theralen, Atarax, more Sertralin, and I stopped.


Now.
Let's begin.
This is where it ends... and why I'm writing this.
When I started the investigation.

Alas, in more ways than one I've reached my limit (character limit).  
I don't expect anyone to read all of this but things have become unsolvable and I'm just letting some stuff out.  

Don't know if you can make two parters when it comes to posts here.  
If you read all of this; thanks.  
If you're looking for the TL;DR; don't have one.  
I just needed to write it down, while could get it out; though I noticed I forgot some words here and there.

Thanks."
6la06w,2,2017-07-04,Can you give me college advice for someone interested in an Accounting career?,CinematicMetropolis,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6la06w/can_you_give_me_college_advice_for_someone/,"Hello, Reddit. To give you some background, I am an eighteen year old, recent high school graduate, currently on summer break and am still undecided about what I am going to major in. Initially, and for the most part of my senior year, I was planning on earning a Communications degree. Upon even more extensive research, I have realized that this broad degree will make it difficult for me to find a well paying job post graduation. So I began looking into different majors and their employment/salary prospects, and, no surprise, the best majors seem to be within STEM, some in business, and in the medical field. Good careers within trade as well. However, I know I don't want to go into medicine, or be an engineer. I am not interested in a trade either. Looking into Business degrees, it seems one of the higher paying career choices is within an accounting degree. I have done little research on the career and I am still interested, but I am hoping to get some advice here. I graduated with a 2.7 gpa, limiting my options for attending a four year university. My next option is community college, and I have enrolled in classes. After two years, I can transfer to a state school and earn my bachelors. I live in Southern Oregon. My attendance at cc is basically paid for completely with FAFSA and a pell grant. I will be receiving refunds every term, so technically I am getting paid to go to school.  I will be living at home, not paying rent or bills, but will be working to save up for a more reliable car. I was lucky enough to get a college savings plan in middle school, and with the help of some scholarships, by the time I enter as a junior at a state school, I will have around $12,000 to spend for the last two years. I hope to work and earn more scholarships along the way to increase that money. I HOPE to graduate with little to no debt. Anyways, I have a couple concerns. 
1.) I fear attending a CC will put me at a disadvantage with other accounting students in terms of networking and internship opportunities. Advice for this? 
2.) Math has always been my worst academic skill, so I also fear this will impact me greatly in this career field. That being said, I am willing to learn and apply myself in school to strengthen my mathematical skills. How much math is involved in college vs. a real world career? 3.) Opinions on a Finance vs. Accounting degree? 
4.) The state school I plan to attend is Portland State University. Does graduating from a state school look bad? I am not necessarily interested in working for the seemingly soul sucking Big 4 jobs. I read most undergrads don't even get hired for those companies without years of experience and their CPA.
 5.) Would minoring in something technical like Computer Science, make me stand out? I am nothing more than a basic computer/tech user and have basically no knowledge about technology related majors/minors. Should I minor in anything at all?
 6.) How stable is this career and are you at least somewhat content with your job? I am the son of two immigrant parents and watching them try to raise my younger sisters and I on low paying jobs and government assistance has motivated me to pursue a career that pays well so I can support myself and my parents as they age. They are hardworking people. How well does an entry level position pay? Median salary? I have read a lot of people don't enjoy their job but have also read some do as they try to have a positive perspective on it. I am looking for financial security and stability and enough free time to satisfy the creative side of me. Are you content with your job? Maybe you weren't in the beginning but now are? 

I apologize for the lengthy post and I hope this is the right place to ask it. I am not completely familiar with the rules of Reddit. Thank you to anyone who can read and answer. "

Some of this is credit to u/Uncle_Tom1, I just took the raw list and formatted it into a table and inserted links where you can find this information.

**The Clinton Crime family over the years had to get rid of some people, unfortunately, to keep their name**.

*Did you ever hear of the tragedy of Barbara the Wise? I thought not. It's not one the DNC would tell you. Barbara the Wise was a Dark Staffer of the Commerce Department. She was so powerful and so Wise, she could influence the other staffers to create..... classified files. She had such a knowledge of the dark secrets of the Clinton Family, she could even save the files she loved from being deleted. The Dark side of the Commerce Department is the pathway to many files, some, consider to be..... classified. She was so powerful, the only thing she ever feared or was afraid of was, losing her files. Which eventually of course, she did. She told the Chair everything she knew, and the chair stripped her naked and killed her after violently bruising her. Ironic, isn't it? She could save so many from deletion, but not herself*. 


*Is it possible to learn this power? Not from a Committee of Organised Crime that operates under the puppet of ""free opportunity and equal rights"".*

I think I started to really hate myself again. I'm feeling really sad. I wish I could go and work out, or get a job, or even go out with friends. I want to do stuff, but I can't. Something inside me stops me and it's getting more and more powerful. I hate being back home. I had made plans for this summer, for my internship and vacation with friends. Well, nothing worked out. My mom was supposed to help me with the job because she's the one with the connections (yes, this is how it works here, welcome). But she didn't. She said that because of my accident on Easter (broke my foot and had surgery) she wanted me to rest. The truth is that she didn't want me to all of a sudden give up and don't go to the job again and make her look like a fool to her friends. She wants me to go on vacation but she always says that we don't have money and that me studying abroad is putting so much pressure on her (money-wise). I don't like the life that she made me believe that I can live. I can't do vacation, I can't do trips with my friends because she won't have enough for the rest of the family and her debts. And she always deprives me when I tell her I want to get a job and she tells me that I will give up and shit. Isn't it sad? And now, that nothing didn't go as planned, I completely gave up. I feel useless, I feel lost. The person that I see in the mirror isn't me. It had been years since I was that fucking sad. I remember when I used to go to my therapist and tell him that I felt depressed he responded: ""You're not depressed, depressed people don't know that they are depressed"". I really wish I had the power to hurt myself like I did 5 years ago. If I could I'd kill myself tonight. Unfortunately, I can't. I'm lost. I hate this life. I want to go back to the UK and stay there forever. I don't wanna see my family ever again. But I can't, I don't think I can work that hard and make the money for my rent and shit. I'm fucking useless."

You get all dolled up, hair up in a tight bun, thick-rimmed glasses, a tight well-cut suit jacket and pencil skirt perfectly designed to both show off your curves and present a professional faced, and then instead of working with any of the partners in the firm they stick you in a small room with some jumped up ganger with delusions of grandeur as a client and an absentee first year lawyer as a supervisor. 

Sure they had done some, I pause in my internal rant to check through the list of potential charges, holy shit, okay all of the crimes, and running one of the largest gangs in the city was kind of cool in its own right, but really how am I supposed to make a good impression on my higher ups if none of them are working on this case with me? Not that this is even a case, just the firm you have on retainer touching base about any potential litigation we may have to prepare for … and people wonder why lawyers are seen as the bad guys …

Just to look professional I skim through the papers in front of me again, shuffling them a little bit, before looking up at you, my blue eyes carefully considering your face across the desk.

“So what can we do for you today?” I’m pretty sure I got the right amount of chipper in my tone to hide some of the boredom but … you don’t look exactly fooled. 

_______________________________________________
So this idea is a little half-formed after an evening enjoying some retro gaming with Saint Rows 2 (is that old enough to be retro now?). The general idea is that a law student sort of riding out her summer internship meets the leader of one of the larger gangs in the city and they eventually corrupt her from prim and proper law student to tattooed gang slut.

I’m open to any kinks where I don’t have to be dominant, but the one I’m insisting on including is some kind of -ification or corruption (slutification, bimbofication, ect.). 

I’m also more than happy to flesh this out before starting or just jumping in. Special attention will be given to females or futa but I’m open for business to anyone tonight.

Anyway, hope to hear from you pervs soon,

Ethan Brenthouse took a long, slow sip from his mojito, draining it down to the ice. He had to admit, as much as his preference was for American rye, the Dominicans made a damn good cocktail. He lazily signaled to a wide-eyed waitress, who quickly shuffled over.

""Another please, mamacita"" he sneered in his distinctive, privileged drawl.

""Of course sir,"" the young girl quietly responded, giving him a pained smile before hurrying back to the bar. In the meantime Ethan sat back on his chair, folding his arms and listening to the waves of the Caribbean crashing into the white sand of Puta Cana Playa, just a hundred or so feet away.

It was good to be American again.

It was hard sometimes to process how much the country had changed in a few short years. Ever since the astonishing electoral victory of the Founding Father's Party in 2020, America had finally fulfilled its Manifest Destiny and become the Empire it always deserved to be. The red, white and blue juggernaut had steamrolled through Venezuela in 2021, crushing the socialist uprising and liberating the world's largest proven oil reserves. Across Latin America rebellions and left-wing insurgencies everywhere from Honduras to Peru were crushed by US-backed dictators using America-made weapons. And yes, the FFP had also built the big, beautiful wall on the Mexican border.

The entire southern continent was now nothing more than one huge maquiladora, making American goods for next-to-nothing and pumping money into the glorious US economy. Places like the Dominican Republic had become veritable gold-minds for American investors. In the morning they could grease some palms, and displace a few hundred favela-dwellers to build a new luxury hotel for American tourists. In the afternoon, dine with corrupt government officials to ensure that US corporations could have monopolies on the country's natural resources. And in the evening, party with an army of Latina sluts, all desperate for a principe blanco to take them to the US.

Which brings us back to Ethan Brenthouse.

Tall, blonde, and chiseled from years of polo and lacrosse, Ethan was about to enter his final year at Dartmouth, and had decided to take the summer to ""intern"" with a venture capital firm down in DR - one owned by an alumni of his frat. Ostensibly Ethan was there to help find new, market-friendly investment opportunities for the growing and dynamic American market. In reality this just involved a lot of partying and drinking, for which Ethan would receive an extremely generous stipend and a job after he graduated with one of Washington's biggest lobbying companies.

Tonight, however, Ethan wasn't interested in business. He was interested in pleasure.

He had tried to make some vague promise to himself to stay faithful to his girlfriend back in Dartmouth over the month he was down in DR - after all he'd cheated, and been forgiven, so many times it was honestly farcical at this point. That changed his second night in Puta Cana however, when he found himself in a strip club's VIP room with some whore on her knees in front of him, head bobbing up and down. The women down here were just so...desperate and servile. Was it the Catholicism? Their sense of inbred inferiority? Or just the fact they knew 21-year-old Ethan was in possession of more money than they could ever dream of?

The waitress returned a deposited his mojito with a timid smile before disappearing. Taking a drink, Ethan's eyes scanned around the hotel's restaurant. It seemed the Mandarin had taken extra care to have plenty of eye-candy on display for their Western visitors, so Ethan wasn't exactly lacking for options. Waitress? Hostess? Classily-dressed girls, here all alone, who were likely hookers?
One way or another, his privileged white seed would be flowing down some puta's throat tonight...

Hi there! Do taboo themes like corruption and raceplay turn you on? Do you want to explore the sick, dystopic side to American colonization? Do you want a well-written, eloquent roleplay that can be either short-term or long-term? Well then you're in luck. This is a story where, together, we craft the downfall of a beautiful, young Latina girl. Maybe she's a waitress, struggling to make ends meet, and sees Ethan as a ticket to the top. Maybe she's a student, wide-eyed by Ethan's riches, or maybe she's a high-class escort, surviving a dystopic world, who knows how to give boys like Ethan the Latina experience they crave. Whatever character you choose, it'll be one where Ethan gets to realize his innate superiority over the mulatto hoards of Latin America, fucking their women just as his country had fucked over their people.

I realize the prompt is quite dark but I'm far, far more interested in mental degradation and corruption than anything physical. I find it so much hotter when a girl forces herself to willingly submit to an arrogant guy then any actual rape scene.

If you're at all interested, shoot me a message. Hope to hear from you!"
6lb744,3,2017-07-04,IJW: The Amazing Spider-Man (2012),justalrightreviews,Ijustwatched,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/6lb744/ijw_the_amazing_spiderman_2012/,"“… like watching Arnie from ‘What’s Eating Gilbert Grape’ if he became a superhero.”

A while after the catastrophe that was Spider-Man 3, it was decided to revive the character of Spider-Man in an attempt to give a more faithful, and maybe less disappointing, adaptation to the fans (make more money). Holy shit did they fucking miss the mark. The Amazing Spider-Man once again follows Peter Parker, an angsty teen who uses Bing and has a flip-phone, as he learns to deal with newly acquired powers after being bitten by a spider that was like a super scientific spider. Instead of Mary Jane we have Gwen Stacey as the love interest, and the villain is none other than Dr. Curt Conners a.k.a The Lizard.

I don’t have more witty banter to ease you into this review so let’s just do it. Peter Parker is supposed to be a nerdy kid who has a heart of gold but isn’t the most popular guy, right? Where the fuck does it say that he has autism, because either I or Andrew Garfield completely misinterpreted the character. This iteration of Peter Parker was literally one spider bite away from become a fucking school shooter, and that makes his character more pathetic than it does endearing. Stuttering through sentences, not making eye contact with anyone, constantly shaking when he’s put in any social situation; it was honestly like watching Arnie from ‘What’s Eating Gilbert Grape’ if he became a superhero. Luckily, much like everyone on the internet, as soon as Peter Parker puts on his anonymity mask he becomes the witty cool guy that he wishes he could be all of the time. This version of Spider-Man, who is pretty much just an asshole, is one that I like more than the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man. He feels more in control, almost as if he’s more experienced despite the fact that they have the same amount of experience. A lot of people say that this version of Spider-Man is closer to the comics, but I don’t know about all of that; all I know is that he was good for a few laughs, and for that he’s alright in my book. Other characters of note include Gwen Stacey, who was alright I guess. I wasn’t really a fan of how much better than Peter she seemed to be in every way, but maybe I’m just drawing that comparison because Peter was literally fucking useless. I thought Emma Stone did a good job with her portrayal, but I will admit she played Gwen Stacey as “Emma Stone Clone #3452”. You also have the character of Dr. Conners who was cool, until he turned into The Lizard. I honestly can not say that I’ve seen a funnier looking villain in any movie ever. I understand that as far as human/lizard hybrids go this is about as good as it gets, but couldn’t you at least give the fucker a nose?

Apart form all of that I found the story of The Amazing Spider-Man to be pretty boring. Not only have we seen this origin story before, but the way the movie tackled seems kind of half-assed. Uncle Ben dying (spoilers, btw) is supposed to be a huge catalyst in the Spider-Man origin story, but in this movie it is brushed of in like two scenes. It seems like the characters didn’t care about anything, and this made it hard for me to care about anything. I also thought the music in the movie was always wrong. I’m not sure if it was just put in the wrong order, or if the composer wanted to go home for the night, but literally every time I noticed the music it was because I was thinking “What the fuck is this?”. Skateboarding montage where Peter also learns about his powers? Let’s throw some depressing indie shit in there. A superhero fight in a high school where a lot of people can be injured at any moment? Let’s throw some uplifting orchestra shit and be done with it. It was always fucking wrong. As far as the CGI in the movie goes, it was either great or terrible. A lot of the scenes with Spider-Man flying through New York, or the Lizard doing his thing wherever the fuck he was, looked great; but at the same time there were a lot of smaller details that looked like shit. For instance: during the bridge fight we see cars flying overhead and a giant Lizard is the one doing the throwing; that all looked fine. As soon as we get a close-up to one of the people trapped inside a car hanging off the bridge it looked like shit. It’s almost like they spent their entire budget on the Spider-Man and Lizard effects, so they had the fucking intern do the rest. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate where their priorities were, but one bad apple can unfortunately spoil the bunch.

Overall The Amazing Spider-Man wasn’t  what I would call great. My biggest issue with the film was the terrible characterization of Peter Parker, which made him seem mentally challenged, but I also had issues with the music and a few story points. What I did like in the film (the Spider-Man stuff) was few and far between, and honestly it is pretty forgettable anyway.

I give The Amazing Spider-Man a C

6ld3lt,2,2017-07-05,[GER] €900 a month for two people (student) How to get better?,HeisenbergGER,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ld3lt/ger_900_a_month_for_two_people_student_how_to_get/,"Hello, 
I'm a student from Germany and receive 900€ from my family as a compulsory financial support (there is a law here that your parents have to support you during your studies when they can). I live with my girlfriend in a 20 square meter apartment, paying around 500€ a month (including all utilities like electricity, water, internet, phone etc.) 

That leaves us with 400€. My girlfriend is here on a language visa, requiring her to attend language school. The current fee is 220€ a month. However, this is going to go up to 330€ a month next year due to a waiver expiration. We're already short on money, spending around 100€ a month on food. Leisure is non negotiable. I still manage to put away around 20€ a month, building a small emergency fund designed to cover our expenses for around 1 month. But next year is going to be worse. We can't live on 70€ a month. 

My girlfriend is, due to visa restrictions, not allowed to work. I spend almost all my day in university (typically from 09:00am till 07:00pm) attending lectures and learning. This basically means, that I'm not really able to work during my semesters. 
In my free time and semester breaks, I try to work to save up a bit of money for the next semester, but every month is such a close call. Adding to that: Starting this semester, I will also be busy to attend compulsory and unpaid internships during half of the duration of my semester break. 

Despite all that, I still managed to stay out of a loan and I'm not looking to go into one. 
I just don't see a way on how we can survive like this next year. This situation stresses her out even more than me, I'm a really calm and optimistic soul. 
But even I start doubting that we can pull through next year. 
The parents of my girlfriend are not willing to support their daughter in any way either. Trust me, I've tried.

I will probably graduate with a bachelor degree in 2 years - a long time to bridge. But that's not the end the road. As a physicist, you need at least a master degree, if not a phd, to go into the industry, research or to work as an educator at a university. 
Do you guys have any idea what we could do? I just don't see any way how we can improve our situation.

I'm 1 year away from graduation but I've a decent knowledge in GNU/linux systems and the sysadmins stuff. I could do anything from a web hosting stuff (don't prefer it tho) automation things using python - bash etc. I could use tools like ansible and such too but I've to read some docs first tho.
 
I've the basic knowledge  in virtualization and using some variant hypervisors also could work with the cloud platforms (prefer openstack) too.. didn't play with em too much tho but I know the basics that could help me .

also I could write decent docs as I worked as a technical writer for two years now. (worked with huffpost- samma3a.com- arageek)

I also been fiddling with C in order to get to micro controllers programming  and I could play with PIs already and their GPIO using python. just saying.

I really could work with any tech as long as I've the time to read docs and playing around with it a little.

TL;DR: an open-source  geek looking for internship while in Kuwait."

I am an American resident who finished his bachelors in Computer Science recently. The school that I went to in my undergrad wasn't a top-tier school at all but it didn't cost me anything, which was the main reason to attend it. During my time there, I had the chance to intern twice and at the end of the my second internship, I got at a full-time offer from one of the investment banks in New York. However, I realized that I love academia and research more than the industry and therefore I decided to apply to top graduate schools. USC was the only school who accepted me. The entire program is going to cost around 80K and I was planning to apply for federal loans to cover my tuition. But is it really worth it? Especially if I am interested in doing a PhD after my MS. I would really appreciate your feedback on this!  "

6leiwd,28,2017-07-05,Never thought I'd say it but I miss the order.,chanz21,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/6leiwd/never_thought_id_say_it_but_i_miss_the_order/,"More of a vent than anything...

I'm not allowed to schedule two people at once when needed for the front during our busiest times. They believe in everyone chipping in except from their department. It's a mini resort out in the country and there is one GM who hires managers and refuses to allow managers to manage. There are 3 maids (one of which only works on Monday, the other two work monday-Friday tending to turning rooms, refreshing , and cleaning all areas needed for the event/bar areas), one maintenance man, and one front desk agent at a time with an assistant manager or hotel manager on duty to a two digit room hotel.  I went from working corporate to small business. 

I was hired as a manager for a hotel that needed some direction.  I'm fortunate to have gained a position after leaving my internship straight from college but the toll it took after a year leaves me wondering if it was worth it despite me knowing it is worth it because of the experience. I don't get a budget. It's a miracle when I can spend money and sometimes I just hope there's money in the bank if I need things for emergency. Hotel doesn't get much love but the event side sure does get updated weekly. GM doesn't like confrontation so I wouldn't know what I did wrong even if I asked because she'd like to my face and just complain about it to the event side. 

Even though I enjoy being able to do as I please....
The fortune I felt dwindled as my eyes opened and the freedom of flexibility with schedule became a ball and chain on my soul.  

Let's start with......

Maintenance/landscaping/pest control/trash man/Bob the builder/banquets(set up of chairs and tables/anything else): This is a one man show with some help from time to time if he is able to find a guy. It being a big and old property there are weeks and weeks of unpaid overtime. 
 
Housekeeping: OT pay doesn't exist either.  2 on duty Monday-Sunday. Laundry, refreshing , cleaning for whatever the rooms the event side needs, lobby, trash, bathrooms....if it's needed , they're the ones that clean. 30 rooms, if it's a one night stay, to turn a day. 


Front Desk: One person at a time is allowed on duty.  Manager on duty is the second person. FD and management handles event paperwork, hotel blocks, pool, security, inventory, water activities; since the hired personnel clocks in and leaves , rooms, housekeeping, maintenance, and drunks. 


Water Activities: People were hired to regulate these activities as the Front Desk has little vision over this area. Last year it was expected that one agent and the Manager on duty manage the flow of people who came to swim. Pass out tickets, sign forms and keep the area under control  but we spoke out. So, the GM decided to hire some inexperienced workers and this problem still exists because they are not doing what they were poorly managed to do and summer season leaves little room for FD to help out. One attendant at the water is not enough. 


Events:
 Event side is only interested in weddings, anything else they have the FD watch over and take the day off whenever. Leaving the front with rooms, people, and a party to control. They expect maids (2people) to clean the event center and flip 30 something rooms all in one day.  They instruct them to clean , day of, without checking the check ins or rooms needed for refreshing. They sit and gossip for 3 hours. Sit on FB for 2. Work for 3. They want/expect everyone to do everything for them and know everything but when they have to know or do something for the hotel it's a foreign language that becomes a hassle and major issue. Their definition of busy in a hotel is the phone ringing and 3 people waiting to be checked in....that's ""CRAZY BUSY"", ""we were up to our ears in work"". 

I miss order. I miss procedures. I miss operations. Why? I must be crazy. Chain of command is ignored which is the main issue. 

TL;Dr I miss order in my work life after working at a business that gave me all the flexibility and had little to no chain of command. "

*[Continued from Chapter 46, here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Romanticon/comments/6imqe1/dark_america_chapter_46_under_the_setting_sun/)*

The next morning, I headed off, once again into the unknown - alone.

Sara had to stay behind, back on that hill overlooking the town.  Several times, I considered taking a blade to that horrible cord that bound her to the monstrosity, the Unity, that reared up over the horizon behind her.  I knew, however, that doing so would likely hurt her more than it would help, and could even kill her.  

It broke my heart.  Sara looked, acted, felt exactly the same as before.  But it wasn't quite her, just like how the vision of my wife, inside that dream, hadn't exactly been my wife.  It had spoken like Alexis, looked like Alexis, moved like Alexis - but in the end, it turned out to just be a projection, a wax figurine.

And when I forced myself to cast aside the veil of emotion, I had to acknowledge that Sara wasn't quite her normal self.  Not any longer.

It was the little things, the things that my brain tried at first to keep me from noticing.  I should have caught it earlier on, last night, but I kept it out of my forethoughts for too long before it was too much to ignore.

She didn't feel the cold.  That was the first indication that Sara was different.  Sure, when I built up a fire, she moved in close and held out her hands to take in its warmth - but when I returned from gathering more wood, the fire had burned down to little more than coals and a few scattered embers, and she stood there with her arms bare, not even showing any hints of goosebumps.  

She claimed to not be hungry.  I scavenged some extra canned food for her, but she let it sit untouched.  I wonder if she even needed to eat at all, any more, or if everything came to her through that cord.

Later, she made me promise that I would stay awake and watch over her until she fell asleep.  But although I waited, and although she closed her eyes, she never actually slowed her breathing, never drifted fully into unconsciousness.  Eventually, I accepted her pretense that she was sleeping and let my own consciousness slip away.

She still looked, spoke, acted just like Sara - but it wasn't quite her.

And she couldn't go beyond the hill.  I told her that I'd be heading out to try and reach the ship that she saw off the coast, but she never even suggested trying to come along.  She acted as though she knew it was beyond her reach, that she couldn't get herself free to go join me in escaping.

""Promise me that you'll come back,"" she said, sitting down amid the long, gently waving blades of grass at the top of the hill.

I nodded, sank to one knee so I could reach out to take her hands.  This was still Sara, still a girl who hadn't even reached puberty, I kept thinking to myself.  Despite being connected to a monster, that didn't change who she was.  

It was still Sara, in there somewhere.  

Did that mean that, somewhere deep inside that dream, my wife had truly been there?  Had there been a shade of her spirit, looking out at me and watching as I screamed back at her, did my best to destroy her?  Had she been begging me to stop, or urging me on, telling me to get out while I still could?

I couldn't let myself get lost in thoughts like that.  I held Sara's small hand, looked her in the eyes.  ""I'll come back for you,"" I told her, meaning every word.  ""I promise.""

She blinked a couple of times, looking almost like she was about to cry, but swallowed the tears.  ""Okay.  Good.""

And so, fighting wetness in my own eyes, I headed down the hill towards the small town on the side of the ocean.

It wasn't hard to locate a boat in the marina.  I found the keys to a small cruiser that should have no trouble navigating the light chop on the way out to sea, but I needed to break the lock off a supply depot to siphon some gasoline out of the inside tank.  Once I was fairly certain that the boat's motor wouldn't run out and strand me out at sea, I fired it up and headed off the shore.

The ship saw me first.  Heading towards what was little more than a hazy spot on the horizon, I heard a buzzing sound come from above me.  Looking up, I spotted a drone as it dipped down from my butts, hanging above me.  I knew that, inside the black sphere at its front end, cameras were swinging around to zoom in on my face.  I wondered if they had recognition software up and running, or if I was going to be met at the ship by stony-faced men armed with automatic weapons.

As if there was any other way.  I cut the engine as I neared the large, gunmetal-gray military vessel, standing up and waving with both hands to the unsmiling men looking over the railing to show them that I wasn't armed.

""Permission to come aboard!"" I called out, reaching back to give the throttle one last burst, just to keep the side-wash from the destroyer from pushing me away.

No answer came back - but after a minute, someone threw down a rope ladder over the side.  

I hesitated for a second before reaching out to grab the ladder.  If I climbed aboard, I'd be losing the boat.  That would leave me on the ship, without a way to reach the mainland.  On one hand, the mainland didn't hold anything for me, currently... but it also was where all my squad mates were, in some way, and I'd promised Sara that I would come back.

Seeking to compromise, I turned off the boat's engine and, with a spare bit of rope, lashed it to the bottom of the ladder.  I couldn't leave it like that for long, or the boat would be smashed to pieces from being repeatedly knocked against the armored hull of the destroyer.  But it would hold for the moment.

Then, taking a deep breath, I seized the ladder in both hands and climbed aboard.

Just as I'd suspected, I was met at the top of the ladder by three unsmiling faces.  Two of those faces were connected to bodies holding automatic rifles, aimed not quite in my direction.  The stance of their holders, however, along with their hard eyes and set jaws, told me that the direction of those rifles could change in an instant, should I make any attempt to start trouble.

I gave those two men a single nod, then turned my attention to the third newcomer, standing in between the bodyguards.

She looked... tired, I found myself thinking.  I guessed that she was in her early to middle forties, but heavy lines of exhaustion added a decade to her appearance.  Short-cropped blonde hair with a hint of red, clearly maintained by a razor rather than a stylist's shears.  Somehow, she made the bulky fatigues look like they belonged on her, like it was impossible to imagine her wearing anything else.

She stood there for a long minute, just looking at me.  I had to keep my spine straight under her exacting gaze and hope that I measured up.  Finally, just as I started to wonder if she would simply wordlessly throw me off the boat, she opened her mouth.  

""And who,"" she asked softly, suspicion coloring her tone, ""are you?""

So recently I've been starting to get really stressed out about work. Of our 3 team leads we have at my work place, only 1 of them is here right now. One other got a new job, and the other is in the hospital and it's yet to be seen if she will be able to return. Because of that, as a supervisor I've had an immense amount of work placed on me. I work in IT, and I'm usually stressed enough because I have to train new hires and interns. I also have to answer phones and help customers. 


My days are more or less the same, and that alone is enough to drive me crazy, then I have all these people always following me and waiting on me and I get no down time. The only time I get to feel better is when I'm able to go into the field and work on computers or networks. But I have been removed from this section of the job because we have 4 interns and 2 trainees, and not enough trainers to baby sit them all. I have also been assigned a team of my own within this job now too, so on top of my other responsibilities, I have a manager that is micromanaging like crazy and forcing all these new things on me. 


I already dislike being a supervisor because honestly I don't like to be the one to bitch out other people when I'm not even the best tech we have, but the pay raise is a dollar and when you're broke you do what you have to. But with everything lately I've been feeling trapped. Yesterday was Independence Day, and I'm usually super excited and happy on that day (it's my favorite holiday) but yesterday I was dreading coming to work today. I never dread coming to this job. I took an extra few days off work this last weekend because I was going crazy last week. I never take time off work. 


Now on top of feeling trapped at work, I feel trapped in my own mind. I've been coming home from 8+ hour days and I immediately crash, even if sitting up. Then I wake up, eat, play like an hour of video games or play music and it's back to sleep. It's nothing but a grind. I'm not in a position to just quit, so I have to hold in there for another few months.


I know that I don't have it as bad as others. I only work 40 hours a week, I know guys that work 70. But for me, this is all too much. For the last few years I've been trapped into the mindset to do school, so I've been trying, but this is my last hurrah. I keep telling myself that I have to work super hard here at this job so I can get a full time job here. If I get that, then I can pay off my damn debts. That's the dream, right? Well I don't really even want a full time position here or a team lead position. If the stress I'm experiencing now is just half of what my team leads experience, then why the hell would I stay?


I don't know what to do. I'm 23 and the last thing I want is to be trapped in my own mental loop again. I usually take pride in work, but this just isn't working with my current mental state. 

If you've read this far, thank you. I would appreciate anyone's advice in this matter. Thank you!

Episode Title Inspired by [“Drowning on Dry Land” - Tab Benoit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6cbtTD9mhA)

**Alternate Friends Title** - The One Where Izzie Borrows a Drill from a Guy Named Vince


**Random Thoughts**
  
- George is a liar, liar, pants on fire to that woman waiting until she knows her kid is safe to be operated on. Thank goodness it turned out alright for him.
- Why is Alex, an intern, in charge of informing the families? Isn’t there some protocol for this? Surely this is not the first mass casualty/mass injury Seattle Grace (a Level One trauma center) has had. It set up a good story line with Alex and the Polaroids, but it was pretty unbelievable. 
- Meredith was under that water a LONG time.
- Burke taking what Cristina said too personally. Come on, Preston, you are too touchy.
- Izzie was kind of a badass and now she has OR privileges back.
- Derek and Mark have a moment. Mark’s a good friend (you know, besides the whole sleeping with his wife thing).
- Wow, Izzie is just gonna say ALL her thoughts.
- Creepy blonde girl found her mama. Yay!
- I’m gonna reveal something that’s probably going to get me down voted, but here goes. When I first watched this back in the day, I was hoping Meredith would die. She was THAT annoying. She still is, but I don’t wish for her death anymore.







**Quotes**

- “You know everyone’s back. Everyone’s back except her. And I listen to her. Everyday, about her McLove life, her McDreamy, her McCrap. And the one day, the one day I have a thing she disappears.”
- “If I murdered someone, she’s the person I’d call to help me drag the corpse across the living room floor.”
- “If you went missing, I’d notice.”
- “I believe in the good.”
- “Hey..Am I…dead?” “Damn right, you are.”


**Questions**


- Do you think George already regrets his decision to marry Callie or do you think he thinks he is happy at this point?
- Does Sydney remind anyone else a little of April?

6lggkf,12,2017-07-05,What CNN did is part of the left's effort to silence right-wing speech online,SKWM3000,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6lggkf/what_cnn_did_is_part_of_the_lefts_effort_to/,"it's been going on for some time.  i've been following it since facebook, in cooperation with germany, created the Online Civil Courage Initiative.  this was created in response to pressure from merkel, who disliked the fact that facebook provided a platform for people to critique her policy on refugees.  you may recall that they tried to cover up the NYE rapes in cologne 2016.  it was because of social media that anyone found out.

you know, of course, that after this happened, twitter, google (which owns youtube), facebook, and microsoft got together to collectively agree to try to reduce hate speech online.  we started to see twitter getting rid of right-wing accounts. (remember when they removed milo's verification?)

and more recently you remember that youtube started demonetizing videos because of their hateful content--and how this policy appeared to cast a wide net, including seemingly any video that covered the news.

you also know, i'm sure, that germany has passed legislation recently that will enable them to go after people who post ""hate speech"" online--or the social media company that gave them their platform.

while this has been going on, we've also seen the rise of irl deplatforming in the UK and the US.

it's certain that youtube's actions are partly due to pressure from old media seeking to destroy smaller content creators.  and it must be noted that youtube's algorithm privileges larger companies over smaller creators.  so there's more to this than just a march against online speech.

reddit has changed with the times as well, banning certain communities.  i recall when communities like jailbait or creepshots were banned--which made sense since they sometimes trafficked sexualized content of minors.  it didn't help that anderson cooper did a piece about r/jailbait.  

in the era of chairman pao we saw communities like fatpeoplehate get banned for the crime of hurting people's feelings.

i remember when gawker doxxed violentacres.  VA was a troll but also a scummy dude and gawker reasoned that outing him was in the public interest.  the story got picked up by MSM, including CNN.  anderson cooper did a piece about it.  i don't know what VA is up to these days but he did lose his job after CNN broadcast his info.

instead of a shit tier site like gawker or buzzfeed doxxing hanassholesolo, we see CNN doing it.  to me this is an escalation in the war against free speech online.  **this was done to chill free speech online.**

recall that ""fake news"" was blamed for trump's victory.  the narrative is that right-wing speech online was able to advance false stories that influenced the electorate.  zuckerberg has said he regrets that facebook provided a platform for this fake news.

the media, in this fight, not only wants to push back against the new media, it also wants to contain the ability of people on the right to communicate with each other.  when talk radio surged in popularity, they tried to use the fcc and restore the fairness clause to combat it.  under obama, they tried to put monitors in newsrooms.  and now, here we are.  in order to both crush new media and right-wing online speech, they are now going after individuals who create popular online content that undermines them or questions narratives they want to advance.

so, again, this is an escalation of two battles that have been going on for decades:  old media vs. new media and elitists vs. right-wing speech.  it's hard in the US to contain online speech through state action so media organizations are doing it on behalf of the left-wing elites.

i fully expect that a second-tier left-leaning publication, like buzzfeed or huffpo, will ultimately make hanassholesolo's info public.  i don't believe that cnn can keep that info locked down and i believe an intern or some low-level person will leak it in the name of ""the resistance"" or some such bullshit.  and to be honest, i think this was the plan all along.  the media in this country are now toying with re-conceptualizing journalistic ethics to bring them in line with the social justice orthodoxy of the left.  this means they must become activists, as the buzzfeed call for technologists reveals.

my two cents. 

**tldr**

* i think we're witnessing the symptoms of an underlying transformation of journalistic ethics to bring them in line with the left's social justice orthodoxy

* expect more of this from the MSM in the coming years

* what happened to hanassholesolo is part of two ongoing struggles: old media vs new media and elites vs right-wing speech (see: left's attacks on conservative talk radio, obama's efforts to monitor newsrooms, facebook's OCCI, twitter purge of right-wing voices, youtube's recent demonetization of videos, reddit's banning of the FPH community, crusade against online ""fake news"" that supposedly propelled trump into the white house.)"
6lgmqa,9,2017-07-05,You need to learn how to disconnect,ThomasOlaf,productivity,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/6lgmqa/you_need_to_learn_how_to_disconnect/,"Lately with running my blog, twitter and doing an internship I have had trouble disconnecting and allowing time for my mind to catch up. This I find is very important to self progression, you need to let your mind reset for it to go forward. Think of your body and mind as a sprint: Attack your work at full force then, rest, evaluate and sprint again.

Not allowing yourself to disconnect can be extremely dangerous, it will numb your mind. Another running analogy is to imagine this constant usage as a marathon, after a while your body settles into a rhythm and numbs, you don’t feel the individual strides, the stretching of tendons and the impact on your feet. Many people end up in this cycle. Daily numbing of the mind from dull work, lack of exercise and overload of data from social media will set the brain into endurance mode.

If you are really committed to growth and self improvement it is fundamental to disconnect. This issue really became apparent to me over the past weekend as I went to Transylvania. The mountains reaching the sky, the vast planes wide, open and full of corn ebbing and flowing with the wind, mountain dogs and puppies who take your attention away from the world…I was a different person.

I came back to reality refreshed and ready to go, I was energised and completely stress free – a lot more productive. You don’t need your own Mountain to unwind on but it is important to find somewhere you can be alone and free – disconnected from the world.

I am not perfect, I have faults and flaws and this is something I really need to work on. I have seen the benefits I just need to do it more often. This weekend I return to the mountains to unwind, cook, eat and enjoy company. Do something for yourself this weekend and reset your brain.

Here are some of my ideas that I have used to disconnect: * Go on a long walk/run without your phone. * Go to a spa or swimming pool and unwind. * Go to the sea and swim, fish or surf. * Delete all forms of social media off your phone for the weekend and let life happen.

Remember: Bursts of smart working is more beneficial than hours of poor quality work.

**Foreword**

""LAST TIME ON: REMEMBER THE WIFE OF LOT, GLORIA AND HER FAMILY INDOCTRINATE A POOR MEXICAN FAMILY WHILE SHE SUFFERS THE WRATH OF WATCHTOWER CONDITIONING! STAY TUNED!"" (And yes, the actual drama has ""previously on Remember the Wife of Lot"" said at the start).

Alright, so I had to work up quite a bit of motivation to start writing this. No matter how many times I started this post, I'd remember the homophobia in part 2 and couldn't even pull up the video to watch it. When I say homophobia, I MEAN homophobia. If you go on the JW website and find part 2 of the drama, in the related articles section you can see ""How Can You Explain the Bible's View of Homosexuality?"", ""Does the Bible Comment on Same-Sex Marriages?"", and ""What Does the Bible Say About Homosexuality?"" They're really trying to profit off of that, aren't they? I don't understand why they placed the topic of homosexuality in the movie anyway. My guess is that they're trying to incorporate the part in the story of Lot where a bunch of dudes try to gangbang the two angels. And if you remember, Lot ""graciously"" offered the group of men to rape his own daughters instead. Lovely.

So, let's get into fundamentalist wet dream: ""Remember the Wife of Lot"" part dos.

**Part 2**

Brian is on the phone with his brother-in-law who wants him to participate in his new investments. Brian refuses, saying that the investments are too risky and would take too much of his money and time (and as we all know, that money and time gots to go to Big Brother). They bicker for a bit until Brian finally hangs up. This is obviously supposed to show how resilient and ""strong"" Brian is for refusing business opportunities unlike his ""weak"" wife who wants give them silly things like ""comforts"" and ""education"" and ""financial stability"". Meanwhile, Gloria picks up a flyer for a business college and puts it in her purse, and tells Brian that their family should invest in something better, like her real estate job. They argue again (BORING) and just as Gloria is heading out, Brian asks where she's going. Gloria drops the bombshell that she's going to real estate classes. Brian, in a state of shock, asks Gloria to talk about her decision but Gloria closes the door on him in the sitcom-y way. To make it even more humorous, Gloria opens the door again asking for some taxi fare from Brian.

We transition to Joe's home as the brothers play hackysack (like growing boys do!) and Mary (whose only character trait is that she cooks dinner) tells them to clean up and sit at the dinner table. Joe comes home from work (lots of walking through doors in this movie), and the boys hackysack is accidently thrown at Joe. Joe, in the dumbest thing I've ever seen anyone get mad at (Watchtower needs a cheap way to show that he's got a temper!), yells at his sons to stop and go eat dinner, saying how there's something important he needs to talk about. Joe announces that he wants the whole family to start studying the bible Jehovah Witness style, and Arthur mockingly asks if he wants him to become a priest. Joe's other son Ricky said that he read some of the publications and that he enjoyed them (AND THE AWARD FOR MOST UNREALISTIC 15 YEAR OLD BOY IN MOVIE HISTORY GOES TO...). Mary is, of course, on board with the idea of studying and says how much she loves JWs and that the faith is helping Joe out with his temper. Ricky, Mary, and Joe are in, but Arthur shows reluctance in joining a cult (as he should, smart kid).

We cut to Gloria showing clients around a house and making deals (gotta make that cheddar!) and comes home through the door of her home holding tons of shopping bags as she tries to walk quietly, hoping not to atrract attention from Brian. This fails as the floor creaks beneath her, and Brian comments on all the shit she bought. Gloria, estactic about her first sale, bought a bunch of clothing and jewelry in hopes of getting promoted in her job. Now, if Gloria's greed wasn't so exaggerated by WT and she never went on her shopping spree, everything would work out much more in her favor. It's a strawman (am I using that word right?) set up by Watchtower to show that everyone who pursues a good career is by default, wasteful and spends all their money on luxury items. And as typical, Brian gives the sermon of how he doesn't like her job and wants to do more spiritually while Gloria's carefree and almost aloof attitude assures him that she can do both.

Joe and Brian go out in service, and find a hostile man at the door yelling about how he's tired and why these two don't go out and get real jobs. Joe recognizes the man as his former co-worker Frank, and Frank immediately warms up and relates the story of how Joe got mad at his job once (HE'S MAD, I TELL YOU, MAD!). Frank is surprised at Joe's new demeanor and invites them inside his home for some beers (and of course Joe refuses the alcohol). I wish Watchtower would stop trying to be comedians and just talk about the damn bible like they're supposed. 

Gloria is on the phone with her mother, as Ruby showers glowing praise on how proud she is of her daughter doing well at her job. Ruby asks if Anna accepted the internship she set up for her, and Gloria affirms that her daughter starts next week. Gloria says if she closes a deal on her next house, that she could afford the down payment on the fancy new place she's been eyeing. They share in a moment of excitement and Gloria hangs up as her clients come through the door, and she indeed makes the sale.

Joe and his family step into the baptismal pool and are dunked as Gloria's family record it on their phones and beam with pride at the new drones. Brothers and sisters come to congratulate the family, including Tina as she comes to Ricky. Ricky talks about how he's learning sign language, but their conversation is cut short as Gloria pulls her away, obviously disturbed by two people of the opposite sex being within three feet of eachother. The CO from part one attempts to converse with Gloria, but passes him by as she needs to go attend to her work. The CO sits down next to Brian and asks him why Gloria's in such a hurry, and Brian explains her situation. Of course, the CO starts making a big deal about how they're going into da wurld!!!!!! Brian appreciates his support (or as I call it, nagging) and invites him for dinner at their new home. The CO agrees and leaves Brian to contemplate their SINFUL WAYS OF GETTING EDUCATED AND HAVING MONEY!!!!

The family sets up for dinner as we see their fancy new home. The CO comes through the door, commenting on how huge their apartment is, with Gloria saying how their income is a blessing from Jehovah (ensue awkward silence and judgement). CO says how he drove past their old home and how he had fond memories of spending time with the family there. Brian asks Tina to show him around, and Tina and the CO talk about how she misses their old neighborhood, saying how stuck up all the people in her building are. The CO relates his own experiences of moving around as a child, and says that setting a goal (in Watchtower's interests and benefit, of course) could help her to cope. Tina relates that she wants to learn a language, and they remember Ricky and his goal. CO asks where Anna is, and Gloria says she's with their cousin Kevin at her new job. The CO asks how Anna is feeling about all the change, and Tina gives a vague answer and says how they invited one of her friends to ~~guilt her~~ come and encourage her. The CO commends Tina for not being like her other female relatives and sticking to the religion, and how they're not going to ""give up"" on her sister. This phrase creeped me out when I heard it, they say it like Anna is dealing with drug addiction or prostituting herself on the streets. They view Anna's new career as a threat instead of an accomplishment, and this is only another facet of the guilt, shame, and warped goals that Watchtower forces onto its victims.

Anna and Kevin walk down the hallway looking at some files, saying how they need they're behind on work and will have to fill in with overtime. Anna reminds Kevin that she has a family dinner to attend, but Kevin tells her that work needs to come first (in the overly flanderized tone of the world that WT loves to display). Anna relents and says she'll text her mother, but is afraid of the wrath of her father. Kevin offers to cover for her and that they can visit her family afterwards to explain why she's putting in so many hours. Anna's other two co-workers tease her for her conservative family, and Kevin warns them that when they visit to not pick fights with Brian.

Anna walks through the door with Kevin, Tess, and Eric (with Kevin telling them to take off their shoes, DAS DA AZIN WAY!), and Gloria offers them a seat. Brian pulls Anna to the side and chastises her for missing the dinner, and Anna tries to defend herself from the WT policing (I feel so bad for this girl). Kevin apologizes to Anna's family and commends her work on the internship, and praises Tess and Eric for their work as well, saying they're the ""upcoming new talents"" in the medical field.

ARE YOU READY TO RUUUUUMBLLEEEEE!!!!!!???? And by rumble I mean awkwardly sit through a homophobic segment while your out of touch parents nod their head in approval? GREAT!

Gloria comments on how proud Tess and Eric's parents must be, and Tess says that her moms are very happy with her work. Gloria CRINGILY tries to appeal to her by saying that one of co-workers is gay, almost in a hushed tone. Tess is visibly agitated, asking if there's anything wrong with being gay. Kevin tries to calm Tess down, but she refuses. Brian tries to hide his prejudice by saying they live by ""bible standards"", and Eric remarks that they still believe that being gay is bad (well, he's not wrong). Brian continues to try and ""reason"" with them, that they and their family live by the righteous morality of the bible. That ""righteous morality"" including killing 42 children for calling a man bald, killing Job's 10 children, sacrificing tons of animals and even people, stoning women for divorce, killing the firstborn child of Bathsheba and David, and the afforementioned offering your daughters to be brutally raped. Eric states how the world has changed, and even Gloria says that they shouldn't be so hard on gay people. Brian says that we have a free will to go against God's standards or not, but if we don't we end up hurting ourselves (THEN ITS NOT FUCKING FREE WILL!). Eric confronts Anna and asks if she agrees with her father, and she stutters a few ""ums"" (I feel so bad for this girl) until Kevin finally changes the subject and leaves, with Anna offering to walk them out. Brian and Gloria argue about Anna's choice of association (please end me).

Brian works on Joe's accounting books and announces that Joe is out of debt. Joe is happy, but wants to talk to Brian about something else. Joe expresses his gratitude to Brian for helping him clean up his TERRIBLE life (I still don't see how his life was that bad?), but is concerned about Brian's own family and how they haven't exactly followed God's way. Brian gets defensive and waves away Joe's attempt at counseling, yelling at him about his wife forcing him to comply with her ideas. Joe keeps telling Brian how he helped him and now he wants to help him (*OVERLY SAPPY CELLO AND PIANO MUSIC INTENSIFIES*), and Brian storms out of Joe's home.

**Conclusion**

6lgzro,1,2017-07-05,Save for Student Loan or Contribute to 403b? Also retirement questions..,sashi_0536,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6lgzro/save_for_student_loan_or_contribute_to_403b_also/,"Hi.. so I'm at a dilemma. 

I'm currently in grad school so my loans are in deferment until May/June 2018. I've saved up $10k for my emergency fund.
My loans are about $9k total at about 3.4% and 3.86% interest.

There's no matching for my 403b and I've contributed to my IRA for 2017 already. 

So I'm thinking that instead of saving for my student loan, I should just contribute as much as I can to the 403b (not sure if pre/post since I make 63k at most as an intern and expect to make more in the future).

So in summary...

Should I contribute to my 403b or should I just save the money into my savings account and do some side bank bonus churning?
If 403b, should it be pre vs post?

EDIT: This would be for any future income I get later on. I'll have the internship until May/June also."

I was driven. I started a lot of projects. I took one of my dream internships, started classes this week, started taking steps to publish an e-book about my experiences with bipolar disorder, started writing a manuscript of poetry, and started recording songs for an EP.

I still intend to follow through with all of those things. But I'm starting to get restless and frustrated. I can't focus on school work. My work isn't due until Sunday, and I've done some of it already, but I could be doing much more yet it's so hard. I'm super interested in what I'm studying, the textbook isn't difficult to understand, and I still can't focus! I just want my mind to slow down. I want to be able to accomplish things. But I also want to be able to relax. Somehow I can't do that.

I want to go up to 10mg on abilify but it's really hard to schedule appointments with my doctor so I don't know when I'll be able to see him.

6lhge5,37,2017-07-05,My first step. A reflection on my relationship with weed,random_user7,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/6lhge5/my_first_step_a_reflection_on_my_relationship/,"Where do I begin… First I’ll say that I was brought here today by /u/subduction’s comment that landed in r/bestof. I’ve known of and visited this sub several times in the past but I guess it just wasn’t the right time in my life.  But today many of the things /u/subduction said resonated with me.

So I guess I’ll say a little about myself. I started smoking shortly after going to college. At first it was only a weekend night thing. Then it became a whole weekend thing. And it stayed that way for a long time, a couple years at least. Then I met heavy smokers and it slowly became an every night thing. Before I graduated it had become an everyday wake and bake thing. Not just for me, but for my girlfriend (now my wife) too. I’ve had to quit several times, for months up to a couple years- to get a good internship and during my first job, while studying for important licensing exams, etc. Every time I’ve gone cold turkey and while I had cravings, I was able to resist and stay clean as long as needed. And then after the issue had passed I would start smoking again. I justified all this by looking at my accomplishments- I have a STEM degree, graduated cum laude, home owner, great marriage, good relationship with my family, I go to the gym consistently, self employed, etc. By most metrics I’m a successful person. As long as I’ve been able to achieve my goals and succeed I’ve allowed myself to go hog wild with weed. That was my justification.

But over time I’ve noticed negative aspects of weed as well, mostly things that other people in this sub have already pointed out and explained more succinctly and elegantly than I ever could. Weed makes me happy doing nothing. I’m not social. I’m lazy. I get the munchies and overeat, so even with all that time in the gym I’m still overweight. But possibly the most destructive part for me is the mental effects. It makes me spiral into an anxious, self loathing, bitter person while at the same time allowing me to be incredibly empathetic and loving to my wife, appreciate the innate beauty in nature, recognize the incredible complexity in life, and allow me to think outside the box and have insights I’d never have had otherwise. I don’t understand how weed can have so many positive effects while simultaneously having so many negative ones. And that’s what makes weed so insidious for me. Despite recognizing all these issues I’m still able to rationalize my use. At this point I wonder if it’s not just a habbit. Or maybe something worse.

And now I find myself at a very important point in my life. My first child is due in just a few weeks and my business is getting very busy. I need to be clear headed and focused, for myself and also for my family. I know it’s time to give up weed. Maybe not forever, but definitely for a long long time, because I can’t control myself with weed- it’s either all or none. I knew this day was coming and have been excited for this stage of my life but I’m finding it very difficult to give up weed knowing this is it. I like weed too much. My roaring 20’s are over and it’s time to change my life.
I still have edibles in my fridge and my mind is already rushing with new rationalizations about enjoying the last bit before my child arrives. But what does it matter. It’s all just a blur of getting high. What do I have to gain from getting high for another couple weeks?

I don’t know what the point of this is, mostly just a way for me to reflect and get this off my chest. If anyone can relate or has anything to say, good, bad, or otherwise, I’d love to hear it. I’m going to include a letter I wrote to Mary Jane a year or so ago when I was trying to quit. It’s just a light hearted way for me to express my complicated relationship with this drug. 


Mary Jane,

I don’t know how to start. We’ve been through so much together and had so many wonderful times.

The three of us spent a lot of time together in college, you, my wife, and me. We had great times; looking up at the stars, hiking, watching movies, cooking… We were basically inseparable. People laugh, but you really did help me understand some of those challenging math concepts. I knew things would change eventually but hoped that we would stay close and make time for each other. We stopped seeing each other when it was time for me to get serious about my career. I had to find an internship and get experience to find a job and be successful. It might have been a little abrupt but I still feel that breaking it off cold turkey like that was the way to go.

Then, when we hooked back up a couple months ago, I was so excited to see you! It was like you had never left. We’ve been together every day since. And somehow, that’s the problem. I’m coming to realize that our relationship isn’t healthy, and I need to step back for a while and clear my head. It’s not you, it’s me. I think you’re great. I really do. You’re fun all the time, and look at how much you’ve helped my wife with her stomach problems. I appreciate that very much. But now I need to focus. Because I’m seeing that we’re spending too much time together and it’s distracting me from things I need to do. Things I want to do.

I know this isn’t goodbye forever. It doesn’t need to be. Once I get myself under control and feel like I’m doing well managing my responsibilities- well, then I hope we can see each other on the weekends.

6lhi1j,3,2017-07-05,[F4M; 18+] Scifi/Fantasy/Modern with Scifi Twist + Romance [Email/GD/Skype/Discord?],erikalalove,Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/6lhi1j/f4m_18_scififantasymodern_with_scifi_twist/,"I just had a really nice, detailed post that included everything I was looking for, but I lost it, so this is going to be a fast breakdown of what kind of roleplay/partner I'm looking for. If you want more details, I'm not going to write them here because I might just lose them again, so you can PM me. 

You can call me Erika. I'm 20. I've been roleplaying for about 7 years. I've done everything: Fandom/Scifi/Modern/Fantasy, One-Liners/Multiple Paragraphs, 1st/3rd person, Skype/Email/Forums/Google Docs/Text Messaging.

Here's a quick look at what I want:

**Genre:** I really enjoy scifi, fantasy, and modern with scifi twists. I also want to add romance between our characters (MxF), but I don't want the plot to take a backseat to the romance. Here's some quick examples of what I've done or what I'm thinking of:

Scifi -- Zombies (fast/slow/special); Dystopia/Wasteland with Mobs/Gangs killing one another and taking prisoners

Fantasy -- the classic sense (magic, archers, knights, royalty, dungeons, etc.)

Modern with Scifi Twist -- Special Agency trains people to be remorseless killing machines/assassins, but when one falls in love and tries to bail to save their future together, all of the assassins are sent after them and they go on the run; a college student finds out that they have superpowers/abilities and must control them (maybe while becoming a superhero/vigilante's 'intern'); a group of test subjects break from a testing facility and try to blend into the normal world while on the run from the facility's agents

These are just examples and ideas. If you have something you really want to do, please let me know.

**Posts:** 

Length -- I don't really want to do one-liners anymore. I'm a writer at heart. Please give me some paragraphs to work with. I would estimate that 2-5 paragraphs is good. Of course, quality is better than quantity. As long as effort is being matched, the plot is moving forward, and the quality is there, I am happy.

Literacy -- Please write full sentences and pay attention to punctuation, grammar, and paragraph breaks. I am not a perfect writer, and I don't expect any one else to be, but I do expect to be able to understand your writing.

Method -- I am open to anything, really. Email might be my first pick because it sends me a notification and allows for multi-paragraph replies. Skype sends a notification but is harder to use for multi-para (in my opinion). GD is fine, too, because multi-para, but no notification. I have never used Discord, but if it can support what we want to do and you can be patient with my inexperience, then I am willing to try.

**Partner:** *Please do not contact me if you are under 18 years old.* I enjoy writing adult themes, including romance and language, and I don't feel like getting in trouble this summer. I also would like to write with a man who plays a male character in order to create the MxF romance. 

Length might sacrifice frequency of replies. I am not working this summer, and I start school in late September, so my schedule is pretty open. Please don't be afraid to message me and remind me to reply. I'm estimating I could supply a few replies a day, depending on speed of the plot and length. Of course, I can't guarantee that.

That's all I can think of. Sorry if it's vague; I don't really feel like writing all of my post again because I'm sad that I lost it all. Please PM me if you're interested! Bring your ideas and plots if you have some. "

Brother[21/m]

Mom[52/f]

Dad[52/m]


Throwaway account because very personal, and he also uses reddit. Also please keep in mind that my brother's and my relationship is far from close or tight even now, possibly due to the age gap. He used to be really mean to me growing up and I can count the times we had a good time together on one hand. This means that some of the information could be pure (and possibly false) speculation, but I have made it clear which parts are speculation and which parts are facts. Also sorry if I seem a little ""rant-y"" in this, I mostly need advice but I needed to get this out of my system, which I can't do irl.



Some backstory:


Objectively, my entire family is pretty smart. My mom and dad both came from poor families, and were one of the few people from their towns who went to university, and even grad school. My brother inherited a lot of intelligence from them, and never really had to study too hard until around IB, while staying top of the class. This meant he had lots of time for gaming and his other hobbies. However, he had to work really hard for his last year in high school, but he made it in to one of the top 10 universities in the world. 


My parents congratulated him a lot on all of his achievements, and he was always doing better than his peers in almost everything. He's top of the class in terms of grades, he plays two instruments and had many friends. I THINK that this kind of lead to him being a little too proud.



He also seemed to have some anger issues stemming from before going to university. This was(I think) the summer before he started the IB two-year-course. Please keep in mind that I have never told anybody about this ever, so I don't know if this is normal behavior for siblings or if this is borderline abuse. We went to my grandma's place the summer before he goes to university for visiting.


During the middle of our trip, my brother was playing a game alone to pass some time. I wanted to play with him because I was bored as well, but he wouldn't let me because of some reason I can't remember now. Due to that, I got mad at him, so I stole the remote control of the air-con, ran out, and hid it in the kitchen. This was during the summer where the temperature was unbearably hot, and my brother absolutely HATES IT when he sweats. My brother ran in after me, and screamed at me to return the controller. I was used to my brother screaming at me and being the headstrong person that I am, I continued to taunt him, asking to play the game with him, but was slightly scared because...well...he's screaming at me. He grabbed a knife from the counters, and threatened to cut my hand off if I don't give it back. I don't know whether it was the look in his eye or the way he positioned himself, I just KNEW that he would do it if I don't give it back. He had been pinching and hitting(which both left marks) me for a long time, and it's not like he wasn't used to the gore with all the video games he played. After I gave it back to him, he went back into his room and stayed there all day. I cried the entire rest of the day and nobody knew why except it had something to do with my brother.


After that, we haven't talked for I think a year or two. I think the only word I had ever said to him in those two years was, ""Goodbye"" when my parents forced me to when he left for university.



We don't live where the university is, so he had to move there. This meant that all we knew about his college life were the phone calls, which got less and less frequent over the months. His grades kept on dropping, and when he came back home for the summer, he was forced into a gap year because of his poor grades. We found out that the reason why his grades were poor was because he was skipping lessons and homework just so he could have more time to play video games. None of us know the entire story of when he was at university, but my speculation was that since he was able to juggle studying and video games easily in high school because he never really had to try, he assumed the same for university and failed miserably. The failures stacked on top of each other, and in the end he just gave up and focused everything on gaming instead. 


My parents were so understanding of this, while I was completely LIVID! This was one of the best universities that the world had to offer, and he just blew his chance and focused on a hobby? Just his tuition fees is someone's yearly income! And he wasted it all so he could be gaming in some dorm away from my parent's nagging. I would kill for a chance at that university. I actually loved gaming myself, and had a slight addiction when I was younger, but knowing that my brother chose this instead of a life-changing experience with many wonderful and smart people you can have deep conversations with was just...UGH. 


This made me completely change my lifestyle and made me study when before I could easily get A's and A*'s without trying. I THINK he's jealous of me for this, because one of the reason he failed in university was because he was horrible at note taking, and seeing me learning this from a young age, which would in turn probably make me (probably) excellent by the time university rolls around. Every time we talk now I feel that there is that thick wall between us. He's (maybe) jealous of me learning from a young age from his mistakes, while I'm still resentful at him for all the times he bullied me or used me for something, and especially when he threatened to chop my hand off. We can have pleasant conversations now but that wall seems to be unbreakable. This wall between us and the constant fighting between him and our parents meant that he probably thought that none of us actually liked him, but just putting up with him because he's family.



After coming back, my parents had been nothing but supportive of him, but they can get annoying at times, like when they ask everyday for my brother to talk with them about his issues when he clearly does not want to talk about them. At first, they just let my brother stay in his room and play video games, hoping that gradually he'll see that there is no purpose to this kind of life and stop altogether. Time heals all wounds, right? Eventually, they realized that my brother is going to need some help getting through this, forcing him to talk to them about his issues. This would usually result in them interrupting one of his gaming sessions, my brother infuriated with that fact and being in a grumpy mood when talking with my parents, which escalates into full-blown fighting. These, I believe, leads us to our next problem...


The screaming. Whenever my brother gets too frustrated from a situation, normally from annoyance, these happen. We're not talking about those screams when you get scared or when you're screaming at someone. These were more...primal.. or bestial. I don't know how else to describe them. You can feel his frustration when you hear those screams. When authors describe screams as ""bloodcurdling"", they weren't kidding. You can kind of feel these in your blood, I have no idea what curdling is, but that feels like it describes this sensation perfectly. These screams are usually followed with the sound of something breaking. I remember reading somewhere before that someone who aren't sorry for their actions only break things belonging to other people, that isn't true here. He's broken everything there is to break. Glasses, plates, even his own computer once. My parents have threatened my brother that they will call the police if he breaks anything on several occasions, but have never actually went through with it.


As this goes on and on, he continues to become in worse shape, both figuratively and literally; He's overweight, diagnosed with depression, not going back to school, etc. My mom even hooked him up with some jobs and internship at our local university, which he stopped going to after a while. He's threatened to kill himself several times, one time actually going up to the rooftop and attempting it(this happened when I was asleep; I thought it was just like any other fight so I ignored it). Me, still being bitter at the times he bullied me, used this opportunity to get him back for all the times he made me look back. I thought this was normal, just another teenager rebellion stage that went on for too long, and thought that this was common occurrence, which definitely did not help this situation. 


Sometime during this period of time, a fight between my parents happened, with my parents forcing me and my brother to wake up, so all four of us are in my parent's bedroom. I could see that everybody was mad, my parents from their fight and my brother from being forced to stop his gaming. I expected this to be another speech about how my brother needs to get his act together, but somehow involving me into the conversation(I usually stay out of the fights). What actually happened was my parents somewhat calmly saying that they're getting a divorce(spoilers it was just my parents being rash). I didn't hear most of the things that anyone said during that, but the basic gist of the argument was that my parents differ too much in what they should do with my brother. My father was more militaristic in saying that my brother needs to either get his act together in [insert amount of time] or he has to go to an addiction recovery camp. My mother was more hippie(ish) in saying that we should give my brother however much time he needs, we can't just force him as he will feel pressured and stressed. Another point I managed to remember was my mom firmly insisting that when they ""divorce"", she'll be keeping me and that my father is left with my brother. This DEFINITELY did not help, because my brother was already screaming about how nobody loves him, while my parents tries to convince him otherwise. 



After a while, he actually started getting better(my speculation is that probably something good happened in-game). Willing to go to the gym with me, trying to keep his job, not staying up too late. My parents saw this as that time is doing its thing and healing my brother, and tried to help this process but not knowing how. This only lasted for a while, before the screams and breaking of furniture started again. This became a cycle of my brother wanting to improve himself, then falling into the void again, both of which probably due to something in-game. 


That brings us to now. My brother is currently on his recovering and wanting self-improvement stage, and I really want to take advantage of that fact to do something, but I don't know what. My parents are thinking of disabling the wifi in the house. They've already shortened the usage time to 7am-11pm, which helped my brother with his sleeping schedule, and they wanted to see if disabling the wifi will force my brother out of the addiction. I'm kind of skeptical of this idea because although this might work, I could think of so many more reasons why this wouldn't work. 



I know all I said about my brother on here was negative things, but deep inside he's really sweet and selfless, just anger issues and depression weighing him down. 


I don't know if this helps, but the game he is addicted to for all this time is FFIX or one of the final fantasy online games(the older one not the newer one). It being an MMORPG is one reason I understand why he feels so addicted to it, with the burden of showing up to his guildmates, and the endless grinding those types of games seem to feature.



Wow, sorry for the essay, I just wanted everything here and there was so much information to cover. 



tl;dr
My brother got messed up by university, ended up gaming in his dorm as a shut in for half the term which got him bad grades. Taking another consecutive gap year and possibly going on his third, he hasn't returned to university because struggling with depression and possibly anger issues. My brother is medically diagnosed with depression but he had also threatened to cut my hand off(with a 90% chance he would if I did not do what he wants) which led me to think that he also have anger management issues. He has attempted suicide, broken his laptop(twice), and my parents almost had a divorce over this issue. Parents currently thinking of disabling the wifi to force my brother out of the gaming addiction. I don't think it's a good idea atm but idk what to do either. Help!"

I contacted employment agencies and they always tell me that the company has taken someone else over me. I don't know what to do anymore; feeling discouraged; feel like giving up. The only thing that I had going was an unpaid internship but that ended 2 months ago. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I feel like it's going to be like this forever.

6lipq0,4,2017-07-05,Constant fear of losing my job.,MSAE,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/6lipq0/constant_fear_of_losing_my_job/,"Hi /r/anxiety!

I’ll preface this by saying I have a lot of general anxiety. I was briefly saw a therapist, but recently relocated for a job. 

I’ve just graduated and have been employed at a small private company. This is my first “real” job. The people here are unbelievably intelligent and hard working. Above all, they’re great to be around. But with this new job comes many anxieties. 

There’s an intern here who, admittedly, is incredibly intelligent. I feel like there is a good deal of favoritism towards her, though. She is on more projects than me, and when I asked for more work, the topic was essentially ignored. I’m not sure what her plans are post graduation, but I’ve heard (many times) that they fear losing her. 

I fear I’m not well-liked here, and that the powers-that-be don’t trust me enough to put me on other projects. The projects aren’t under-staffed, as far as I know, but I could be wrong. I also think some of the projects are too far underway to train me on the requisite material. I’ve been complimented on the (few) things I’ve finished here, but I want more. 

Every day, I fear for my position. Every closed-door meeting is, in my mind, about me. I just want to do an outstanding job. I want to be the best I can be. However, after starting here, my confidence in my abilities has hit an all time low. The constant fear honestly prevents me from enjoying anything these days. I feel as if I should be working all the time. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you all. "

I sublet from some college students and planned to stay for three months (duration of internship), but didn't get along with one of the roommates. I never signed a contract committing to the three months and decided to leave. I gave the person I sublet from a few days notice, but that seemed to be a mistake as that really angered the roommate that I had issues with. I stopped staying there but went back to pick up my things, where I was yelled at and physically threatened. She pushed me and hit me, I got away but may have left some of my things there.

I am wondering what steps I could or should take legally. I feel so unsafe, I moved here alone and am considering getting a license to carry a gun in order to defend myself better in the future. Other things I am curious about: could I get the roommate in trouble with her workplace (anger issues) or building management? Should I get a restraining order?

I am entering my junior year as a CS student with 310 completed. I am finishing off the 3XX courses this following semester and after my two internships these past two summers as a Software Engineer (Amazon) and Firmware Engineer (Intel) I am wanting to know what some opinions are on 4+1 and a Masters degree for CS in general.


I've heard a masters in CS for a Software Engineering / Developer position really only nets about a $1500 increase in salary. After talking to a bunch of people at my current internship, I conclude a Master's would better secure my future and open leadership opportunities. 


I am looking for insight into what to avoid for 4+1, and what to definitely get into. I definitely am not interested in academia, so stopping at a Masters for sure. I'm not quite sure what I'm branching into once I graduate. I've been told I'm a great systems coder (whatever that means, Intel) but honestly didn't enjoy the Intel internship day-to-day job tasks as much as Amazon.


*tldr; CS Master's worth it for leadership positions?*"

With so many classmates I question whether potential employers would ever consider the bottom of the barrel I feel I am.

6lkdt2,6,2017-07-06,My peers are doing a lot better and I just seem to fail.,dinkelstein,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6lkdt2/my_peers_are_doing_a_lot_better_and_i_just_seem/,"I'm still in university in Europe and since I think the system in the US is different, here ist a small outline of my master for you to understand: I'm studying in the life science field and the master takes two years, in which I have to perform two internships, each a little longer than half a year. Currently, I'm doing my first internship and it shuold be finished by now or in the very near future, but I honestly have no idea when I will be able to finish up my work, or actually get started again. For about 3 months now, I haven't really done any work. My supervisor knows about my depression and tells me that my mental health should be my number one priority, which makes it at least bearable to come here although I don't get anything done.

However, I don't think that I'm moving forward in any way, academically as well as socially. I've always saw myself as smart and capable of learning new skills. I don't want to come across as arrogant, and I certainly don't see myself as a future Nobel laureate or top scientist or whatever, but I always had the ambition to be better than average, and until the first year of my bachelor, I managed to do that. For for years though, I don't really know what I'm doing and how I can achieve that. So I kind of peaked in highschool, which is frustrating to me...

A couple of months ago, some weeks into my internship, I felt a depression kreeping up (I have had a depression two years ago), and I tried but failed to not let it develop. Now, I still don't know how to free myself from it. This sounds like I'm a victim or that I'm not trying enough and I'm aware of that, but I just have no idea how to get out of its grip, and seems so ridiculous. (I paraphrased Andrew Solomon here, so this seems familiar, you know why). Anyway, now that I don't think that I'm moving forward, I start to see how it should, when I look at my peers. My internship project was quite important to my supervisor, so understandably, he took in another student. I don't hold a grudge against him or the student for that. It is just frustrating to see how it seems so easy for the other student to do the work, when I'm struggling to just be there. To top it off, he will probably publish something that comes out of it. I'm not jealous at him, I just think that this could have been me. Another student in the group will also probably publish some outcome from her work. Friends of mine who work in different groups wil also publish something, one even got an internship and if it goes well, he might do his Phd there. The thing that seems delusional, is that part of me sees that and thinks: ""This is something I should work towards"". I have a feeling that this should me motivational and not numbing. 

However, when we have group meetings and someone presents his or her work, all I think about how it might be easier to just end it all, since I'll never achieve that. I still don't really plan to do that, but the thoughts are constantly in my head. The thought of a futureless future (as Stephen Fry put it), is not really frightening, but I don't know how and why I should or can be up for it. I don't seem to be the person I always thought I could be. Looking back, all those years where I did well, seem to be a lie, and the thruth comes out now.

Ok, that was more than I intended to write (as always I guess), but thanks for reading my rant or whatever this was."

The first few weeks were hard, we were both lonely and we were talking to each other a lot. We decide that I would go to the city that she is at for the final month of her internship.

We've been talking every day and it is great. It doesn't feel like a long distance relationship when we talk as much as we were. She was having lows, feeling really lonely, and she would seem really affectionate. She would be telling me that she loved me and missed me. In a sick way I was glad that she was as lonely as I was, I felt like I was validated for how I felt.

This past week her friend has come to stay with her and everything has changed. I would be hard pressed if she would text me back, which I don't need constant communication but some banter throughout the day is appreciated. She has called me a couple of times at night and only talks about her day with her friend, she doesn't even ask me what I've done today. She called me drunk one night and bragged that she told her friend her darkest secret and she refuses to tell me (I still have no idea what it is which is upsetting).

I am doing my best to not be clingy, I'm trying to give her and her friend some time to hang out without being some sort of overbearing asshole, but this whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. She acted like she needed me and loved me, now I just feel like I'm the third wheel in their relationship. I don't want to stay in this other city for a month with someone who doesn't feel the same way that I do.
 

I leave in a week from today, her friend leaves this upcoming Sunday. I'm worried that if I confront her about this she will take it the wrong way and think I'm a really controlling boyfriend. I just want her to know that I don't feel like she loves me, I am feeling like I am just a warm-blooded thing to keep her company.

6lm1da,17,2017-07-06,The Diary of A Scientologist Part 2,Toomajan,scientology,https://www.reddit.com/r/scientology/comments/6lm1da/the_diary_of_a_scientologist_part_2/,"OT VIII Is the highest spiritual level attainable in the church at this writing and is only delivered in one place called the Flag Land Base in Clearwater, Florida. In June 1986 when I was 26 years old, I moved to Clearwater, Florida where I lived and worked for 3 years. I want to cover the 3 years I was in Clearwater in as concise a manner as possible.

I got situated with a place to live and a job and went to Flag for the first time. My registrar was a guy named Christian that I bought training from before signing up for intern auditing. I was at Flag every day for months training, running errands for the staff and writing letters for them. While I was there I saw Sally Allerdice, the ethics officer from New York who now worked at Flag. I saw Anna Balash, but we didn't speak. I saw Kitti Georgius Kahn, who actually worked at Flag but had only been temporarily assigned to fill in as a Flag Service Consultant in New York when I first met her. Another person I saw at Flag is a guy named Bruce Dobin (OT VIII, Class VI auditor) I had never had any contact with, but has seen around the church in New York once or twice because his brother Bart Dobin, was supervisor of the Foundation Communications Course (the first course I did in Scientology).

I stumbled upon Kitti Georgius Kahn on Pierce Street in back of the church by herself one afternoon. She burst out laughing at me as I passed by and then she walked off. She was saying to people in public, out loud, so that I could overhear her saying to them about me ""That guy's a queer!"" ""I'm afraid of him!"" ""That's the guy, that's him, this one!"" ""He's on his way to a security check!"" ""He became homosexual!"" ""The case supervisor is very aware of him!"" and other things. A Scientology case supervisor is someone that reviews the auditing of a person getting audited and tells their auditor what to audit on them next. Kitti was joined in her harassment of me by a Class IX case supervisor named Mark Campbell that I saw walking around Flag a couple of times but had never had any kind of contact with. Some personal things I left in the registrar's office were stolen while I ran an errand for one of the staff. Another staff member told me to check the church's lost and found at the security office in the Fort Harrison garage. The security officer there said he didn't have them. Kitti Georgius Kahn later began reciting out loud in public so that I could overhear personal notes I had only written in a notebook I had that was one of the items stolen. Also stolen and never returned were very personal letters from my mother and father at home in New Jersey that can never be replaced.

I lived only a few minutes' walking distance from Flag for 3 years. It is surprising I was not written, visited or phoned once by anyone at the church the whole time I was there. Yet, when the closest church to me in New Jersey was 17 miles away, the church staff went out of their way to get in touch with me at all costs at all times for all the wrong things. The only time I ever spoke to the Scientologists was when I was somewhere at Flag doing something. Other than this, it was like as if they didn't know me, outside the front doors of the building.

After a few months at Flag, I lost interest. I asked them for a refund of my donations formally in an official church refund routing form. They would not give it to me because I had waited over 30 days to ask for it. One afternoon I calmly walked out the front door, quit communicating them and never went back.

After I stopped going to Flag, suddenly, I am told that I am no longer welcome in Boston Ronnie's (a Scientologist's diner in Clearwater on Cleveland Street) that I went to for breakfast sometimes where 2 of my neighbors (Christine and Thomas) worked that were not Scientologists. I was even walking past there about a week after they told me to get out, and the owner approached me on the sidewalk and pushed his finger into my chest and said ""Hey! You don't like us Scientologists do you?""

Moving forward, an angry motorist, got out of his car and chased a church public guy down the street and punched him in the head and face in the front doors of the Fort Harrison right in front of me and then got back in his car and drove off.

I was sitting across the street from Flag one night and a Scientologist came out of the Fort Harrison and exposed himself and then rushed back into the church all excited.

I was crossing the street and a Scientologist (a guy) walked into me in a very violent manner deliberately. When I say he walked into me in a very violent manner, I want to qualify that. I mean in a very violent manner. I stopped, turned around and asked him if it was necessary that he did that. He said: ""What did you do that made me do that to you?""

I was at the Park Diner that used to be on South Fort Harrison Ave. in Clearwater and saw a neighbor of mine named Christine inside and we sat down and had lunch together. She was telling me that she no longer works at Boston Ronnie's Diner on Cleveland Street because the people there were fanatics about trying to get her to join the church. Suddenly, a man in a Sea Org uniform walked up to our table, interrupted us and asked: ""Did one of you just say something bad about Scientology?"" He said he overheard us. He was seated with other Sea Org members a few booths behind us. He would not leave us alone until I told him to go back to his table and mind his business.

A student from Flag came into a Scientologist's health food store where I was shopping and screamed at the girl behind the counter ""You are going to pay for and get onto your next church service NOW!"" on the top of his lungs. And when I say on the top of his lungs I mean on the top of his lungs from 2 to 3 feet away from the girl's face. I thought he might hurt her. The girl was visibly embarrassed and upset. The owner of the store came out and asked him to go.

I was walking home one night on Drew Street and a car sped past me towards the church's Sandcastle hotel at about 70 miles per hour and hit a Scientologist named Bill Bragg who was driving in his car. He had tried to beat the speeder to the intersection by racing across it in the speeder's path before he got there. The condition of the 2 cars afterwards was unreal and I told the police I saw the whole thing. As a matter of fact I am the one who called the police from the pay phone at the cleaners. I had to go as a witness to the court for the police. The speeder showed up, but the Scientologist Bill Bragg did not show up. The police are the ones who filed the complaints and had the summons' issued against both of them. The drivers did not file complaints.

These would seem like insignificant observations to people in the church where these criminal types are considered top Flag trained Scientologists, with these being just a portion of my observations. But, had these things been done in front of police officers or not, not just the guy that got out of his car to assault the Scientologist, but the Scientologists as well most likely would have received a summons and/or been arrested for their conduct.

I went home to New Jersey in 1989. My parents were getting older and I felt they needed me. I started at this point letting people know that I do not think the Church of Scientology is worth supporting. I contacted the churches I donated money to in the past one by one, and used up my remaining balances on account and asked to be removed from their contact lists. When I called the New York Foundation church to inquire about my account balance, Raymond Baiardi got on the phone and said ""Hi crazy!"" and hung up. I called back and he said ""Look, if this is about your declare or something why don't you just fuck off!"" and hung up. I phoned Flag to inquire about my account and Kitti Georgius Kahn responded to my call and shouted into the phone that she doesn't work there anymore and hung up.

In 1993 my mother and I went to a Halloween parade in our town and then out to eat afterwards at a place near where we lived. At the place we went to eat a New York Foundation staff member named Jennifer McDonald Cox came in and stood at the cash register. She came over to our table. I was surprised she even knew my name. I had not seen her since 1978 when she was the nanny in the church nursery. I only saw her 3 or 4 times including at a staff meeting and never made friends. She said she was still a Scientologist, and was training at the church in New York with her kids and her husband. She said she had not seen me in a while and was wondering what was going on with me. And then said she had opened an art store on the highway not too far from there and she invited us to go see it and told us what the store had for sale. After she left, I explained to my mother how I knew her. My mother and I went to look for her store about a week later and found it. It was in a location you might not normally look for or expect to find a business. All New York Scientologists worked there. Larry Broncato from the former Rower mission. Susan Cox Mongiovi who was a student at the church in New York and was Jennifer's sister in-law. Angelo Mongiovi (Susan's husband) would show up there. Larry Cox (Jennifer's husband) worked there. There was a lot of Scientology traffic in and out of that location and it was listed under different names:

1. The Profit Center
2. The Art and Picture Warehouse
3. The Discount Picture Warehouse
4. Discount Frame Store

I knew no one that knew including myself, that Scientologists worked in our town for years. I just took for granted that their whole business was operating under the table without even inquiring. I bumped into another guy in the center of town that used to be on course at the church in New York. He lived right around the corner from the art store. He was using drugs, had become an alcoholic, was a heavy smoker, and told me he was thinking of killing himself. He said Anna Balash was the last person he spoke to at the church in New York. She was his ethics officer. He said he did not know the people at the art store were Scientologists until I told him, but that he had gone there and bought a picture from them once.

I bought a picture of the New York skyline from Jennifer and when the clip on the back of the frame broke off I went to see her about getting it fixed. At the same time, I thought since she even surprised my mother with how well she remembered me after so many years, maybe she might know why I cannot get any information from the church in New York about the money left on my account. She was friendly up until I asked her this. Then she got nasty. She said she did not want to talk about it, and that if I did she was going to ask me to leave and not come back. I left. Jennifer eventually became a director at the Office of Special Affairs in New York (the group that replaced the Guardian Office). She must have contacted someone at the church in New York about me, because in March of 1994 Raymond Baiardi called me. He asked me to come to the church and see him about my account on a Sunday March 13 which is L. Ron Hubbard's birthday.

I met him in his office around 3:30 p.m. on the second floor of the church. I asked about my account but now he said he did not ""remember this cycle of action"" any more because his ""recall is not that good"". Then two guys came in the room. The first guy said ""I think it is time for you to leave"". I said ""I am in the middle of discussing something with Raymond, and I will leave as soon as we are through"". He yelled ""No, you are going to leave NOW!""

I started to walk to the door to leave and the guy was blocking it. He threw a manila folder he was holding in his hand to the floor and grabbed my jacket collar and leaped on me. I fell backwards into and smashed my head on a desk behind me. I landed on the floor and he placed his knee on my throat making breathing or speaking almost impossible and pinned my arms to the floor. The second guy sat on my legs to keep me held down. I saw church staff like Debbie Indurski, peeking in the doorway at me smiling while I was on the floor. The church called the police and reported that a maniac had forced his way into the church and assaulted someone and was being detained by the church staff until help arrived. Raymond Baiardi patrolled the window in his office for a few minutes and then told the guys to let me up. I got up and walked out of the building and the police were outside and asked to speak to me. After we spoke they went inside the church as I waited for them by their patrol car. Raymond Baiardi was nowhere to be seen but 7 or 8 staff members surrounded the police talking to them all at once. The police came out and told me to go to a local emergency room to make sure I was OK and then file a complaint. After leaving the emergency room, I went to the Midtown North police precinct on West 54th Street in Manhattan, and spoke to 4 detectives for almost 2 hours before filing a criminal complaint against the church naming Raymond Baiardi as chief conspirator. I was contacted by the NYPD a few days later to go with them to the church and arrest Raymond Baiardi and/or the other 2 attackers if they were present. The detective told me I could meet him on a Sunday if that was more convenient due to the fact that I live in New Jersey. I told the detective I would rather not because of all the travel involved but that I would leave the complaint open for 1 year in case anything changed. No one from the church ever filed a complaint on anyone anywhere stating that he or she was assaulted that day, as should be required of anyone that makes a call to 911 of the kind the church made that afternoon. They just thought it was joke to bring the cops there.

The money I donated to the church will never be found. Raymond Baiardi used it for his own personal expenses instead of the auditing he lied to me that I was supposed to be paying him for at the church. He still works there at this writing with his wife Maureen Baiardi (who is a treasurer and case supervisor). The 2 of them together case supervise people out of their life savings that sign up for auditing at the church.

In 2000, my sister Lorraine came home from school one day and said a Scientology mission had opened 1 block away from her school on Morris Avenue, in Elizabeth, NJ. Right around then, I saw a Scientology book called ""Clear Body Clear Mind"" advertised on TV. It was $17.10 at Barnes and Nobles in Springfield, NJ. I went to the mission to see if I could get the book there instead of having to go all the way to Springfield. Bruce Dobin (OT VIII, Class VI auditor), was the mission holder. He was also a former New York Foundation staff member I had seen around the church a few times and once at Flag but never had any contact with.

In 1983 I was having lunch in a diner in Elizabeth, NJ and a guy came in and sat in the seat next to me. I didn't know I had ever seen this person before anywhere. He physically nudged me with his arm and said to me ""Hey buddy!"" ""Ever consider going clear?"" ""Ever consider joining the Sea Org?"" ""Did you ever get a letter from the international ethics and justice chief?"" ""Do you know who L. Ron Hubbard's original student was?"" Those were his exact words. I said ""Please, could we not talk about Scientology""? He got up, shook his head at me and left the diner. This diner is located exactly 1 block up the street from where Bruce Dobin eventually opened a mission 17 years later. At first, I didn't think anything of it, but then something in my head clicked. I realized that if Bruce Dobin was 20 years younger, and about 70 lbs. lighter, he would look just like the guy that came into the diner that day. It was him in fact. He knew in 1983 that I would not recognize him as someone I had already seen at the church. And he knew in 2000 that I would not recognize him as a diner patron that sat next to me up the street in 1983.

He introduced himself to me as if he had never seen me before in his life. I asked to buy this book and he said he didn't have a copy on hand, but he would order one for me for $35.00 and ship it to me when it came in. I said OK and he gave me a receipt and said he would let me know as soon as it came in and I left. When I got home he was on the phone with my mother asking her all kinds of questions ""Whose phone number is this?"" ""How old is your son Lawrence?"" ""What is your son's real address?"" ""Who else lives there?"" She said after she finished talking to him that he said he needed this information in order to ship me the book I had just ordered.

Bruce called me 2 days later to say my book had not come in yet, and he would ship it to me when it came in. He invited me to an open house party that he and his wife Sharyn Mason Dobin were having at the mission the following Monday. I accepted and went. There was an OT VIII guest speaker that spoke, then Bruce spoke, there was a Q&amp;A period followed by refreshments and then requests for the guests to buy something. But, no one bought anything because all the people at the event were Scientologists except for 1 person whom it was easy to tell by his responses that he was not a trained Scientologist. Before I left, Bruce said he was going to Flag the coming Friday for two weeks and he will talk to me about my book when he gets back in case I didn't receive it yet. I called him about two weeks after that (3 weeks after I had ordered the book) and he said the book had not come in yet.

1 Week later Bruce called at about 10:30 p.m. I was on my front porch talking to my sister Lorraine. He called to say my book had not come in yet and that I was no longer welcome at the mission or to call there or engage in any way any of the staff there about my book or anything else because if I did the police would be called. He said data about me he got from the church is the reason why but that he had been wanting to tell me this himself anyway for a while. I called the next week to ask where my book was. I left a message on the answering machine as no one ever answered the phone when I called or even returned my messages. I called Bridge Publications in Los Angeles (the organization that prints all of the church's books) and complained it was taking over 5 weeks to get a copy of 1 book out of the mission of Elizabeth, NJ. I offered to send them a copy of the book purchase receipt as proof and was told it was not necessary. They apologized to me and sent me a copy of the book I ordered that arrived 3 days later from Los Angeles.

The next week Bruce sent me a package with a letter attached to it. The package was the book I had ordered from him. The letter stated I was ""no longer welcome at the mission"" and I was ""bad news"" and was ""never to call again or show up at the mission for any reason"". All of this is being said a second time, as he had already told me this in an earlier telephone conversation we had. He wrote the not being welcome part twice in the letter. The second time it was written in big all capital letters underlined in the center of the page. He further wrote, that when my ""free book arrives from Bridge"" I am to ""return it"" to him at my own expense at the address of the mission because I am not ""entitled to it"" and because of the inconvenience I caused him.

I donated both copies to the Linden, NJ Public Library and they threw them in the garbage as they no longer accept book donations. I was told this by the librarian when I mentioned to her that I did not see the books I had donated on the shelf.

In 2002, I began sharing my experiences in Scientology for the first time with other people on the internet and was able to communicate with a very wide audience. I eventually published my own web site about the church's activities with me and also shared the same exact information on the web site with select law enforcement officials. I sent a copy of the same information I sent to the FBI to the church out of fairness to them in case there was anybody there that really was able to help resolve any of the problems.

On Sunday February 9, 2003 I was home in my pajamas and the doorbell rang. I looked through the door peek hole to see Bruce Dobin and a Scientologist named Dominic Sarlo standing on the porch. I went to the kitchen and called the police. Both of them started pounding on the door and kicking it. I called the police a second time and held the phone up in the air so the officer on the other end could hear the commotion. The Scientologists were banging on windows, tapping on the windows with keys, going in the mailboxes, ringing mine and my neighbor's doorbells, yelling for me to come out, shouting my name, for a full 10 minutes. The police were late in coming because of a traffic accident on the highway.

When the police came I told the officer that Bruce was a Scientologist and has been following me in his car since 1983 and that I did not even know who the other guy was that was with him. The officer wrote a report on both of them and then asked them to leave and not come back. I decided to file a complaint and took Bruce to court in April 2003. He showed up with Dominic Sarlo and some guy in a pin striped suit. After the letter that he sent me and the phone call that he made to me, what was he doing at my house? He could not answer other than to say that he had received data from a continental Scientology organization that said Lawrence had placed a large amount of information about his church on the internet. I made him to sign an agreement, that if he ever bothers me again this matter will go forward as a criminal prosecution. He agreed, signed it and I never saw him again. That court order is still in force and active unless I ask for it to be dismissed which I have no intention of doing.

The Elizabeth, NJ mission closed in 2005, even after moving to a new location next to an International House of Pancakes that was owned by Scientologists. I remember seeing the Church of Scientology's finance police (Men in Black) in front of the mission one afternoon when I went past on my bike. One of them said something to me as I passed that I of course ignored. I heard a story later that they literally smashed Bruce's head into metal filing cabinets before taking his mission holder license away and then billing him for the fact that they had to show up to do that. My understanding is that the finance police charge $10,000.00 per day during their visits. Bruce Dobin also paid for all of the mission's expenses out of his own pocket right down to its utility bills the whole time it was open. After the mission closed the Scientologists that owned the International House of Pancakes sold it. While the mission was open, it and the International House of Pancakes owner's managed to adopt a small piece of land in Elizabeth, NJ and name it L. Ron Hubbard Park. It is about the size of a 10-car parking lot covered with grass in front of a low-income apartment complex with no fence or trees. Written in very small writing on a 12-foot-tall clock that belongs to the city are the words in honor of L. Ron Hubbard.

Is there any greater gift that one can offer another than their own immortality like the kind the church says it has to offer? The Church of Scientology tried to get rid of me permanently for inquiring about their services.

I am not a high ranking former member of the church, or a millionaire with attorneys knocking down my door to represent me and hear my story.

I wanted to give my parents something to be proud of and I thought Scientology was the way. If the Church of Scientology was a real church that delivers what it promises, that would have happened. But, as I hope you can see, it did not.

6lmdks,2,2017-07-06,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6lmdks/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Marino Bar Review was founded by Professor Joesph Marino, named “the go-to-guy for those in need of bar review” by The New York Law Journal after helping JFK, Jr., the most famous retaker, to pass the bar, after failing twice with two other bar courses.
Professor Marino was a former full time professor at New York Law School, credited for raising their bar passage rate from 57% to 94% and a former lecturer for Barbri. At Marino, we have earned a reputation for helping unsuccessful bar candidates to pass, most notably with our Retaker Course, the only program designed specifically for those students retaking the bar exam. Generations of attorneys nationwide have attributed their bar exam success to Marino and send their children and grandchildren – as well as their legal interns and law clerks – to Marino for bar exam preparation.

My boyfriend and I just graduated from college in Philly. 

Me: I graduated in December and have been working full time for a start up firm, mostly telecommuting. I make 40k/yr before taxes and have PA-based health insurance.

Boyfriend (of 5 years): Graduated in May and through a family friend has a connection with a small editing and videography company in LA. He jumped at the opportunity for an unpaid internship with this editing guy who also does event videography and some other film industry work. This guy wants to get my boyfriend trained ASAP so he can pay him to take on certain responsibilities and start making some money. This is a great foot in the door and may lead to more work in the future in the film industry...but obviously there's no guarantee. 

So my question for you guys is, does it make sense for us to move to LA? My salary is alright for Philly as I live pretty frugally, but it's basically minimum wage in California. I will definitely look for a new job over there, but I will still be able to work from home and be getting a paycheck until I find something better. 
We just signed a lease (before this LA opportunity even came up) for a 2 bedroom for 1000 in Philadelphia, which I am totally fine with finding someone to sublet I don't think it will be a problem. Our current lease ends at the end of the month, so I'd really prefer to not move all our shit twice and make the decision upfront to move to LA straight from the current apartment.

We live pretty frugally and are fine living in not the best neighborhoods and a crappy apartment...but we already do that in Philly and everyone says California is insanely expensive. 

Also if you have any suggestions for cheap neighborhoods or any factors I haven't considered, I would really appreciate it. 

**tldr: I make 40k working from home, boyfriend has a foot in the door but not guruantee of getting a full time job. Can we afford to move to LA from Philly?**

Internship Company expressed interest in hiring full time although I've accepted a separate, non-DS job offer before knowing this. How do I handle a situation like this?",omsa_hmm,DataScienceJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DataScienceJobs/comments/6lnajk/recently_graduated_and_currently_doing_a_data/,"


I recently graduated with a degree in MIS (cross between IT/Business) and am an intern at a mid-sized company (500 employees) doing data science work- natural language processing and machine learning. Previously I had accepted a job offer from a massive company (250,000 employees) for an entry level job that deals with ERP software and pays well for entry level. Let's call them company Big Corp, and due to their massive size I don't feel too bad like I'm hanging them out to dry by backing out of the job with late notice.

My internship is doing data science work and my manager has a lot of experience in this field and although the team is small it is a good opportunity for experience . The company also claims to have good benefits (they used to be state run and so have some nice benefit packages carried over when they went private). I'm also enrolled in an online grad school analytics program (Georgia Tech Online Masters in Analytics) and Internship Company will reimburse some education while Big Corp does not.

My manager and his boss recently sat me down and expressed interest in hiring me full time upon completion of the internship. I said I would be interested and in the next few weeks HR will sit down with me to figure out more details.

Here's the info from current job offer from **Big Corp**:

**Salary:** $60,000

**Bonus:** $5,000 signing; $5,000 retention bonus every 12 months for the first two years.

**Benefits/Other:** 10 days vacation, decent health care, 401k matching up to 3% and discount company stock after 6 months employment, no education stipend

**Internship Company**

**Salary:** ?

**Benefits/Other:** Supposedly very good benefits. Gym reimbursement, public transit reimbursement, Education reimbursement/stipend.

**What I would ideally like:**

**Salary:** Would like to at least match the compensation of Big Corp ($60,000 + $15,000 in bonuses in the next two years)

**Benefits/Other:** Would like some time off before I start as I immediately jumped into the internship after graduating and also need to fully move from my hometown and find a permanent residence. It would be nice to have a title like ""junior data scientist"" since having experience as a ""data scientist"" could be helpful down the line in getting a new job or raise. Is that something worth negotiating or giving up salary for?


**TL;DR:**

I want to keep working with my internship company but have an offer from another company. How can I navigate this to stay at my internship company but not give up salary?

Sorry for the wall of text, but this will affect my life and future quiet a bit. Thanks everybody."

I've seen all the episodes and rewatched it atleast 3 times. But it seems sometimes like we're going in circles.

Personally for me it starts to fall off with the plane crash, and the death of Mark and  Lexie.

After that it just felt  certain storylines seem somewhat repetitive.


The whole Derek arguing with Meredith over their careers.

Owen getting with women who don't want children.

Jackson and April relationship quarrels spanning different seasons.

Alex once again in a crazy relationship.

Alex who imo has shown the most growth of the series (from intern to attending) still has a short fuse and beats the crap out of Deluca without talking? Ok.

Richard Webber marriage/relationship issues.

There must always be one lesbian couple on the show. Honestly Arizona and Minnick felt so forced.

These are just some things off the top of my head

I'm not bashing greys. I just wanted other people's opinion on this. If the show is still fresh to you please explain why :) If it's not it is understandable the show has been on for years. I will still continue watching cause I've invested so much time in it, and I want to know how it all ends.

6lnfgh,7,2017-07-06,Time to act like a grown man and quit for good this time,LongDongLikeKingKong,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/6lnfgh/time_to_act_like_a_grown_man_and_quit_for_good/,"Hey there, Stop Gaming. I'm a 19 year old engineering student and like many of you I grew up playing video games. I've tried to convince myself to give it up to no avail, but tonight's the night. I'm fed up, I am done.

When I was a little kid I had perhaps two achievements that I was proud of, one of them being reading my first book by myself using a Windows 98 Green Eggs and Ham CD rom, and the other being speedrunning the last level of Halo and finishing with 30 seconds more time to spare than my dad. I hardly read at all anymore. See, as a child I had a much more balanced lifestyle. I'd go to school, read every night, play soccer, have parties with my friends and yes at those parties we would often play four player split screen games, but at least we were in each other's company. However, instead of video games we would often choose to run around the block playing tip. I should have cherished that in the moment as of course those days had to come to an end.

When it came time to go to high school I opted for the top school in the area, whereas my friends either went to local or private high schools. In short we were dispersed, so I had to find a new circle of friends to spend the school day with. Fortunately for me I did find such a group, but they were different from my old friends, different in the sense that we didn't go around to each other's houses or join the same weekend sports team, or do any kind of out of school activity for that matter besides the occasional movie. In fact it is only now that I realise that the only thing we had in common was a sense of humour and even that seems to have faded over the years. So naturally I wanted to keep in touch with my old friends as much as I could have and with the advent of online gaming and voice chat I was able to do so without hassle. However, this was at a time when video games were transitioning from fun little arcade shooters to games where it's all about where you rank on a scoreboard and which achievement you have unlocked. As a young high school boy of 12 that achievement was the tactical nuke in Modern Warfare 2 and its allure had drawn me in. I'd log into Xbox live at any chance I got and go for that 25 kill streak. I was the kid camping in the corner with a thermal scope on any given round of Domination. Playing the game was no longer fun for me, it was frustrating, it was unfair; essentially it was work. Oh, but when I got that first nuke the thrill was like no other experience I'd had in a video game. The world of online gaming had well and truly got its grubby mitts on me and I was in danger of being smothered. 

As high school dragged on I began seeing fewer of my old friends. While I was still playing soccer twice a week, reading every night and leading a relatively balanced lifestyle, I would choose to play video games rather than develop any hobbies or attempt to expand my social circles. At the time I didn't see any problem with this. The way I saw it there were two types of people, those that went out in their spare time and those that stayed in. It was my time I was wasting anyway, I might as well waste it on something that pleases me. It never occurred to me that I need not waste it at all. 

At the end of year 8 I built my first computer, and looking back on it now this was a defining moment in my life. I was so pleased with myself that I informed my English teacher that I couldn't finish my homework as I was up all night assembling my shiny new computer. This was also the year that Skyrim came out, and of course that's what I asked for for Christmas. It was the greatest game I ever played, I was enthralled. I spent two weeks straight playing that game, racking up 112 hours in the process. That's 8 hours a day, and while unfortunately that may seem normal to some of you and even to myself now, but before this time the longest session I had ever had was probably 2 hours. I was utterly entranced by the game. It was the middle of summer in Australia and my computer was essentially a heat pump. I'd be on the edge of my seat, feel the sweat build up on my forehead and then burst out of my room into the surprisingly cold air of the living room to get some water to take back to my sauna of a room. Everyday without fail I'd be called for dinner and come out with a raging headache, yet I'd do it all again the next day. 

When school started up again I'd return to only gaming on the weekends, but in every holiday period we had I'd do nothing but play video games. I only had one of my old friends that I would game with at this point, and he was the only one that I actually kept in touch with at all. I'd come online and wait for him, and after he'd leave I would stay on and play for at least another hour. I always needed to go for a higher kill streak, clear a dungeon, get a higher rank or simply come first in a lobby. This went on for a few years and got worse when I got my first iPhone as I stopped reading at night, instead choosing to scroll pointlessly through Facebook. 

I want to stress this again now. Gaming was not the only thing I did. I went to school, played sport, and socialized with my school friends and my old friends where I could. It was during my spare time, all my spare time, that I played video games rather than better myself. I had come to a point where I would start playing a video game to amuse myself, but after an hour or two I wouldn't feel like stopping to do anything productive as I'd be too distracted or I'd have a headache, so I'd continue playing despite getting no enjoyment out of the game. 

When I finally finished school I was faced with a four month break before university started and this was the first time that I experienced unbalance in my life. I had no organisation in my life, which would have been fine if I had my license. With both my parents working I was essentially trapped at home, which was fine at first as after finishing my exams all I wanted to do was power up my computer and play some games. I was craving any game I had on my hard drive. GTA V had also just been ported to PC, and when my school friends bought it we finally had something to play together. The monotony of sitting in my room was broken briefly by a family holiday, and then it was back in front of my monitor for the next month and a half. I gained weight over this period, going from skinny-fit to average/dad-bod, which is how I still am now. After being so skinny for so long I can constantly feel the fat pushing against my belt where it didn't before or my stomach rest on the bed when I sleep sideways. I thought I would do something about this last year, but at the end of my first year at university I again did nothing but game for four months. However, this time for the most part my friends did not join me and I didn't have as much respite. Halfway into the break I was weary, but with nothing to do and the ease at which one can waste their time on the computer that's just what I did. By the end I was bored out of my mind. I vowed then to get my act together and get an internship next summer holidays, and also to never waste my time like that again. It is now the mid year break and I have spent a handful of days gaming either side of a vacation. I was fine with spending a few days playing video games in the half week between my exams and my vacation, but when I got home I was going to finally play some guitar and start reading for leisure again, not spend day after day wasting away online. 

Tonight I was scrolling through instagram before I was going to go to bed and when I refreshed I saw a photo of a girl from my school who's on holiday in Europe. It was a very revealing shot, but when I saw it I felt an immense sense of sadness because she is absolutely stunning and in great shape, whilst I had just yet again spent the day on my computer. I used to be fit and proud of how I looked and who I was. Everyone I know is growing up and moving on from their childhood life, whereas for me not much has changed, and what has has become worse. The thing that really hit me hard about this photograph was the fact that we were actually pretty good friends for much of high school and apparently we both used to have a thing for each other, just not at the same time. A woman like her wouldn't love the me of today, not because of my body but because I'm honestly such a bore. Gaming doesn't give you anything, all it does is waste your opportunities to better yourself, to hone a skill or even just to have some kind of experience that you could use as as talking point. This is why I stop now, and this is why for me it is permanently. "

6lntau,0,2017-07-06,I [22/F] think my SO [36/M] cheated on me again,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6lntau/i_22f_think_my_so_36m_cheated_on_me_again/,"Throwaway account. This will be long so please bear with me. 

**BACKGROUND:**

We started dating/ seeing each other on December 2013 and became official couple on January 2014, making the relationship 3 and 1/2 years. 

We met when I was a college junior. He owns a medium-sized printing company, specializing in forms with security features. He mainly contracts with government agencies and local government units. Due to the nature of his business, he has to travel (go out of town) from time to time. He also has a relatively large manpower composed of sales men, technicians, etc. 

We are sexually active. He's my first boyfriend and I have given my virginity to him. We don't live together. 

The first time he cheated on me was February 2014. (Yeah, two months in the relationship. And yeah, I stayed.) The 2nd time was June 2014. But I only found out about his dishonesty last January 2015 (more on this later). 

**FEBRUARY 2014:**

As I mentioned earlier, it's not unusual for him to go from city to city. His trips usually range from day-trip to full blown 7 days. And since I was still studying that time (completed my college degree just last 2016, 5-year course), more often that not, I couldn't accompany him to these so-called business trips. 

On one particular trip (not sure how long), he took one of his ""female friends"" without telling me, let's call her Friend A. I always felt uncomfortable with his ""friendship"" with this particular girl. Plainly because he would often tell me how attractive he finds her to be and would often wire money to her, saying that FriendA was short of funds etc etc. All the times he sent money to her, I would not utter a word because I know I have no right over how he chose to spend his money. Also, he would often exchange texts with her, longer than how he did with me. I never got a chance to see those messages, so I'm not sure what's their nature. But, I did try to tell him how I felt, although in a subtle way. Like asking, ""Again?"" every single time, when we're together, he'll tell me he has to make a side trip to a money remittance because he has to wire money to her. (If we're not together, he would not tell me that he has to send money to her. I'll only find out about it if he chose to tell me later on. As such, I'm not really sure how many times he sent money to her) 

With that context, I hope you do understand why I felt so bad when I found out they went together in one particular trip. When I confronted him about it, he denied that they went on a trip. When I showed him their facebook message, he admitted it but said that this girl only went with him because she has to visit her cousin. And that upon arrival at the city, they parted ways. When I asked why did he not tell me, he didn't answer directly but opted to shift the blame on me for snooping around his account. 

**JUNE 2014**

I was doing my internship from May to June. It's a typical 8-5 job. My internship was 2 hours away from his office/ house. With an exception of few days, he will visit me during lunch time and bring food. We'll park somewhere less populated and share the food. I really appreciated that. Sometimes, because he was feeling horny, he'll ask me for oral. I never refused his advances simply because I feel bad that he has to drive 2hrs going to me and another 2hrs back. 

During the last week of June, I found out that he posted an ad in Craigslist Personal (never knew about this site until this), looking for a college virgin student who is willing to do sexual favors in exchange of financial perks. He posted this ad twice. I would never know if someone did answer to these ads and if there was, what they did after. 

You can't imagine how disgusted and dejected I felt when I read those posts. 

**HOW I FOUND OUT/ JANUARY 2015**

He's not too tech savvy so when he forgot his password for his secondary email and for his Facebook account, he never tried to retrieve it. So when I got nothing else to do, I tried to mess around with his account and found out that he used his main email as his recovery contact for the secondary email. 

I wanted to surprise him. I never thought of looking at his accounts to find dirt. 

So yeah, when I recovered both Facebook and the mail, I got the surprise of my life. His facebook messenger were littered with a lot of PMs to unknown girls around my age, including his frequent chats with Friend A. I saw the craigslist post in his email. 

The confrontation was ugly. Complete with the ugly crying and breaking-down voice. He never owned up to it. He denied everything. He said that although he posted those ads, messaged those girls, and went on a trip with Friend A, he never cheated on me because he didn't have sex with them. He thinks emotional cheating is BS. 

Yeah, well, I forgave and stayed. To be fair to him, he said he severed contact with FriendA. 

**PRESENT/ JULY 4, 2017**

We were visiting a city for 4 days because he had to fix some issues with his client. I've got nothing to do so I tagged along. Honestly, for the past year (2016) we've been great. Although we had some arguments especially during my preparation for national licensure exam and law school admissions, we haven't had any issues as serious as his cheating, until now I think. 

Anyway, he was consulting me about a document his client sent which I was reading in his phone. Then he received a message from a certain ""Sam"" saying ""Hi thinking of you ;)"". 

I lost my shit and had ugly-ass breakdown 2.0. 

I cried all night but he was adamant that this ""Sam"" is the sister of one of his sales man. Like??? Is that believable??? I haven't met this sales man guy but I've often heard stories about him and have heard their conversations via phone. And this sales guy fucking talks with him with utter politeness. So I really can't believe that his sister, which, btw, is not my SO's employee, would talk to him so casually. 

But, given that SO was telling the truth, that this Sam is indeed his employee's sister. Isn't their relationship a little fishy? Isn't the text a sign of flirting? Or have I really lost my screws? He said I was too easily jealous but he apologized and have since repeatedly say, ""I love you"", ""Im sorry"", and ""Please don't leave me"". 

I've been numb since Wednesday and honestly don't know what to do. My insecurities have spiked to the heavens and I kept thinking that maybe I'm too ugly that's why he keeps on cheating. But I know it's just my self-pity speaking but I can hardly eat or sleep. 

We just got back to our city this morning (timezone is GMT +8) that's why I just got my chance of soliciting advice. My friends and family have long told me to leave him. Is that what I'm going to get in this sub too? I'm actually really scared. He's my first everything - first kiss, first love, first date, first holding hands, first sex, etc etc. But I think he's treating me like a trash. 

**TL:DR** SO has a record of cheating on me. I had his phone when he received a ""flirty"" text by a girl he claims to be his employee's sister. I find it hard to believe, he said I'm too jealous with other girls.

   So I was salty about the whole thing. I mean I got to dance with a few people at Homecoming, but I wanted to be with Liz. Until I heard some rumours that Liz's dad is some super villain. Man, imagine a super villain driving you to homecoming knowing that if you screw up he could kill you.

6lo3xa,3,2017-07-06,I feel like I'm kinda useless at my job and I feel bad about it.,UselessInternThrow,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6lo3xa/i_feel_like_im_kinda_useless_at_my_job_and_i_feel/,"Throwaway account just because that's what people do.

So I'm a summer intern  (hoping for part-time work once summer ends) working in IT at a place I interned at last year. This year they have me on a new project they're working on, and I'm the only intern on this thing, rather than the two other interns I was with last year.

The thing about this project is that it requires me to email users to find a time to set up software on their PCs. The process of setting up this software takes virtually no time at all. Most of my job time is spent waiting around for email responses or waiting until the time someone asked me to come set up the software. I've actually done nothing today but sit around, send emails, and schedule some setups for tomorrow.

They're paying me pretty well for an intern, especially given the fact that I'm doing nothing. In addition, everyone here in IT really likes me, especially one of the guys in charge. I impressed him in my interview last year. I know pretty well what I'm doing when I'm actually doing something. 

I just feel bad because they gave me this one project to work on (coupled with some side errands from time to time) and the majority of my time is just spent sitting around. I feel like I'm just leeching money in exchange for nothing and that this project will never get done. I'm not the only one working on it (just the only intern) and I have no choice but to wait for other people, but I still feel like it's my failure. My supervisors don't give me stuff to do when I'm just sitting in the office. I feel like I should find something to do, but I have no idea what because I have no idea what else needs to be done. They haven't even given me permission to answer the support desk phone, which probably has the jobs I'm most qualified for. I'm worried they're all gonna get pissed at me sitting around doing nothing, if they even care.

Maybe this is just the dream gig? Professional redditor, I guess. But it gets very dull and I worry for my future here.

I don't know what I should do. Any advice is appreciated."

6lo74s,9,2017-07-06,unpopular opinion in this subreddit; would appreciate an opposing force of change to counter my statements.,throwawayfuckall01,proED,https://www.reddit.com/r/proED/comments/6lo74s/unpopular_opinion_in_this_subreddit_would/,"I understand I'm viewing this from my own sphere of experiences and my mileage may vary, but if I were to actually ""be myself"" for people and not change I'd be this lump of shit with inflammatory opinions and an ugly face. 

**If you have a differing opinion and a different perspective, then I encourage and challenge you to not just downvote, but to offer a reason as to why you think I'm wrong.**

I don't like feeling this way and I used to embrace the individual and thought--but I feel very jaded and it's hard to believe that we don't have a conformist society. For me, a conformist society is what prompted and pushed people to create this subreddit in the first place.

We wear makeup/fight acne for a reason. Braces are a coming-of-age standard for a reason. We call political activists with unpopular opinions crazy for a reason. No one likes the devil's advocate for a reason, unless they have a charming face. 

I'm just so frustrated because every time I try to express my plans for change, I get called either a sociopath or a person who buys in to norms. But that's the way the world works? You either go out with the rest of the interns for drinks and you dress to the standard and you talk about relatable things or you don't. If everyone judges you and doesn't want to hang out with you, then don't whine about no one liking who you are as a person.

People want to be like everyone else and they don't like change that doesn't fit with how they view things. Thus, anyone that falls too far outside or below that standard gets ostracized.

I'm so fucking tired of people telling me to ""be myself."" Do you want a controlling freak who incessantly talks about calories, the importance of a good sunscreen and how Israel isn't exactly the greatest country in the world (it's not the worst I know, but I'm sick of people playing it up like it's the best ever ~~looking at you, super conservatives~~)?

No. No one wants to talk about that. I'll go back to studying how to dress like you, how to talk about sports like you, makeup like you, vacation spots like you, and continue stalking you and your friends' Facebooks to figure out a common denominator of what everyone really enjoys and what makes you and all your pretty little friends so **likeable** so that I, too, don't get left behind out in the rain of discrimination again.

Dear White People and Coco Conners is my idol. Idgaf anymore about ""being myself"" because I won't survive in this world if I do.

**DISCLAIMER**

I understand this above post has been very volatile and aggressive. I started out by reading things on ""how to be likeable"" and asking for solid advice on ""how to make friends"" and all this be yourself advice got me feeling like I'm back to square one. I burned a lot of bridges my freshman year after a sexual assault that changed ""myself"" into a fucking monster. It's difficult being yourself when all you are is jaded, bitter, and angry about everyone and everything.

I obviously need self-development and help, but what it boils down to is that it depends what my goals are. For me, it's about making more friends rather than a few (I'm still keeping my few close friends, I'm not a fucktard and they are my ride or die in this shitty life atm) and to change my reputation to be successful and not piss anyone off anymore. I want to excel in the workplace where it's an office and obviously that's where popularity and being likeable wins. It's just how the world works for me.

But if you're comfortable working in a small workplace where everyone plays LoL or only gets out together on the weekend to watch the latest puppy movie, and you're *happy* then that's totally okay. That is *you* and who you are. Those are your goals and yours alone.

After all this; maybe I just need to be more open about my goals. But how do I do that without being called a sociopath? **It's not that I don't care for people or about people; I just want to know how to be like people.**

This sub is what it all is. We just want to be *accepted.*"

6lpqzy,1,2017-07-06,My GF [20F] of 8 months is experiencing unwanted advances at work.,CineGory,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6lpqzy/my_gf_20f_of_8_months_is_experiencing_unwanted/,"Sorry, this is longer than I had anticipated.


My girlfriend [20F] landed her first office experience via a fellowship that she was chosen for over the summer. Everything seems to have been going well so far, but during our end of the day conversations, she had mentioned some behavior from a high school intern [18M] that threw up some red flags to me.

It started off with staring at her legs. I get that guys are going to check out attractive women -- it happens all of the time, but this is clearly inappropriate in an office setting. She told me that she felt like he was obviously staring at her, but she didn't want to cause any trouble in the office if she was wrong.


The next incident occurred when they were both early to a meeting regarding feedback for a toastmasters kind of thing aimed toward giving leadership skills to highschool students (I believe that he is in some kind of leadership program offered to people that would otherwise not have the opportunity). She was there to critique his presentation for an upcoming speech-giving contest. He lingered by the light switch at the door, and when she tried to turn on the light in the room, he said with a smirk, ""Keep them off. I like it with the lights off."" While there could be room for ambiguity there, I feel like there was clearly an over the line comment being made. Again, though, my girlfriend didn't want to confront him about it because it could be perceived as being ambiguous.


Since then, he has been frequently stopping by her cubicle and invading her space. For example, he would talk to her and keep getting closer and closer, until she was cornered; he'll try to lean over her to show her something on her computer; and today, he came in with a set of folders and actually sat at her desk, claiming that it was easier for him to sit there because she's situated closer to the filing cabinets. Let me make clear that he didn't even ask, but just sat down and made himself welcome in her space. He is also making comments about her outfits, and, in my opinion, was trying to tease or lightly neg her by saying that she was dressing like an old lady and that she should go back to dresses.


What she has done to try to curtail this behavior has been to not necessarily directly tell him to stop, but point out that he routinely makes comments about her, bothers her, and invades her space, while his excuses for doing so could just as easily apply to the other fellow situated next to her. For example, in response to his comments on what she was wearing, she said, ""Do you talk to Dave about what he's wearing? Do you have opinions on how he should look?"" He said that she was making it awkward and that she was over-reacting. He basically made it seem like she was crazy, exaggerating, and that he was the victim because she was seeing something that wasn't there. In addition to that, when he invades her space, she'll call Dave over and he'll call out the high schooler on how strange it is that he's so close to her. She also mentions me regularly, but he doesn't seem to care that she has a boyfriend, and even asked her for a ride home and out to eat after work. This kid is clearly not getting the hint, and is actually getting worse. Even when she makes things ""awkward,"" he keeps on coming back to her. I felt like this would happen when we first talked about it and said as much, but I don't want to make it sound like, ""I told you so,"" but there are some things I don't think are helping: she doesn't want to seem mean, so she shared food with him when he asked (she was eating fruit at her desk) and generally is tries to be amiable. While I know that she just wants things to be normal, I feel like he is probably thinking that her being nice is a sign that his other behavior is okay. He's either oblivious as to why things get ""awkward,"" or he just doesn't care. I didn't tell her that her kindness may be opening her up to further harassment, but I think that that may be what's going on.


What I thought she should do is document each instance of when this occurs, so that she could establish a timeline and pattern of behavior. I said she should be direct with, because her implied messaging does not seem to be going through. If he reacts poorly or continues, I thought that she should present the timeline and complaint to her boss. Her concern is that nobody will believe her --- that his perception and word will over rule hers since he's been around longer. She said that he crossed the line and she wants to do something, but doesn't know what to do. I know that she's scared about saying something, because she's ultimately a temporary employee trying to garner work experience. Everybody likes her and they hinted at future employment, but she's afraid that complaining about this intern will sour her opportunity.


Any advice is welcome!

6lqb0a,10,2017-07-06,I decided today to quit. I am a shell of my former self and I now know why,SerendipitousWaste,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/6lqb0a/i_decided_today_to_quit_i_am_a_shell_of_my_former/,"Typical as bad as it gets story. I started smoked after I was diagnosed with epilepsy under the guise it would help. What it really did was compound my depression. Since January I have been eating 1 square meal a day due to extremely low appetite (may be a separate issue) but every time I think about eating I feel like being sick. Even though I love food?

Before today I had managed to smoke every day for the last 9 months, and after desperately scraping the last of my kief and emptying out smoked joints, I realised I'm at my rock bottom. 

This is especially shocking for me because I have always considered myself a winner, in high school I had the best girl, best grades, I was the man with it all. 

And now a summary of my failures due to weed as an enabler:
- didn't even show up to my university exams, failed obviously and will have to resit the year. 
- pushed away my already small group of friends to the point where I can only say I have one true friend. No support network for me!
- I don't really sleep. I stay up smoking my head off until I effectively black out from being so high. When I wake up, I reach straight for the grinder to repeat another day of watching YouTube videos, avoiding people and stomaching pathetic meals. 
- I currently have £21 to my name, even when it was around £200 (to last me 3 months) I spent £70 on shatter and bud. 
- (unrelated to weed but worsened the habit) lost my summer job, and got massively fucked over by an internship opportunity. 
- (worst of all) my sister has a school trip tomorrow which I doubt I will make it to because my sleep pattern is so broken and my head is such a highly strung mess. 

It's like, I look back and think wow, why did I do it to myself, WHILE I SMOKE A JOINT. Why am I so self-destructive? 

At 12pm today I stopped. By 8pm I was crying from the stress and anxiety piled on top of me. Only around 12am did I get a proper grip of myself after a shot of whisky loosened me up. 

I'm really struggling, but I want to better myself. 

Sorry if this is a rant, I'm hoping this thread will open a gateway for advice/awareness on the darker side to the marvellous weed culture. If anyone wants to talk or anything, please let me know, it'll be beneficial for me too to know there are others really locked tight in this vice. "
6lqfyj,8,2017-07-06,Think Clearly,MoaXing,CTWLite,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTWLite/comments/6lqfyj/think_clearly/,"[Incoming long story. It got a way from me and just got long and rambling. Also pretty NSFW, although I tried my best to keep it clean. Anyway, I wanted to get it put today because I have another long one for Feature Friday tomorrow. If it seems too imperfect I'll edit it later. Also the latest story by /u/madicienne required the speed of this post too.]

It had been a long day. That's how they all seemed lately. Ever since the death of Councilman Andre Drake, everyone at CityWatch News had been on edge. News articles were being released behind schedule as every article had to be subjected to intense vetting to ensure it was up to the standards that had been forced on the news outfit. As it turned out, CityWatch’s concerns had made it back to ENC’s corporate office, and all the way up to CEO Iliza Monarch, who had to ensure advertisers that nothing was wrong at her subsidiary. Things at CityWatch had continued to get worse following the death of a reporter who worked there. Rumors had started to flow, and production was slowing.

For what seemed like the entire morning, Iliza had been field calls from the editor in chief over at CityWatch. John Freeman was his name, and he was a good editor for CityWatch, but a pathetically weak man. It seemed like he always put in calls to corporate to make sure any action was okay. Iliza felt a truly personal hatred for Freeman. Today, he had called five times asking about some story that he knew damn well he shouldn't run. Iliza was tired of it, and saw that a problem was developing in Freeman. Journalistic integrity. After disconnecting her call with him, she told HR to pay out his severance package and picked a better candidate to replace him. Truthfully, she was tense and in a horrible mood. Normally, John Freeman was mild annoyance. Today had just been a bad day for him to be one.

Either way, his retirement was finalized. The fact that it was a forced retirement was beside the point. She called John’s office and informed him of his retirement, keeping the threats subtly masked under remarks about how integral he was to CityWatch, and how much of a shame it would be for him to leave the ENC family. After that, she drafted a corporate memo for immediate release to all employees of CityWatch concerning the retirement of their editor in chief. She capped off the whole show by calling the newly minted editor in chief and congratulating them on their promotion. It was a performance she had practiced many times and once again it was flawlessly executed. The audience showers her with applause! Roses are thrown onto the stage! Take a bow Iliza Monarch! Leading lady of the famous stage show *Manipulating the Media! or How to Normalize Corruption and Get Rich Too!!* a great show indeed.

She leaned her chair back from her desk, and let out an exasperated sigh. She had wealth, power, and beauty. All the things any woman in her late thirties should desire, and yet she was unhappy. Why? She wasn't sure. Everyday she saw her bank account grow larger, and her vault of secrets continued to fill. Wealth and power continued to grow. Was she truly concerned about her looks fading? Don't kid yourself baby, that was easily remedied too. If it ever happened. Was her great unhappiness just one of life's equally great mysteries? Perhaps. Was there a remedy, albeit temporary? You know it. 

She left work early that day. You can do that when you're in charge. So she left and if anyone needed her? Too bad! Let the answer of “Sorry, Ms. Monarch is not in right now,” serve for anyone who wanted to find her. She needed to get away from the office for a time. Those idiots at CityWatch were taking up too much of it anyway. ENC had thousands of subsidiaries globally, and yet they rarely ever called corporate. Nor did corporate have to interfere in their affairs that often either. It was easy to get tired of dealing with other people's problems. So fuck them.

She left her office, went down to the parking garage, and got behind the wheel of her incredibly expensive car. An automated voice told her to fasten her seatbelt and input a route. 

*Fuck you car, I’ll drive myself,* she thought. She hit the manual button, and a steering wheel deployed from the dashboard compartment. She turned the car on, and floored the accelerator and peeled out of the garage and onto the street, merging into traffic with skill. The drive home was quick as she jumped from lane to lane, speeding all the time. The roads were nice and empty at this time of day. It was between all major commuting times, which made it the perfect time to drive manual.

She exited the highway after crossing the river. The turn took her to a cluster of high rise residential buildings that only the upper crust of the city could afford. She turned to the building that she lived in and drove into the underground garage where the gate attendant allowed her in. She parked in her reserved spot, walked to the elevator, and punched the button that said “P”. A keypad lit up and asked for her security key, a fingerprint scan, and a retinal scan. Three step security system. You know you’ve made it when you need a retinal scan to enter your home. She provided all three and the express elevator shot upwards towards her own personal heaven above the city. When it reached the penthouse, it dinged softly and the doors opened with a whisper. She stepped out and the doors whispered shut and the elevator descended back down. A second security door, apparently blast resistant, slid shut over the elevator. No one getting here, that's for sure.

The first thing Iliza did upon getting home, was take off her shoes and leave them where they lay. The second things she did was to slip out of her dress and leave it where it lay as well. She stood stark naked in her penthouse condo, which encompassed two floors by the way, and let the sun pouring in from the floor to ceiling windows bathe her in light and warmth. One time the building's window washer had been an audience to this showing. She had let him watch, and even put on a little show for him. Why not? No one would believe him anyway. 

Today there weren't any window washers. The view out of her windows was clear and unobstructed. The skyscrapers of Arcadia glittered in the light of the sun. The waves of the bay and the river were equally aglow. The mansions of Dorsett Island looked extravagant as ever. She had thought of living there once, but it was hard to look down on people when you weren't on top of a skyscraper. After admiring the view, she walked upstairs to her bedroom. Another sign of extravagant wealth was the elevator between the penthouse’s first and second floors. The building had installed it during construction to accommodate any disabled billionaires and stay compliant with federal mandates on disability accommodations. Even so, they charged extra and tacked it on the bill as a feature. Capitalism in action!

She went to the bathroom and took a shower. Unnecessary really. You don't work up much of a sweat sitting in an air conditioned office. She let the water run down the curves of her body. It flowed off of her perky, and natural, breasts before cascading down to her feet. She glistened with water from head to toe. After her shower, she did her hair. Once she looked presentable, yet still nude, she set about organizing one of her famous parties. Men and women would come to her penthouse to take part in pleasures of the flesh. An excellent cure for unhappiness. 

The guests arrived around seven. The elevator bounded back and forth between the ground floor and the penthouse. Iliza controlled it all from within her bedroom. After thirty minutes, the last guest had arrived. Iliza sent the elevator back down and sent a “Do Not Disturb” request to the front lobby. She set all her personal devices to ignore incoming messages with a polite response. It was her time for fun, and she did not want anything to get in the way of that.

She exited her room and walked across the second-floor living space to the balcony that overlooked the first-floor living space. Her guests were gathered there. There seemed to be two men for every woman. An average split for her parties. She looked down at them, and they looked back up at her. She watched them eye her naked form, and she eyed theirs as well, watching their reactions. More than a few of the men were sporting erections.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” she began. “Thank you all for coming to my little party on such short notice. Now, let the fun begin.”

She descended down the staircase, which curved gracefully to the lower floor. The guests watched her as she crossed the living room. The created a path for her through the masses of naked flesh. She made it to the back of the room where a keyboard sat on a small table. She typed in her login, and turned on the large monitor. It showed the room from the viewpoint of the main camera, which was facing the crowd.

“Is everyone ready?” she asked. A murmur of approval rose from her guests. “Let's get comfortable and let the fun begin.”

A small panel slid open in the wall, and an automated cart carried out a frame with handcuffs dangling from it. The frame was positioned in the middle of the room for everyone to see. As they watched, the secrets behind the scenes of the party went to work. Tiny cameras hidden all over the room, in conjunction with footage captured from the elevator, set to work creating a database of all the guests faces. While the database assembled, it ran the faces through an advanced facial recognition program. The master program sorted everyone into categories based on how much damage footage of these events could do to their character. Those who would be least damaged went to the bottom of the list, just above those who weren't important enough to matter. When the database was ready, the games could begin.

“I see some familiar people among the crowd tonight,” Iliza said after the program alerted her that the database was complete. The leader of the list was a prominent opponent of M0lly Mil10ns and the proliferation of sex available through the digital world of SLUM. “For the newcomers among us, I’ll explain the rules. The system will randomly select someone from the group. That person will go to the frame and be locked up and blindfolded. While on the frame, the other guests can do whatever they want to that person. Any questions?”

“Wait, is it going to display our faces?” one newcomer, a man, asked. The group laughed at this, Iliza included.

“You did make sure to wear your digital mask right? It's the only way that the special contact lenses, and the cameras, will detect the face you chose to mask your true identity.”

Iliza pointed to a small silver disc on her neck, which everyone else had as well. The man seemed to calm down as he reached up and touched the disc on his neck. Then he said that yes he had his on. With that, he blended back into the crowd.

“Let the games begin,” Iliza said. As she did, the monitor displayed a very plain male face. White, with not too spectacular features. The man stepped out of the crowd and went to the frame. Iliza did the honors of cuffing him to the frame and blindfolding him. “Well, have at it.”

The first person to go up was a short woman who had been to several of these parties before. Iliza knew what she was into, and felt sorry for the poor bastard on the frame. The woman walked up to the man and went behind him. She reached down between his legs and took hold of his erect penis. The man had a look of pleasure on his face as she toyed with it, even bending down to lick it as well. She ran her hand up to his testicles. Playing with them gently. The man had no idea what was coming. He was grinning like an idiot before his expression changed to one of immense pain. The short woman was squeezing the poor bastards balls like she was trying to pop them. She rotated them with force and malice. The man let out a pained squeal, and the woman let go and walked away. She was quickly replaced by another woman who was equipped with a strap-on. The robotic phallus covered with synth skin was almost like the real deal. Almost. The woman had her way with the man in the frame, and when she was finished a man replaced her and did the same thing to the man in the frame.

An alarm beeped as the first man’s time was up. She uncuffed him and watched as he stumbled back to the couch and collapsed. He’d be better off with virtual equivalent than this it seemed. She ran the program again and watched as another face appeared and another person went to the frame. It took six tries before her own face was on the wall.

When it was, she went to the frame and signalled to a young woman with platinum blonde hair and perky breasts to cuff and blindfold her. As soon as she was locked up, she felt a hand on her ass. It soon began probing lower until it found the warmth between her legs. Fingers slipped in, then out. Then something much larger slipped in. A man with a member of considerable size was getting into a rhythm inside her. She moaned in pleasure. Another hand caressed her face. It was soft and well manicured. She smelt the perfume of the platinum blonde. Another hand was pinching one of her nipples. The same girl. She was being kissed now. Lost in pleasure time slipped away. Then the alarm beeped again. The platinum blonde uncuffed her and removed her blindfold.

“Stay with me tonight,” Iliza said to her. She nodded her head yes. The party continued on until it got late. People started to pass out and others excused themselves to go home. When the penthouse was empty, save for herself and the platinum blonde, Iliza led her up the the bedroom. Together they rolled beneath the sheets. The blonde's tongue probing Iliza, who was considerably wet. They were like this all night, changing position with each other. The taste of the blonde lingered on Iliza's lips. They fell asleep in each other's arms.

**

Dawn broke and bathed the bedroom is bright light which came in from the many windows in the walls and ceiling. Shafts of light gave the platinum blonde a halo around her hair. Iliza woke up early and went and sat on a chair facing the window. She watched the morning sun dance off the skyscrapers of Alporte, making them look as if they were on fire. The bay looked the same, like a massive fire on the waves. She heard the sheets rustle as her guest climbed out of bed. Her feet padded along the floor as she came up behind Iliza and embraced her in a hug from behind. Her hands coming to rest on Iliza’s breasts.

“Good morning,” she said. “What are you doing up so early?”

“I couldn't sleep. I’ve been up all night,” Iliza responded, surprisingly honest. 

“Too bad. I slept great,” the blonde said. She leaned in close and whispered to Iliza. “I had a great time last night. Maybe we can keep the fun going.”

“No I’m sorry. I have too much to do.”

“I don't believe you. Something tells me you're very rich and very powerful, and that you don't care if anyone needs you. You could stay here all day with me if you wanted.”

“You’re right. About all of it. Truthfully, I’m unhappy in life. I have money and power. A fantastic sex life and good looks. I’m nearly forty years old. All of that should make me happy beyond belief. I’m a success story if there ever was one. Yet I don't feel that way. Something is missing.”

“I know who you are. So just tell me everything and I can help Iliza.”

“How do you--,” she began. “Never mind. Tell me who you are.”

“Tell me what's bothering you and I’ll tell you who I am.”

“Fine. I don’t feel powerful enough. I want to control everything in this city. Psychiatrists would say I have a god complex, or that I’m a megalomaniac. Maybe I am. What it comes down to is that I will never have complete power. No matter how much blackmail material I have to leverage the rich CEOs and minor politicians, I will never truly control Alporte.”

“Why limit yourself to just the city?”

“Don't interrupt. Since you ask though, I'll tell you. Alporte is moving towards independence. It will fall away from the nation-state it belongs to and it will become a city-state. That's what this whole era will become. The age of the city-state. It makes sense. All the wealth and technology is centered in the biggest cities, and Alporte is right there among them. If I controlled the city and could stay in control long enough to guide Alporte into the new era of city-states, I would control more than just a city. I would control the wealth of one of the world's greatest cities.”

“Well why don't you just run for mayor?”

Iliza laughs at the thought of that. “No thank you. I prefer not to sign my own death sentence. Our current mayor would have me killed, regardless of our friendship, as soon as I announced my candidacy. Besides, the people of Alporte dislike me almost as much as they hate Ellen.”

“Then make a mayor. Take someone and put them in office.”

“I could but there really aren't any candidates in this city. The only people who could afford to run a campaign for mayor are rich, and the people of Alporte hate the rich. They protest and riot against the oligarchy that controls this city. They burn them in effigy in SLUM. There is no one in this city who is loved by the people, able to sustain a campaign, important enough that Ellen couldn't have them killed, and most importantly, easily manipulated. That combination does not exist in this city.”

“Yes it does. You aren't thinking clearly. Focus. Who comes to mind?”

“Mercier?”

“Aciano Mercier, yes. Loved by the people, rich, Ellen can't kill him, and foolish and easily manipulated. Trust me, Ellen is already scared of him as it is. She thinks all his humanitarian projects are intended to make him appealing to voters. She thinks he's gunning for her job.”

“Really? How do you know.”

“I suppose I did promise to tell you who I am. My name is Lily Kara and I’ve been working at City Hall for a while now. First as an intern, but now I work directly for Mayor Machida. I’ve got the inside track on what she thinks and how she acts. I could help you take power in this city. Use Aciano, sell him to the people and she’ll fall. I don’t know how you intend to control him, but I’ll let you handle that. Just one thing. When you own the city, I want to own it with you.”

Iliza thought it over. What was she asking? To partner up? Or to go beyond that? Could she be trusted? Most importantly Iliza hoped she wasn't suggesting some sort of sustained romantic relationship. As attractive as she was, Iliza was entirely adverse to the idea of being tied down in some relationship. There was no fun at all in that.

“What exactly is my benefit in letting you in on this?” Iliza asked.

“I’m a valuable source of information form Ellen. I can use my proximity to her to our advantage. On top of that, I could be a potential campaign manager for Mr. Mercier if he agrees to run with our help.”

“Alright then,” Iliza leaned in and kissed Lily. “Let's celebrate.”

I'm really pissed off with myself and my life. I feel like a waste of space right now. I'm a 22 year old guy, who never once had a job, let alone done anything with my life. back when I finished high school, I went to community college, only to unofficially drop out later due to failing a course too many times, which caused me to lose my financial aid, which was the only way I was able to go in the first place. year or two later, I went to a trade school, and into a program called ""Digital Multimedia"", which is a fancy way of saying I do stuff like graphic designs and the like. finished and graduated, did a short internship because it was a graduation requirement, and thought things were looking up. I was wrong. I still don't have a job, the place I interned at can't hire me, and all I do is sit around and play video games while my parents remind me how much of a piece of shit I am. I have no car, no reliable transportation because my parents can't do it, every place I look at applying, they asked for years of experience in some other field besides graphic designs, ask for a portfolio which I don't even have yet, and because I live in Florida, means even If I do find a place, I'd have to take a bus, which I doubt I could get to and from at a reasonable time.


my parents yelled at me earlier, pretty much mad that I still haven't found anything, and practically begged me to look for something already, while at the same time making me feel even worse about myself. I can't even get a simple entry level job, because I live in the middle of fucking nowhere. any place that has a said entry level job, is too far to walk, but too close to take the bus, and again my parents just can't take me.


I just feel pathetic. My life is complete shit, my parents are fucking assholes who seems to always do this to me, and me trying to talk or get them to help me just gets them pissed off at me, saying things like why am I not like the hundreds of other people around my age, who have a job and car, and possibly a home already.


I really wish I could say more, but to me, everything I just said barely seems coherent, if at all. Just, fuck man. fuck my parents. fuck me, and my stupid ass for not willing to do anything. I don't even see the fucking point. don't see the point of looking for a job when I know chances are I won't get it, and even if I did, I wouldn't last. I don't see the point of doing anything to change my situation, it just seems impossible. I don't even see the point of even living. even when I think about wanting to kill myself, I can't even bring myself to do it. again, what's the point? seems like dead or alive, I cause problems for people, and either way I'm still fucking pathetic. other people have had much worse things happen to them, and yet here I am, typing all of this on reddit.

fuck me man. fuck."

I don't have a job and I'm trying to find any kinds of job right now but I can't get anything. And my parents 24/7 won't stop reminding me of it. They are always wondering ""what's wrong with you? Why can't you be like your brothers? Why can't you get a job?""

I've doing my prayers and fasting with hope that Allah(swt) alone with help. I've doing my part(going to my career counselor,trying to network with my fellow graduates, applying online, going to interviews, emailing follow up emails, going to career fairs, trying to get internships etc..)

Long post but I promise it's chill.,financegodthrowaway,tressless,https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/6ls7ng/my_success_story_asian_24m_on_finasteride_proscar/,"Hi guys - this is going to be a long post. I'm going to share my hairloss story and how everything is chill now with proscar finasteride. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm a long-time redditor and I keep this fin stuff on the DL so I'm using a throwaway. I'm having a pretty relaxing night in an otherwise hectic week so I thought I would share my success story thus far. If you don't believe me or think I'm fake - it's all good homie, I won't be providing pictures or anything because I'm pretty private and.... honestly too busy for anything else other than this post. Also I've never made a long post before so apologies in advance if I fuck up the formatting.

---

&amp;nbsp;

**Background about me**: I'm a newly-turned 24 year old Asian male in Canada. I just finished uni and I'm now working stupidly aggressive hours in finance. Not to be a fucking douche but I do pretty well with girls. I hit the gym religiously to get yoked and I'm pretty good at the tinder grind. I'm not drowning in pussy per say but I don't really get caught out in dry spells. 

&amp;nbsp;

**My ohhhh shit moment**: I was at a party and one of my buddies was chatting up this chick. She made a joke about how he kinda had a receding hairline (pretty fucking wack joke if you ask me ahahah). He laughed it off and then she was like oh financegodthrowaway your hair is kinda going too. I was like lmao miss me with that shit. But it was all good cuz although she wasn't my type, she was a fun girl to hang out with. Anyways that day I went home to my girlfriend and was like yooooo am I balding?? She told me no but then I went on the internet (i.e. reddit) to learn about hairless. That's how I found /r/tressless. 

&amp;nbsp;

**My hair loss stage**: My haircut is a tight fade on the sides/back with a longish pompadour on top. I pulled my hair all the way back and was like holy shit I guess my temples are pushed far back. I wasn't like fucking crazy bald or anything. It was like Norwood 2. No more no less. With the haircut I have it's chill if the temples are receded - I don't look wack or anything. But I remember reading tresses obsessively for like a week - I read every single big post. The one I remember the most was that guy who was an actor and used fin + a bunch of stuff. He looked pretty chill and I was like yo I'll just do that.

&amp;nbsp;

**Finasteride debate**: I did all the research I could into fin. Ya there was some pretty scary shit out there on the web. But there were also a lot of success stories that calmed me down. Was I ready to be shackled to some pill for the rest of my life and risk dick problems just to have nice hair? Turns out yeah I was tbh. When you're young and in your prime yeah I want to have nice hair. You can dress however nicely you want and hit the gym 10000000 hours. But still let's be brutally honest. Nice hair completes the aesthetics for guys. Close your eyes and imagine a super alpha stud who pops bottles and pulls bitches day in day out. Yeah that guy has nice hair. 

&amp;nbsp;

Maybe when I'm like 35 years old I'll stop fin. When I'm 35 I'll probably be making fat bank and married already so I probably will give 0 fucks then if I'm bald. Girls around that age also care less about hair probable and more about maturity and financial stability. Girls my age care about that too - but also how good you look, let's be honest. 

&amp;nbsp;

So anyways long story short I was like fuuuuuuck it. I bought like 3 pill cases off amazon: a weekly one for fin (plus all my multivitamins/fish oil etc), a keychain pill case (in case I slept over somewhere and didn't have time to go home to take a fin pill), and some backups. If I was going to do this I was going to do this right. I don't do a half ass job on anything. I take shit seriously.

&amp;nbsp;

**How I got my fin (also why I dodged minoxidil)**: Hit up my family doctor. She was like nah dude and started talking about dick problems which kinda scared me. She gave me a prescription for minoxidil. I knew 100% i was not going to take minoxidil. There is 0% chance I'm going to rub liquid into my scalp every morning. I work almost 70 hours a week at my internship and I'm not going to wake up at some girls house on the weekend and be like yo gimme a sec let me rub some liquid in my scalp to not be bald. Fuck that lmao. Fin pills were a much better fit for my lifestyle.

&amp;nbsp;

So i hit up a walk in clinic and got a prescription for Proscar there. 5mg and you buy a pill cutter to cut them into 4ths. Every Sunday I take out my pill cutter and cut up some pills to stick into my box. Pop one every morning at my desk and I'm ready to crush some financial models at work - fuck yeah. (I don't take them on empty stomach in morning just because I have an aversion to taking pills on an empty stomach - no clue why).

&amp;nbsp;

I buy any Proscar at Costco. Maybe it's Canada, maybe it's Costco - but 6 months supply was almost south of $20 (I forgot the exact price, but it was pretty cheap). 

&amp;nbsp;


**How I feel**: Good. At first I was cataloguing everything. I was really really scared of side effects (""sides"" as everyone here calls them). I was like taking pictures of my hairline, my dick, everything to store and compare later. Paranoid as fuck. I got lazy because of work so I actually stopped tracking everything cuz like idk if it ain't broke it's all good. Here's a quick evaluation 7 months in taking 1.25 mg of fin every single day.

&amp;nbsp;

Hair: Stopped receding. I don't think I had a big shed. Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't. I didn't really check - I was pretty busy. In the recent month I think my hair did recede like half a millimetre. TBH that's probably because I've been literally going to work from 9am to midnight every single day including weekends (shorter on sat sun tho). It's super super stressful at work so I wouldn't be surprised. Ehhh whatever that part is out of my control. 

&amp;nbsp;

Sex: Ok this part is interesting. 

*Before fin*: I fucked like an animal. BUT I also have kind of an accordion dick. I was born with weaker circulation so I have this thing where when I'm fucking, I'm rock hard. Like so hard it hurts sometimes. But like when I pop out of the girl to flip her over or something I'll lose half my boner. So I'll get her to suck me back to full (takes like 15 secs maybe?) then I'm rock hard again. It's super weird. I've made it like kind of a game with my current girlfriend to get through all the diff positions without every physically removing my dick from her pussy  (exception for when she's going down on me) because my dick might go accordion on us. 

&amp;nbsp;

*On fin*: I mention this because fin seems to have made me have more of an accordion dick. When I'm hard I'm still rock solid. I have no problems getting it up for sex ever. It's just like when I remove my dick from a girl 4/10 times I'll soften up and she will have to suck me back up to being hard. All in all though tradeoff is worth it to me personally because I still have a lot of sex and have no problems dicking down a girl. And tbh having nice hair makes me look better so I pull more girls in total (if that makes sense?)

&amp;nbsp;

Other side effects: In the beginning my balls kinda hurt. But they don't anymore. Did I grow tits like some other redactors said? No. Did I get a ED? No. (praying that it never happens in the future tho lmao. Please please no bad karma here. God please let me still keep fucking like I do. I've been a good kid.)

&amp;nbsp;

One interesting thing to note - my jizz is now a lot more watery. Idk if that's like really bad or not. I'm not really looking to get anybody pregnant so I'm not really concerned about that tbh. In the future I need to get a girl pregnant to start a family and it turns out the jizz is bad I'll stop taking fin or just do IV fertilization. But tbh idk if it affects anything.

&amp;nbsp;

*Game plan*: keep popping fin to preserve my hair until I'm 35. Stop then cuz i probably won't care if I'm bald at 35.

&amp;nbsp;

---


**Conclusion**: Started fin in Dec at norwood 2. All good then, all good now. Only been 7 months though. I'm spending my night making this post out of gratitude to /r/Tressless. Honestly if I didn't discover all these stories I wouldn't have started fin and would be probably more bald by now. I get what you guys are going through - I really do. The thought of balding hard in my mid twenties scared the living daylights out of me. I was in a dark place in my life. Fin and /r/Tressless has changed that. I'm not paid to make this post. I'm not trolling any of you guys. I would have never discovered fin without this community.

&amp;nbsp;

I really earnestly want to pay it forward. I don't get anything from cool internet points. I really don't. /R/tressless has changed my life. The community here and the stories you share - I trusted them with all my heart. 7 months later I'm glad I took the plunge. Maybe things will all go to shit a couple years from now. Maybe they won't. But hey man that's life. I got dealt the balding hand in life and here is me trying to fight it. If I win I win. If in the end I go bald anyways or get some fucking crazy shady sides then I lose. In the end I'm just a kid trying to make the best out of what I was born with and the resources I have.

&amp;nbsp;

To any of you out there who are thinking about taking the plunge - here is my advice. Do what feels right for your lifestyle and your risk tolerance. I've always been a risk taker. I go big or go home. Right now I have my hair and a great life. I am so blessed and thankful for it. Having chill ass hair has definitely made a positive impact on my quality of life. I might get hit by a car tomorrow so I live my days out trying to stretch out the moments in every day. 

&amp;nbsp;

GOOD LUCK EVERYONE.

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to reach out to me, I'll check this throwaway periodically.

6lsh99,35,2017-07-07,"Repeating the $50,000 Success: Part 1",Juscol,juststart,https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/6lsh99/repeating_the_50000_success_part_1/,"I have had success with affiliate marketing. Over the past three years I've been making more than $50,000. Unfortunately, the earnings have slowed down. My best month was in november 2015 where I was making $3,502. Last month, I was making $718, and I've on average been making $1,060 in 2017.

The drop in earnings isn't surprising because until last month I haven't really touched my sites nor created any new content for years. I have actually been quite lucky in the earnings in my opinion. Fortunately (and hopefully) the decline is over - I'm starting again.

**Who am I?**

I'm a 20-year old guy who in a very young age got interested in online marketing and especially affiliate marketing. I have had success with two sites: a how-to-create-a-website blog and house and garden site, and they still generate me income (not so much the first anymore, though).

I live in a small European country with just below 6m people which limits the competition but on the other hand limits the traffic and income potential on the websites.

**Why am I starting again?**

Because I still see the potential in affiliate marketing. If I'm still able to generate a very decent amount of money each month on fairly shitty websites that I created when I was a confused 16/17 year old boy, God knows what I will be able to create now.

Also, I'm currently stuck in South Africa. I was supposed to attend an internship for six months in a South African company, but the company got liquidated 1.5 month before I was done (surprise). So I decided to be productive the last 1.5 month with a site which hopefully will be a valuable asset later.

**The website**

The new website I've created is in the fitness and nutritional supplements niche (protein powder, creatine, fish oil - you get the idea). Why? Because I myself have been working out seriously for about a year. This makes it fun to create content, while I'm also able to provide valuable content to the visitors. Also, the competition is fairly decent considering the traffic potential. I think I can beat my competitors with some hard work.

**Current stats for June**

The current stats aren't quite exciting yet. Especially the traffic - or lack of same - is making me impatient. But I suppose I'll just have to suck it up, and wait till my site gets out of Google's hideous sandbox.

Words written: 25,773 excluding guest posts - obviously not as I would have liked it, especially considering that I'm working 9 till 5. I'm hoping to be more productive this month, and I also have to accept that quality content takes time.

Linkbuilding: I've been trading some guest posts which have given me about four valuable links. Also did some brief answering of questions on forums and profile links.

Traffic: [mostly bots and me, but also a few organic hits](http://imgur.com/a/VftwW)

Sales: $0

**Strategy moving forward**

I'm only staying in South Africa a few more weeks before heading on, but I still hope to be more productive than last month. The cornerstones of the website are also about to be done.

I have had an idea of starting a podcast where I interview nutritional experts, personal trainers and fitness athletes. It would give me a competitive edge, and make my website look more serious. It could potentially also lead to some nice links from the people that I interview. Have any of you had experience with that?

Thanks for reading along - will update soon!"
6ltiaq,2,2017-07-07,[US] Looking for any advice you could give - hoping to become CPA,gottathrowitawaymaan,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6ltiaq/us_looking_for_any_advice_you_could_give_hoping/,"TL;DR AT BOTTOM

Psychology major with 130 credit hours - Wanting to become an accountant; CPA hopefully. 
Ive taken financial accounting, enjoyed it and got an A.  Not sure if its relevant but also took macroeconomics, calculus for business, and a couple of statistics courses - I got A's in those classes as well.  

Planned to go into social work.  However, I got in a bar fight a year and a half ago and was charged with felony battery.  Still in the middle of the case. The lawyer thinks it will be brought down to a misdemeanor.  But, violent criminals are not allowed to work with at-risk patients.  Ive looked up the CPA eligibility statutes for criminal records in Florida and Im pretty sure I could plead my case in my favor.  Its my first offence.

GPA is 2.8 - D in Bio II - C in engineering psychology
I took an EMT class in 2009 that was 18 credits and I got an F.  
When I was arrested I was taking 5 classes, I subsequently received F's in those classes as well.  My school allows for 2 grade forgiveness attempts throughout your college career and I am retaking 2 of those classes this semester.  
The rest are A's and B's

I have $23,000 in student loans.  Was counting on loan forgiveness so I took out a lot more than I needed. 

I lost my job because of the arrest.  Im hoping some of the accountancy internships will look past it.  

My school (UCF) has a Masters in Accounting (MSA), which would require me to take 14 accounting/business prerequisites (45 credit hours) before taking the 30 credit masters level courses.  

Financial aid in Florida will cover 150% of the 120 credit hour undergraduate degree which comes out to a maximum of 180 credit hours.  Which will cover the 45 credit hour prerequisites on top of my 130 credit hours already earned.  

The grants should cover most of the costs.  Parents are willing to help here and there, but Im mostly on my own.  Im 26.  

TL;DR - PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR WANTING TO BE CPA - HAVE 130 CREDIT HOURS - 2.8 GPA - 14 PREREQUISITES NEEDED TO BE TAKEN TO APPLY TO MASTERS IN ACCOUNTING (MSA) - $23,000 IN STUDENT LOANS - HAVE PENDING CRIMINAL CASE (BATTERY) - 

Any Advice would be greatly appreciated

6ltptf,1,2017-07-07,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6ltptf/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

6lu76m,291,2017-07-07,Annual Disrespect be Creepin,Guitarjack87,detroitlions,https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/6lu76m/annual_disrespect_be_creepin/,"Well boys, it’s that time of year again. The time of year where memory of last season is hazy at best, and the national media does everything it can to absolutely shit on the Lions. We are hearing how good the Bears are again, which the media does every single fuckin year bar none. The Vikings are building a whole new hype train after their hype zeppelin from last year went down in a fiery explosion with all hands via a Golden Tate flying brown eye. The Packers are, as usual, being talked about as the class of the division. This should not surprise you. You shouldn’t be angry at this. This is par for the course. 

Everyone go ahead and take a knee. We need to talk about some things. First of all, the Lions team as a whole was pretty fucking bad last year. Lets be honest. The defense was hot garbage that was exposed by every good team we played. Of course, they were all lined up right at the end of the season and it looked like a collapse. But you all watched. The defense was trash all year long. We ended up using a rookie 4th rounder who was absolutely NOT pro-ready (Killebrew) instead of a third linebacker a lot, because we simply did not have a third linebacker. I actually was really impressed with TA again, he seems to find ways to mold the defense around their strengths. Last year they had no strengths. So the gameplan was ‘let’s play defense as little as possible’. It actually worked for most of the year. Most of you have seen the advanced numbers at this point, but the Lions had the least drives against them in the league, because they shifted the offense to a TOP grinder, which we will cover in a little bit because it is remarkable that we could even do that. Back to the defense though, it was hot garbage. Utter and complete trash. They couldn’t turn anyone over. They were the bend until they break defense. Tight ends could literally walk 7 yards down the field, stand there, and wait until Tahir Whitehead lost interest in pass coverage and decided to chase some butterflies somewhere else. Haloti Ngata just looked like the guy who plays the line in a rec flag football league because he is fat and you can’t play him anywhere else but he isn’t allowed to sack the quarterback so mostly he just stood there, sweating. I honestly feel bad for the secondary, because most of them are decent players. It must have been so frustrating for them having to cover guys down field until the end of time, to then watch a Tight end grab a floating touch pass underneath their coverage and lumber downfield for 14 yards every. Single. Time. 

Then we have the offense. I spoke earlier how we pivoted this year to a grind the clock type deal. This isn’t the first time. Back when Brandon Pettigrew was a legitimate NFL player, before his knee injuries transformed him from just ‘slow’ to ‘charity 5k briskly walking lady’, he played a large role in a couple of Linehan iterations  that did the same thing. Naturally, we had no run game to speak of, and Pettegrew became the short yardage run game substitution. I think. That is the only way I can possibly fathom Pettegrew catching as many balls as he did those years. I mean, he was whatever the polar opposite of ‘explosive’ is. When he ran, I legitimately felt sorry for him. He just looked so awkward in his own body. We did the same thing this year. Abdullah got hurt, we tried to run the ball with a slot receiver (Riddick (Lol)) for a while and that didn’t work either, then he also got hurt. We had one of the quality control interns, or whoever that white guy was, try a few times. But mostly the offense was designed to attack horizontally via the use of our three receivers and Eric Ebron. Stafford, once again, executed it masterfully. Just like he does with every other iteration of offense, ever in the history of time. Naturally, he gets trashed for being ‘inefficient’ and having a low YPC, even though he was doing exactly what he was supposed to do. Until he was hurt, he was an absolute monster. After the injury, you could see that the timing on his touch throws was off. It was obvious they had to sort of shift what they were doing on offense to make up for that, and it just didn’t work anymore.

We were bad as a team last year. This team lacks talent and real playmakers at nearly every level, other than Special Teams, which were fuckin great last year. Slay and Stafford personally accounted for a large majority of the Lions victories. Without Slay, we probably finish 8-8. Without Stafford, we probably finish 5-11. That is the rub though. That is what having a good QB does. Just ask Green Bay. Their guy is one of the few guys in the league I can say without debate is better than Stafford, and he carries a trash front office and coaching staff to the playoffs every year. I mean, seriously, how many times have you heard the bullshit ‘Green bay develops their own players and doesn’t sign FA’ shtick used as a fucking compliment? They all take the damn offseason off and chuckle at the media pundits while they sip mimosas, because no matter what the Packers do it becomes a positive narrative. Not doing anything is a fucking bullshit strategy, and they should feel bad. But of course, Aaron Rodgers carries their team to 10 wins year after year and they all keep their jobs. It’s actually good for us, because if they got some competent people in there and built a real defense they would probably win a lot more. 

That is why I actually don’t mind all the bullshit we are getting. Yes, the team was bad last year. Yes Stafford got hurt and we lost our last few games. No, that doesn’t mean you can sort by PFF score and rank him accordingly like r/nfl did. It was obvious the injury affected him and he was a better QB than damn near everyone outside of Brady, Rodgers, and Ryan last year until he was hurt. 

We can’t be worse as a team than we were last year. The defense just has to step it up from ‘hot garbage that is being covered for by both the offense and special teams’ to ‘maybe average, maybe a bit below but sometimes they turn the ball over’ and we are better. The offense just has to have some semblance of a run game and we are better. We got the right guy behind center. The guy who shows us that comebacks are NOT flukes, because he does that shit every fuckin year. That Stafford meme is old as hell boys. It wasn’t invented in 2016. So next time you read a bullshit article about how the Lions are gonna go 5-11, just sit back, and smile. You know the truth of the matter. Stafford is going to come in this year, drop his much thicker, longer, newly dadded dick on the NFL, and we are going to win a fucking playoff game.

6lujha,6,2017-07-07,Currently working abroad. Any tips or suggestions as to how I can have a job lined up for when I return to the US?,MisterFreeze29,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6lujha/currently_working_abroad_any_tips_or_suggestions/,"I apologize if this is the wrong sub for this sort of question, but I would appreciate any help you can give.  

The title says it all - I am working abroad and have been for the last year and a half.  I have been in China, working with students looking to study abroad in the US.  My current contract finishes in January 2018, and I am planning my exit strategy.  I would prefer to not have to move back with the parents and go through the long-winded unemployed job search.  If possible, I would love to have something lined up that I can start immediately when I return to the US (specifically, Chicago).

I am wondering if anyone has had any experience with a similar situation to mine, and if it would even be possible to try and accomplish what I am looking to do.  I moved out here a year and a half ago with one of my friends, and it has been an interesting experience, but I feel as if the career ladder in this profession isn't very high, and of course there are other reasons as to why I want to move back.  I will spare you all the details.

Not to make my time abroad seem better than it was, but I hope to utilize some of the skills I have acquired while abroad (namely conversational Chinese, and experience in a multi-cultural office).  I am only 2 years removed from college with a marketing degree, and I had some solid internships throughout college that are good padding for my resume.  I like the business work culture, but I also have found my current job to be rather rewarding and a unique experience.  What can I do to ensure an easy transition back to the states?  The challenge here is that I will not be available for an in-person interview nor a phone interview.  Skype is likely the only option.  I'm not asking, ""hey guys, find me a job!""  I'm just wondering how can I professionally get my resume noticed despite the fact that I am not physically in the country.

Also something to note:  I have lived in Shanghai, which is the most populated city on earth, and there's always things to do.  I feel as if living and working in the suburbs won't cut it for me at this point, so living and working in the city would be somewhat of a priority for me.  Thanks for your suggestions

6luphu,2,2017-07-07,"Me [24F] with ex bf [25M], I am still feeling very resentful after I broke up with him. What do I do?",ResentfulNeglect,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6luphu/me_24f_with_ex_bf_25m_i_am_still_feeling_very/,"My ex and I were together for two and a half years. The first  year was amazing, even after it turned long distance 8 months in when I moved away for a professional degree. Looking back now I realize there were already some warning signs for future behavior, but I remember being happy and so certain that we were an amazing match. I fell in love hard, we had amazing chemistry, both put in so much effort and loved being together every weekend or so. He had been applying for engineering jobs for 6 months after graduation when he finally got an offer in my city. We were so excited, but unfortunately a week before he moved, the company laid off hundreds of people, him included. This was the turning point, I am certain he became depressed and started to withdraw from me, which considering the circumstances, I understand, but he absolutely refused to think about it or consider getting help.

At this point I figured I had to step up and be a supportive gf, taking on the emotional load of our relationship while he struggled. I moved back home that summer for an internship and watched things crumble. We had been arguing about things so he ""wanted a break so we could get back together later"". I told him a break was a break up to me and he had to make a choice - he stayed. He told me I had to see a therapist to deal with my ""issues"" (anxiety, wanting to talk in a day, being hurt by the ""jokes"" he would say), so I did. I am glad I did, but I am not the only one who needed to work on things. He started to say ""jokes"" to me that bordered on verbal abuse, it eventually stopped after I told him how serious it was. He was condescending and arrogant and would always tell me ""you can tell me what you think I'm doing wrong, but I won't change anything unless I agree that your hurt feelings are rational"". I know I should have left then, but I stayed, justifying it under the thought that this was just his depression. Eventually, his lack of planning for our future, the constant feeling of me not being enough for him even though my friends adore me, and the lack of effort got to me, and I broke it off two months ago. 

Looking back, I don't think he ever respected me, he doesn't respect anyone else, so why would I be any different? I still see a lot of this as his immaturity and selfishness, still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. He always told me he loved me more than he ever thought possible, and he had the ability to be incredibly loving when he felt like it, but in the end, he didn't really treat me like he loved me that much. I would classify the last year and a half of our relationship as emotional neglect, and it ripped me apart. I lost myself in him, everything was driven by his wants, I stopped initiating sex because I was too scared of that rejection on top of everything else (though it was still often and I never said no). I had terrible self-esteem, anxiety, started to experience depression, but hid it from him, the long distance made it easy. I stopped respecting him (which I still feel guilty about), and I finally snapped and broke it off. I was tired of being treated like shit under a façade of promises and loving words. 

It's been two months and generally, I feel so much better. I don't want to get back together with him, I know I deserve more than that. But something inside me is still just so broken and angry and sad. I'm young and know there are others out there who will treat me properly, I'm not rushing in to anything new because I know I have to find myself again. But I still want him to regret how shitty he was to me. I want him to admit I was goddamn right for once and fix this, even though I know taking him back is not something I want to do. I know that none of these things are healthy thoughts and I want them gone, but I don't know how to get past this. I am so tired of still thinking of someone who broke my heart. I am so mad that I was open and vulnerable and tried my absolute hardest and still feel like I am hurting more than he is. I am mad at myself for putting up with this treatment for so long. If anyone has advice or kind words, please help. I am already keeping myself extremely busy and surrounded by friends, and am not moping around or obsessing over him. 


TLDR; BF of 2.5 years emotionally neglected me for a year and a half after an amazing first year. Please help me get over my anger and resentment

I got a 503 with a break down of (126/123/125/129). Obviously CARS killed me. This was the lowest score I have received, practice tests were consistently in the 507-509 range, and I was praying for that test push to pull me up to a 510-512. 

My GPA is very strong, and I have decent EC. I have an internship with NorthShore this summer, which is affiliated with Pritzker, and over 200 hours of community service, along with research. Also, I have held a job since first semester freshman year. Despite the rest of my app being strong I feel like I shouldn't apply this wave because I really want MD. I am from Illinois and would love to stay in state or consider a Florida school. Any advice/insight would be much appreciated.

I've been with Cerner for almost 3 years now in a technical role and I think it's about time to move on after review time.

I have a BS in Computer Science with a concentration on Software Engineering. I'm not 100% sure what I want to end up doing though. 

I will probably look for System Engineer or Software Engineer positions, but I would need a team that's willing to work with my limited exposure to real world coding. I have little experience and I pick up things fast, but in college I didn't take any software internships (I worked full time during college).

Are there any System/Software Engineer jobs where the training is good? I'm not necessarily talking about going through the Academy program, just a team willing to work with someone with less exposure than most. A team that's willing to give someone a few months before they throw them in any kind of ""sink or swim"" situation.

Thanks!"
6lvq28,13,2017-07-07,[OC] 2017 West Virginia Preview - Quarterbacks,wvufan44,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/6lvq28/oc_2017_west_virginia_preview_quarterbacks/,"**1st of a 10-part series previewing West Virginia’s football team ahead of the upcoming season**

&amp;nbsp;

We’re less than a month from camp, meaning it’s time to revive our ~~wildly~~ mildly successful preview series from last year. Parts 1-9 will again look at each of our position groups, starting with the quarterbacks and ending with the coaches, and attempt to grade them on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest. The 10th part will be a season preview where I’ll go through the schedule game by game and predict our final record. Off we go..

&amp;nbsp;

**THE BFG**

As in, “Billy Fuckin’ Grier”. It’s been a nervy 12 months or so wondering if Will would be eligible, but now that it’s official (Happy 154th West Virginia!) it’s time to get hype. Fair warning, reeling myself in and staying objective for this section is probably one of the 3 or 4 hardest things I’ve done in my life. Not that I wasn’t excited for Skyler last year, but I can talk myself into almost anything if you give me enough time.

&amp;nbsp;

This year though.. this is the first time in many moons that my cautious optimism has skewed more towards optimism than cautiousness with regards to our QB. Ye Mountaineer Faithful rejoice! Skyler’s Wild Ride is over, and we’ve officially entered the Willennium (I’m so sorry).

&amp;nbsp;

**The Good**

We’ve only seen Will play 6 games at the D1 level (or 7 if you count our Spring Game), but those 6 (or 7) games have provided more than enough evidence to convince me that he should be a pretty substantial upgrade over his predecessor in just about every conceivable way.

&amp;nbsp;

Let’s start with the arm. Grier completed 66% of his passes while at Florida, a number that he matched with his 12/18 performance in the Blue-Gold game. That’s not setting any records, but his ability to consistently put the ball in the right spots, especially in the short and intermediate areas, will be a welcome addition to our offense. Watch here how his ball placement creates the opportunity to run after the catch:

&amp;nbsp;

http://imgur.com/zQAV5v1

&amp;nbsp;

To show he’s still got it, here he is this spring again delivering the ball on-time and on-target, which again allows for some considerable YAC:

&amp;nbsp;

http://imgur.com/UBCPRMK

&amp;nbsp;

And one more. Note here how he drills the ball into his receiver’s body so that there’s no chance the defender can make a play:

&amp;nbsp;

http://imgur.com/Z1sMfsr

&amp;nbsp;

That’s phenomenal accuracy, but he also shows the arm strength to drive the ball downfield, with 14 of his 106 completions at Florida going for 20+ yards. Here he casually drops one into a bucket from the opposite hash:

&amp;nbsp;

http://imgur.com/MkxCnC9

&amp;nbsp;

And if necessary, he’s willing to stand in there and take a hit to do it:

&amp;nbsp;

http://imgur.com/7xktA5T

&amp;nbsp;

As for the athleticism, let’s not forget that he was evaluated by some outlets as a dual-threat QB coming out of high school. He only ran for 116 yards and a pair of scores in his 6 games at Florida, but flashed some impressive big-play ability with 7 of his 36 carries going for 10+ yards. He’s not a guy you’re going to call a ton of designed runs for, but moves around very well both inside and outside of the pocket:

&amp;nbsp;

http://imgur.com/t5QXDAW

&amp;nbsp;

The guy is straight galloping through that second level. He also appears to have great feel in the pocket, and trusts his instincts regarding when to step up and scramble:

&amp;nbsp;

http://imgur.com/l27JILK

&amp;nbsp;

More than enough to keep people honest, right?

&amp;nbsp;

Then there’s the intangibles.

&amp;nbsp;

*“He doesn’t have to act like he’s something special, he just is.” Kyle Bosch on Will Grier*

&amp;nbsp;

Skill set aside, it’s these kinds of quotes that have me really excited. It just seems like everybody loves the guy. A lot has been said about the 18-month lay-off and how it’s going to make him rusty or whatever, but I feel that’s completely ignoring the benefits that time has provided. Sure he hasn’t “played”, but he hasn’t been sitting on his ass either. If anything those 18 months have been like an internship, providing Grier the opportunity to learn the offense and build relationships with teammates away from the spotlight before taking the reigns full-time. Quotes like the one above show how much that behind-the-scenes stuff matters, and seeing the on-field chemistry he already has with his teammates reinforces it. Simply put, the guy seems like the kind of leader who makes others around him more confident just by being there. We haven’t had a guy with a presence like that since Pat White.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Bad**

Right now it’s hard to say. He wasn’t perfect at Florida by any means, but the mistakes he made are simply part of the learning process for young quarterbacks, and our own relationship with him is still so new that we haven’t seen any glaring red flags yet (I’m assuming there are some?).

&amp;nbsp;

**The Ugly**

Please. Dude has fully bought into that Mountaineer lifestyle, and the beard speaks for itself..

[The Beard](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Crc92XPUkAAdX4-.jpg)

&amp;nbsp;

**THE BACKUPS**

Right now the only backup is Chris Chuganov, though he’ll hopefully be joined shortly by David Israel. Israel I’ve not seen at all (though I’m sure we wanted him for some reason), but I know Chugs throws a pretty good ball when he’s not pooping his pants (which he’ll do from time to time). I know this sounds harsh, but neither of these guys give me much confidence that they’re ready to take over if something should happen.

&amp;nbsp;

**POSITION GRADE – 4.5/5**

So I guess I lied. I said I’d reeled myself in, yet here we are 1000 words of verbal fellatio and one Pat White comparison later. Best part is, I don’t feel bad about any of it. Will gives you everything you’d want in a QB – he’s accurate, has the arm to make all the throws, the legs to escape pressure and extend plays, and most importantly, the poise to make smart decisions under duress. There simply aren’t many guys that I’d rather have leading our team than BFG."
6lvuay,2,2017-07-07,I'm tired of not changing the world. Are you?,pitzahoy,cofounder,https://www.reddit.com/r/cofounder/comments/6lvuay/im_tired_of_not_changing_the_world_are_you/,"....A bit about what I am working on....

For the past year, I've tried to figure out a way to make a better search engine. Why is google designed one way for everyone? Why is it so hard to find a new desk that I want to put in my bedroom online? Why is the mobile version just a simple port over from from the desktop version? 

What's funny is that most people don't realize how horrible their search engine experience is sometimes. But after interviewing a hundred plus people it comes to light how many issues you can have when not looking for something basic. So I thought about how we could create something more streamlined, and user friendly. 

Then, it clicked. I had an idea to really figure out how to make a new search engine. With an entirely unique page ranking system. One which is transparent, optimized for every user, and with a great UI. I started working on this idea, and the general concept is actually the basis for a scholarly research paper being written at Carnegie Mellon. 

....what I am looking for....

While I have a tech background, my strong suit is really on the business side. I've put together a good go to market strategy (aka, a specific search engine, initially targeted at a specific set of products) which can grow to something bigger. I've figured out how to get paying customers. I've done hundreds of hours of research. Hundreds of hours of dreaming. But I really need someone to own the product. Figure out how to connect all the pieces and turn it into gold. Someone who can challenge my ideas and work with me to grow the shit out of this. There are similar, though much more basic, emerging products on the market. There are the biggest of all incumbents to challenge. But I've had enough experience to know that the right team can beat everything else out. I want to find that team. One with programming talent would be wonderful. Another with design / marketing talent would be wonderful. Or just a person who's going to work their ass off would be wonderful. 

One might think it would be easy to find someone at Carnegie Mellon to help out with this, but it's been surprisingly hard. I am working with a professor and have an intern, but haven't found anyone else with a real committed entrepreneurial sprit. 

....A bit about me....

I've grown and managed high growth teams in the past.
I am a resident at a venture capital firm and am good at making necessary connections.
I have some growth hacking experience. 
I am currently getting my MBA in entrepreneurship, don't need a salary, and am focusing most of my time on this. 
I am willing to go in crazy debt to fuel this idea. Not because I like debt, but because I am willing to bet on myself.
I work really hard. 

....In summary....

I hope that I am not coming off as boastful, but really just want to show my commitment to work on something that could be big. If you are willing to work on something hard, learn along the way, fail a few times, and keep on going - let me know. 

Send me a direct message. I'd love to connect to get your thoughts. And you know, change the world."

&amp;nbsp;

Notable trivia about this episode:

* ""*This was the final episode made in season two. Co-creator Larry David thought the show was going to be cancelled, so he decided to end it with Jerry and Elaine back together as a couple, which is what NBC executives had been asking for. Ironically, NBC showed the final four episodes of the second season out of order. This episode was fourth from the last, so the final three episodes, having been made before this one, made no reference to Jerry and Elaine as boyfriend and girlfriend. And after the show was picked up for a third year, no further reference was made to Jerry and Elaine and their one episode reunion.*"" (from IMDB)

&amp;nbsp;

Other:

* A bit of foreshadowing? ""I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate."" - George

* Cake is mentioned in this episode, but was referenced in a previous episode and thus already appears on the Food/drink list

* If you haven't yet checked out the [Seincast podcast](http://seincast.libsyn.com/), it's almost a must-listen for any Seinfeld diehard

&amp;nbsp;

6lwgs8,6,2017-07-07,Hiring managers should be entirely replaced by computers for software development positions for companies with more than 10 employees.,sirtophat,mylittleandysonic1,https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittleandysonic1/comments/6lwgs8/hiring_managers_should_be_entirely_replaced_by/,"Programming hiring managers as a whole are too petty and irrational to do their job properly. I wish a large union or something would form and correct the hiring process. In any kind of merit based system I'd have had a job by now but of course hiring managers are probably finding some ridiculous problems with my resume like the font choice or the order the fields are listed in or something else equally stupid - this is what I've heard they're like online and my personal experience seems to confirm it, since as a recent graduate with well above-average experience and an internship on my resume I should've at least gotten an interview by now.

The optimal hiring system would be that when you apply to a company that has open positions, the hiring program blindly evaluates your experience solely on how well it fits the criteria put forth by the company (with your experience having been validated by some kind of certification authority ran by the aforementioned union), so that there's no possibility of bias from unfit hiring managers due to your resume's formatting or your gender/race/socioeconomic background which are all too common. The program would pick from the most qualified candidates randomly, or if less than three were the most qualified, pick randomly from the top 3 most qualified, so that people with less experience get to actually have a chance instead of hopelessly jobhunting forever as it is now - it could even occasionally pick one of the middle-qualified ones for this purpose. If the company has to train the candidate a bit then good, that's how it used to be and companies need to stop being able to get a free ride only selecting candidates with 10 years experience in everything on their wishlist. No interviews obviously, hiring is finalized on the computer's decision. Firing would only be able to happen through proof submitted to the union of unacceptable performance and all that other good stuff that comes with unions, no unpaid overtime etc. 

Unrealistic but I wish this was how it was. Back in the day strong unions made things fair for working people who had spent years of their life training. I'm tired of having to struggle to find any company even willing to give me an interview in this stupid industry I was memed into spending years of my life on. At this rate I'll probably end up working at McDonald's while still living with my parents to pay off my student loans and never be able to move out. If you're picking a major my advice is to stay far away from anything computer related, it's too flooded with new graduates like me and there are too many cheap overseas programming mills. Years of experience on high-profile online software projects with others, my own pretty good side projects that I've had a history of working on since the 8th grade, an internship, a 3.65 GPA, none of it seems to matter because I'm not friends with or related to the hiring managers and I haven't started two startups that got acquired by Google and Microsoft respectively by the time I graduated."

&amp;nbsp;

****************
&amp;nbsp;

The first week of July 2017 started off well. When July came, it translated to one complete month of absolute NC; I deleted her number, deleted our past messages, blocked communication channels and put in the conscious effort of moving on. I was feeling better with each passing day now, I am much, much better than I was in day 1. Then...this happened.

&amp;nbsp;
****************
&amp;nbsp;

The time now is 2 hours past midnight of what was supposed to be a delightful Friday; I had a wonderful lunch with my colleagues and of course, TGIF. I get to leave work early just now and when I reached my home area, I strolled into the nearby mall happily because I wanted to get a snack.

Just seconds after I entered the mall, I came across a booth. At first glance, it was one of those booths where bank employees are planted to gain potential customers. Before I get to turn my attention away from the area, there she was.

***Our eyes met.*** 

She put on what seemed to be a sheepish smile. Her body language seemed to indicate that she was conflicted as to whether she should continue facing me, or to turn her back on me and pretend like she did not see me. In that same moment, I had to make a decision as our eyes continued to meet: do I take out my earphones and say hi, or just smile and simply walk away?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Me:** Hey. (*I smiled*)

&gt;**Her:** Hey. (*She smiled*)

&gt;**Me:** Why are you here?

&gt;**Her:** Cause I'm stationed here...?

&gt;**Me:** Ah. I see....How are you?

&gt;**Her:** (*short pause*)......(*she continued smiling sheepishly*)

&gt;**Me:** How are you doing?

&gt;**Her:** ...I now work 7 days a week.

&gt;**Me:** Oh wow...Yeah. I've heard about that from people in your line of work.

&gt;**Her:** My boss is here so...

&gt;**Me:** Ah okay. Take care.

&amp;nbsp;

She stepped back and I turned by body away to ride down the escalator nearby, without looking back at all. At that moment, I knew little of what to do or feel other than putting my earphones back on. For a moment as I was riding down that escalator, I felt the intense waves coming back. But then, it was only for that moment. That moment passed and I...smiled to myself. Because it doesn't hurt as much anymore, and I find that to be amusing.

However, while I had this small triumph to pat myself on the back for, there was something that made my heart flutter.

As I looked into her eyes during that short conversation, I noticed them being teary. As much as I wanted that image to be conceived by my imagination, those eyes were too familiar to me; I have seen those eyes in the most intense and saddest of moments. A great deal of time is needed for me to forget those eyes. Those eyes that I have come to look into as though she was my entire world and nothing else mattered as much. Perhaps she was not prepared to see me and it proved too much for her to conceal her emotions. A part of me tells me that it was saddening for her to see me, that it was bittersweet. And if I were to follow my deep instincts, I would have hugged her to tell her that everything will be okay. Another part of me however reminded me of what she said before I went full NC: 

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;*""You said you wanted to be alone. Why did you get attached to him? How do you move on so fast?""*

&gt;*""I wanted to be alone from YOU.""*

&amp;nbsp;

I have respected her wishes and decision. 

I intend to continue doing so.

&amp;nbsp;
*********************

&amp;nbsp;

Hi guys. I hope everyone is doing better than yesterday. I know it's hard. I am sure it's hard. However, I am here today to just pen down some of my thoughts and perspectives that I have gained from the past few months, but especially the past 30+ days of NC.

Before that, let me share an excerpt of my story. The story of how my first love ceased to exist.

&amp;nbsp;

After **9 months** of commitment on my part and falling in love with this girl, she broke my heart last September by admitting that she couldn't see a future with me. That reason was a rationale one but we were still in love. We still hung out after, sometimes like a couple still, but lacking the commitment and there was a void that we both seemed to ignore. Come December, she even said she loved me, when I was there for her in face of life's troubles. The new year came and she decided that she couldn't reply back: *""I love you too.""*

Then **April** came, she said she wanted to be alone, to find her own strength, to seek for independence. I went on to respect that decision, believing that she needed time to be alone to rediscover about her own self.

31st **May** came, and I found out through text that she has been dating a guy for one month. Not just any guy. A guy that actually pursued her even when we were still together, and he knew about us being together. 

Vulnerability, as it turns out is a low-balled requirement of loving someone. You are in fact required to be near suicidal to fall in love with someone. The pain was seemingly insurmountable. That moment when I learned she has moved on and replaced me, especially with that guy, was soul-crushing. I threw away the last thread that I was hanging on to by asking her to give 'us' one last chance. But she said no. It was wrong of me to ask that from her when she's attached to another guy, but like I said, that was my last thread. The evening of that same day I went to her place to deliver a letter that I have long prepared for her and some other things that would together be construed as a closure for me. She was not there to receive it but an hour after I dropped the stuff off, she texted informing me that she has received them. I said my last goodbyes and well wishes while she said she would continue supporting me as a friend. I knew I couldn't bear to remain being friends with her; I went on to block her from every single communication channel and deleted her number. She could not remain in my life anymore or at least for the time being. This, all of this, was 31st May.

&amp;nbsp;

**June** said hi. I said hi back with such low energy but I was excited to welcome it.

Now, if I were to give June a chapter title, it would be titled: ***The Magic of NC***

&amp;nbsp;
**********************

&amp;nbsp;

The following are things that I have learned or come to find out in just 30+ days that I **fully committed to NC**:

1. When I decided to do NC, I had to establish with myself that it was mostly for **my own healing** and **NOT** to make my ex miss me and create any sense of hope for reconciliation. **MOVE. ON. DON'T. TURN. BACK.** You can look back at the relationship but for the purpose of doing meaningful reflections in hopes of improving yourself so that you can be a better person in the future. And personally, I would like my future partner to not have the trouble of harbouring any insecurities resulting from any relationship I have with my ex.

2. NC immensely help you in getting rid of those chemicals that are associated with making [us addicted to our ex](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-mindful-self-express/201603/is-your-brain-breakup). The first week of NC, I think about my ex almost every single minute. For the following weeks, however, I think about her lesser and lesser. Huge contributing factor for this is being occupied with productive activities for my own self-improvement. 

3. For the first week, when my friends presented me with the thought of eventually moving on to another lady, another partner, it was inconceivable. I couldn't even find any other females attractive! It was hard for me to imagine another female being in my life in that special way. Now, after 4 weeks, it is way easier for me to think about dating again. But first, I have to put in my own work: invest in myself and being able to be happy alone. I think you have to be comfortable in being alone first, before you can welcome a person into your life in a special way.

4. Throughout the 4 weeks of this tough period, by the grace of a higher power, I managed to sow the benefits resulting from the time and effort I have put into investing in myself. One of the highlights was that I got into the finals of a national competition that would greatly benefit me in my dream career. I worked hard for this competition as I was going through the on and off relationship. So, this serves as a reminder to myself and other people that throughout one's life, one of the constants should be your will to invest in yourself always. Because this is one of the best ways to love yourself.

5. I was very much elated to know that my friends were there for me when I'm at my lowest point. But this was because I did not neglect them totally when I was happily attached. So another note to self: don't ever neglect the ones who would be there for you when things get rough. An understanding partner would not disallow you from spending quality time with the other people that also matters, those people were in fact there for you before your SO came into your life.

6. Building new connections helps a lot in making your life less miserable. I started a new internship on my first day of NC and since then, I got myself very involved with the activities in my workplace and the people around. In having new connections being made, you'll find the relevancy of your ex's existence to be diminishing as time goes by. What's wrong with that? My ex didn't want me around anymore so it shouldn't matter much that I care less and less about her.

So in conclusion, **NC does work**! However, you have to put in a lot of conscious effort to reap its true benefits. I however am not gonna lie that I still have plenty of recovering to do. But relative to how I was during the first day of NC, I am in a much better place. Some of you perhaps might be skeptical in having known that this is only 30+ days of NC and that my relationship might be shorter than yours. But during these 30+ days I did a lot of stuff to work on myself. It was immensely tough. As for the duration of the relationship, despite its length, me and my ex went through some real life issues, especially her, and I committed to her greatly. However, things did not work out and I was devastated. What more, she was my first girlfriend. I have plenty to learn still. These are just my own perspectives and if you resonate with it or you find it helpful, I am glad for that.

**NC works, but YOU have to put in work for it.**

I hope each and everyone of you get to be closer to happiness with each passing day. All the best to you all. "
6lx9pz,11,2017-07-07,How to NGAF properly,bassmentproject,howtonotgiveafuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/6lx9pz/how_to_ngaf_properly/,"This is an inspiration and a thank-you post for /r/howtonotgiveafuck community.

I've discovered /r/howtonotgiveafuck relatively recently. I don't even know what it was how I've got here - probably just one of thousand attempts of googling on how to fix your life or something. And man, am I glad that I found this place. I feel like a lot of people don't really understand the concept, or twist it to extremes. Anyways, just my opinon. I would like to share a story, and piece of my mind of what I'm going through and how to deal with it.

Special thanks to Sal Moretta aka Well Rounded, his videos are really something that gets so little appreciation. One significant lesson I've learned from it is the way to handle your emotions. Emotional is what makes you **you**, and there is nothing you can do about it. You could say your emotions and ways of expressing them is your *soul*. I don't believe that soul is something you can touch, but rather what is inside you, you are your own God. And there is something really wrong with suppressing them, I tell you as someone who used to do this alot, and learned not to; which, in return, turned me into alive person. When we feel our emotions, that's when we are truly *alive*. And I'm talking about genuine and deep emotions - like love, or sadness. Love, not crush. Crush is shallow emotion - try to break it down to dig into the core of it, and you won't really understand any real meaning behind it. Just hormones and endorphins and all this stuff.

I'm used to be someone who'd crush really easily. Several times, it brought me nothing but pain and misery. It's really like doing drugs - you get your kicks, but there is no explanation and/or logical conclusion behind it. It just happens, if you want it or not. I tell you what, guys, it really does worth it to wait for *the one*, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Yeah, we are humans are not monogamous, but i you throw away biological aspect of wanting to spread your seed, what will you get in result? Someone who cares about you and shares your inner world, a soulmate. Not only someone you just have sex with. Yes, sex is important, but it's only one half of what it is if you would like your relationship to succeed. It's the act of supporting of each other, and treating your significant other as a **person** in the first place. A person with their own visions of the world, their own dreams. You don't ""own"" each other. It's more like a union. All the love you give - you do it because you want to, and because it feels nice. It feels nice to make each other happy. And sometimes, happiness of the simple fact of being together is not enough. As I heard frequently said here - if you want to make someone else happy, *be happy yourself first*. And it's true. I see where this is coming from. It's the internal piece you achieve when you are happy with yourself. Happy with your own skin and emotions. Happy with the way your life goes. You can't help but spread all your positive feelings with your loved ones. This is really how it works.

So to speak, that's exactly how I've got into relationship. The bonding factor was that openness from the beginning. It never happened to me before, and really, at all. Thanks to my seeking self-help abilities, I've found this community and other content creators that somehow resonated with me. Discovering HTNGAF psychology was one of the milestones in my life, that helped me to keep my shit together, piece by piece. I've been lurker here for long enough to see it become a place for inspirational posts. Oh well.

Anyways, it's been time long enough that I've spent my life with this person. Long enough for me, and my current life situation (living in a foreign country). She is a foreigner, too, and if you never been living in a foreign country, you would never know what it is like to have friends based on exact same visa situation as you have. Maybe it's fear that keeps us together, but who cares? Yeah, not being born in Europe or other Americas kinda sucks. But hey, that's what makes it so special - the struggle of living the life on harder difficulty than local people. I would advice you to experience this, definitely a life changer. Heh.

Time flies. And here we are - two independent people, living together, doing their own thing while providing emotional support to each other. That's exactly what I've imagined love to be! This hard work on yourself it pays off eventually - you see how people around you start to change, when you start to change. This is just how world works. Here we are, chasing our dreams together, but independently. She is into fashion, and I'm into electronic music. We are both getting somewhere, I guess internships in those instead of what we are studying in uni tells that something is right.

And then here's that moment. Someone is getting closer, incredibly closer. And you are really proud of them, with all your heart. But it's also an obstacle. An obstacle of physical closeness. When your next step is just right in front of you, you wouldn't think much. Especially when you are in 20's. Life has only just began, really. You can't keep the person you deeply care about forcefully physically close to you. Even if the amount of time you will spend separately together is unknown. No dates, no nothing. It could be just a month or two, or it easily become a year. Nobody knows. But you have no right to decide what is better for them. You let go. You let the sadness come through, and it makes you visibly sad. But hey, what have we talked about emotions earlier? They exist separately. They are what they are. Raw and unfiltered feelings. And the only thing you can do about it is just to *let them be*. Sound really boring and generic, but it's true. All you can do is just ponder on them, and make your own conclusions how you'd react. Would you let your subconscious take over? Or would you rather have a control over your life? Experiencing this just confirms one more time that I've chosen the right person. But, they are not my property. They are a person, just like I am. All that is left to be done is just wait, and watch the life unfold - through all the emotional pain it might give. This is what NGAF is about - I don't give a fuck if I want this person to be close to me, because I respect them. It would be just a wrong thing to do. Yet, somewhere deep inside of my imagination, so right.

I expect nothing. Maybe it will last for a short time, and I'm writing all this for nothing. Or, maybe it will get an unexpected turn to go deeper. Maybe you will laugh after reading this, or be understanding, or make your own conclusions. Live your life right, and right things will happen. Or so I choose to believe.

Yes, it's my first time being in a relationship. I'm also a little bit  high. Thanks for reading."
6lxbew,1,2017-07-07,The Five Sins of Hiring,silverwolfer,silvernotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/silvernotes/comments/6lxbew/the_five_sins_of_hiring/,"**1. Taking too long to decide**

Too many companies can extend interviews to as much as 4 or 6 times. Prolonging a hiring process that started April and deciding to hire someone in June.   Having a overlong hiring process not only puts a drain on your internal resources, but also can let talent slip through fingers by companies who can make a decision within 3 interviews.  You also put a drain on those applying uncertain of your decision making, often going with companies who decide to hire them in a reasonable time.  2 to 5 weeks is the reasonable range for job posting to onboarding. 


**2. Confusing Adequate with Insultingly Low**


Many businesses have to choose between the cost of stellar talent and just competent. Sadly many confuse competent with insulating low.  The mistake happens often with folks not realizing how much a field gets paid and not doing proper research (folks glass door exists use it already).  The other end of the stick is folks who knowingly under hire.  Yes the folks who decide to have a intern do the tasks of a senior programmer stick out like a sore thumb. 

**3. Not knowing how to phrase what you are looking for**

For prime examples of this, visit /r/recruitinghell .  More than 25% of job posting I would say just don't know what they are looking for or lack the experience of what to ask.  Being concise, clear, and in control will show you exactly the type of talent you are looking for.    Another sin is folks who hide the job duties.  Hiring for an entry level of something and slamming them with senior level duties is a sure way of hurting your company in the long run. 

**4. Stick with a Few Good Recruiters**

Stick with 5 or 7 Recruiter groups or firms that get you what you need. The last thing you need is having 50 some odd recruiters from who knows what end of the country cold calling anything that knows how to breathe.  Not only does this set you up with wasted interviews, but also a bad taste in workers mouth if the recruiters you are using come up shady. 


**5. Sink or Swim**

Throwing your worker in the deep end to see if it works out is a horrible modern method.  With all the resources needed these days to bring in real talent, risking it by such a sloppy onboarding method means you may have lost out on real progress.    Having a proper onboarding method when it comes with training, senior staff mentorship and clearly going over expectations can make all the difference between having a motivated worker and one who drowns.

January 20, 2017 

Inauguration Day.

A very cold day in America. 

It's late January, so naturally there will be a chill in he air. the wind will whip through the crowds gathered in front of the U.S. Capitol building. However, the throngs gathered for this historic occasion will not be bothered by the cold. The true faithful wouldn't miss this for the world. They've waited for this day for a long time. They've marched, they've chanted, they've occupied, from college campuses to urban centers, just to make this possible. Today the foot soldiers of the American Leftist movement will gain their triumph. Today, Hillary Rodham Clinton will take the oath of office as the forty-fifth President of the United States. 

On the stage with Clinton are the cast of characters who will make up her administration. There's her husband, former President Bill Clinton-welfare reformer and signer of the Defense of Marriage Act, he's easily the most conservative person on the platform. All he can think about, of course, is getting back into the White House, his old stomping grounds. He tries to remember if the interns start arriving on Day One. He hopes so. The sooner the better. His role in this administration will be mostly ceremonial-a few speeches here and there, a charm offensive ready for deployment when needed. He'll have a few official duties, and plenty of time for his own extracurricular activities.

Seated nearby is another familiar face: Al Gore. Once Bill Clinton's Vice President, he's returning now as the Secretary of Energy. The man who made a career out of scolding Americans for their use of evil fossil fuels-while keeping his motorcade idling outside during his speeches-will finally be able to make his environmental dreams into a reality. 

Another Al isn't far away: Al Sharpton, longtime activist for ""social justice"" and failed MSNBC TV host. The American public never quite caught on to the Reverend Al's unique blend of shameless self-promotion and race-baiting on MSNBC-his ratings were always terrible-but his politics line up nicely with the new President's, and he was a loyal mouthpiece on the campaign tail. So, he's has been rewarded with the post of Secretary of Education. And his job is about to get a lot bigger. 

Also on the stage is a man whose presence at this occasion would have seemed unthinkable six months ago-but that's politics. He is former Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the committed ""Democratic socialist"" who ended up giving Hillary Clinton a run for her money in the Democratic primary. Despite being in his seventies-only a few years older than the new President-Sanders is revered by many as the fresh face of a resurgent American brand of Socialism., which was firmly embraced by the new commander in chief in her drive to win at all costs. Officially, Sander's role in the new administration will be fixing ""income inequality""-by any means necessary. However, the well-known friend to socialists around the world-who took his wife to the former Soviet Union for their honeymoon-is expected to advise Clinton on foreign policy matters as well, especially on how the United States can integrate more fully into worldwide collectivist movements.

President Hillary Cilinton's inaugural address will be a rousing one. As the masses listen below and watch on televisions around the globe, she will spell out her agenda for America's long march into the twenty first century. She will not speak of American leadership on the world stage-not even ""leading from behind"" as President Obama put it-but of simple ""participation"" in world affairs. We will end war, she proclaims to thundering cheers, by taking American out of the business of shaping the world's destiny. After all, the new President will remind us, what right have we to tell other countries what to do when our own situation is so flawed? Ironically, in years past it was Hillary Clinton who led President Obama to topple secular dictators in the Middle East in favor of radical Islamic leadership.

She will then proceed to remind us all the social ills that plague our fellow Americans-poverty, homelessness, stagnant wages, inflating health-care costs. She will waste no time pointing out that these are all the fault of the greedy, heartless corporations that have controlled business and politics in this country for far too long. In another carefully delivered applause line, President Clinton will remind her audience that she's in office now in order to make sure the evil corporations *pay* for what they've done-in every sense of the word. 

She promises the audience at her inauguration a brand-new era- an era without uncertainty, an era without risk, an era of absolute fairness and equity. The gap between rich and poor in America will no longer be bridged, she says, but the two sides of the canyon will be shoved back together. The seas will be un-parted. No American will be left wondering why their neighbor seems to have more than they do. 

The crowd hangs on every word, and cheers for every promise. This made all the ""safe space"" demonstrations and Occupy protests worth is. This is what they'd been fighting for. This is what generations of Leftists before them had been fighting  for. President Hillary Clinton has shown them the mountaintop-but what does the path to the summit of socialism look like?


**TWO MONTHS LATER**

Two months after the inauguration, we start to see out first glimpses down the path. College students, back from their winter break and the exhilaration of the inaugural ceremonies, notice that things are a bit different on campus in the new Clinton era. College activists were the vanguard of the Clinton campaign army. While many campuses were divided between Hillary and Bernie Sanders in the primary, the #FeeltheBern crows was soon won over once Clinton clinched the nomination and vowed to embrace her onetime competitor's unapologetic brand of ""Democratic Socialism.""

The Clinton team has rewarded their collegiate foot soldiers with some changes for which they have long clamored. One of the first acts of Al Sharpton's Department of Education, which has dramatically increased its involvement with higher education institutions, is that ""safe space"" doctrines are now required on all American college campuses. Any speech that has the slightest possibility to offend another person is confined to certain ""Free Speech Zones"" in public areas or during certain programs. Speaking your mind outside of these areas will be classified as ""microaggression"" and result in disciplinary action from the school and referral for prosecution in a court of law. This goes for students and professors alike, and anybody on campus can be brought up in front of student-run tribunals on charges of violating the ""safe space"" of another individual or of the university in general.

The goal is clear: to remake the American system of higher education into a breeding ground for future guardians of political correctness. It's no longer about learning, about challenging yourself to think. No longer are American students expected (or encouraged) to live up to F. Scott Fitzgerald's definition of intelligence-""the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."" There's only room for one set of ideas in the American mind now-the politically correct ones. And there's no room for F. Scott Fitzgerald, either, for that matter. All he did was write about rich people. 

This new American education will start even earlier than college. In public schools, from kindergarten classrooms on up, the United Nations flag is now placed side by side with that of the United States. There is no more Pledge of Allegiance. Not only is it deemed exclusionary to the increasing number of kids born elsewhere, but it sends the wrong message. American children should now think of themselves first and foremost as ""citizens of the world,"" and as Americans second.

Even those in the older generations, well out of school, will have no problem getting access to the ""right"" information. More accurately, they won't have a choice. In just the first few months of the Clinton administration, the American news media has already undergone a dramatic transformation. During the campaign, it was clear that every major news outlet-with some exceptions of center-right media-were unabashedly in the tank for Clinton. They weren't just drinking the kool-aid, they were swimming in it.

After her election, it was decided that her cheer leading networks should simply drop the whole ""impartial"" act entirely. Why continue the charade of denying the reality of their bias when they can just join the May Day parade already? In the interest of ""fairness"" and ""progress,"" mainstream media organizations consolidate themselves in a series of mergers, initiated and overseen by the government. The government then takes over combined entities to create a single state propaganda mouthpiece, under the now greatly expanded authority of the Federal Communications Commission. 

This takes so much guesswork out of the equation for consumers. This way, they won't have to worry about conflicting perspectives. They can go to once place for all the news their benevolent Uncle Sam (or Aunt Hillary) deems fit to print. All the information is handpicked, vetted, and curated to suit the needs of the people-and their government.

Whose perspectives *do* get airtime under the new regime? Since all legal media i now effectively government media, many of the new ""media personalities"" are in fact government officials. 

Some high-profile members of the Clinton cabinet host their own shows. Bernie Sanders gives ""inspiring"" lectures on the evils of pay gaps every Saturday and Sunday-*Weekends with Bernie*, they call the series. Al Gore's 2006 environmental horror flick *An Inconvenient Truth* is shown frequently, with new commentary and interviews by the Secretary of Energy himself included to bring modern viewers up to date. Most kids will have seen the original-it will be required viewing in schools. 

Schoolchildren, too, will be treated to frequent addresses by Education Secretary Sharpton, who also is back on afternoon television with educational shows that are *strongly recommended* for after-school viewing. Sometimes the Revered Secretary will bring in special guests, like Professor (and former domestic terrorist) Bill Ayers to present his special *10-Part History of the United States*. Grab the kids-it's ""edutainment"" for the whole family!

Not only will everyone hear more from government officials, but we will hear more from the President herself. Between traditional media, which has now gone completely over to her side, and social media-where the White House bully pulpit carries a lot of weight among followers-we hear something from or about President Hillary Clinton every single day, on multiple occasions.

There's a calculated reason for this constant intrusion. Team Clinton wants us to get used to hearing from them as much as possible. Soon, Hillary and her advisers will  be more than just government officials making pronouncements. They'll become trusted friends, and whatever message they're spouting will be immediately accepted by viewers More than that, consumers will welcome the idea of people from the government frequently beaming into their lives to discuss some matter of no doubt vital national importance. That makes eventual government involvement, and further government control, therefore seem necessary 

One of the many uses for a propaganda apparatus is the fomentation of crisis. And as veteran Leftist operative Rahm Emmanuel said, ""Never let a crisis go to waste."" Early in her administration, President Hillary Clinton invents a crisis in order to achieve a longtime liberal policy goal. She declares that gun violence is a national emergency that threatens us all, and sets the Department of Homeland Security to the task of confiscating all firearms from law-abiding Americans until the ""problem"" is solved. The National Rifle Association is deemed a hate-mongering organization, and their Virginia headquarters is raided by federal agents. Yet the government is careful to point out that this is not a permanent ""gun grab."" Citizens deemed trustworthy and obedient by the federal government may be able to get their guns back once the government determines the ""crisis"" is over, which will be sometime between now and never. 

With the guns out of the way, the process of radical wealth redistribution begins. President Clinton made sure in her inaugural address to remind American entrepreneurs  that they didn't achieve hard-earned success on their own, and her Treasury Secretary, Bernie Sanders, soon tells them it's time to spread the wealth around. A national minimum wage hike is put into effect, with no recourse for the small businesses forced to close by the new policy. Even entrepreneurs personal property is not safe; it's been deemed that some of them have ""too much."" That vacation home you spent your whole life working and saving for? You don't need that-time to turn it over to the state.

The federal government may also come after your car, but for a different reason. Energy Secretary Gore's department has been given sweeping new powers, and he's tossing vehicles off the road left and right. The SUV that you load up to take your kids to soccer (Stenographer note: Fuck your kids soccer SUV) practice? It's been outlawed by the Environmental Protection Agency. You'll be provided with a voucher to exchange it for a hybrid, a cash rebate for a bicycle, or coupons to use on public transportation-your choice.

When none of these initiative seem to be solving the unemployment crisis in America-and are even starting to make it worse-President Clinton turns to a solution that is as simple as it is elegant. It addresses the most glaring problem with one of the Left's pet issues: political correctness. Unemployed Millennials and former Occupy activists-the people who got Clinton elected-are put to work under a new Homeland Security program designed to police hate speech. Any language deemed to be racist, sexist, or seen to promote inequality, patriarchy, and white privilege will now be punishable under the law. Citizens are encouraged to report any conversations or symbols that might trigger them. Power to decide what constitutes hate speech is delegated to a rotating council of Left-wing academics appointed by the President, and their powers are enforced by the roving gangs of activist thugs who were until recently unemployed. Their zeal for political correctness is such that it makes Mao's Red Guard look like a church youth group. 

When these gangs start raiding the homes and businesses of anyone they think has offended someone else, when non-regime-approved journalists are forced to broadcast in secret, when personal property is simply confiscated for violating new riles, people will start to look around at some point and start to wonder where it all began. It began on Inauguration Day, 2017, compared to the chilling effect on out freedom brought about by the rise of socialism. "

I have the equivalent education of an associate's in Computer Science, but the rest is all learned outside of school. I'm now getting professional help for my anxiety, and have been doing great. Through friends who know me, I was able to interview and then get an internship at a fantastic and good sized company, where I have been for the past 5 months, and I'm doing very well according to my boss and my boss's boss. I asked if they thought I was hire-able as a full-time employee, and was told that while they weren't in charge of that, they would love to have me. My skillset includes Java, javascript, jsp, mongo, Spring, and Magnolia, and I have been doing work above intern level to the point where even some of the releases were mostly (or in one case purely) my work, albeit most of it were bug fixes and only a few new features. At this point, I am performing very well, am dealing with my anxiety, will be returning to school in the fall part time while I work full time, and everything seems to be on the up and up.

The problem? My pay. My internship was supposed to end in August, but they want to now extend it with a pay bump from $10/hr to $12/hr. This is well below my value, and as an intern I'll remain a 1099 with no benefits instead of a W-2 with benefits. I have asked if there were any full-time openings and been told no. According to my coworkers who are not in charge of my pay, I'm basically being paid slave labor for good quality work, and should be worth $50-60k annual salary at this point, with plenty of potential for more. Going by salary aggregators, this also fits even with my current lack of a degree and minimal (5 months) experience. Also, given how well I've been doing, I feel like average is an underestimation, but I'm not going to push my luck.

Long-term, I need to continue school and get my degree, and working while attending school keeps me on track (social anxiety, work is easy, school is hard). I also like my co-workers, the work atmosphere, and everything except the pay. It just doesn't seem right considering the quality of work I am contributing. There weren't even any pay negotiations, just a ""Do you want to extend your internship? I'll also request for a pay raise from HR."" The pay raise amount wasn't disclosed until after the request was put in, but I was assuming at least $15-20 given the circumstances. The date of this conversation was yesterday. Does anyone have any advice for how to proceed? I'm currently learning towards accepting the offer while looking for work elsewhere, but then I'll be leaving a lot of my friends, and these are the friends who helped give me a chance in the first place by getting me an interview. I'm just torn. I can get by on 12/hr if I continue my living style, which is extremely frugal yet leaves me little disposable or savings at all. However I'd rather earn an actual living. Plus, costs are going up when I return to school as even though I'll be attending a public state university with in-state tuition, it's still not free and I won't qualify for Pell with the coursework I'll be taking."
6lyxth,9,2017-07-08,My Thoughts on Spider-Man: Homecoming (Spoilers),MSRiverKings,moviereviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviereviews/comments/6lyxth/my_thoughts_on_spiderman_homecoming_spoilers/,"The opening dialogue of the film, after the title card, clearly establishes this film's purpose. Vulture: ""When I was young we used to play cowboys and indians."" BetaWhiteMale: ""They are called Native Americans now."" This film wasn't made to accurately and respectfully adapt a storied and iconic comic book character, it wasn't even to tell a great Spider-Man story, it's sole purpose was to push political and social agenda through a popular medium. It really reminds me of Ghostbusters (2016) in that way.

It's called Spider-man: Homecoming, but the homecoming dance is only on screen for 5 seconds and has nothing to do with the film's plot. It's obvious they just used the title to signify Spider-man was ""coming home"" to the MCU. We do see a lot of Peter's high school. It's supposed to be a public school in Queens, but looks nicer than any private school in the country, at least on the outside. The school is a diverse utopian wet-dream where everyone is any color but white and all the smartest, best students are black and brown. There are male and female homosexuals, trans, every person of every race, etc.

It's darker than a Tyler Perry film. 95% of actors and extras are non-white. I live in NYC and there are definitely a lot of brown people, but there are tons of white people as well. There are only about 5-6 white men in this movie and each one is either an extreme beta-male, a cuck, extremely dumb, a criminal, or an outright fag (except Tony Stark). There are even less white women including Aunt May, Pepper Potts, the mousy friend of Peter's love interest, and some white lesbians at the homecoming dance together in the background.

**Peter** is a bumbling, clumsy, beta-male in that he's everyone's bitch. He's bossed around by Tony, Happy, Aunt May, his teachers, by his fellow students, his friends. He's constantly fucking up everything. He's not really a nerd, a social outcast or an unassuming loner. He seems well known at his school. Everyone thinks he was given some ""Stark Internship"" where he goes and does science-y things, but it's just a cover for his vigilante crime-fighting. He's not the most popular kid in school, but all of the popular kids are involved in the same clubs and activities as him. They run in the same social circles and go to the same parties. The popular girl in school likes Peter and is his date to the homecoming dance and Peter himself is good looking. It's not the Peter Parker you are used to from the comics. Like a lot of things in this film, Peter's social status is inconsistent and ill-defined.

Everyone tells Peter how super smart he is and he does wears a lot of science t-shirts, but he's not smart and does nothing to prove otherwise. He has no particular love or aptitude for any science or engineering. He's not even curious about things in general. He doesn't investigate his own powers, his parent's death, Uncle Ben's death, how he got his powers. He's not tinkering with or testing his web. He doesn't work on his fighting abilities and does not try to refine his technique or figure out different ways to use his web in different situations. He doesn't build gadgets or conduct experiments. He doesn't create his suit or modify the suit Tony gave him, which you would expect Peter Parker to do. He makes his own web (with chemicals given to him in his high school chemistry class) and web cartridges, but it's not clear if he came up with the web formula or designed the cartridges or the shooters himself. I assume Tony Stark created it all for him because Tony Stark created the suit which had all sorts of different types of web, web shooters, web devices built into it. Even if Peter did create the web, Tony made it 100x better. Peter is essentially wearing an Inspector Gadget/Iron Man suit that he doesn't know how to use. He is overwhelmed by the technology for comedic purposes even though it was made so user-friendly retards could operate it. I guess this is just another dig at Peter. Another way to show he is a beta-male, bitch boy. He can't even properly work his suit. 

He's not witty or a smart-ass when he is Spider-man. He makes dumb decisions constantly, whether in a fight or talking to adults/friends, or leaving his backpack in random places so it always gets stolen. He can't think on his feet at all. He doesn't use his knowledge of science, quick-wittedness, or reason to solve any of his problems. He is assisted by his suit's artificial intelligence ""Karen"", his Hawaiian friend, or Tony Stark in every decision he makes. Everything bad that happens happens when he acts without first consulting someone else for advice. He is constantly out-smarted by the most obvious tricks and tactics. He's not self-sufficient in that he relies on so many other people.

I guess he's athletic. They show the stereotypical glamour shot of Peter with all of his muscles when he takes his shirt off and he does do Spider-man-esque things at the start of the film. But he is a terrible crime-fighter. Bad guys and regular people constantly get the jump on him. People always take him by surprise, sneak up on him, or he is oblivious to their presence, even when he is wearing his suit that can see through walls. Sometimes he has great reflexes and agility, but it's inconsistent. He crashes into everything he comes into contact with, a-la Team America style. One can only assume this Spider-man has no Spidey-sense or it somehow turns off and on randomly with no indication given to the audience.

The film does not clearly establish how strong/durable Peter is physically. He falls from great heights and gets hit with a lot of different things that would kill a regular person and survives without a scratch, but at the same time he is knocked out cold by some weak things, is scared of heights, and the audience is constantly told what he is doing is fatal and will kill him. Many of these inconsistencies can be chalked up to lazy writing and an unimaginative director. The issue is Peter is never curious about his own powers. He's already established as Spider-man, this isn't an origin movie. So he never explores his abilities or their limits himself or even explains them to anyone. The audience is left to figure it out but there was no consistency so his powers and abilities are just ill-defined.

There's no moral center. There's no ""with great power comes great responsibility."" He does say he won't kill bad guys and stealing is bad no matter what. There's no Uncle Ben. Tony Stark is Uncle Ben's surrogate and Peter's male role model. But Tony doesn't give him any advice other than ""don't do anything I would do and don't do anything I wouldn't do."" Honestly, Peter's morality comes from his best friend, kind of. This is another major thing missing from this film. Just because this film is aimed at teens and older doesn't mean it can't have theme or message. This is still a super hero film.

He doesn't do things a 14-year-old boy would as Spider-Man, which is what I thought this movie would get right! He asks a girl to a dance and she said yes and he got happy! Wow, you really understand the complexities of the male teenage psyche! The movie creates another one of those cliched Superman situations where Peter and Spider-man are never in the same place at the same time, which is how how the bad guy figures out who Spider-man is. You think Peter would be smart enough to avoid that problem, or the writers clever enough to avoid it, but no. There are simply no classic or iconic Spider-man moments in this film, he doesn't even swing through the skyline of New York City ffs.

**Peter's Best Friend**, a morbidly obese Pacific-Islander, is nerdy because he is fat, likes Star Wars, and wears a fedora. He always talks about building a Star Wars lego Death Star, he even brings the entire thing with him to school (something every teenager does these days, right?). He's kind of Peter's moral center. He cautions him against doing things he shouldn't like messing with the suit Tony gave him, but then helps him with it anyways. At the same time he wants to tell everyone Peter is Spider-Man and have him show up at his high school party so Peter would get cool points (probably the most realistic thing in this film). He helps him multiple times when Peter is out on missions with things like how to turn on a car's lights even though they were already on earlier in the film or uses the find my iphone application to track Peter's phone. He talks about looking at pornography, but he doesn't specify what type.

**Aunt May** looks like a holocaust survivor she is so sickly thin and is the perfect progressive parent. She encourages Peter to go out partying while she drinks herself. Men constantly talk about how hot she is, which was probably in Marissa Tomei's contract. Mexicans who work in the nearby bodega speak Spanish in front of Peter so they can talk about how hot his aunt is and how fat her ass is in front of him. She really has no role in the film though, doesn't give Peter advice, or do anything.

**Flash Thompson**, Peter's ""bully"", is an Indian/Muslim who is a super rich DJ who's the popular kid in school and takes the hottest white girl in school to Homecoming. Flash doesn't play sports (none of the characters do because sports are evil products of the patriarchy) but he still has latent homosexual yearnings that Hollywood likes to give to jocks. I'm assuming he is secretly in love with Peter. He seems literally obsessed with him. He calls Peter ""Penis Parker"" over and over again every time he is on and off screen whether Peter is there to hear it or not and he slaps Peter's ass. He's on the Academic Decathlon team with Peter, Peter's black love interest, black MJ, an African exchange student, and a couple more brown people.

**Peter's love interest**, Liz, is the spitting image of one of Obama's daughters Maleeka or Malandra. She is the smartest, prettiest, richest, most popular girl in the school. She throws a house party in her multi-million dollar mansion on Long Island where she lives, even though she attends a public high school in Queens. She is obviously full black and not mixed at all yet it's revealed her ""father"" is white, he's the Vulture. Meaning the Vulture is a cuck and is raising a black man's child.

**MJ** is a black emo loner who is nerdy, cocky, tough, witty, and talks about things like protesting various embassies in Washington D.C. and preaches that no one should honor the Washington Monument because it was built by slaves. She rivals Peter in intelligence, but so does every other person in the film. She's one of the film's comedic reliefs by doing things like flicking off Peter and bullying him with insults and put-downs. She will definitely wear the pants in her future relationship with Peter."
6lyy6p,0,2017-07-08,My [26f] former friend/current co-worker is making my life miserable. Do not know what - and if - I should say anything to our supervisor.,satanscoworker,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6lyy6p/my_26f_former_friendcurrent_coworker_is_making_my/,"About four years ago, I got a brand new job out of my master's degree. A year afterwards a position became available in our department and I encouraged a friend of mine (FBS) to apply. She got it. It was fun for about a year.

She has more experience in our field and a stronger academic background in our specific niche branch (it's a quasi-academic field, very competitive and incredibly small). When our supervisor retired last year, FBS was promoted into the position. We'd both applied and been interviewed and our department boss informed me that I was their runner-up choice. The department was restructured with our department boss as FBS and my mutual supervisor

I was upset but their rationale is solid. We focus in slightly different areas and the role is better filled by somebody who has her niche over mine. I accept that. Our department is one of a kind in the state. They're not able to add another position for me meaning eventually my contract will expire and I'll have to leave the job, likely in another field. It's sad but that's life. My boss has made comments about trying to get another position to add to our department and says he wants to see me stay in our field - but those are generalities at the moment.

But things with my coworker have gone way fucking sideways. She had to hand over some projects to me before assuming her new position. It was difficult for her as she has control issues. One of the projects got really fucking busted because she refused to step back and her interference caused a lot of confusion. We had a meeting to set some boundaries with regards to those projects.

I found out from other coworkers, though, she's been badmouthing me, questioning my capabilities. She's lied to me a lot about certain projects, lobbying our supervisors' supervisor to take them away from me and give them back. My career is incredibly important to me - I'm incredibly driven. I loved my job.

She's been incredibly condescending towards me over emails, questioning choices made for my projects without knowing all (or really any) of the facts and has, at times, cc'd those emails through our entire department. This further reinforced, to me, the fact that she's being disrespectful towards me.

She's routinely failed to inform me when she's changed policies or procedures, won't bring me in on new projects, and would prefer to use the summer interns or members of other departments than allow me to participate in anything. She gave me a piece of work to do for the first time in over a year yesterday. It was to fax a document to somebody - something we use volunteers for. Don't get me wrong. I do a lot of stupid tech shit for our supervisor. And I don't mind hooking up printers and scanners or converting pdfs to word. But that's literally the only thing that FBS has allowed me to handle in the last year.

FOR MY OWN PART - I acknowledge I'm an asshole. I defriended her on Facebook and blocked her on instagram. I don't want to interact with her outside a strictly professional basis. I don't want to hear about her weekend or see pictures of her cat. It's a very casual, personal work place and everyone's involved in each others' life so this is actually a pretty jerk move. When she attempts to engage in friendly chit chat I've begun trying to answer in a way that would discourage further response (""How was your weekend""/""Good. I have a meeting now.""). I don't trust her and I don't want to be her friend. Our only remaining mutual friend has told me that FBS was very confused and upset about the social media shit.

I genuinely do not understand her. The position is hers. There does not seem to be any reason to try and undermine me. I can be an asset - I have knowledge and skills and could be a great tool. And yet it strongly feels like she's trying to kneecap my career. This conflict is making me a worse person - I was a normal fucking human being and now I've developed anxiety. I'm angrier. I sometimes have ideations of punching her smug face.

My supervisor is away on a business trip and then I'm away on holidays, but when I return I want to discuss this with him and am thoroughly unsure of what I can fairly ask. I would like more concrete details about when/if another position will be added. I definitely want clearer delineations between our roles in order to facilitate better boundaries. She needs to stay in her own lane. But I also just want to inform them of her behaviour - I honestly have known what to do so I've only told a very select few people (most my work-wife, my mother, and a few key friends).

tl;dr: Problems with a conniving, controlling coworker who seems to be trying to ruin my job? Not sure how (OR IF!) to broach with my supervisor."
6lz052,1,2017-07-08,Choosing Between Intellectual Vitality Essays,appblrqueen,GetIntoStanford,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetIntoStanford/comments/6lz052/choosing_between_intellectual_vitality_essays/,"Hi! I have two intellectual vitality essays- one already written and one newer idea. I am a prospective applicant applying for Fall 2018, hopeful to be a Science Technology and Society (concentration public policy) or Political Science major and CompSci minor. Tell me which idea sounds most intriguing.

1: My senior year honors information technology independent study project, where I research and apply classic and modern philosophical principles to developments in artificial intelligence and technological innovation as a whole. I also discuss my love for discovering the unknown and bridging the gap between the humanities and sciences

2: Discussing my experiences being a research intern in political science at a nearby university, and how I deepened my appreciation and knowledge about social policy, specifically educational policies. I want to tie in my background here to give context. I'm wondering if this should be my EC essay, but I've already written it (it's about debate).

Which one is better and why? If you need to read the one that's written, PM me"
6lz0a8,4,2017-07-08,IJW: Spider-man: Homecoming (2017),MSRiverKings,Ijustwatched,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ijustwatched/comments/6lz0a8/ijw_spiderman_homecoming_2017/,"The opening dialogue of the film, after the title card, clearly establishes this film's purpose. Vulture: ""When I was young we used to play cowboys and indians."" BetaWhiteMale: ""They are called Native Americans now."" This film wasn't made to accurately and respectfully adapt a storied and iconic comic book character, it wasn't even to tell a great Spider-Man story, it's sole purpose was to push political and social agenda through a popular medium. It really reminds me of Ghostbusters (2016) in that way.

It's called Spider-man: Homecoming, but the homecoming dance is only on screen for 5 seconds and has nothing to do with the film's plot. It's obvious they just used the title to signify Spider-man was ""coming home"" to the MCU. We do see a lot of Peter's high school. It's supposed to be a public school in Queens, but looks nicer than any private school in the country, at least on the outside. The school is a diverse utopian wet-dream where everyone is any color but white and all the smartest, best students are black and brown. There are male and female homosexuals, trans, every person of every race, etc.

It's darker than a Tyler Perry film. 95% of actors and extras are non-white. I live in NYC and there are definitely a lot of brown people, but there are tons of white people as well. There are only about 5-6 white men in this movie and each one is either an extreme beta-male, a cuck, extremely dumb, a criminal, or an outright fag (except Tony Stark). There are even less white women including Aunt May, Pepper Potts, the mousy friend of Peter's love interest, and some white lesbians at the homecoming dance together in the background.

**Peter** is a bumbling, clumsy, beta-male in that he's everyone's bitch. He's bossed around by Tony, Happy, Aunt May, his teachers, by his fellow students, his friends. He's constantly fucking up everything. He's not really a nerd, a social outcast or an unassuming loner. He seems well known at his school. Everyone thinks he was given some ""Stark Internship"" where he goes and does science-y things, but it's just a cover for his vigilante crime-fighting. He's not the most popular kid in school, but all of the popular kids are involved in the same clubs and activities as him. They run in the same social circles and go to the same parties. The popular girl in school likes Peter and is his date to the homecoming dance and Peter himself is good looking. It's not the Peter Parker you are used to from the comics. Like a lot of things in this film, Peter's social status is inconsistent and ill-defined.

Everyone tells Peter how super smart he is and he does wears a lot of science t-shirts, but he's not smart and does nothing to prove otherwise. He has no particular love or aptitude for any science or engineering. He's not even curious about things in general. He doesn't investigate his own powers, his parent's death, Uncle Ben's death, how he got his powers. He's not tinkering with or testing his web. He doesn't work on his fighting abilities and does not try to refine his technique or figure out different ways to use his web in different situations. He doesn't build gadgets or conduct experiments. He doesn't create his suit or modify the suit Tony gave him, which you would expect Peter Parker to do. He makes his own web (with chemicals given to him in his high school chemistry class) and web cartridges, but it's not clear if he came up with the web formula or designed the cartridges or the shooters himself. I assume Tony Stark created it all for him because Tony Stark created the suit which had all sorts of different types of web, web shooters, web devices built into it. Even if Peter did create the web, Tony made it 100x better. Peter is essentially wearing an Inspector Gadget/Iron Man suit that he doesn't know how to use. He is overwhelmed by the technology for comedic purposes even though it was made so user-friendly retards could operate it. I guess this is just another dig at Peter. Another way to show he is a beta-male, bitch boy. He can't even properly work his suit. 

He's not witty or a smart-ass when he is Spider-man. He makes dumb decisions constantly, whether in a fight or talking to adults/friends, or leaving his backpack in random places so it always gets stolen. He can't think on his feet at all. He doesn't use his knowledge of science, quick-wittedness, or reason to solve any of his problems. He is assisted by his suit's artificial intelligence ""Karen"", his Hawaiian friend, or Tony Stark in every decision he makes. Everything bad that happens happens when he acts without first consulting someone else for advice. He is constantly out-smarted by the most obvious tricks and tactics. He's not self-sufficient in that he relies on so many other people.

I guess he's athletic. They show the stereotypical glamour shot of Peter with all of his muscles when he takes his shirt off and he does do Spider-man-esque things at the start of the film. But he is a terrible crime-fighter. Bad guys and regular people constantly get the jump on him. People always take him by surprise, sneak up on him, or he is oblivious to their presence, even when he is wearing his suit that can see through walls. Sometimes he has great reflexes and agility, but it's inconsistent. He crashes into everything he comes into contact with, a-la Team America style. One can only assume this Spider-man has no Spidey-sense or it somehow turns off and on randomly with no indication given to the audience.

The film does not clearly establish how strong/durable Peter is physically. He falls from great heights and gets hit with a lot of different things that would kill a regular person and survives without a scratch, but at the same time he is knocked out cold by some weak things, is scared of heights, and the audience is constantly told what he is doing is fatal and will kill him. Many of these inconsistencies can be chalked up to lazy writing and an unimaginative director. The issue is Peter is never curious about his own powers. He's already established as Spider-man, this isn't an origin movie. So he never explores his abilities or their limits himself or even explains them to anyone. The audience is left to figure it out but there was no consistency so his powers and abilities are just ill-defined.

There's no moral center. There's no ""with great power comes great responsibility."" He does say he won't kill bad guys and stealing is bad no matter what. There's no Uncle Ben. Tony Stark is Uncle Ben's surrogate and Peter's male role model. But Tony doesn't give him any advice other than ""don't do anything I would do and don't do anything I wouldn't do."" Honestly, Peter's morality comes from his best friend, kind of. This is another major thing missing from this film. Just because this film is aimed at teens and older doesn't mean it can't have theme or message. This is still a super hero film.

He doesn't do things a 14-year-old boy would as Spider-Man, which is what I thought this movie would get right! He asks a girl to a dance and she said yes and he got happy! Wow, you really understand the complexities of the male teenage psyche! The movie creates another one of those cliched Superman situations where Peter and Spider-man are never in the same place at the same time, which is how how the bad guy figures out who Spider-man is. You think Peter would be smart enough to avoid that problem, or the writers clever enough to avoid it, but no. There are simply no classic or iconic Spider-man moments in this film, he doesn't even swing through the skyline of New York City ffs.

**Peter's Best Friend**, a morbidly obese Pacific-Islander, is nerdy because he is fat, likes Star Wars, and wears a fedora. He always talks about building a Star Wars lego Death Star, he even brings the entire thing with him to school (something every teenager does these days, right?). He's kind of Peter's moral center. He cautions him against doing things he shouldn't like messing with the suit Tony gave him, but then helps him with it anyways. At the same time he wants to tell everyone Peter is Spider-Man and have him show up at his high school party so Peter would get cool points (probably the most realistic thing in this film). He helps him multiple times when Peter is out on missions with things like how to turn on a car's lights even though they were already on earlier in the film or uses the find my iphone application to track Peter's phone. He talks about looking at pornography, but he doesn't specify what type.

**Aunt May** looks like a holocaust survivor she is so sickly thin and is the perfect progressive parent. She encourages Peter to go out partying while she drinks alone by herself. Men constantly talk about how hot she is, which was probably in Marissa Tomei's contract. Mexicans who work in the nearby bodega speak Spanish in front of Peter so they can talk about how hot his aunt is and how fat her ass is in front of him. She really has no role in the film though, doesn't give Peter advice, or do anything.

**Flash Thompson**, Peter's ""bully"", is an Indian/Muslim who is a super rich DJ who's the popular kid in school and takes the hottest white girl in school to Homecoming. Flash doesn't play sports (none of the characters do because sports are evil products of the patriarchy) but he still has latent homosexual yearnings that Hollywood likes to give to jocks. I'm assuming he is secretly in love with Peter. He seems literally obsessed with him. He calls Peter ""Penis Parker"" over and over again every time he is on and off screen whether Peter is there to hear it or not and he slaps Peter's ass. He's on the Academic Decathlon team with Peter, Peter's black love interest, black MJ, an African exchange student, and a couple more brown people.

**Peter's love interest**, Liz, is the spitting image of one of Obama's daughters Maleeka or Malandra. She is the smartest, prettiest, richest, most popular girl in the school. She throws a house party in her multi-million dollar mansion on Long Island where she lives, even though she attends a public high school in Queens. She is obviously full black and not mixed at all yet it's revealed her ""father"" is white, he's the Vulture. Meaning the Vulture is a cuck and is raising a black man's child.

**MJ** is a black emo loner who is nerdy, cocky, tough, witty, and talks about things like protesting various embassies in Washington D.C. and preaches that no one should honor the Washington Monument because it was built by slaves. She rivals Peter in intelligence, but so does every other person in the film. She's one of the film's comedic reliefs by doing things like flicking off Peter and bullying him with insults and put-downs. She will definitely wear the pants in her future relationship with Peter."

Another way to show he is a beta-male, bitch boy. He can't even properly work his suit. 

He's not witty or a smart-ass when he is Spider-man. He makes dumb decisions constantly, whether in a fight or talking to adults/friends, or leaving his backpack in random places so it always gets stolen. He can't think on his feet at all. He doesn't use his knowledge of science, quick-wittedness, or reason to solve any of his problems. He is assisted by his suit's artificial intelligence ""Karen"", his Hawaiian friend, or Tony Stark in every decision he makes. Everything bad that happens happens when he acts without first consulting someone else for advice. He is constantly out-smarted by the most obvious tricks and tactics. He's not self-sufficient in that he relies on so many other people.

I guess he's athletic. They show the stereotypical glamour shot of Peter with all of his muscles when he takes his shirt off and he does do Spider-man-esque things at the start of the film. But he is a terrible crime-fighter. Bad guys and regular people constantly get the jump on him. People always take him by surprise, sneak up on him, or he is oblivious to their presence, even when he is wearing his suit that can see through walls. Sometimes he has great reflexes and agility, but it's inconsistent. He crashes into everything he comes into contact with, a-la Team America style. One can only assume this Spider-man has no Spidey-sense or it somehow turns off and on randomly with no indication given to the audience.

The film does not clearly establish how strong/durable Peter is physically. He falls from great heights and gets hit with a lot of different things that would kill a regular person and survives without a scratch, but at the same time he is knocked out cold by some weak things, is scared of heights, and the audience is constantly told what he is doing is fatal and will kill him. Many of these inconsistencies can be chalked up to lazy writing and an unimaginative director. The issue is Peter is never curious about his own powers. He's already established as Spider-man, this isn't an origin movie. So he never explores his abilities or their limits himself or even explains them to anyone. The audience is left to figure it out but there was no consistency so his powers and abilities are just ill-defined.

There's no moral center. There's no ""with great power comes great responsibility."" He does say he won't kill bad guys and stealing is bad no matter what. There's no Uncle Ben. Tony Stark is Uncle Ben's surrogate and Peter's male role model. But Tony doesn't give him any advice other than ""don't do anything I would do and don't do anything I wouldn't do."" Honestly, Peter's morality comes from his best friend, kind of. This is another major thing missing from this film. Just because this film is aimed at teens and older doesn't mean it can't have theme or message. This is still a super hero film.

He doesn't do things a 14-year-old boy would as Spider-Man, which is what I thought this movie would get right! He asks a girl to a dance and she said yes and he got happy! Wow, you really understand the complexities of the male teenage psyche! The movie creates another one of those cliched Superman situations where Peter and Spider-man are never in the same place at the same time, which is how how the bad guy figures out who Spider-man is. You think Peter would be smart enough to avoid that problem, or the writers clever enough to avoid it, but no. There are simply no classic or iconic Spider-man moments in this film, he doesn't even swing through the skyline of New York City ffs.

**Peter's Best Friend**, a morbidly obese Pacific-Islander, is nerdy because he is fat, likes Star Wars, and wears a fedora. He always talks about building a Star Wars lego Death Star, he even brings the entire thing with him to school (something every teenager does these days, right?). He's kind of Peter's moral center. He cautions him against doing things he shouldn't like messing with the suit Tony gave him, but then helps him with it anyways. At the same time he wants to tell everyone Peter is Spider-Man and have him show up at his high school party so Peter would get cool points (probably the most realistic thing in this film). He helps him multiple times when Peter is out on missions with things like how to turn on a car's lights even though they were already on earlier in the film or uses the find my iphone application to track Peter's phone. He talks about looking at pornography, but he doesn't specify what type.

**Aunt May** looks like a holocaust survivor she is so sickly thin and is the perfect progressive parent. She encourages Peter to go out partying while she drinks herself. Men constantly talk about how hot she is, which was probably in Marissa Tomei's contract. Mexicans who work in the nearby bodega speak Spanish in front of Peter so they can talk about how hot his aunt is and how fat her ass is in front of him. She really has no role in the film though, doesn't give Peter advice, or do anything.

**Flash Thompson**, Peter's ""bully"", is an Indian/Muslim who is a super rich DJ who's the popular kid in school and takes the hottest white girl in school to Homecoming. Flash doesn't play sports (none of the characters do because sports are evil products of the patriarchy) but he still has latent homosexual yearnings that Hollywood likes to give to jocks. I'm assuming he is secretly in love with Peter. He seems literally obsessed with him. He calls Peter ""Penis Parker"" over and over again every time he is on and off screen whether Peter is there to hear it or not and he slaps Peter's ass. He's on the Academic Decathlon team with Peter, Peter's black love interest, black MJ, an African exchange student, and a couple more brown people.

**Peter's love interest**, Liz, is the spitting image of one of Obama's daughters Maleeka or Malandra. She is the smartest, prettiest, richest, most popular girl in the school. She throws a house party in her multi-million dollar mansion on Long Island where she lives, even though she attends a public high school in Queens. She is obviously full black and not mixed at all yet it's revealed her ""father"" is white, he's the Vulture. Meaning the Vulture is a cuck and is raising a black man's child.

**MJ** is a black emo loner who is nerdy, cocky, tough, witty, and talks about things like protesting various embassies in Washington D.C. and preaches that no one should honor the Washington Monument because it was built by slaves. She rivals Peter in intelligence, but so does every other person in the film. She's one of the film's comedic reliefs by doing things like flicking off Peter and bullying him with insults and put-downs. She will definitely wear the pants in her future relationship with Peter."
6lzrqb,5,2017-07-08,Request for advice.,darthmeshkat,QuantumComputing,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantumComputing/comments/6lzrqb/request_for_advice/,"I graduated a month ago with my undergrad degree in electrical engineering. In the last few months of my undergrad I got interested in quantum computing. After graduating I started studying the subject and am currently reading Nielsen and Chuang. I did not take any physics courses related to quantum mechanics in my college. But I did do a course in classical information theory and loved it. 
Currently I have completed the first two chapters of the book. I want to continue and have been wondering about pursuing this subject in grad school. My undergrad GPA is an average 7.2/10 (we have a 10 point GPA system). 
What would you recommend I do to get into grad school for this subject? To remove my lack of experience in this area, I was thinking that I should try applying to work an intern in labs which are working in quantum computing. My background in EE makes me more inclined towards working on the physical implementation but for now I am not too worried about that because I have no experience with the subject and so would love any opportunity to gain some. How difficult do you think it would be to get such an intern position in a lab? 

Also, does anybody know of any online reading groups one could join? I have always found that when I am teaching something to myself, I do better when I study with at least one other person."
6m104j,2,2017-07-08,Afraid to end up alone.. My story,Japan1994,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6m104j/afraid_to_end_up_alone_my_story/,"Hello guys, first of all I am new here and English is not my native language. So if I make mistakes excuse me for that. For the people that read my story and reply, thank you so much for your time.

I found myself in a hard situation. At least from my perspective. I try to be rational but it is very difficult for me some times. Okay, so I'm afraid to end up alone. I have a girlfriend that I love. But because I have personal troubles (working on it) and if I don't she doubts our future. I am 23, she is 25. Let me provide you some background information.
My environment sucks, no supportive friends nor family. I would describe my family as a dysfunctional family. I have non personal freedom, for instance I am forced to believe in god and to pray everyday. I can't talk to them, because if I point out things to discuss it's not true or they don't take me seriously. They don't communicate proper with eachother and end up most of the time into (screaming) fights. My dad is manipulative, controlfreak and disrespects my personal freedom. He treats our family like crap and my other family members ignore this fact. But I don't. I have had pointless discussions. So due to this, I don't argue with them anymore, because it's pointless.


Recently I have cut ends with my so called (activity) ''Friends"". I did this because the are very materialistic and have screwed me over before. So I made the choice to leave them. I don't find it hard that I left them, but that I don't have some nice people around my bothers me sometimes.
This is a bit of an insight of my environment, I hope I explained it well.


Beside this, before I met these friends and my girlfriend of 8 months. I was very alone. Long story, but I had not very much friends and ended up being sad en maybe even depressed.
Now the real deal what bothers me the most. Is that my girlfriend doubts our future. She explained what bothers her, and she is worried that in the end I can't help myself. Because, to improve my situation I want to live on my own. But due to the fact that I had to pay everyting by myself as a student, I wasn't able to. Now I am looking for an internship and after that a job. But that beside, she finds it sometimes hard to communicate with me, because i interpret things not always right. We both think my environment is messing with my head. She also don't like the fact that I have not been on my own (yet). Because this makes me not fully independent. She has not seen my family and she won't. I think this wil not profit her or our relationship, and I want to limit the shit that she has to deal with due to me.


Furthermore, due to stress I have gained some serious fysical problems. I suffer from it daily. Let me not describe it, because then it will be a too long story : )
At last, I have a passion. I like to draw. But I lost my motivation a bit and she also don't like that.
Thank you for reading this. I have a lot more to tell, but also don't like to make the story too long. I appreciate that some of you take the time to read my personal crap.

6m1751,27,2017-07-08,[Discussion] I spend a lot of time seeing where I am now and comparing myself to where I think I should be and it's depressing. Any help trying to not beat myself up?,pinetreeteepee,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/6m1751/discussion_i_spend_a_lot_of_time_seeing_where_i/,"A lot of my anxiety and worry comes from feeling like I'm always behind the trend. By trend, I mean relationships, career, finances, etc. I'm 25 now, and most of my days I think about how I'd give anything to go back to 18 and start over again. If God came down and offered me to go back 5 years in time in exchange for less 5 years of my maximum life, I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

I think this feeling comes from regret. Regret of not building up myself to where I feel I should be. I just recently went on a date that didn't work out and I just spent the rest of the night beating myself up over how by now I should have the dating experience since I'm already 25. Instead of I can count the number of girls I've had on one hand.

Financially, I've screwed myself over where I should have had a salary paying job, but I'm just jumping from internship to internship just spinning my wheels. I should've graduated when I was 22 but I've failed many classes and now I'm finally graduating this year.

My expectations of where I should be at this moment to where I am today is a huge hole filled with regret, self-hatred and anxiety.

I guess I just need help not beating myself up over my failures. 

P.S. Before anyone suggests that I sound depressed, yes I have been going through depression for 7 years and I am currently seeing a therapist. And I realize that part of this depression comes from that feeling of regret of not living up to my expectations."

6m1wgj,1,2017-07-08,[ROUTINE HELP] I have PIH and Hyperpigmentation I'd like to address. What DE serum to invest in?,tsunshun-,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/6m1wgj/routine_help_i_have_pih_and_hyperpigmentation_id/,"Hello friends, 

At my last internship I was given a $75 gift card to Sephora as a parting gift. I've had my eye on the DE Glycolic Night Serum and the DE C-Firma Serum for a while now and I'm not sure which one to purchase.

&amp;nbsp;

About my skin: I suffer from hormonal acne and about once a month I'll get a really big cystic pimple. I usually treat those with cortisone injections because I find that that's the easiest way to get rid of them. Also I'm a bit of a picker, so I tend to keep touching the cystic acne until it's far worse. 

&amp;nbsp;

Routine: Evening/Night I use the TO Niacinamide Serum and apply my moisturizer Dr Jart Ceramidin Cream. I also exfoliate with the CURE Aqua Gel. I also am using Tretanoid .01%. 

Here is what my skin looks like: http://imgur.com/VTxseMv http://imgur.com/0tR8XRY (apologies for the weird photobooth pictures) 

&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately my concerns are fading my PIH and helping prevent getting clogged pores. Which DE serum should I try? 
Thank you!

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Also I just purchased TO Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution, Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 and AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution and am hoping to work these into my routine!

6m33wu,0,2017-07-08,Emotional Support Dog ~ Right Breed? [breeds],mirandacraghead,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/6m33wu/emotional_support_dog_right_breed_breeds/,"Hi I'm a college student living in Florida. I just recently started seeing a psychologist and was prescribed an emotional support dog. 

Backstory 
To say the least I have very unsupportive and manipulative parents that even though they say they want the best for me want me to fall in line with their plan of my future. I'm constantly teared down whenever I want anything and then forced into doing what they want by fear tactics. Thus, I have self-esteem issues, anxiety problems, lack of motivation to pursue anything. Due to a lack of social skills I don't have any friends other than my boyfriend. He was actually the one that opened my eyes to my parents behavior. Before then I didn't know different. All I knew was that I was always sad. I have been depressed for about 8years. Unfortunately, he is going on an internship to Belgium for 6months and thus I was really looking for a companion dog.  

After trying to convince my parents into allowing me to get a dog for literally a week of unending pessimism I finally got a baby from a breeder out of state. (Even though I have saved ample money from past jobs it's in their account and they wont allow me to use it without their permission). Unfortunately, the dog was just way too needy. He would always cry for me to hold him. He wasn't even okay if he was on the coach 5in away from me. Considering he needed more emotional support than I could give I rehomed him to a better suited home. 

I am now fostering a puppy from the local shelter. She is relatively good however she has growled at me when I tried to take the leash out of her mouth and just recently today when I was just laying in bed with her. She shows some aggression that really makes me wonder if she would bite. Regardless, I really need advice on good dog breeds. 

Characteristics I am looking for
-Snuggle bug that will cuddle in bed and love attention
              However on the counter the baby cannot be too needy  
              I am gone 3-6hours a day he will need to be okay with 
              being alone. Of course the dog will be sleeping in my 
              bed. 
-A very calm dog 
               I want a dog that can chill all day on the couch right 
               beside me. A little bit of energy isn't a bad thing I 
               love to run outside with him at least 30-1hour a day 
               intermediately. (The dog I currently foster~ I take her
               out to the bathroom every 3 hours for about 30 mins
               of running and playing) 
The dog cannot have a barking problem nor aggression 
               I live in a one bedroom apartment right next to a 
               walk path and green space. I cannot have a dog that
               would cause noise complaints nor be aggressive to 
               people give the frequency the park is used.

Size, gender, and appearance really aren't a concern for me 
I really just want a dog that I feel loved and can help ease my anxiety. I want a dog that only looks at the world with joy and happiness as it would be hard not to be happy watching a ball of fluff wagging its tail all around. 

I have had dogs on both ends of the spectrum. The dog I recently lost in October after 8years was far too independent he never would sit next to me unless I was petting him otherwise he was on the other side of the house. (my parents didn't let me bring him to college) and then the dog from the breeder. I understand I need to make a compromise between independence and affection I just don't know what breeds to even look at. 

Thanks for any advice you can offer

6m3dgb,19,2017-07-08,Sex Ed for us freaks specifically!,Totallynotmepromise_,adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/6m3dgb/sex_ed_for_us_freaks_specifically/,"Okay I'm avoiding work and I have this knowledge which people have found helpful several times in the past, with my answers to questions...so I wrote some stuff down.  

Let's call it **Adulterer's guide to a few lesser known risks** 

Subtitled: *""well I used a condom"" "" He has x. Is he cheating?"" Gray areas.* 

If you don't want any reality right now move along.  There are so many topics, but these ones have come up on a couple pages lately.  



The only way to be completely safe is to cloister yourself until marriage, only fuck for procreation, wrapped in latex except your tab C and slot V.   But, you know, we're all hanging out on r/adultery , so that might not be how we roll.   

I have a BS in microbiology and molecular genetics and a masters in education and some field work experience.  I did not just stumble across this page out of no where ;) I fact checked, but am not a doc so I may have made errors.



**HPV:You know that mystical cancer nobody understands**

Technically not an STI/STD. There are upwards of 40 types and most people have it in some form, already.  Only a small number of them are serious.  

It is unlikely to come from oral sex.  But is likely to come from genital to genital contact.  

Condoms help, but think about that balls slapping her taint when you are about to cum moment.  Ooh sexy, but it's genital epithelial to genital epithelial touching and that counts.  

All of us old broads carry on; young ones, under 26, Gardasil helps prevent some of the dangers, not all.  **edit see u/adorawhore 's comment below**

**Bad news:** can get cervical cancer, genital warts

**Good news:** likely won't, dudes you're good when it comes to cancer

**Adulterer fact:** The only ""oh shit busted"" with this one comes in when you both married as snowy white, sexless, turtle doves.  Then you have some explaining to do.  The rest of us hoes, are all good.  It can lay dormant for years.  So while you may have picked it up from AP. You just as easily may have picked it up under the bleachers in 10th grade, even if you just literally bumped uglies..  They don't test dudes, but even if they did...their immune system can take it down.  So there is no telling if they had it at some point and now it's gone.

**Did they cheat smoking gun:** This one is inadmissible in court, friends.  It's like the sexy intern has a cough and then your man has a cough... could just be pollen. 

**Guilt/asshole factor:**  limiting sexual partners and using condoms helps.  If you happen to transfer the HPV 16 or one of the 8 or so other bad ones to your female SO, you are putting them at risk for cancer or warts. Easy to rationalize away, but in the back of your mind you know it's a risk. It's the plane crash, you aren't going to stop flying but you always know it's a possibility.


**Crabs:**

They are actual insects but the only other close relative are some gorilla crabs and lice.  Genital louse is a fancy name for a nasty fucker in your pubes. They can cause major skin irritation and just ick.

Brazilians aren't completely  preventative as they can hitch a ride on the folical, but it does show a decrease.  But fuckin ouch, have you tried that?  

In the eww department, trendy, bearded hipsters going down all hot and.., yah they like those and mustaches too.  

Sorry black people, you may have out evolved us melanin deficient, when it comes to regular lice, but you've got an equal shot at pubic lice.  Hair to hair jumping. All hair, but rarely head hair.  

24 hour survival rate without a host.  These fuckers are just sitting around waiting for you to sit your hairy ass on their location.


**Bad news:** You have mother fuckin bug things burrowing into your snatch


**Good news:** After you get treatment, cleaning and shower, like you starred in Carrie, intermittently crying  and whimpering ""icky"", you will live a long and healthy bug free life. 

**Adulterer fact:** true story, I got these at 20 yo. Called up my boyfriend who had a long internship in another state. He got checked, no bugs.  Dumped me.  I was but an innocent fawn back then, never would I have soiled my good name by taking a lover.  How dare he!  

Likely source, I had a job in a dorm taking in bed linens from an at risk teens camp.  I also used the same facilities as these guys and gals.  And back in the full-bush, Bush years...one of these fuckers jumped aboard and propagated.  

**Did they cheat smoking gun:** I'm living proof that you can be an angel of virtue and still bring home the bugs.  But the dumping wasn't completely out of line.  Most cases are from getting freaky and possibly a little unhygienic about it.  

So you don't have proof that your man was screwing an unkempt, full bushed, hippy chick, on the mattress that she stole from her roommate back in Boulder...but I'd ask a question or two about his theory of how he contracted them. 

Speaking of which, let's play cover story.  MONDAY you find out you've got crabs.  Unless you've been on a business trip for a few weeks, you need to tell him.  They are in your sheets and clothes.  That night you have a head ache and can't get busy, but you are excited to tell him about your new volunteer gig that you started 5 DAYS AGO (incubation period)...[insert plausible reason to touch undies and laundry]. TUESDAY ""oh no I have crabs dear, but I likely got them from [see above]""...you're welcome.


**Guilt/asshole factor:** Nobody died, so there is that.  If you are on the sketchy scene and taking risks, this could be the result.  It can happen to anyone, but it's more likely to happen when you're  plowing a girl who goes by Blaze, at a music festival, in the port-a-John, underwear around your knees, that you are pretty sure you weren't wearing before you dropped that acid.  Don't be that guy!


**All you freaky asshole lickers listen up!**

I know, I know, I'll be transformed into orgasmic heights yet unseen ;).  But hopefully like the key parties of the 70's and 'everybody has to get flogged' of the 90's this too will see it's end.  I say this not with a prudish glint in my eye, but as someone who has physically cultivated ass bacteria before.  Dental damns are annoying and somewhat impractical for oral.  Maybe though, we could make them cool for ass licking?  
 
E. Coli and campylobacter will have you puking your guts out.  And Strep. B can hop on board and give a strep infection.  And that is between normal health people as 30-40% of people are just carrying strep B around.  

Pooping and nauseous for three days?  Surely it's just nerves. Nerves because you are meeting this person in real life for the first time, after sexting about marathon gymnastic feats, that in real life you are pretty sure you can't figure out the physics involved, let alone perform.  What if it is instead food poisoning?  Yummy.  

And there are so many more contagions in this situation!!!!

Piece of advice #1 stop licking assholes, and it goes unheeded, I'm sure. I'm not going to curb the massive wave of ass licking that is orgasmically sweeping the internet.  But for god sakes kids wash the hell out of the little starfish and anything you put in or on it.  


You probably won't get caught because of anal rimming.  When my aunt got food poisoning last week, I didn't immediately question what asshole she had been playing with.  Now I am.  



Alright my fine fucking friends, carry on!

Rick (a nearly underage boy ) watches you shiver craving for cock, his eyes look at your red lips and down at your cleavage as he realises he has a chance to fuck a much older girl, in fact this boy is yet to empty his balls and for a (weeks/months/years) he had been stroking his cock stimulating his semen to be produced but unable to release to his congenital problem where he cannot cum unlesss he has accumulated a (weeks/months/year) worth of thick creamy fertile sperm load.
""Ok.."" he nods as you beg for him to fuck you raw...he drops his backpack and starts to unzip his shirt revealing a large bulge under his underpants. Before he continues you presse ""STOP"" button on the lift.
Bassically you are someone who is aware of his condition and either by pure need of cum or altruism reasons you take the opportunity of us being alone to make me unload a large period of time worh of cum. As it is a generous amount it would be life threatening to have it all done in one go, so you would plan to have me nut several times throughout the roleplay 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my teen daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw Kaley (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that Kaley was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as Kaley? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent little girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) A innocent little sleepover with your 2 friends and you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them and want to learn everything, but no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.

I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks), lingerie, thick girls, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.

For the first week or so, the re-diagnosis didn't seem real to me. Now (about 5 weeks since they found the brain tumor) the full reality has set in. The treatments so far aren't that harsh; however, I will have to begin a clinical trial once my current regimen of oral chemo (Temozolomide/Irinotecan) and radiation ends which will force me to miss a semester of school (at least) and who the hell even knows if the trial will be successful. The oncologists said this would be a ""curative attempt,"" but perhaps the last attempt I can have seeing as traditional treatments haven't worked the past two times.



Mentally, I haven't been doing great. Although I feel ok and happy at times, the things I normally enjoy in life have began to feel more and more like temporary distractions from the reality of my situation. I was originally supposed to be living in my college town (my apartment lease extended through the summer), working part time at an internship I worked my ass off to get, spending time with friends, and really living my own independent summer for the first time in my life. Instead I'm stuck back home, dealing with chemo and radiation all over again.



Between having all I looked forward to/worked so hard for ripped out from under me and my bleak looking medical situation, I've felt really hopeless and empty.




Have antidepressants helped any of you cope with your situation? The therapist at the hospital told me they were a possibility if my mental state continued to worsen. The issue is I'm not sure my state is truly depression or just a ""mindset issue"" and resolvable with behavioral changes of some kind. Any other general coping/mental health tips are very welcomed as well!! 

Thank you all for your support"
6m51n6,68,2017-07-08,"""You should really be more careful""",Magpie2018,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6m51n6/you_should_really_be_more_careful/,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I had an encounter with a pretty awful creep today and I just needed to vent. 

Today I met a guy on tinder, as you do when you're a single girl in her mid 20s interning in a new city far away from home. He seemed normal enough. He's pursuing higher education at a respected university and I'm in town for an internship. We are in the same field so initially we had a lot to talk about. 

We met for lunch and he immediately started talking about how he never meets girls like me and how I should've let him pick me up (I declined his offer for safety and all). He seemed a little desperate but we decided we'd go to a movie later that afternoon. 

We had a couple of hours to kill so he decided that we would go to a local supermarket and walk around. This was a little strange but I thought that maybe he just wasn't used to planning appropriate time killers for dates. I already was getting a bit of a weird vibe from him but I was writing it off as maybe him just being super smart and maybe socially awkward. When we got to the supermarket he started touching me-my arm, my back, my legs. He would go out of his way to touch me for no good reason. He wasn't listening to a word I said, instead, he was going on and on about how *special* I was and continuing with the progressively invasive touching in the middle of a supermarket. 

Eventually my gut is just really telling me that something is off and I need to get out of that situation fast. I end up finding a way out of it. Before I leave he gives me a hug goodbye and kisses my cheek. I thought that everything was ok but then he comes to my window and motions for me to roll it down. I did and he asks for a kiss. I kissed him on the cheek and then he asked for a kiss on the lips. I give him the quickest lip peck I could just to get out of there and then speed off. 

As soon as I get on the highway I saw his car behind me. It just so happened that his car was very distinctive and so I noticed it in my rear view mirror. I was obviously a bit paranoid so I made a wrong turn and he followed. I went into a subdivision and did the whole ""three left turns"" thing and he made each turn with me. Eventually I lost him in the subdivision but I was shaking by the time I finally got away. 

Later today he ended up calling and texting me so much that I had to block him. I was upset and shaken by this whole ordeal and reached out to friends about it. There were a couple that were really great but the overwhelming response I got was ""you should really be more careful."" 

Why? Why should *I* be more careful in this situation? What about the man who obviously thought that it was OK to touch me in public, demand a kiss on the lips, and harass me? How am I at fault for accepting a date in public, driving myself, and leaving when I felt that something was off? What about how I feel? Every time I encounter men like this I get sad because I feel like I'm nothing more than an object to be had. Doesn't that matter at all? 

I'm really disheartened by dating lately. Several guys have either been downright creepy or ""stealthed"" me and none of them seem to care about me as a person. It seems like no one wants to actually date but rather just use women as objects for whatever they want. 

TL;DR, got creeped on and friends are blaming me. Needed to vent. "
6m525i,130,2017-07-08,UPDATE: My daughter was sexually abused by my now ex-SO (24hrs later),dragon-pet,breakingmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/6m525i/update_my_daughter_was_sexually_abused_by_my_now/,"So first off thanks to all the ladies who reached out, I was touched by your amazing supportive words.  They got me through an extremely tough night.  Today has been pretty low-key, but I have some updates.

I'm going to put a Trigger Warning here because I very vaguely reference the type of abuse kinda.  Just figured I'd put it on there just in case. 

He was released on bail today, with his mother standing surety for him. Because of this he will have to live with her until his next court date which is mid late August.  His mom lives in a city over an hour away so hopefully no chance of accidentally bumping into him.  He cannot contact my daughter or come withing 500m of her or my apartment.  He can still contact me but he hasn't yet and I've made up my mind that if he does I make it clear I do not want contact from him in any shape or form. 

The police told me I would be contacted by a 3rd party sometime, it was very unspecific, and they would arrange a time for him to come to the apartment with an officer and remove his property.  He said I would have to be here but I am going to see if there's anyway I can just vacate for the time he's there and just let him take what he will.  I don't think he's going to try and fuck me over but you never know.  

I don't think I can face him.  I think I might just see red and do something very very stupid.  In my mind we are done, but of course have not actually told him that but at this point I don't feel the need to.  I keep catching myself doing things like almost sending him cute pics or interesting articles I find online.  I just copy the link automatically but have stopped myself from actually opening the messenger.  

My social worker is going to set up an appointment for my daughter to get a checking over by a doctor.  Thankfully, if I can be thankful for anything at this point, is that there wasn't penetration of any kind as far as what she told us.  But this kind of thing is routine of course. 

She has another two appointments at the beginning of the week but then the plan is on Thursday for her to fly to a different province to be with my parents and my brother and his family at the family summer home.  She is desperate to see her two younger cousins and I want her to have something nice right now.  

I have so many things I have to figure out from banking and rerouting some of my direct deposits out of our shared chequing account to possibly going on welfare while I look for work.   I need to see if my school can extend my internship for a couple weeks so I have some stress free time to do what needs doing but I don't know how that will work.  

I am looking at moving soon and my parents are likely going to help with that.  

I am in this weird headspace when I am getting physical reactions to emotions, breaking down crying, clenching my teeth till my jaw hurts but inside I am like ice, completely numb.  It's the strangest sensation.  

My daughter is being amazing.  It's like the weight of the world is off her shoulders and I keep thinking of things she's told me in fits of anger about how she wished we never moved in with him, how she wished it was just the two of us.  And at the time I tried to convince her that we were better with him around, that he cared for her and that he made me happy, and now I know that I was saying this after he had abused her.  It makes me want to throw up.  I thought because I'd told her from the very beginning of the relationship that I would always believe her if he did anything to her and that she could always tell me, I thought that meant I was on top of everything, but I was so fucking blind!!! It makes me want to claw off his stupid fucking face.  

Ahem. 

So yeah, that's where things stand.  I am taking it one day at a time and that's all I can do."

6m65eo,1,2017-07-09,"Why are my teeth shifting? What can I do? PLUS, a temporary update on my retainers",clashofclans202,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/6m65eo/why_are_my_teeth_shifting_what_can_i_do_plus_a/,"Hey /r/Dentistry

Earlier this year (around February to April), I got my braces off after almost 5 years (yay!). I was given retainers to wear during the night while I was in bed (my orthodontist called them ""tooth pajamas"") and was told that if I didn't wear them regularly, my teeth would shift.

My orthodontist told me to wear the retainers 24/7 for the next 3 days and only take them out while eating and brushing my teeth. After that, I'd need to wear them for 8 hours every night. If I skipped a night, I could wear the retainers during the following day to make up for it. I did as he said for those first three days. 

I have NEVER forgotten to put my retainers on at any single night. I have ALWAYS worn them every single night since I got them and have never completely skipped a night.

When school was going on, I would put my retainers on at around 10:30-11:00 pm right after dinner (rarely at 12:00 am, and almost never after that) and then continue to do my homework and study (yes, I know my family eats dinner late).

Being a junior in high school, I had AP classes, standardized tests, and so much stress under my belt that I would often go to bed late. Therefore, putting my retainers on before I went to bed wouldn't be ideal. I woke up at 7:00 am every morning before heading out to school at 7:45 am so putting my retainers on at 1:00 or 2:00 am (or even after that if I had a big exam coming soon) wouldn't be a good idea as my retainers wouldn't be on for very long.

During weekends, I would sleep like a hog. After slogging all week, I deserved some extra sleep over the weekend. Hence, I would often wear my retainers for more than 8 hours every Friday night and Saturday night, and sometimes even on Sunday night. This was good because in case there was one or two days where I only wore my retainers for 6-7 hours that week, I could make it up over the weekend.

As school was about to end (and exams were about to start), I visited my orthodontist for a check-up. He told me that my teeth were looking good and that I should keep up the good work. My next meeting with him is some time in August or September if I remember correctly, maybe October.

I also visited my dentist around that time. I had no cavities and they also made no negative comments on my teeth, and just did my normal cleaning.

Finally, school ended. I spent the first week looking for summer internships and by starting to an online course. Even if I went to bed late that week, I woke up a bit late (my parents made me get up before 12 pm). Nothing was at stake by me waking up late. So I was wearing my retainers for the required hours for most of that week, if not longer.

The next week, I found an internship and got started right away. The internship (still ongoing) is from 9 am - 6 pm every weekday at the best web development and marketing company in the silicon valley. I am having fun and learning a lot as well.

Since the internship starts at 9 am and is quite a distance away from home, I wake up some time between 7:00 am and 7:30 am everyday and leave the house at 8:05. One of my parents drops me off at the train station 5 minutes away from home and I ride the train to work. My dad's office is nearby so if he needs to go to work early one of the days, he drops me off on his way so I can leave a bit later (morning traffic is something we have to deal with but we do reach faster than I would by train).

I usually go to bed at midnight on weekdays (sometimes 11 pm if I am really tired) and put my retainers on then. So I'm basically wearing them for 7-ish hours every weekday night. I used to be a bit naughty and go to bed at 1 am sometimes when my internship first started (for about 2 weeks) and only had my retainers on for 6-ish hours then. However, I soon realized that I was tired and not as productive as I could've been if I had more sleep, and didn't want to get fired (especially since getting internships as a high schooler is a challenge and I was so lucky to get one this good), so I made it a habit to go to bed at midnight or even before that every single night and that has been a habit for quite some time now, and I don't plan on breaking that habit.

On July 4, my family went to San Francisco and didn't come home until 1 am, so that's the only exception where I broke the rule.

Yes, I know I am often missing around 5-10 hours of retainer time every business week, Monday to Friday, (closer to five), BUT I make it up as much as I can over the weekend. I try to sleep for 10 hours (sometimes more) every Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday night, to get 6 extra hours of retainer time total in addition to the required 8 hours per night. Sometimes I only sleep for 8.5-9 hours on a weekend night, but that's only if I have other plans.

Earlier today, I visited my dentist. Apparently, I needed a crown on my front tooth. Upon arrival, not only did I find out that I had THREE cavities, but that my teeth had also shifted a little. Nothing major, just a little. My dentist told me that I must not be wearing my retainers regularly. The truth is, I am. I tried explaining to my parents that I am wearing my retainers and making up the missed time as much as I can over the weekend, but they sided with my dentist more. 

I don't know what I should do. I am honestly shocked. This problem wasn't there when school was going on. 

Should I start wearing my retainers RIGHT after dinner on weekday nights like I did when school was going on (I'll take them off before brushing my teeth and then pop them back on, that is what I did during the school days)? Obviously over weekends, I can sleep late and wake up late morning and still get enough sleep, but I honestly don't mind wearing my retainers right after dinner and only taking them off to brush my teeth both before going to bed as well as in the morning if it helps me make up my missed retainer hours even more. I'll need to sacrifice my midnight snacks (I'm looking at you, pretzels and chips), but I don't mind if it means my teeth won't get any worse.

I could take them off for a bit if I decide to have a midnight snack and then pop them back on before I go brush my teeth for bed, but I don't have midnight snacks very often, unless I didn't have a good dinner, which doesn't happen a lot since my parents are both good cooks.

Unless I am traveling and am not home until late, I could bring back the habit of putting my retainers on right after dinner if that would help.

I would like your advice on this, too. Do you agree with my solution? Are you confused as to why this is happening to my teeth? Do you know why this is happening to my teeth? Do you have any other solutions? Do I need braces again (my teeth have only shifted very little, so it's not too late to get more disciplined)? I really hope not.

More than my dentists being unhappy with me, I am worried about my teeth getting all out of place again, like they were before I got braces.

I am ready to get more disciplined and don't mind sacrificing midnight snacks (unless dinner was completely unappetizing and i didn't eat much, which won't happen a lot).

Looking forward to your advice!

TL;DR: Been wearing retainers for a couple months now. Teeth were good at first, but are now slightly shifting, even though i wear retainers every night. I need advice on what to do. 

UPDATE: In the dentist appointment today, the dentist applied a temporary tooth on one of my top front teeth. This tooth is significantly larger than my other teeth and even the original tooth which the temporary tooth is on top of. The retainers for my top teeth won't even fit now! The bottom one is nice, tight, and snug, but the top one isn't, and that is a problem.

Here is a video of the situation: https://youtu.be/0szzWnsv0B0

I'll take an appointment with my orthodontist some time this week (hopefully Monday) to see what I can do. I know I have an internship, but this is pretty serious and I am more than ready to spend my lunch hour at the orthodontist office (his office is close to my office so it's not too big of a commute). 

Besides being more disciplined (or doing what else you guys suggest) in the long run, what can I temporarily do until I meet my orthodontist again and get this mess cleaned up?

Sorry for the long post, just kind of stressed out, and I've come to trust Reddit quite a bit recently. :D"
6m6elc,11,2017-07-09,How I almost got out but failed miserably (Again),Minjaze,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/6m6elc/how_i_almost_got_out_but_failed_miserably_again/,"A few months back, I made a couple of posts about me meeting a girl on FAdating. She was smart, funny, cute, kind, and just as nerdy and FA as I am - she was everything I ever wanted in someone. We seemed to hit it off pretty well and eventually I asked her out - and to my surprise, she said yes!

While we still haven't met irl yet, (Due to both of us not having enough money to travel that far) everything seemed to be going well. We talked every few days, played a game of Civ V, shared drawings, and she even opened up about her problems to me. Though, I kinda felt like I was putting in most of the effort. (Making plans, messaging first, etc)

After a few months have passed though, I made the mistake of getting attached and saying ""I love you"" something she couldn't say back. She then got all pissed at me over something I said out of context and wanted to take a week-long break. Right after I professed my love, too.

After the week was over, she seemed back to her usual self. Though later, she confessed that she was planning to look for internships in England and even Scotland - reducing the chance of us meeting even more. And now she's been far too busy to reply to me, (For weeks now) even after I've been begging her to set aside at least one day where we can spend time together. She claims (In the one message she actually sent back) that she actually still cares about me, but I hardly believe it cause no-one is busy 24 hours a day. (She's on summer break now, too) 

I haven't officially ""broken up"" with her or anything, but it's pretty clear that this is heading nowhere. Should have learned from my last attempt at a LDR.

I work as a pharmaceutical scientist for a company I love, which took a lot of hard work to achieve as a younger female scientist. Unfortunately, the hard work that got me here today was not by choice, but by a means of pure survival.

I was 10 years old when Nfather started ""spanking"" me-his definition of ""spanking"" was duct taping 2 ping pong paddles together and drilling holes in them so they hit harder and faster. Bruises were left each and every time. I think the right word is ""beating"".... whenever he would ""spank"" me (at least once a month)-my Nmother did nothing. She'd leave me alone with him, even though I'm positive she could hear the struggle (I put up a fight, no way was I just going to stand there and take his hits). ""Reasons"" for the spankings ranged from me not wanting eggs for breakfast, not wanting my Nmother to do my hair, and me telling my brother about a change in vacation plans (just as a few examples). Everything was always my fault-and I became increasingly aware of this as my Nmother would kick me out of the house as I got older (especially between the ages of 17-21). The irony was that my parents would call the cops to come and drag me out of whichever friend's house I was staying several hours after kicking me out. 
So, you can imagine the confusion that ensued when my Nmother's best friend's husband took an interest in me (I was 15 when it started-he was 39). It felt good to have a male figure that I looked up to for so many years seem like he cared for me. Well, that ""caring"" quickly turned into molestation and rape, which didn't stop until my boyfriend walking in on the guy raping me. To be honest-I never told anyone up until that point because the guy said I would send him to jail-and how could I do that ""to the one man who cared about me""?. My parents also never gave me the ""if someone touches you, do this..."" talk. 
That summer (I was 16) was hell. My parents went back and forth about believing me, my Nmother got so mad at me that she tried to run me over in a parking lot when my boyfriend's mother confronted her. My parents would show up at my friends' houses and literally drag me out of the house. They had me locked up in a mental institution for 4 days because they ""didn't know how to handle me"". Mind you, this entire time I was a straight A student in all AP and Honors classes, who was on the Varsity swim and tennis teams, while working in the winter time as a cashier at Food Lion and in the summer time as a pool and ocean lifeguard. I didn't even touch drugs until my undergrad years!!! Yeah-I was clearly a problem.
Once in college, I did everything I could to avoid going home-breaks were spent at friends' homes, I studied abroad in Asia one summer, I spent another summer as an intern for the EPA in a state on the opposite coast of my parent's house, I did summer research....and the list goes on. 

The upside is that my desperation to avoid my parents set me up for major success in career world. The downside is now I have a son, whom I desperate to protect. Every time I look at him, my heart breaks. I would walk through fire for this kid-how could my own parents forsake me over and over again? Three weeks ago, I stopped talking to them all together. I've blocked their phone numbers and haven't responded to their emails. They had written my husband out of the will and left me a whole $1 (they're millionaires BTW) after I refused to leave my husband. Hubby is going through treatment for PTSD he developed after serving three tours in Iraq as a US Marine in the Infantry. But hubby is a good husband (has never hit me) and an even more amazing father. My Nparents just want to be rid of him because my husband has stood up to them several times about the rapes, how they treat our dogs when they visit, and their unhealthy obsession with money. They also HATE that he comes from a poor family. I don't care about the inheritance, but I'm not leaving my husband of 4 years. He's done nothing wrong and he's a good man.

Today, we wake up to the cops pounding on our door to do a wellness check. Everything goes smoothly, and we get on with our day. Tonight, I receive a text from my younger brother that ""mom isn't doing well"". I know what that means-she's suicidal again ( a constant theme in my adolescent years). But I don't want to talk to her. Why is it always my job to lift her up?!?? When will she, for once, be there for me?!?? I don't mean to sound selfish, but I feel bad that I don't feel bad about not wanting to talk to her.

Please give me support/thoughts/opinions. Thank you for reading my post.

6m7fpe,96,2017-07-09,Shelby Stories Post-Vegas [40M/22F] (Update 1),Jameson77,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/6m7fpe/shelby_stories_postvegas_40m22f_update_1/,"Hey all. It’s Sunday morning and I’m home by myself – Shelby left about an hour ago to head to some event/fundraiser in which she is participating, and I’m honestly just sitting here tired and amazed by this tiny little sexy package that may soon be, if she not already is, my girlfriend. That’s a HUGE leap, I get that. But I said it, and I’ll explain more shortly. So here we go…

Since we got back from Vegas, I had two very limited interactions with Shelby in person. I explained them in prior comments, but basically she came to me at work, sneaking in to touch base, and once to kiss me, before leaving for the day or going about her job. I have to say, this impressed me. At 22, she knows when to be proper and when to be……the opposite of proper. And I have no problem any time I am around her, but I respect that she wants to come get a kiss or flirt, make it fast, then take off, leaving me to work without worry of being caught and leaving me wanting more. That said, I had not gotten to be with her, to talk to her, to touch her, to smell her, to feel her, to taste her since we got back from Vegas, and it was all I could do to stay sane. This is where the story begins, but first…a tiny bit of background.

I have two couples, neighbors, that are good friends, who I see outside of work. First, there’s Debbie and Brent, and then there is Matt and Erica. Debbie and Brent are both around my age….around 40ish, and I think Debbie may be under 40, but not by much. Matt is 42 and Erica is 33. So I invited them to cookout this weekend at my place, because I have a nice pool, outdoor seating areas with multiple fire pits, and an outdoor kitchen. It’s really my prize possession and I love spending time there. Debbie has a friend, Danielle, who is probably late 30s, but I’ve never asked, so I don’t know the exact age. My point here is that Shelby is 11-20 years younger than the rest of my friends that were there tonight. In addition, I have dated younger girls before, in their early 30s, and the girls usually tease me, and so I expected some of that. They didn’t give me any breaks.

Yesterday, Shelby texted me late in the day and said, “What time tomorrow.” I told her the time, and she asked if she could come early. “I want to suck your cock.” OMG, yes. Yes please. I responded, “Of course baby girl.” I couldn’t wait. I spent the day cleaning my house and preparing food, and I won’t lie…I was ready to go early. But, Matt and Erica showed up before Shelby did, and there I was…crap. No blowjob for me. Not early at least.

Shelby arrived next. She looked great. I was preparing food when the doorbell rang. I went to open it and saw this beautiful girl, wearing what I call fake sequined shorts that were silver and pink in color, with a black tank top, and I could see glimpses of her red and white striped bikini underneath. Also, she had this hair braid that ran from the top center of her head, around the side behind one ear, before being gathered with the rest of her hair into sort of a messy ponytail. The girl has this cute/hot dichotomy thing going and it did not disappoint. I opened the door and put my arm around her, while she sort of stepped in and melted herself against me, and we kissed briefly, almost a chaste kiss, I’m sure only because my friends were there and it would have been maybe too much PDA too soon. She lifted her bag and asked where she can put it and I go, “In here, come on,” and lead her upstairs toward my room. As we got there, I took the bag from her and sat it inside, then turned, now outside view of the others, and I pulled her to me. She easily put her arms over my shoulders and crossed her wrists behind my neck and got to deeply kiss her for the first time since we got back. I pressed my hand at her lower back, pressing her to me, and she sort of mewled approval, grinning while she kissed me now, then pulling away with a lingering smaller kiss, and another. It was the first real kiss we had since Vegas, and everything still felt right. As she turned to go back out front, I swatted her ass gently, to which she turned over her shoulder, grinning her approval. I wanted her right then.

I introduced Shelby to Erica, and they hit it off quickly. Erica had a million questions….how do you know James, where did you meet, what do you do, where do you live, on and on. I said nothing, but listened as I prepared food and talked to Matt, but at one point Matt goes, “Would you leave her alone, she doesn’t want an inquisition,” which pumped Erica’s brakes a little bit, for which I was grateful. From then on, the two girls were like best friends. I was amused at some of her answers though. She told Erica we met “through his [my] work,” and she also told her she was in television, handling account promotions and on-air support, which she is at her internship. If she wanted to tell her we work together, that would have been fine, but she was being respectful and not putting it all out there right away. Sharp girl.

The girls went to check out the pool and patio area and generally sort of hung out, while Matt and I kept cooking and chatting over beers. Matt only once goes, “Sooooo……Shelby’s nice, yeah?” I said she was. And he goes, “Man, enjoy that,” and winked, and conversation moved on like normal. Debbie and Brent soon arrived and as soon as they sat down a bag of food they brought, Debbie introduced herself to Shelby. She didn’t quiz her like Erica had, but I could tell she was being nosy and sizing up the new girl in my life…..that’s how Debbie thinks and what she’s like. I got everyone drinks as they wanted them and proceeded to cook some serious burgers, vegetables, and shrimp. Soon enough, Erica wanted to get in the pool and Shelby did too. The guys and Debbie sort of continued sitting where we were, and Erica peeled off a cover up she was wearing. At the same time, Shelby sort of stood and leaned on my shoulder as she undid these strappy shoes she had on, then took off her tank top, then her shorts. She walked away from us toward the pool, pulled her hair out of its tie in the back and ran her hand through her hair, quickly shaking loose the braid and pushing her hair back. I’m certain the guys watched her the whole way…I know I did.  When she jumped in, out of earshot, Debbie goes, “James….” Here it comes, I thought. “What school bus did you get her from?” I sort of laughed and she goes, “She’s charming. I just want to know if she has her driver’s license yet?” And that’s how it was going to be with Debbie. 

The little pool party continued and eventually we all made it to the pool. Nothing really happened, as we sort of cooled off and drank and hung out. She did wrap her arms around my neck and I sort of gave her a piggy back ride around the pool a bit, before she would peel away, swim a bit, and swim back to me. Occasionally, she would slip a little kiss my way. At one time, she was lying across a float pad, sort of kicking around the pool, paddled up to me, and gave me a longer, more serious kiss. I was glad she was comfortable in the group. After dark, we had all kind of cleaned up the food and then sat drinking near a fire pit and things wound down. (HERE’S THE FUN PART)  Debbie and Brent left and after a while, Erica was tired and she and Matt took off. They walked out of my gate and around the front of the house and when the motion light went off, Shelby immediately climbed into the lounge chair I was in and crawled beside me, her body stretched against mine.

“Hey baby,” I said, my hand snaking down her back and down to cup her little ass – my favorite feature. 

“Hey,” she said, putting on her little girl voice. It’s so cute because she uses it at times when she’s at least acting vulnerable, or just being sweet. And it’s hot because you know she’s boiling just beneath that and available to you. We started kissing, making out like teenagers, and my cock was hard and pressed against her bikini. Her skin was cool from the water, but warm against me, and she smelled like coconut. As we continued kissing, I ran my hand into the back of her bikini bottom, rubbed her ass a time or two, then slid my hand low to press my middle finger squarely on her little asshole. 

“Mmm,” she gave a breathy moan of approval and pressed her hips back a bit. I rubbed my finger around a time or two then pressed the very tip inside. “I like that,” she said, as my other hand tugged her hair, allowing me to kiss her neck. I felt her goosebumps erupt along her chest and side where she was pressed against my. She gave a little chuckle. “Goddamn you make me feel good,” she said. I kissed her neck again and kept the pressure on her little brown star. We sort of stayed like that a few moments until she sort of lifted up from where we were kissing, my hand still squarely holding her ass. “Take me inside,” she said. I unwrapped from her and she stood up, before I took her hand and led her upstairs. 

We got to my room and I kissed her, my thumb in the middle of her throat, the rest of my hand wrapping around the side of her neck, sort of a choke hold, but not putting any pressure on. I gently edged her down to the bed. “Weren’t you going to suck my cock,” I said, stepping toward her and opening my trunks. She said nothing, took my cock out and immediately started to do just that. My hand went again to the side of her neck and I started using her mouth a little bit. I couldn’t stop, and I got to fuck her face, if gently, long enough to cum, and I got to see her cute little grimace that wrinkles her nose every time she swallows me, and the grin that follows. “My turn little girl,” I said, pushing her back on the bed, crawling between her thighs, and tugging her bikini to the side as I ate her pussy for all she was worth. I went on like this for what felt like forever. I love seeing and feeling her stomach rise and fall, tighten and release, over and over as I eat her pussy, and by the time she had quivered herself out and I had her cream all over my lips, I was hard again and needed her. I stood up and tugged her bikini off, then peeled the top off too. I kissed her hard, knowing she was tasting herself, and I felt her arms around my neck and her legs spread around me a split second before she accepted me in one smooth thrust. 

“Fuck baby you feel so good,” I said. “I missed this.” I started fucking her in a steady rhythm, not rough and not soft, enough to make our bodies slap together and fill the room with the sounds of two people going at it. She pressed her hips up to take me and gave as good as she got. We went at it furiously for a while, maybe ten minutes, before she tensed up, quivered, and her voice cracked then went away, her face contorting into a silent scream as she released cum all over my cock. I raised up and smiled, my hands rubbing her firm tummy and thighs as she came down. 

“Oh my….oh my god,” she breathed heavily. “Oh god that felt great.” I grinned, said nothing and started fucking her again, increasing my speed until I was ready to explode. “Not in me,” was all she said, and I obliged, pulling out and unloading all over her stomach. We collapsed and cuddled, chatting about nothing and everything for a while. We weren’t done, but it was then that we had a talk about the sex. I’ll hit the highlights:

“I think I need to get on birth control.”  - Shelby
“Were you going to cum in my face (in Vegas)? I would let you.”  -Shelby
“I love playing with your ass. I want inside it.” –James
“I know you do.”  -Shelby
“Your pussy is so tight,” –James
“It better be, I work hard to stay cute,” –Shelby

After she said the last, I rolled her to her back and slid inside her again as we kissed. This time we fucked, at first, a bit slower. As we did, and since we had been talking, I decided to make a bit of a move, using a tactic suggested to me by a Redditor. As I was fucking her, I nibbled her ear, then her neck, then leaned in to kiss her. As I pulled back we were face to face and I was just looking in her eyes, starting to thrust faster. “You know (thrust) last week you (thrust) mentioned me (thrust) fucking (thrust) Madison (thrust).”

“Uh huh,” she moaned, breathing hard. I’m not sure if she thought I was just dirty talking again or what, but she was taking my cock and agreeing with whatever. Great. 

“Is that (thrust) something (thrust) you’d like, baby?” She arched her back and closed her eyes. I felt her tense up a bit. I thought I’d lost her and we’d finish and that would be that. It just seemed like she was shutting down. “Look at me,” I whisper. “Baby look at me.” She opened her eyes and she was back, her hips grinding up to meet my thrusts. “Is that something you’d like?” I ask. She sort of breathlessly nodded. “Would you like to eat her pussy while I fuck you?” I ask. Another nod and an “uh huh.” We were fucking hard now and I wasn’t going to ask for a threesome…I just turned her over, entered her from behind, curled over her where I could fuck her and talk in her ear. “Good girl,” I said as I fucked her hard. “Good little girl. Just relax….you feel amazing. That’s a good little girl,” I said. She stretched her arms high so her upper body was pressed to the bed, her ass still up. She buried her face in the covers and took everything I gave her. I reached forward when I was about to cum, grabbed her hair and arched her back. “I want to cum inside you,” I now said, right in her ear. 

“No, baby,” she said between groans. 

“Oh yeah,” I said. 
“No,” she repeated. I thrust again, then again, then pulled out, pressed her into the bed again, and came all over her back. I blasted 6-7 times and made a huge mess. We caught our breath and she had not forgotten what started things off to be so hot. “You must like that idea,” she said as I cleaned her with a towel and she rolled to her back. I just kissed her. “I don’t think that’s a good idea,” she said. I didn’t press it anymore. I wasn’t going to whine and insist it was. And I wasn’t going to agree it was not a good idea. I know in the moment of fucking her, Shelby seemed to think it was hot. But I was curious to see how she would react, and in doing so, there was no harm done to whatever this is that we have going on.

Now for the grand finale, so to speak. We laid around and even dozed off for a while. We woke up around 6am when I went to spoon her and sort of pressed her to me. She turned to kiss me over her shoulder. We laid there a couple minutes, both awake, but saying nothing. She turned over her shoulder one more time. 

“You want to fuck me again?” She asked. She grinned as I turned her to face me and mounted her. I felt her long, firm thighs in my hands as I opened her up and quickly found my home in her bare slit once again. I got into a steady rhythm and was going at her pretty good. She didn’t starfish, but she was clearly trying to get me off and not worried about cumming herself. So I just sort of pounded away as she moaned. I wanted to take her up on her earlier offer.

“I want to cum on your face,” I said, still fucking her. Okay, she said. I leaned in to kiss her, just to suggest I respect her and am about her before fucking fast once more and rounding third to home. After a few more moments, I pulled out just in time, climbed over her so that I straddled her chest, and hit her with several ropes from her chin, across her pretty nose, and over her forehead. I painted her and left a cummy mess. When I was done, she kind of gave a forced grin, wiped it from her eyes with one hand (which she then licked away), and gave me an easy pat on my hip as if to say, “Okay, get off me and get a towel,” which I did. After she cleaned up I kissed her deeply and we spent a bit more of the morning, off and on, making out and just sort of cuddling.

“I really like you,” she said at one point. “I hope you want to keep me.” I thought that was an interesting, sweet comment. I hope you want to keep me. Not marry me, not love me, not keep fucking me like a dirty fuck toy, just…..keep me. I told her I hope she wants to keep ME. We fell asleep until her phone alarm went off. About an hour ago, she got up and took a quick shower. She came out in a cute summer dress that is sort of violet and white, wearing some simple wedge heels. She sort of hiked one leg up on the bed so she could lean in and kiss me. She’s on her way to a professional women’s fundraiser breakfast. 

“Thanks for inviting me,” she said. “I had fun.” I told her I did too. “You weren’t rough with me,” she said. I couldn’t tell if she sounded happy for that or perplexed by it. And I didn’t ask if I should have been. I just asked when I was going to see her again. “Tonight,” she said. Oh really? 

“Yeah?” I asked. 

“If you want to,” she said. “How about I cook for you?” Awesome. She said she’d text me and figure out what time she can come over. Then kissed me deeply a couple times before I got up, threw on some shorts, and walked her out to her car.

So that’s last night. She continues to amaze, stun, and turn me on like nothing else. She continues to be this amazing woman-child that gets me off so much and steals my heart at the same time.

After I graduated college I went back home in search of a job since my two internships failed to materialize since they weren't typical internships (I coached college hockey two years for my internship). I picked up the first job I could at the beginning of the summer to make some money to save for when I found a ""big boy"" job and possibly had to move.

I started working at a very high end resort in overnight housekeeping. I had three degrees from college and even made the Dean's list most semesters, but here I am working as a ""lowly housekeeping attendant"". After about 3 months of doing this work I was approached by the Front Desk manager who had seen me out and about being overly friendly to everyone and always having a smile on my face (I was a pretty average employee, not exceptional, but not the worst). The Night Auditor was leaving and they needed someone to take his place. I accepted his offer and transferred to the front desk after giving Housekeeping my two weeks’ notice (meanwhile, I am still looking for a job in Sports Management).

A year goes by as the Night Auditor before a supervisor role opens up at the Front desk and I apply and get the position. 5 years later and working my butt off by being PM supervisor and MOD 5/6 days a week had finally paid off. Our biggest competitor gave me a call since I had my profile on Linkedin and they were looking for their own GSM. My GSM had been there for 7 years and his boss had been at our place for 20 years, they weren't going anywhere and I really needed to make more money, but I was no longer looking for a job in Sports because I have finally found my true calling, Guest Services at Resorts/Hotels.

The new Resort brought me in for an interview and after about a month I got the job there as their GSM. There was also an understanding my boss was going to be retiring soon so I would also be groomed for her position. Fast forward one year and I am now the Director of Guest Services of a huge multi-billion dollar Resort. I started off my Hospitality career by scrubbing shitters at 3AM, because you have to start somewhere to get where you want to go.

Two months as the DOGS we had this pretentious group in house that treated all the staff like shit and belittled anyone that they were able to. I'm walking down the hall and I hear a lady who has the ""I want to speak to your manager haircut"" screaming at a room attendant because she didn't get bath towels when she wanted them. As I approach closer the mother turns to here 14 year old daughter and says ""this is why you go to college, so you don't turn out like this dumbass"". Not only did this make my blood boil because it's a shitty thing to say to someone, but this Housekeeper is one of our best on staff and one of my friends.

I confront the guests and ask her if everything is ok because I heard some yelling and I could see our housekeeper visibly upset. She said she didn't get her towels and she didn't have time to mess around with our incompetent staff.  I grabbed two towels off the Housekeepers cart, pushed her cart aside, and placed them in the guest’s bathroom. The guest pretentiously stated that it was a good thing I was there to help because clearly I had an education. I told the guest I hope they enjoy the rest of their stay and told her to never talk to our staff that way again. As her face started to change to ""but I want my pony now"" I looked over at her daughter and told her ""I run the entire Front of House of this Resort.  I graduated from college with three degrees, but you have to start somewhere. I started off cleaning bathrooms at a Hotel when everyone else was sleeping. One day, the person helping you, may be your boss someday"".

I gave the pretentious Mom my business card and said if she has any questions; please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any comments, questions, or concerns.

TL;DR Just because someone doesn't have an illustrious job title, doesn't mean they aren't educated or aren't motivated. Be nice to people you come into contact with, because one day they may be your boss or your children's boss when they become adults.

I'm a 20 year old male studying computer science in New Zealand &amp; am graduating next year. I'm wondering though how I would get on if I applied for work in Dubai once I finish? I did an internship last summer &amp; will do another one at the end of this year, I have a pretty decent portfolio of personal projects (using java/c#/css/php/html/python/javascript &amp; more) and will only add to it between now and then. My grades are not outstanding but I consider myself to be a pretty outgoing and easy to talk to person which I think will definitely help me. Ideally, after some time, I would like to be in a more of a leader role where I would communicate ideas between product owners/partners and the development team.

Any advice from a fellow redditor for my situation would be greatly appreciated!

6m8m0c,3,2017-07-09,"(20M) Girlfriend(19F) has never visited me and its causing a lot of issues, I don't really know how to proceed and feel I'm being self centred. Any advice going forwards?",MaxxieMac97,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/6m8m0c/20m_girlfriend19f_has_never_visited_me_and_its/,"Hey there!
Me and my girlfriend have been together one year and eight months. She lives in the US and I live in the UK.
I visited her for the firs time in March of 2016. The trip was great, everything was wonderful, we originally planned to take it in turns. I visit her and she visits me next. It never really happened like that. I got back from my 6th trip two weeks ago. She has never came to visit me.
Now people have different circumstances, that much I understand, but I feel its really stunted the growth of our relationship in a major way.
I've visited her six times. I've tried to be courteous to her family and at the time they seemed to like me. When I leave, however, they trash talk me and make fun of me being long distance. It effects her on a severe level to the point she told them we broke up to avoid their remarks (her friends know we are together because I spoke to them last trip).
I feel her telling her parents we broke up just proves them right if anything and sets us back in their estimations. She has asked to visit me before and they said no. They think the UK is unsafe and she would be bombed on the plane. They also said that were she to be sexually assaulted I'd run away. I find this line of reasoning not only worrying but emotionally manipulative to my girlfriend as they are scaring her into submission.
She goes to an expensive college in the US and the parents foot the bill. This means she has no student debt at all. This is why she won't stand up to them, because she thinks they will pull out of paying her college tuition. I've tried to explain that parents would not do that to their child and that she is a woman who can decide her own holiday destinations and that her fear of standing up to them is a symptom of a larger problem. She says when she moves out she will visit me. Again, I said she will be financially indebted to them for life and that reality may hit hard. She will have bills when she moves out, rent, a full time job. I don't think she understands how real life is (I work full time at a start up and do college at night so I know the stress of work life balance myself)
My parents have always been on board with the relationship, albeit a little worried about the distance, they see I am happy and thus are happy in turn. There was tension at the start but I talked, communicated,and won them over. Had I not the first trip would not have happened, had I not we would not be together.
They are less on board now. They are sick of me making excuses for my girlfriend. Having me say ""she is coming soon"" isn't enough. They want to meet my girlfriend. The fact she won't visit me has lowered her in their viewpoint. They think she is all talk. I tried to explain but its hard to make excuses when it bothers me too.
I feel that because she hasn't visited me its only natural she doesn't see me as a person. She has no context of my life. No idea how I live, no idea what my friends are like. I feel this is a crucial part and the fact we can't have it, honestly, kills me.
She may be doing an internship in paris and will fly for a day to me but if that does happen its not enough. All my trips equate to three months in total. A day because she is close anyway seems so cheap.
Her parents have never let me stay with them. I have to pay for flights and airbnb. It comes to 1k + each trip. She doesn't help. Sure, she will pay for food and tickets to things but its not close to 50/50. She thinks because she works weekends she should not pay but I tried to explain that she gets tips as she is a waitress and makes 300+ a night most nights so the days don't work out the same. She didn't understand.
Her parents have never let her sleep over with me. I've been with her over a year and a half and I've not slept with her. My own girlfriend.
Her parents have split up this week. Her, her two siblings, and her mom moved to a one bedroom. We can't skype anymore. Her dad was the one who defended me and tried to convince the mom. I actually went to baseball with him and we hit it off. The dad was an alcholic however so they left him. The mom hates me, tries to pay my gf to stop talking to me, and makes jokes about me which are relayed back.
The mom now has full foothold.
My dad said I can't visit again this year and it didn't dissapoint me that much, I didn't put up a fight, because I can't help but feel I'm fighting for someone who won't lift a finger for me.
What can I do? is it selfish of me to think like this given I don't live in her situation?does the fault lie with her? Am I a bad person for feeling like its one way?"

I understand this and I know that a lot of partners aren't okay with this, but there are two situations in particular that make this very hard for me.  
1. When I was fifteen, I ran away from home and ended up moving in with then-boyfriend *Dylan. I didn't speak to my real family again for three years, meaning Dylan's family basically adopted me and I have lived there, called their home my home, and called them my parents for six years now. Me and Dylan don't have a relationship or really even a friendship anymore, but we do occasionally end up at home at the same time or at the same family gathering.  
2. I have always tried to maintain a friendship after a relationship if it was a mutual breakup or nothing else went sour otherwise. Not necessarily see each other/hangout, but generally keep in touch. So, I had about three friends who were exes. One of my best friends, *Aaron, we never dated, but did hookup once or twice.
  
One time, Aaron got high and tried hitting on me/asking me for pics, before me and Reese had decided to be anything official. I brushed it off because it has happened before and I always say no. Reese told me that Aaron was a shitty person for saying that because Aaron is good friends with an ex I don't speak to anymore (bad breakup), and that if I ever wanted to be with him (Reese), Aaron would have to go. It was sad, because I considered Aaron a very good friend. This is someone whose family I kept in contact with, attended multiple holiday dinners and etc., but I came to the conclusion he was only hitting me up for sex and that wasn't a good friend, so we quit talking.  
  
We were able to come to a compromise about Dylan, to an extent. About two months ago, while I was visiting home from college, Dylan was too (separate college). The first night, I paid for a hotel room to hopefully avoid the situation altogether. But he ended up staying longer so I did have to go home at some point. I hungout with Reese as much as possible to avoid being at home, however, this also meant avoiding my family. The night Dylan and I stayed, I slept in the guest bedroom and Dylan slept on the couch. This was only one night.  When Dylan's parents found out I was avoiding staying at home to make Reese happy, they found it very controlling and they were unhappy.  
  
We broke up not too soon after this, because I decided last minute to take an internship that would put us four states apart. It was a very nasty breakup and he said a lot of hurtful things. I was upset during this, and relied heavily on my friends/family and told them everything he was saying and what I should do about it and etc. Needless to say, friends and family are not cool with Reese.  
  
I decided to give Reese a second chance, and things seemed to get a lot better but at first, it was rough. He didn't trust any males at all, which made it hard to interact with the other interns (predominantly males at a large company). There were a couple of times where I had to explain in-depth why I was eating lunch with guys. (The reason always being either that all of the interns on the floor were getting lunch or that some interns recognized me eating alone and decided to sit with me.) But, we got past this. He quit asking me who I was eating lunch with or anything to do with work, and he said he would trust me. He even made the drive to come stay with me in my internship city for awhile. While he was here, everything was great. During this time together, he asked me to officially be his girlfriend and we exchanged i love yous.  
  
There were still some underlying issues: I couldn't tell Dylan's family that Reese was visiting. They were under the impression once I moved away, we would be done and he would be out of the picture. Telling them would anger them and disappoint them. For awhile, Mila and Lauren would ignore me anytime I brought Reese up. We talked it out, and I can still talk to them about Reese, but only the good things. I'm afraid if I say anything bad, they will say ""i told you so, what did you expect,"" and never accept him. I still feel like everything has changed because I'm keeping such a big part of my life on the down low.  
  
But other than that, everything was great up until last week. An ex (from 2013/2014) that I considered a friend and the last time we had spoken had a girlfriend, sent me a drunk text around 3am, stating that he still cared about me, wish that we were as close as we used to be, and wanted to hangout more before we left college and went our separate ways. By the time I had woken up around 8am, he had already sent an apology acknowledging it was inappropriate. Reese was asleep, and I didn't want to wake him up to tell him nor did I want to argue, so I waited until later in the evening in what feels like the worst mistake ever. Reese said that I was dishonest and that this was a huge setback in our relationship and that how could he trust me if I didn't tell him stuff like that. He wanted me to respond and say that I had a boyfriend and that he needed to back off, but this ex knew I was with Reese and had already apologized, so I opted not to answer. Reese was unhappy I didn't answer. It is awkward for me, but it doesn't infuriate me. I don't want to engage in any in depth conversations with him, but we do share a friend group and I don't want to remove myself from it or make a scene over a drunk text. It's still kind of an issue.
  
Three days later, another ex (*Christian) text me to ask where I've been. It's been three months since we've text last, and the last conversation was while Reese was being very nasty to me. Christian and I dated in high school (2012/2013), went to separate colleges and have maintained minimal contact since, but still catch up if we are in the same town. Christian has been in a relationship with a girl for close to a year, very public, very committed. I am 100% sure he has only a platonic view of me. I told Reese that he had text me, but all he did was ask for a picture and upon seeing him saying ""if you cheated on me with him, i would just laugh at you."" I didn't answer Christian.. it was strange, as he is such a good friend and he doesn't deserve to be ignored, but I am trying to make this relationship with Reese work.  
  
Of course, today, Reese left from visiting with me and not too long afterwards, Aaron text me after a long time to send me a message of something he thought was funny. I learned from not telling Reese a message last time, so I immediately screenshot it and send it to Reese. He freaked out on me. I was so upset because I feel trapped. If I didn't tell him, it would've been dishonest. If i did tell him, he would still get mad because i haven't ""gotten rid of these people I've been with."" I can't complain to my friends or family bc they would just say ""duh."" I personally don't have an interest in speaking with Aaron because I am mad for how our own friendship ended, but I wouldn't do it now anyways. So, again, I didn't answer. Reese wasn't happy with this either, saying that ""you never go against these people, even if they did you wrong.""  
  
I am sad that I cannot tell my friends/family the truth, I am sad that I can't even try to repair a friendship with Aaron and I have to ignore one with Christian. I have never really cut someone off/ended a friendship unless they did something to deserve it. It also doesn't help that while I am adjusting to removing these friends from my life, Reese feels as though I am completely weird/unnatural to stay in contact with any exes and tells me that he never had this problem before and that his previous girlfriends had always cut off contact with anyone from their past because they loved him.  
  
So, am I truly wrong for doing this? I don't have an ulterior motives, they are exes for a reason: a relationship with them is unfeasible. I wouldn't touch them for any reason, I just considered them friends. I feel like any friendship with a guy I've had is dead, friendships with my female friends are strained, and I'm living a lie to my family. How can I manage these relationships and fix them before I end up isolated and outcast, because I feel like that's what's gonna happen. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My current boyfriend has a serious issue with me communicating at all with anyone I've ever slept with. Some of the people I've slept with are/were good friends. My family and close friends that are girls don't like him either. I feel trapped."

However, Statics is tripping me up...it is my third time taking it, and due to some unforeseen circumstances, I may not be able to use Grade forgiveness for this attempt. I would need to pass this time with an A, but the highest I can get as of now is a B, which I think is possible, but not good enough.

My previous catalog year allowed more than 3 attempts for a class, however, an advisor told me to change it to the 2015 catalog year. No rush, but I did it asap anyway, which may have been a mistake. A new rule for newer years, is that any more than 3 attempts result in getting kicked out of the College of Engineering at UCF. I have only 9 classes to take left after Statics, and have completed all but 4 of my IE classes (two are tech electives, one is senior design). 

With statics being an F last semester, my overall GPA dropped from a 3.00 to a 2.95 (I did some damage to it my first two years)...my major GPA is around a 3.33, received my ASQ yellow belt certification, and I've held two IE internships. Being that I am close to graduation and my experience, I would appeal if it came to that.

However, if I wanted to transfer to USF, would they still allow me in their college of engineering? If so, what are my chances of being admitted? I'd really like to finish off my engineering degree and not have to start in degree just because of one class :( I've invested so much into it.

Basically I meet with them a few times a week to talk and help with their conversation skills, help with any writing assignments they may have, help with campus life, and I also show them things going on in the city and nearby area as well as participate in a few cultural events. I also took a Japanese class and have been teaching myself (still a beginner).

Other than that, I feel like it's all I got. My major is computer science and I'm a software developer now. I've been thinking of getting TEFL certified online (one requiring a practicum, which I've been told I can do at my old University). Most people say it's not worth it unless you want to continue after JET, but I feel like it might be needed since my profession is so far removed from teaching. If I can save myself the money and find other things, that would be ideal though.

I can extrapolate things from my software job and previous internships I guess. The attention to detail and patience coding requires. I also work closely with Business Analysts on project requirements, so my job does require some people skills and pro activeness. 

Should I just continue doing what I'm doing and hope for the best? I guess I don't know how I would stack up to the average applicant."

Another one is I'm out hiking and meet some guys where I get tied up and someone posts saying that a slut needs to be used as strangers come and have fun.

6mb4ml,1,2017-07-09,Cancer fucking Sucks,whos_that_girl-Jess,MyParentHasCancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyParentHasCancer/comments/6mb4ml/cancer_fucking_sucks/,"So dad has cancer and it really sucks. Like, the full range of “sucks” from the kind of sucks where you feel the slight “Aw man, I just stubbed my toe … this sucks” to the “My entire world feels like its falling apart and all I can do is sit here and cry, this really fucking sucks”. And, I don’t know what to do about it. I feel utterly out of control with the whole situation. He was diagnosed in October after having brain surgery of a tumor that turned out to be cancerous, and from then I don’t know what the hell I have been doing. Everything is a blur and I have such a wide range of emotions that I just push down and don’t even want to deal with. 

	I guess I should start by saying my dad is the fucking best. We have always related so much more than I ever had with my mom. Don’t get me wrong, my mother is amazing and eccentric in all the most amazing ways, but I have always been more like my dad than my mom (to my mom’s chagrin). Anyways, this has completely changed since the diagnosis and it is really fucking with me. I’ll return to this later I guess because it deals with religion and his whole personality since the cancer thing, and that seems a little too heavy of a topic to cover right now, but either way it has truly screwed up my dad and I’s relationship and that is the last thing I wanted to happen when I’m constantly worried if I’ll ever see the guy again. 

	I guess that is why I decided to type all this out, I am honestly terrified I’ll never see him again. Honestly crying while writing this, but hopefully my sarcasm and general sass covers the fact that I feel like I’m dying inside. I love him, I mean for fuck’s sake he is my dad, so I guess that makes sense. But for some reason I honest to god believe that I might never see him again and that scares the living shit out of me. I know cancer doesn’t work like that, and if he dies it will be a slow sad death, but I still can’t shake the feeling that whenever I leave him that it’ll be the last time I ever get to see him. 

The irony is that him dying quickly (if he is to die that is, which of course is the WORST case scenario) would honestly be the best. I don’t want him to have to suffer through the agony of cancer… it sucks. I have never had it, but I know it sucks. You’re constantly tired, which he already is, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. There is the losing of hair from the insane medication, there’s the withering away and becoming a sad wisp of a person, and there’s being nauseous all the time, yada yada yada…. It’s the worst. Everyone knows cancer is the fucking worst. 

But yeah, I worry I’ll never see him again. This causes me to feel insanely guilty every time I have an opportunity to go home but choose to stay in my apartment because I have some menial task to do on my day off such as laundry, the dishes, or god forbid actually get to see one of my friends for the first time in forever. It’s just crazy because I feel so guilty for living my life, which is exactly the opposite of what he wants. I even took an internship that let me stay close to him, relatively, so I could see him more… despite the fact that the internship is in no way related to what I want to do with my life, and honestly would surprise me if it helped me get a job at all. But whatever, it was worth it to have the potential to drive and see him whenever my heart desires. Which sounds like I’m being sarcastic, but I’m not at all. I want to see him all the time. If he would say something like “Hey, I help you pay for your rent so therefore I feel entitled to stay with you on your couch for the summer” (which would mean my boyfriend would never come over, and thus eliminate my sex life), I would still say “Fuck yeah Dad, I would be over the moon happy to be able to see you everyday for the summer”. That’s how sad about this whole thing I am. I would give up fucking my insanely adorable and fuckable boyfriend just to hang out with my cancer ridden dad for the summer. 

So yeah, this whole thing sucks, and it takes nothing for me to go from being in a fantastic mood to literally sobbing like a child over it. I’m not even kidding, I started crying over a dog food commercial because of this. The dog was old and on the verge of dying, and in my head I thought “My dad isn’t even old enough to validate dying, but he might none the less” and I started sobbing like a baby. That is all it takes. Now, up until this whole diagnosis, I was a hard ass bitch. It took a lot to make me cry, like a whole lot. I worried I didn’t have normal emotions prior to this. But, now all it takes is a dumb dog commercial and I break down in tears. 

So yeah, that’s where I’m at right now. I don’t know how to deal with my emotions. I guess I never did, and it just took something like this to make me realize it. I love my dad, and I know this was an insane oversimplification of everything, but I thought typing it all out and sending it into the depths of the internet might help in some fucked up way. Peace out bitches *mic drop*

6mbkwc,1,2017-07-09,Skiers thumb and turf toe - questions,nwood2,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/6mbkwc/skiers_thumb_and_turf_toe_questions/,"Hello!

So I have two injuries, one to my thumb and one to my big toe. Below is some background of how they happened?

Skiers thumb: fell on some slippery stairs last October with awful pain and swelling immediately. I went to the ER and they did an x-ray and did not find a fracture (unfortunately they didn't do an MRI). They gave me a splint to wear for a few weeks that prevented my thumb from moving. Had pretty bad bruising and could barely move my thumb for the first few days, but over time my mobility got better. I patiently waited a few months to let it heal and was still experiencing pain and limited mobility, so I saw a specialist in January who did a physical exam and was pretty sure it was skiers thumb (torn UCL) and that I would need surgery. He ordered an MRI, but it was bad timing since I was leaving for a 6 month internship out of state, and I am only insured in my home state. So since January, I haven't seen a doctor or gotten an MRI but will do so when I return to my home state in a few weeks.

Turf toe: In April I encountered some bad luck and fell off a ladder, landing pretty awkwardly. At first I had slight pain in my big toe, but it honestly wasn't bad at all. I woke up the next day to it being really swollen and in awful pain whenever I put pressure on it or moved it. The pain and swelling reduced, but three months later I still experience pain when putting pressure on it. I've stubbed this toe a few times and the pain is really excruciating where I injured it, so it's clear that the injury has not really healed well. I am still out of my home state, so I am not insured and have not seen a doctor about it yet. After looking online the symptoms definitely match the turf toe (torn ligament) description almost perfectly, so I am assuming that is what it is.

My question for you guys is what your opinion is on these two injuries, and what the prognosis looks like with them. Also, in the next few weeks before I can see a doctor, is there anything I can do to help the injuries? I'm a tennis player so I am worried about the future impact of both of these injuries. I'm also worried specifically for my thumb because I work a lot on the computer.

I appreciate all the help!

6mbxvx,24,2017-07-09,"I think that I've met the man in my near death experience visions, in real life.",Lawdtrafalgar,Glitch_in_the_Matrix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/6mbxvx/i_think_that_ive_met_the_man_in_my_near_death/,"I'm the first one to admit that I'm an absolute disaster magnet and I've had a handful of near death experiences so far. It's a terrifying moment each time but comforting to where I'd go. 

Ever since like the third near death experience when I was around 7 years old, I would wake near a man, my husband, each and every time. The curling of his lips, I was so happy to see that smile each time that welcomed me.

Thinking back on the first time, it was comically horrifying. I've never dreamt of a fairy tale wedding or having a family for that matter. To this day, I haven't really changed my stance on that. Yet I was joyful to be in that environment with a husband and daughter. 

(I can write more in detail if anyone is interested, gets fairly long though.)

Anyways, through each time, I've studied this man's physical features and generally the way that he made me feel. I've never been comfortable with any man even to this day, I'm so uncomfortable except with one. 

Personally, I never really thought much on the truth that could be behind these visions. I would say that but give each man an extra look admittedly. I would hope and pray that I'd catch him walking by one day but it never came.

So I met this man years after hearing about him since high school. He went to another school about 3 miles from mine. He dated this girl who I never could really get along with but I was friends with all her other friends. 

My friend went to the same school as he and kept in touch. She invited him over and I was absolutely stunned. His short sandy blond hair and piercing hazel eyes were the beginning of familiarity. The soft vertical crease in the tip of his nose which wrinkled to each time which he laughed intern raising pale cheeks specked with light freckles. The unique raspiness to his voice I had also heard before. The heart shape to his face led his jawbones to familiar gauged ears. 

I had been told so much about him but never shown an image. My friends assumed that I couldn't stop staring because I found him attractive but it was so much more than that. I was all but convinced that he was the man in my visions. A slightly younger version, but it's him.  

I briefly panicked in his presence but very quickly did we grow a bond. As I said, I'm so uncomfortable with men. I'm almost 22 and this man was my first date. Over roughly 5 hours, we walked out with pet names. We would call each other one half of an anime couple, we're the worst. 

I felt like I've known this man for years.

I've told him about each instance expecting disgust but he was really okay with it. Though he's never had visions like mine, brief dreams he's admitted to. A woman with long straight black hair in a light and dark blue military suit would come to him. At this time, his then fiance (the one I could never be friends with) had short blonde hair and would wear a black and white dress for her job.

There's plenty of women that fit his visual description, I included. I had never told him until this point that I'm in the ROTC program and wear a light and dark blue air force uniform every once in a while.  

Further details that he fits:

-once in my vision, he walked in with a guitar. This man is a musician as well. 
-(I was sick once in my vision) he said that he'd call 'Eric' to check me out. Eric is now my brother-in-law of 3 years and is my regular doctor. ;; we were talking once and correctly called my bro-in-law by his name and occupation. He said that he didn't know where it came from just kinda fell out. 
-once in my vision, he was painting my long nails. I doted on how weird it was to have long slender fingers with long nails. I was a child when this time occurred, I returned thinking how horrifying it would be to have long nails. my short and stout fingers along with anxiety bitten nails were the normal. / now as an adult, I have those long slender fingers with long nails that I stopped biting a few months before I met him. His first compliment to me was actually my nails. I'm weird and absolutely just want compliments towards my nails that I work hard not to break.   

I can go on and on about the similarities that I see now. I'm not sure what those visions could have been or what they even mean.

Nothing was wrong with my grown father having outbursts &amp; breaking things in the house, but when I would throw temper tantrums as a 6-11 year old, I was demonized. I can go on about the narcissistic things that my African parents/relatives did, but I don't want to break my computer out of anger. 

I'm 24 and I am so desperate to be financially independent. I've grown tired of being dependent and not having my own things, while a lot of people around my age aren't dependent on their parents. 

Ever since I started this year-round internship, my mom has been on my neck about how much money I make. I have been planning to save money for a car to get so I don't have to constantly be using my mother's car like a dependent teenager. I want my own car so I can stop missing nice events and I can leave the house whenever I please. 

I think this time my mom crossed the line by demanding to know how much I make every two weeks at my internship and even outright accused me of lying when I told her the amount of money I had saved up from March. 

My brother came up with the idea of me chipping in extra money monthly to get rid of my mother's car payment. I, of course, objected because this would mean I would have to wait for months to even a year to get my own car. She got angry when I objected to my brother's plan of me helping to pay to get rid of my mother's car payment. I objected because I did not want to wait extra months to buy my own car and I am growing tired of either asking for rides and using my parents' cars while people my age have their own cars. Me not having a car even ruined a chance of me gaining a friend because I asked for a ride &amp; after that, she distanced herself from me. 

I despise having a pushy, controlling African parent. I envy and resent people with normal parents who either force them to become independent at age 18 or don't demand to know how much money their children are making. "
6mc20i,174,2017-07-09,Investment Banking - A Guide,savantness,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6mc20i/investment_banking_a_guide/,"Alright boys, I wasn't going to make a post until the summer was over but the banks have lost their god damn mind and we're in full swing recruiting season already. Two years ago it was reasonable and would be January of your junior year, then last year it became October. We joked that it was getting pushed up way too quickly and that the banks were going to start recruiting sophomores one day. Yet here the fuck we are this year. For some of you it's already too late unfortunately, some kids already have offers. 

I know this stuff because I'm at a bulge bracket investment bank. Don't send me your resume, don't ask for stock picks etc etc. Just don't. If you have questions make a separate post and people on here will help. Ok now to the guide:

Part 1: What's investment banking (IB)?

You'd be shocked how many people interview for IB and don't even know what it is. It's not trading stocks. Please don't say ""I want to do IB because I love the stock market and trading"". Terrible answer. 

Investment banking is providing advisory services for mergers and acquisitions,  equity and debt offerings, etc etc. Google it and learn all about it. 

Part 2: Why should I do investment banking? 

IB is arguably the best job you can get out of business school. Big 4 accounting and big 3 consulting are great too, but IB gives you more of an edge. You make 6 figures out of school and have incredible exit opportunities including private equity, hedge funds, etc.

You also learn a shit ton in a short amount of time. 

Part 3: Why should I not do investment banking?

It's fucking hard. The hours are long, you work 90-120 hours a week depending on deal flow and your bank. You have to be able to think quickly and pick up concepts even faster. People expect a lot of you out of school and the culture can be intense. Don't just do IB for the money, you might hate yourself. 

Part 4: What can I expect as a summer analyst?

Generally you do the work no one else wants to do, but you still pick up a lot. You're doing bitch work all day one day, but then the next you get to listen to a call with the CFO of a multi billion dollar company. It's really fucking cool stuff, hearing what the CFO is thinking about for his or her company. 

Part 5: Ok I want to do IB, how can I get in?

Typically candidates have this criteria:

Ivy League school with 3.5 GPA + or top tier school with a 3.7+ (3.9+ is preferable and will make your life a lot easier)

Internship experience. Internships in accounting or finance help a lot, especially if you have a lower GPA. 

Involvement. This isn't as important but just don't be boring. Have other stuff you're interested in besides school. Student athletes are a huge plus. 

The last thing I'd say about candidate criteria is you need to be cool. Most of the time people are looking for a guy they can sit with for 100 hour weeks. 

Part 6: Ok I meet the the above criteria, or I'm a minority (not asians though you don't count), or I'm a girl, now what? 

It's still hard to actually get a job. You're required to learn a shit ton of technical questions, have a story on why you want to be a banker, etc etc. I'd recommend going on Wall Street oasis for more info on this. They have some great guides. 

If you're a girl or minority you'll be placed in some bull shit program and have it way easier. That's reality, not going to sugar coat it. This is WSB not r/feels 

Part 7: Additional resources 

Wall Street oasis- great guides

Breaking into Wall Street - good technicals but don't buy anything, everything you need to know is available online for free 

Damadoran- forgot how to spell it but it's this Indian professor that is the shit at explaining financial concepts. 

WSB- ask questions but nothing you can't fucking google. 


I'm tired of writing so go ahead and ask me any further questions below. I'll answer until around midnight or so. 

Oh btw for proof that I'm in IB you can just ask u/theycallme1 's mom. But really if you don't believe what I'm writing just google this stuff it's all there. This post was to create awareness. "

I'm a college student entering my sophomore year and I have done nothing productive this summer. Every summer or break I have I seem to derail my life, gain that weight I worked so hard to lose, not get a job and lose any motivation of achieving my goals. I'm already behind everyone in engineering getting their internships and CO-OPs, something I constantly see people suggesting students do The more I see this the more useless I feel.  During school I do average have a 3.0+ GPA, worked out, join clubs, and got motivated to change. I just hate not knowing what the best thing to do next is. It just angers me because with anything I do I always think that I could be spending my time better. I've cut ties with most of my friends in the past because all they did was stay at a party school and I'm not the party person, I feel like I'm best when I stay busy. But, I just look at them and they all seem so happy. 

As I write this at 2:58 AM, this bothers me to the point that I am starting to lose sleep. Even when I'm tired I have a hard time sleeping. My habits have worsened and I'm slowly losing communication with the people I love in my life. Sometimes days I feel depressed and not say a single word all day. it never got this bad during the past summers.   

Having essentially no resume, no connections, no job experience, no motivation, right now, what is my best course of action with a month until college starts again? "

I was happy, for I like Breadwinners, and I have an unaired episode of it to myself. I then headed home and played the DVD on my TV.

The intro played normally, but the audio sounded demonic. The title card read, ""The Massacre of Deucer"", there wasn't any music, and the opening credits all read ""ME"" in place of the workers' names. ""This is getting creepy..."" I said to myself, but I eventually shrugged it off, thinking it was a morbid joke.

The episode began at Ketta's Auto-Tune Up, and the Rocket Van was being fixed. SwaySway was in front of a restroom door, ant it seemed that Buhdeuce was inside. SwaySway then said, ""Uh, Buhdeuce... Are you done yet?"" Buhdeuce then replied, ""I have a surprise for you..."" before the camera cut to a shot of Buhdeuce with his eyes closed for 10 seconds. He then opened them, but they were black with red, dot-like pupils. He also held... A KNIFE!

I was like, ""WTF?!"", but I kept watching. Suddenly, the video cut to static for about 5 minutes before cutting to a scene where Buhdeuce killed his partners Ketta, Jelly &amp; SwaySway, then a lot of pop-culture characters from all 4 corners of the world (even his Nicktoons neighbors) --- including CatDog, SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward, Tom and Jerry, Gumball, Darwin, Anais, Nicole and Richard Watterson, Mac, Bloo, Wilt, Coco, Eduardo, and Frankie, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson, Gru and his Minions, Lucy, Margo, Edith and Agnes, Jin and Asuka Kazama, Ultraman, Garfield, Sgt. Keroro and his allies, the Avengers, Italy, Germany, Japan, America, England, France, Russia and China, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny, Cloud Strife, Samus, Godzilla, Milli, Geo and Bot, the Lorax and the Once-ler, Spock and his USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) crew, Coraline Jones, Link &amp; Zelda, Flaky, Flippy, Lumpy and the rest of the Happy Tree Friends characters, Finn and Jake, Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man, Hi-Five Ghost and Benson, Naruto and Sakura, Mario, Luigi, Yoshi and Peach, Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, Star Fox, Luke Skywalker, Suzumiya Haruhi and her SOS Brigade, Ico and Yorda, Barry Steakfries, Master Chief , Sub-Zero, Kirito and Asuna, the Doctor from Doctor Who, Dick Tracy, Spider-Man, every single Kamen Rider, Percy, Grover and Annabeth, James Bond, Natsu Dragneel, Lucy Heartfilia, Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet, the entire Justice League, Blossom, Bubbles &amp; Buttercup, Hatsune Miku, Megurine Luka and the Kagamine twins, Eren and Mikasa, Anna, Elsa, Kristoff and Olaf, Phoenix Wright and Maya Fey, Dora and Boots, BoBoiBoy, Gopal, Ying and Yaya, Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and Puss in Boots, Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy, Black★Rock Shooter, Pedro Penduko, Rainbow Dash, Pingu and his family, Captain Falcon, Garuda Knight BIMA, the Kids Next Door, every single Super Sentai team and Aka Red and Himura Kenshin (But there was no sound played during that part, save for those blood curdling screamings from ""Suicide Mouse""!). I was freaked out. ""WHAT THE WHEAT?!! These characters aren't supposed to be in Breadwinners!"" I cried.

The video cut to static again, but for 20 seconds this time. It then showed white text on a black background. The text read

You're next, Daniel.

I then shouted, ""OMG, the DVD knows my name! I must get rid of it!"" I ejected the disc and snapped it in half before throwing it in the nearby dumpster.

I still like Breadwinners, but I could never look at Buhdeuce the same way again."

We both want to keep our relationship going as we both feel like we are the perfect match and will most likely be looking in to marriage at a later stage.


At this point in time I am back in Sweden doing the regular graduate job hunting and she is still in Australia doing an internship that ends at the end of september, she will come and visit me in Sweden once her internship is done. After the visit the plan is for her to go back to Australia as she can work for the same company for another 6 months, thus giving her not only a competetive salary but also western work experience.


So 8/9 months of LDR we want to think of opportunities to move to the same country. However there are many more variables. The two options are of course for her to come to Europe or me to come to Japan (or other Asian countries), however I have a younger sister (20) and a younger brother (5!) where I feel that I am constantly losing connection with them as I haven't been home for almost 4 years. Thus I would like to avoid going to an Asian country until I have at least established better contact with my family. Also if I end up finding a graduate position in Sweden (or Europe) then I can not simply leave after 6 months of work.


For my girlfriend the main issue would be to find work in Europe, she has a lot of experience now but perhaps the language and culture barriers would be to much? She wants to pursue a career in HR.
So the questions that arise for us here is, where should we try to create a life together? Is it ok if I go away for a few more years and risk losing connection with family and friends even more? If anyone knows, what are the possibilities for her to find work in Europe (marrying for visa would definitely be an option)?


I feel as if we are just running around in a circle trying to find a solution, it is really damaging for our relationship and we are mostly just sad when we talk to each other these days.


P.s she is not the typical Japanese woman but rather very career focused, open and speaks very good english.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: not sure in what country to settle as we are from different nationalities, love each other dearly but need to find a solution."

It's not a case of us getting an intern to ""find servers"" - it'd be a huge commitment in terms of cost, and in time to get things set up.

The cost of the infrastructure we would require (resilience from DDOS, low latency, high security) and the cost and time required for maintenance and management is disproportionately high versus having servers in other regions. As I said back then, our team haven't found something cost effective at this time.

With that said, it's something which keeps cropping up as something you guys care about. We want to be receptive to your feedback - and in the spirit of delivering on ""Unfinished Business"" - we will continue to raise this with the team on your behalf!

6me3jb,48,2017-07-10,"37F, getting serious about my health and weight",Lobolikesstuff,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6me3jb/37f_getting_serious_about_my_health_and_weight/,"Hi, I have been lurking for a couple of weeks, and thought I should introduce myself.

I have been heavy all my life. I started trying to diet at around 11/12 years old and never really lost weight, but had an unhealthy relationship with food throughout my teens. I lost weight a few times during university and law school using CICO method, but could never really keep it up. I also always went too far with it. Like, less than 1200 calls a day, obsessive working out, etc. 

My last serious attempt to get to a healthy weight was when I was 23/24. I went from 207 to 145. I couldn't maintain 145 without continuing a very restricted diet, but I did manage to keep a few healthy habits and hovered around 170 for a few years, helped in part by an internship in Africa where I didn't eat much processed food and was very active. After I returned, I got a desk job, and over the past ten years, the pound have piled on. I have also battled depression for most of my life, which doesn't help.

About 4 years ago I started biking for transportation and while that has made me feel somewhat healthier (even at this weight, I don't get as winded walking up stairs) but since I was still eating crap, I kept gaining. At the time I was in a very toxic work environment and I hit a low point with my depression. I was also very isolated, and not seeing many people besides my toxic business partners.

I now have a great job that I love with wonderful colleagues. But I was still eating crap. I was eating breakfast and lunch take out near my office, and usually choosing the least healthy options. Then getting home and ordering pizza cause I didn't feel like cooking. No wonder my weight ballooned!

For the past two weeks I have been logging everything in MFP. My starting weight was 247. (!) at only 5'3, that's morbidly obese. 

I have been focusing on making healthy choices and keeping a small calorie deficit, but being conscious of my previous tendencies to go a bit crazy dieting. I am taking advantage of the amazing seasonal farmers markets that are everywhere in my city right now. 

This time, slow and steady is my mantra. I have been averaging about 1500 net calories and I lost 2.5lbs. It's a slow start, but I will get there! I haven't set a final goal weight, as I don't know how I will feel once I get there. Even though it's still overweight, I actually felt and looked really good around 150-160, so that may be enough for me. I would like to get into a size 12 clothing wise. (I am currently an 18-20, depending on the store/style.) my interim goal is to lose 10% of my body weight by Christmas, so that 25lbs, a goal of 222."

6mf48i,35,2017-07-10,Gave Petri Dish impromptu come to jesus talk after all,petriswifemaidmom,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/6mf48i/gave_petri_dish_impromptu_come_to_jesus_talk/,"Before I launch into the main portion of this post, I'd like to provide a little more background. 

First, Petri Dish's family owns a successful small business started by his grandfather (the one that gave him the car). I don't want to get too specific, but basically they sell manufacturing materials to manufacturers of a specific type of goods. My FIL took it over when he graduated college, and he planned on eventually teaching PD the trade and eventually owning the business when FIL retires. However, PD was in college during the recession and it looked like the business might not survive, so PD got his bachelors in an unrelated field. But luckily for PD's family, the business did survive the recession (mostly because my ILs could live off their stocks and dividends and didn't have to rely on a real salary from the business during the tough years) and it's been doing better and better over the past few years--so now FIL has invited PD to join the business. This will be relevant later.

As I mentioned in our first post, Petri Dish and I started dating when we were 21 and both in college. When we graduated and started our first full-time office jobs, it was a tough switch to go from college kid mode to working professional mode. Like most adults, I got used to it and it didn't bother me after a few weeks. However, PD never really adjusted to the life change. He always felt like working a full-time job was unfair in some way and frequently let me know I was the only reason he didn't quit and go back to being a dishwasher at a restaurant. I would usually say something along the lines of ""Gee, thanks"" and/or say that I didn't want him to resent me for holding him back from living the [shitty] life he desired. He would always say no and he didn't mean it like that. Meanwhile, his #1 excuse for not helping around the house was that he spent his whole day at work hating his life and when he comes home he just wants to go have fun. That's understandable--but again, it's called being an adult, and it's completely unfair to me because I also had a full-time job, but I still took on household responsibilities. This was around the time when we really started our power struggle referred to in my first post.

To PD's credit, he kept that job he hated for 5 years and just finally quit at the end of June and will be starting at the family business this week. I am honestly very happy for him and I really hope it goes well. This job will be significantly more flexible and he can even do a lot of the work remotely, which is something he has always wanted the option to do. He has been sounding optimistic lately about making some changes and being more helpful. I've told him that I am counting on those changes actually happening (this is not the come to jesus talk). 

Meanwhile, PD has been a real dick about doing anything productive I ask him to do. For example, the car seat in my car is nicer than the one in his car, so we switched them when we went to the beach for the 4th of July. When we got back, I asked him to move it back every day (because he had a week off between jobs and he has been the one that deals with installing the car seats), but he wouldn't get around to it. Then on Friday I told him he had to do it because I was taking DD to visit my parents this weekend and I really needed the better car seat. He doesn't feel like dealing with it and complains that I should know how to do it/I could figure it out if I really wanted to. I remind him again that I've been asking him to show me so that I can do it in the future, so he needs to do it now and let me watch. He grumpily agrees and we go out to the driveway, but then he's about to light up a cigarette while transferring the car seats. I ask him to please wait until after he's done with the car seats to smoke (FFS) and he gets all hostile and complains about having to do it, starts slamming the car seats around &amp; literally throws his into his trunk/folded down back seat. Then when he's done installing mine (for the record, I do now know how to install it, yay!) he starts complaining about how now he's running late to go over to our friend's house and he's going to have to take even more time to smoke the cigarette that he could have been smoking while doing the car seats. I just rolled my eyes and walked inside. Fuck. Him. 

I've already been feeling like too much damage has been done and the resentment is too deep, so an ultimatum is pretty pointless because I don't really see a future that doesn't involve me divorcing him, and that little fuck boy episode (and others like it) only confirm those feelings. However, when he got back that night I couldn't hide my feelings towards him--I couldn't even look him in the eye--and when he asked what was wrong I calmly stated that I was happy for him that he is about to start a new job and it's great to hear that he supposedly wants to help more, but that I wanted to be crystal clear that if he does not make some radical changes then I will be leaving him. I will never be happy with the arrangement where I do everything and can't keep up and I don't want to spend the rest of my life nagging him. He shut up after that. I think he believes me because I am not one to make idle threats, but honestly I am fresh out of fucks. Will he change? Probably not. But at least now I can have a clear conscience about giving him a final warning. It's up to him what he does with it. 

Again, I don't even really know what he could do to make me rethink leaving him, but if nothing else maybe he can start getting used to doing some chores because his lazy ass is about to be doing ALL of them when I'm gone.  

As far as my projected timeline goes--I'm torn between leaving when my internship is over at the end of August or trying to hang in there until I graduate this coming May and start working full-time again. If I can do that, then I will be significantly more financially stable and could even consider kicking HIM out and keeping the house instead of moving in with my parents. I also still really need help with DD when I'm in class and/or working on projects, and it doesn't feel fair to put that on my parents. All I know is that I'm getting sick of looking at him and I want out. "

I want to get involved in the Ethereum ecosystem because it seems like there is a lot of opportunity right now, and more importantly room for personal growth and learning.

I am wondering what those who have worked or hired developers for ethereum/blockchain projects think of the following two options:

1) Build DApps, develop and showcase experience building smart contracts using Solidity.

2) Make substantial contributions to projects developed and maintained by the Ethereum foundation.

Right now, I'm leaning towards #2 because it would give me deeper insight into how Ethereum works  'under the hood'.  I'd like to hear feedback from the community about these two options, and what they look for when evaluating developers for hire.

I am not a statistics person (I took a very basic intro course three years ago) however I am working with statistical data for an internship, specifically census data from the US Census Bureau.

 I was going to post this on Yahoo Answers to hopefully not seem like a complete idiot but their site, much like their financial future, seems to be failing. If you need clarity I will update/respond to you, I apologize if this doesn't make sense.

 Anyways, for example I am calculating the percent of total people under the poverty line ( estimated population # under the povertyline / estimated total population # of an area) * 100. Each estimate value (population under povertyline and total population) each has a margin of error number. I am wondering if it is possible/needed to alter those numbers to create a margin of error for the percents I am calculating (for example, I have the percent calculations for estimates... do I need to alter the moe?) 

I'm not sure how the moe works (the website says its a 90% confidence interval estimate). I know you can aggregate it by adding the squares of the moe and square rooting it. Idk how it works with dividing/multiplication. Idk if it would make sense/be possible. Thanks!"

TLDR: My (53 M) and my gf (55F) have been living together for seven years now along with her three adult children (M 32, M 27, &amp; F 22 with her 3 months old daughter) None pay anything for rent/utilities nor can they afford to move out on their own. What do I do? 

Here's the situation in more detail. 

My gf and I live together with her three adult kids. I am the only one who has a full time job, making good money. Between the four of them they don't make enough money to pay rent for even a 2 bedroom apt. 

Our current rental company is hiking the rent by $125/month. My new rent in this place would be $2700/month. Not to count the extra costs of utilities. 

I am moving to a smaller somewhat less expensive house, and I want my GF to move in with me, as does she. The problem is that I do not want the kids yo move with us. If they don't, they will be homeless. And I am serious about this. They have no other place to go. 


I fully expected that the kids would have been out on their own before now. But with little education, and drive/ambition, I guess I was wrong. 


But how do you force someone to do better? Or to pay living expenses like a normal adult?


Here's what I am dealing with. 

The oldest son may not be an issue since it looks like he's going to be moving in with his GF (at least until she realizes that he's as much of a leech as the other two). He just recently (6 months or so) started working (also part time) after being off work. He quit being a long haul truck driver so he could spend more time with his now 6 year old son. But for the past two years he's lived with us also scott free. 


The middle son is 27 years old. For the past year or so he has been working doing display/merchandising  setups in local stores for a company . It is part time work not high paying. He has plenty of free time to go find another job, but he hasn't. Additionally I pay him  275/week for helping out with my small business. 


If he would pay me one weeks worth  that for rent, I would have no problem with him living with us. But he doesn't. He says he has bills that he has to pay. Well so do I. 


My GF's 22 year old daughter got her cosmetology license, worked for about a month as an intern then quit. Hasn't worked since. Three months ago her and her fiancee had a baby. Now her fiancee was supposed to pay me $300/month for them to live here. To date in the 4 months they've been here, I have received $300 in total. 


My gf doesn't seem to be able to make them pay. I have run through my retirement account trying to keep us in housing during a few periods of unemployment. She understands that I am at my financial &amp; wits end but does nothing to help me. 


So I am controlling the one thing that I can, what I am willing to spend my hard earned money on. But I feel like crap knowing that I am going to be leaving these people homeless. 


What else am I supposed to do? I am no longer willing to be a Charity for people who won't or can't support themselves. "

Clue #1 - MJ is every where Peter is. She sits at the same table, she's in the same groups. She even goes to detention with him even though she doesn't have to be.

Clue #2 - She knows his comings and goings. She comments on the activities he's already dropped out of due to the ""Stark Internship"", but trys to cover it up by saying shes ""observant"".

Clue #3 - In the scene where they are in detention and Peter looks up at her, she holds up a drawing of Peter, a cloud, and a girl with long hair with her head down. The immediate assumption is that its mocking Peter, suggesting he daydreams about Liz. But if you look at it from left to right, it's actually a image of a girl dreaming about Peter. The fact that her face is covered would lead you to believe its Liz, but it's actually MJ.

Clue #4 - When Peter arrives at the homecoming dance with Liz, MJ flips him the bird. Why would she do that? She's only been nice and civil to him up to that point, so why suddenly turn crass? It's because he's with another woman. The drawing she showed him was her way of telling him she likes (dreams about) him, and he ignored her and asked another girl out. Her feelings are hurt, so she flips him off.

Clue #5 - The only real obvious one: the way she longingly looks at him after he leaves to meey Happy in the bathroom.

MJ's got it bad for Peter."
6mhppf,6,2017-07-10,Should I Jump Ship and Intern Somewhere Else?,BIGBOYTODD100,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6mhppf/should_i_jump_ship_and_intern_somewhere_else/,"Hey r/Accounting, I'm a long time lurker, and this is my first post.

I'm currently an intern in Louisiana working for a small CPA firm in the Baton Rouge area. 

I should mention that this is my first internship in the accounting field. I got the gig from my Dad's old fraternity buddy who owns his own firm. I can't say that I'm not grateful for this opportunity, but I'm starting to have the feeling that my wage is lower than it should be (Or at least that I think I'm being taken advantage of).

I started 6 months ago completely useless at $10/hour. I was a junior in college who didn't understand a lick about how a firm worked.

However now that I'm a little bit more experienced and have taken more classes (I even have a few certifications under my belt like Quickbooks and Lacerte), I feel like I should be paid a wee bit more. However, they're wanting me to stay longer hours, do weird jobs like picking up my boss's mail from his house, and even solve small IT problems around the firm (I'm sorta good with tech). I see most interns around reddit doing temp work for $15-30/ hour.

I feel weird. I want to ask for a raise, but I'm afraid they'll probably laugh me out of the office because I'm ""Not skilled enough"". My Dad is telling me to wait it out until I graduate or something, but damn it, I want the money now. 

The firm environment is alright, though it sometimes feels like one giant witch hunt. Not to mention the other partners prowl around sending employees home if they don't have work which is super discouraging.

Opinions, thoughts, and comments would be greatly appreciated.

After a couple weeks of basic training i get flown out to california for two weeks of hardcore sales training. I am very excited for this opportunity!

I am a pretty social person and am able to hold a conversation with most people. This job is going to be mostly cold calling to start with. I am blessed with a great opportunity however i feel nervous that i will not always be able to have the skills or sales personality to succeed at this job.

I would love some tips or advice from anyone who has been in a similar position as me, or anyone in general!"

It’s not my fault you want to have me pick up the slack of the work you “don’t have time” to do and then neglect to give me details and expectations until the day it’s due.  It’s not my fault you’ve worked maybe 5 days in the past 3 weeks.  It’s not my fault nobody tells me project expectations until the last fucking minute, if they even do at all.

It’s not my fault you approve my work and then change things last minute because you “didn’t have time to do a REAL quality pass” before.  It’s not my fault you change your mind.  It’s not my fault I do the projects based on the information I have, which is never all of the information I need.  It’s not my fault that you want to retain so much control over every project while not being around to manage it.  It’s not my fault that you want to dictate every detail while also being missing in action half the fucking time.  

It’s not my fault that since the day I started this job I’ve basically been cleaning up the messes of people before me.  The file server you’ve created is a fucking mess and a joke in and of itself, and everyday I struggle to find the correct files to work with.  It’s not my fault that the people before me used fucked up styles and rules in their documents which I now need to spend hours re-sorting and figuring out every time I do a project.  It’s not my fault that half the projects you assign to me you don’t even know how to do yourself so you tell me to “figure it out” or “Google it.”  Well, I’m fucking trying, but you hired me based on a skill set I’ve honed for years, and yet, here I am, wasting all that experience making fucking PowerPoint presentations and copy/pasting shit into a WYSIWYG like a mindless monkey.  I’m a professional designer, not a fucking college intern.

It’s not my fault you made a deal with me when you hired me and then didn’t honor it.  In fact, you’re fucking lucky I didn’t leave.  We had a deal.  What the fuck happened?  I watched you weasel your way out of paying me that raise, citing first that the company couldn’t afford it, and when I shot back that we made a deal and it wasn’t acceptable, you pathetically decided that you wouldn’t pay me my raise because I “didn’t meet expectations.”  How fucking convenient.  Maybe if I’m not meeting expectations you should fucking tell me in our weekly check-in meetings instead of springing it on me right when the raise is owed to me.  You’re so fucking lucky I haven’t left and let you die in the mess you’ve made.  

I’m doing my best.  I’m always torn in several directions, and people are always shoving last minute changes down my throat from every fucking department.  They don’t use the request forms we’ve set up, so I’m managing emails, IMs, and face to face requests all day long, on top of my “regular” workload.  I’m sick of the last minute changes and endless revisions on this shit.  I’m already going well out of my way for you fuckers.

This is why we have the review process.  This is why we have so many fucking meetings.  Why do we have so many fucking meetings if after all of them, we go and change it all up at the last minute?  “Do you think the text should be black or grey?”  Let’s agonize over it for 3 fucking weeks.  Who cares that the company is tanking and we’re about to lose our benefits because you clowns can’t run a business?  Let’s waste more time and see how fast the profits can fall.  We all end up waiting around for you and schedules get pushed back because you’re not there to weigh in.  At a certain point, does your opinion fucking matter if you don’t show up to give it?  Do you realize this company is dying?  We are all on the brink of losing our jobs.

I’m doing my best and it’s frustrating to have all your chaos shoved on me while I have no clue what you’re doing at home or on vacation or where ever the fuck you always are.  It’s a waste of my time and it’s demoralizing to have to follow your expectations where ever the hell they lead to.  It’s never consistent and it’s never predictable.  It’s chaotic and it’s destroying my motivation to do my job.

There has got to be more to life than this."
6mi8g0,3,2017-07-10,Im scared,ImpossibleMango,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6mi8g0/im_scared/,"Hey sd, it's time for me to finally make a post here. I apologise in advance if this gets a little long and confusing. I've been lurking for a few months, trying to come up with what I want to say, but I finally had my revelation and my thoughts might all just spill out at once.

I'm not sure what I'm looking to gain by posting here, whether it be helpful insight, support, or encouragement, but I know I need to post. Something about that just makes it real, like I'm finally making a step in the right direction.

To cut to the chase, I think I might have ascites, or whatever the term is. And after about a year of alcohol abuse, I'm now actually scared for my health. I know self-diagnosing is bad, and in addition I do tend to jump to the worst conclusions, but I'm fairly certain my trip to the doctor in the coming week will confirm my worst fears.

I'm 21. I've been fairly skinny my whole life, about 6'0 135lbs. I started drinking when I turned 19, and I started abusing alcohol a couple months before my 21st birthday. So all in all that's about a year and a half of alcohol abuse as of today. I haven't had sip of alcohol since last Thursday, but I think it's already too late. When I started out, it was maybe 4 beers a weekend. When it started to get worse, it was maybe closer to 4-5 beers a night, Friday and Saturday. In the summer of 2016, it was 6-8 beers a night on weekends, and maybe a couple here and there mid week. This past fall, I was in a bad living situation, living with my ex and her new man (an ex-friend of mine) and I had just turned 21, a very bad formula. It was probably about 6 beers a night, or a 30 pack a week, whatever that math is. And of the hard stuff too, nothing under 5.6%.

I've never been a flabby dude, so when I started getting a belly, I figured it was from all the calories I was gaining from sitting around drinking beer. But as of this past week, I'm 85% sure it's something worse. My gut area just feels... Wrong. Granted I don't know what normal flab feels like, I don't think it's fat. I've read about the ""wave test"" or fluid wave or whatever, and I'm pretty sure I can feel that. When I lay in different positions, I can get the tympany thing as well. Now this is all super subjective and I realize the only way to confirm anything is to see my doctor. But until then, I'm scared out of my mind. Ive read that basically if I've gotten to the point of ascites, my liver has serious damage. The main treatment for cirrhosis seems to be a liver transplant, and while in my mind that seems a bit extreme, its not unbelievable.

I just can't believe I've done this to myself. I always thought ""I'm 21, this thing happens after years of abuse"". ""I can binge on the weekends, it won't cause any serious damage until I'm like 25"". Well obviously that's not the case, and I can't believe my idiot self would sit alone on the weekends reading this sub will downing Redd's wicked.

I'm currently at an internship. Ive been a fairly functional alcoholic. I go to class on time, I go to work on time. My friends know I drink a lot, but it's never had a catastrophic impact on my life, so nothing really changed. If I need to be hospitalized for this, I don't know how I can cope. It will probably be the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to me. I don't know how to tell my parents, who are more or less none-the-wiser, that I need medical care to fix my problems. I can't afford to take time off my internship. And I can't help but think that what little reputation I have, as an introverted skinny nerd, will be destroyed and replaced with an introverted, skinny, alcoholic, lowlife, nerd.

If I'm being honest with myself, I'm not in a horrible place in life. I've got a lot going for me. I graduate in December, and I've got a full time job already lined up for January. My self image and reality are constantly fighting. But I digress.

Thanks for listening to my rant. I'm eager to see what you all have to say."
6midgq,1,2017-07-10,My [22F] Mother [55F] wants to leave my violent/angry Father [56M] &amp; I don't know how to help both of them,randomaccount0915,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6midgq/my_22f_mother_55f_wants_to_leave_my_violentangry/,"My mother informed me today during breakfast that she wants to leave my father. This came as a complete surprise, but what caught most off guard was that my father has had two major violent outbursts (one of which left my dog blind) while I was not present. I've been gone from home for 4 years for college and I rarely come home (due to summer internships). I was at home less than 2 months a year during the last 4 years. 


(1) My father's first violent outburst according to my mother was when he beat my dog so badly to the point my dog went blind. He beat my dog because the dog had sneaked into the kitchen and had eaten out of the trashcan. My mother was upstairs went she heard my dog yelping and crying and ran downstairs to the kitchen to find my dog with a large lump/bump on his head and bloodshot eyes. After that, apparently my dog slowly lost his sight. I was at college at that time and my mom called me one day and told me my dog had glaucoma and had lost sight in his eyes. I thought it was odd because while my dog was a bit old (12 years old), he had been in excellent health the last time I'd seen him.


(2) My father's second violent outburst was when he threw glass dishes and utensils at my mom during dinner (in which I was not present). I noticed odd scratches on the dining room table when I came home a few weeks ago and asked about it. My mom said it was because she accidentally dropped something hot/sharp on the surface. Today, she told me the truth. She said they had an argument and my dad began blaming her for everything that was going wrong (their poor financial situation, losing their home a few years ago, losing contact with relatives). My mom cursed at him and he began to throw utensils and the dishes and cups - basically everything on the table. She got cut from the glass and after that my dad apparently stopped.


In both of these cases, my dad apparently began crying and apologizing for his mistake. He cried when my dog had to get surgery to remove one of his eyes (which were causing him pain after he went blind) and cried again after my mom got cut from the glass. He apologized and begged my mom for forgiveness. It's clear that he has anger management problems. He is usually a mild-mannered person and hates having arguments, but he has these volatile/violent moments in which he can't control himself. He needs help, but my mom feels that he will have another violent outburst if she suggests this. We are also a conservative Asian family and I just know my dad will be absolutely against any idea of treating mental illness. He won't admit that he has any problem, especially an anger management issue.


For me, this was all very hard to swallow because my dad has always been super sweet and caring towards me. We went on a lot of great family trips together and I had a great childhood - we would fly kites together, plant flowers in the garden together, etc. Even today, my dad does his best to help me out whenever I have problems and we have a lot of fun hanging out together. Apparently, my dad had begged my mom not to mention the violent outbursts to me. He had also tried to remove the scratches on the dining table and turned the table around so I wouldn't see it when I sat down at my place at the table. At the same time, I think it will be hard for me to see my dad in the same light. The way he acted towards my mom and my dog is completely unacceptable and I don't want to leave my mom or my dog alone with him. I'm angry and disappointed in him, but I still love him because he's my dad. I want to get him help but I just know he's going to resist and grow angry and my mom will have to deal with his anger. 


My mom has told me that she wants to just leave the US and go back to her home country in Asia without my father and without officially divorcing him. It's not a realistic option right now because of our current financial situation and because it will be difficult for my mother to be financially independent (she hasn't had a job in the last 25 years). She doesn't want to divorce him and go through the legal steps/paperwork - she wants to leave quietly without a trace. She also wants to euthanize my blind dog instead of leaving him with my dad or anyone else. My blind dog is 13, has huge lumps all over his body, and has Cushing's disease so she thinks he doesn't have much time left. I can't imagine doing such a thing because he is not in pain and still goes to the bathroom/eats as normal. We can't leave him with anyone else because he becomes severely depressed if we are not there - we once left him at a friend's house and he refused to eat/drink for two days.


I don't know what to do or what to say to either of my parents at this point. I did suggest that my mother come with me in a few weeks when I move to San Francisco for a new job so that she can be physically distanced from my dad and decide then whether she wants to officially divorce him. I want to bring my dog along as well. My mom thinks this will make my dad even angrier and that this will put me in the middle of their fight and get me hurt. She is convinced that my dad will hunt us down and kill us. At the same time, as much as I hate what my dad did, I want to help him and I'm worried about leaving him behind. I know that if we leave him, he will become depressed, lonely, and will be unable to take care of himself. He has had a troubled past with his own parents and I think his anger management issues stem from that.


Honestly, I'm unsure of what the best course of action would be for the well-being of both my parents. I know this was long, but I'm looking for any kind of advice on how to act in this situation.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My [22F] Father [56M] has anger management issues and is prone to violent outbursts. I don't know how to best help my mother [55F] who wants to leave him without officially divorcing to go back to her home country. It will be difficult financially. I also don't know how to approach my father about this issue."
6miylt,1,2017-07-10,"m4f family, multi-character, bi, and more",MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6miylt/m4f_family_multicharacter_bi_and_more/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. 

2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 

3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature. 

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 

5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! 

Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters."

6mjcog,2,2017-07-10,Likelihood of individual mandate being enforced during next year's tax season? I'm losing Medi-CAL...again.,princesszatra,HealthInsurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6mjcog/likelihood_of_individual_mandate_being_enforced/,"Sorry, I'm gonna do a little rant/backstory. I'll do a TL;DR at end but I need to get this off my chest.

Last May, I got a short-term paid internship. While I had it, my Medi-CAL got cut off because I made too much. My boss at the internship was a really really nice lady and made me eligible for insurance through the internship, but that only lasted until October when the internship ended. I tried to get back on Medi-CAL but I didn't hear back from them. Finally, this year in like March I got back on Medi-CAL and they back-dated it to say I was covered starting Oct of last year. But that took almost a month of sitting with a social worker and sitting on hold calling the county and crap.

Anyway, so I had Medi-CAL again, so I could finally get prescriptions for my chronic migraines again. And this whole time I was unemployed. I didn't know about unemployment insurance and that I could apply for it or anything, but the social worker said that I had to in order to qualify for Medi-CAL again since I wasn't working. Cool, I thought. I did that, and I've been getting unemployment ever since. Then I finally got a minimum wage retail job at the end of May. Since its just part time I still qualify for unemployment and I still get a portion of what I was getting when I didn't have a job. Now Medi-CAL has determined that I make too much money and don't qualify. I did the math and yes, the unemployment insurance that they made me sign up for to qualify for Medi-CAL earlier this year puts me $200 over the threshold to qualify for Medi-CAL and my insurance will be terminated at the end of this month. How's that for luck?

I can't afford to buy insurance and I really don't wanna try to fight this with the county, their numbers are right, I do make too much according to their ridiculous rules. I mean, my total monthly income won't even pay for one month's rent here, but I'm too rich to be on state health insurance...fucking bullshit. If I decide to just be uninsured am I gonna face a penalty? I don't think there was one last year, right?

TL;DR: Medi-CAL thinks a minimum wage retail clerk who is on unemployment makes too much money to qualify. Can't afford to buy insurance. Will I get hit with a penalty if I don't?"

From independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report to the House on President Clinton. Some of the language in these documents is sexually explicit.

Previous Page | Table of Contents | Next Page
II. 1995: Initial Sexual Encounters
Monica Lewinsky began her White House employment as an intern in the Chief of Staff's office in July 1995. At White House functions in the following months, she made eye contact with the President. During the November 1995 government shutdown, the President invited her to his private study, where they kissed. Later that evening, they had a more intimate sexual encounter. They had another sexual encounter two days later, and a third one on New Year's Eve.

A. Overview of Monica Lewinsky's White House Employment

 	 	 
 	 	

Monica Lewinsky worked at the White House, first as an intern and then as an employee, from July 1995 to April 1996. With the assistance of family friend Walter Kaye, a prominent contributor to political causes, she obtained an internship starting in early July, when she was 21 years old.(131) She was assigned to work on correspondence in the office of Chief of Staff Leon Panetta in the Old Executive Office Building.(132)

As her internship was winding down, Ms. Lewinsky applied for a paying job on the White House staff. She interviewed with Timothy Keating, Special Assistant to the President and Staff Director for Legislative Affairs.(133) Ms. Lewinsky accepted a position dealing with correspondence in the Office of Legislative Affairs on November 13, 1995, but did not start the job (and, thus, continued her internship) until November 26.(134) She remained a White House employee until April 1996, when -- in her view, because of her intimate relationship with the President -- she was dismissed from the White House and transferred to the Pentagon.(135)

B. First Meetings with the President

The month after her White House internship began, Ms. Lewinsky and the President began what she characterized as ""intense flirting.""(136) At departure ceremonies and other events, she made eye contact with him, shook hands, and introduced herself.(137) When she ran into the President in the West Wing basement and introduced herself again, according to Ms. Lewinsky, he responded that he already knew who she was.(138) Ms. Lewinsky told her aunt that the President ""seemed attracted to her or interested in her or something,"" and told a visiting friend that ""she was attracted to [President Clinton], she had a big crush on him, and I think she told me she at some point had gotten his attention, that there was some mutual eye contact and recognition, mutual acknowledgment.""(139)

In the autumn of 1995, an impasse over the budget forced the federal government to shut down for one week, from Tuesday, November 14, to Monday, November 20.(140) Only essential federal employees were permitted to work during the furlough, and the White House staff of 430 shrank to about 90 people for the week. White House interns could continue working because of their unpaid status, and they took on a wide range of additional duties.(141)

During the shutdown, Ms. Lewinsky worked in Chief of Staff Panetta's West Wing office, where she answered phones and ran errands.(142) The President came to Mr. Panetta's office frequently because of the shutdown, and he sometimes talked with Ms. Lewinsky.(143) She characterized these encounters as ""continued flirtation.""(144) According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Senior Adviser to the Chief of Staff, Barry Toiv, remarked to her that she was getting a great deal of ""face time"" with the President.(145)

C. November 15 Sexual Encounter

Ms. Lewinsky testified that Wednesday, November 15, 1995 -- the second day of the government shutdown -- marked the beginning of her sexual relationship with the President.(146) On that date, she entered the White House at 1:30 p.m., left sometime thereafter (White House records do not show the time), reentered at 5:07 p.m., and departed at 12:18 a.m. on November 16.(147) The President was in the Oval Office or the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. Lewinsky worked during the furlough) for almost the identical period that Ms. Lewinsky was in the White House that evening, from 5:01 p.m. on November 15 to 12:35 a.m. on November 16.(148)

According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President made eye contact when he came to the West Wing to see Mr. Panetta and Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, then again later at an informal birthday party for Jennifer Palmieri, Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff.(149) At one point, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked alone in the Chief of Staff's office. In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her pants.(150)

En route to the restroom at about 8 p.m., she passed George Stephanopoulos's office. The President was inside alone, and he beckoned her to enter.(151) She told him that she had a crush on him. He laughed, then asked if she would like to see his private office.(152) Through a connecting door in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office, they went through the President's private dining room toward the study off the Oval Office. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""We talked briefly and sort of acknowledged that there had been a chemistry that was there before and that we were both attracted to each other and then he asked me if he could kiss me."" Ms. Lewinsky said yes. In the windowless hallway adjacent to the study, they kissed.(153) Before returning to her desk, Ms. Lewinsky wrote down her name and telephone number for the President.(154)

At about 10 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she was alone in the Chief of Staff's office and the President approached.(155) He invited her to rendezvous again in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office in a few minutes, and she agreed.(156) (Asked if she knew why the President wanted to meet with her, Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""I had an idea.""(157)) They met in Mr. Stephanopoulos's office and went again to the area of the private study.(158) This time the lights in the study were off.(159)

According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President kissed. She unbuttoned her jacket; either she unhooked her bra or he lifted her bra up; and he touched her breasts with his hands and mouth.(160) Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""I believe he took a phone call . . . and so we moved from the hallway into the back office . . . . [H]e put his hand down my pants and stimulated me manually in the genital area.""(161) While the President continued talking on the phone (Ms. Lewinsky understood that the caller was a Member of Congress or a Senator), she performed oral sex on him.(162) He finished his call, and, a moment later, told Ms. Lewinsky to stop. In her recollection: ""I told him that I wanted . . . to complete that. And he said . . . that he needed to wait until he trusted me more. And then I think he made a joke . . . that he hadn't had that in a long time.""(163)

 	 	 
 	 	

Both before and after their sexual contact during that encounter, Ms. Lewinsky and the President talked.(164) At one point during the conversation, the President tugged on the pink intern pass hanging from her neck and said that it might be a problem. Ms. Lewinsky thought that he was talking about access -- interns were not supposed to be in the West Wing without an escort -- and, in addition, that he might have discerned some ""impropriety"" in a sexual relationship with a White House intern.(165)

White House records corroborate details of Ms. Lewinsky's account. She testified that her November 15 encounters with the President occurred at about 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., and that in each case the two of them went from the Chief of Staff's office to the Oval Office area.(166) Records show that the President visited the Chief of Staff's office for one minute at 8:12 p.m. and for two minutes at 9:23 p.m., in each case returning to the Oval Office.(167) She recalled that the President took a telephone call during their sexual encounter, and she believed that the caller was a Member of Congress or a Senator.(168) White House records show that after returning to the Oval Office from the Chief of Staff's office, the President talked to two Members of Congress: Rep. Jim Chapman from 9:25 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., and Rep. John Tanner from 9:31 p.m. to 9:35 p.m.(169)

D. November 17 Sexual Encounter

According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had a second sexual encounter two days later (still during the government furlough), on Friday, November 17. She was at the White House until 8:56 p.m., then returned from 9:38 to 10:39 p.m.(170) At 9:45 p.m., a few minutes after Ms. Lewinsky's reentry, the President went from the Oval Office to the Chief of Staff's office (where Ms. Lewinsky worked during the furlough) for one minute, then returned to the Oval Office for 30 minutes. From there, he went back to the Chief of Staff's office until 10:34 p.m. (approximately when Ms. Lewinsky left the White House), then went by the Oval Office and the Ground Floor before retiring to the Residence at 10:40 p.m.(171)

Ms. Lewinsky testified:

We were again working late because it was during the furlough and Jennifer Palmieri . . . had ordered pizza along with Ms. Currie and Ms. Hernreich. And when the pizza came, I went down to let them know that the pizza was there and it was at that point when I walked into Ms. Currie's office that the President was standing there with some other people discussing something. 

And they all came back to the office and Mr. -- I think it was Mr. Toiv, somebody accidentally knocked pizza on my jacket, so I went to go use the restroom to wash it off and as I was coming out of the restroom, the President was standing in Ms. Currie's doorway and said, ""You can come out this way.""(172) 

Ms. Lewinsky and the President went into the area of the private study, according to Ms. Lewinsky. There, either in the hallway or the bathroom, she and the President kissed. After a few minutes, in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she told him that she needed to get back to her desk. The President suggested that she bring him some slices of pizza.(173)

A few minutes later, she returned to the Oval Office area with pizza and told Ms. Currie that the President had requested it. Ms. Lewinsky testified: ""[Ms. Currie] opened the door and said, 'Sir, the girl's here with the pizza.' He told me to come in. Ms. Currie went back into her office and then we went into the back study area again.""(174) Several witnesses confirm that when Ms. Lewinsky delivered pizza to the President that night, the two of them were briefly alone.(175) 

Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President had a sexual encounter during this visit.(176) They kissed, and the President touched Ms. Lewinsky's bare breasts with his hands and mouth.(177) At some point, Ms. Currie approached the door leading to the hallway, which was ajar, and said that the President had a telephone call.(178) Ms. Lewinsky recalled that the caller was a Member of Congress with a nickname.(179) While the President was on the telephone, according to Ms. Lewinsky, ""he unzipped his pants and exposed himself,"" and she performed oral sex.(180) Again, he stopped her before he ejaculated.(181)

During this visit, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President told her that he liked her smile and her energy. He also said: ""I'm usually around on weekends, no one else is around, and you can come and see me.""(182)

Records corroborate Ms. Lewinsky's recollection that the President took a call from a Member of Congress with a nickname. While Ms. Lewinsky was at the White House that evening (9:38 to 10:39 p.m.), the President had one telephone conversation with a Member of Congress: From 9:53 to 10:14 p.m., he spoke with Rep. H.L. ""Sonny"" Callahan.(183)

In his Jones deposition on January 17, 1998, President Clinton -- who said he was unable to recall most of his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky -- did remember her ""back there with a pizza"" during the government shutdown. He said, however, that he did not believe that the two of them were alone.(184) Testifying before the grand jury on August 17, 1998, the President said that his first ""real conversation"" with Ms. Lewinsky occurred during the November 1995 furlough. He testified: ""One night she brought me some pizza. We had some remarks.""(185)

E. December 31 Sexual Encounter

According to Ms. Lewinsky, she and the President had their third sexual encounter on New Year's Eve. Ms. Lewinsky -- by then a member of the staff of the Office of Legislative Affairs

-- was at the White House on Sunday, December 31, 1995, until 1:16 p.m.; her time of arrival is not shown.(186) The President was in the Oval Office area from 12:11 p.m. until about the time that Ms. Lewinsky left, 1:15 p.m., when he went to the Residence.(187)

Sometime between noon and 1 p.m., in Ms. Lewinsky's recollection, she was in the pantry area of the President's private dining room talking with a White House steward, Bayani Nelvis. She told Mr. Nelvis that she had recently smoked her first cigar, and he offered to give her one of the President's cigars. Just then, the President came down the hallway from the Oval Office and saw Ms. Lewinsky. The President dispatched Mr. Nelvis to deliver something to Mr. Panetta.(188)

According to Ms. Lewinsky, she told the President that Mr. Nelvis had promised her a cigar, and the President gave her one.(189) She told him her name -- she had the impression that he had forgotten it in the six weeks since their furlough encounters because, when passing her in the hallway, he had called her ""Kiddo.""(190) The President replied that he knew her name; in fact, he added, having lost the phone number she had given him, he had tried to find her in the phonebook.(191)

According to Ms. Lewinsky, they moved to the study. ""And then . . . we were kissing and he lifted my sweater and exposed my breasts and was fondling them with his hands and with his mouth.""(192) She performed oral sex.(193) Once again, he stopped her before he ejaculated because, Ms. Lewinsky testified, ""he didn't know me well enough or he didn't trust me yet.""(194)

According to Ms. Lewinsky, a Secret Service officer named Sandy was on duty in the West Wing that day.(195) Records show that Sandra Verna was on duty outside the Oval Office from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.(196)

F. President's Account of 1995 Relationship

As noted, the President testified before the grand jury that on November 17, 1995, Ms. Lewinsky delivered pizza and exchanged ""some remarks"" with him, but he never indicated that anything sexual occurred then or at any other point in 1995.(197) Testifying under oath before the grand jury, the President said that he engaged in ""conduct that was wrong"" involving ""inappropriate intimate contact"" with Ms. Lewinsky ""on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997.""(198) By implicitly denying any sexual contact in 1995, the President indicated that he and Ms. Lewinsky had no sexual involvement while she was an intern.(199) In the President's testimony, his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky ""began as a friendship,"" then later ""came to include this conduct.""(200)

Is this theory that the weak hairs are shedding so stronger hairs will grow true? or is that bullshit

6mjsud,82,2017-07-10,My [20F] mother [60] wants my to support her financially,nowjo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mjsud/my_20f_mother_60_wants_my_to_support_her/,"Let me begin by saying this -- I adore my mother. We have had our issues but I love her to death and would do absolutely anything for her. However, I'm young, I've got a whole life ahead of me and I'm scared that I'll be taking care of her for the rest of my life.

For the last decade or so, she hadn't worked. She was a stay at home mom for the first eight years of that and then when I went to college she just stayed at home -- no income. Her husband supported her. Let's call him Bob -- I hate Bob. But that's another story. The point is that now my mom and Bob are potentially splitting up and my mom is looking to me to save her.

It's important to point out that she's not lazy. At least I'd like to think she isn't. She worked to support three kids on minimum wage and welfare for twenty years prior to getting married again. She worked her ass off and I'll never negate that. However, I also don't know how to explain that I don't want to feel the burden of caring for someone else financially at such a young age.

I'm still at college, graduating in a few months and job hunting and she has dropped hints more than a few times that I'm her golden ticket. She's said things like -- 'I can't wait for you to interview here so we can just leave.' Or 'I'm really just waiting for this job opportunity to come through for you so I can just leave and Bob can kiss my ass.' 

Meanwhile I am sweating bullets trying to find a good job that's applicable to my major but all anybody wants me for are little to no paying internships that I would love to take but can't because I have to now help financially. FYI all my classes are online for my final semester so I moved back home, which is why I'm able to look into full time work in the first.

She even said to me that she doesn't want to put me in the position that her mother put her other sister in -- one in which my aunt cared for my grandmother for fourteen years and was miserable. But then she says she wants to drive for a car service and keeps telling me that I'm the one that has to fill out the paperwork for her and she keeps putting the onus for me to get her into the work force anytime either of us brings it up. I have to apply for jobs for her. I have to sign her up for the car service. I have to research this opportunity for her. I don't want to be responsible for that either! Especially when I'm trying to find my own job.

I'm scared. I'm scared to end up at some dead end job just for the money because I had to support my mother. I don't want to get stuck -- I want to go to graduate school in the Spring and we can't both live off my student loans.

I don't know what to do.

Tl;dr mother wants to be financially dependent on me and. Makes it my responsibility to find her a job. Scared of ruining my future."
6mk1be,12,2017-07-11,She shouldn't have made me wait so long. [MF][1st][cheat][interr],NotDaddyFL,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/6mk1be/she_shouldnt_have_made_me_wait_so_long/,"I was already clenching my jaw. I was damned near growling, actually.

I would control myself -- for now -- but she really shouldn't have made me wait this long.

I focused on what still needed to happen first.

I had invited her to this lunch. I was therefore hosting, technically, so I arrived at the restaurant early. I chose a table outside, under an umbrella, to showcase our Miami winter for my tourist friend. It was probably a bit silly. I knew Morocco didn’t lack for sunshine, breezes, and beaches. Still, I wanted to set the stage correctly, and this was right.

I sat down as the waiter set menus on the table, poured water, and started rambling. I smiled and nodded... but I wasn’t listening. Keeping my composure was going to be more difficult than I had expected. My guest certainly wouldn’t notice; I was as experienced at these types of meetings as she was inexperienced. But still… the wait. I wanted her, and it was affecting me.

Twenty minutes later -- and ten minutes late -- Maryam arrived. She got out of her Uber, thanked the driver. She spotted me from the sidewalk, smiled her girlish smile, and walked toward me in the uniform I had seen her in so many times on Snapchat: a loose cotton v-neck t-shirt, coral this time, and tight little jeans. Her shoes, sunglasses, and modest earrings added the slightest touch of elegance to the casual outfit, and all of the colors she wore accentuated her copper skin, long black hair, and almond eyes. She was a smart girl, sophisticated for a girly 23-year-old, and she knew what looked good on her. As simple as they were, her clothes fit her personality just as well as her jeans fit her skinny thighs.

She paid attention to detail... which is why I knew that her slender frame would be accentuated by perfect lingerie underneath those simple clothes.

I couldn’t stop thinking about that lingerie all morning, and not just for the obvious reasons. In my mind, I was sure she had agonized over whether to put on the lingerie when she got dressed in her hotel room that morning. After two years of talking, her in Morocco, me in Miami, I knew her well. She would be honest enough to realize that putting on that lingerie signaled her willingness. That she probably shouldn’t do it; that the very fact that she was considering wearing lingerie at all meant she should rethink whether to meet me on this trip.

But she would dismiss those thoughts... and put on that lingerie. “It won’t hurt,” she’d think. “Just in case.” She would know that these were lies, and foolish ones at that... but she would allow her desire to get the best of her.

Maryam was Muslim, but not particularly religious even by Moroccan standards. She was a thoroughly-modern, combatively intellectual girl earning her Master's degree back home. But she was traditional; conservative in ways. She kept the holidays, respected her parents, fasted on Ramadan. Her virginity still mattered. It should have gone to a Muslim boyfriend back home. Under ideal circumstances, even to a husband on their wedding night. It definitely, definitely wasn’t supposed to go to me.

I was a 35-year-old white American businessman with my own carefully considered, thoroughly irreligious set of ethics… ethics that, while sophisticated and rigid in their own way, permitted me to cheat on my wife, whom I loved deeply. Very rarely, and very selectively… but still. I was a married man, and by her own personal philosophy, Maryam should not have been going near me.

We had met on an anonymous chat app. She used it to vent and flirt, I used it to discreetly meet and screen potential affair partners. I didn’t usually talk to women on other continents, but she posted something funny about bad pick-up lines, and I was bored. I struck up a conversation with her… and we soon struck up a flirty friendship. We discussed our totally different lives. I was candid with her about my cheating and reasoning behind it; she was candid about her distaste for it. But we shared a sick sense of humor and a love of honest debate about important topics. She also loved hearing about my sexual adventures despite her objections to them. My deeply dominant side, the women I seduced, the submissives I put over my knee and tied up. She was unrepressed and loved learning about and discussing sex, despite being a virgin who had never been able to bring herself to orgasm… though certainly not for lack of trying. I flirted with her shamelessly, and she teased back just as shamelessly. She often admitted to touching herself while talking to me, and I silently hoped to bring her to her first orgasm with my words alone. It wasn’t to be.

I regularly invited her to visit me in the U.S. as we spoke. She always laughingly refused, despite constantly bemoaning the sorry state of her love life. Eventually, she found a boyfriend, an older student in another city in Morocco whom she liked and trusted. After months with him, she told me that she expected him to take her virginity. I was happy for her, and I had always known that my ideas of having her weren’t much more than a fantasy... but I was still deeply disappointed.

Three months into her relationship with her boyfriend, she found out that he was a player. He was flirting with other girls, and probably cheating, though the distinction didn’t matter to Maryam. He was something other than the boy he was supposed to be, and that dishonesty was enough for her to break things off. She cried a little, but she was frustrated, mostly.

In a few weeks she had righted herself emotionally, but she still needed a break. And she was more frustrated than ever before. By her relationship, by men. By her standards, her virginity, her inexperience, her pent-up needs. It was at that time that she planned her trip to the U.S., a welcome relief brought on by her career: she wanted to hunt for internships in her field here.

She mentioned the trip to me as she planned it, but she was unusually vague about details. I knew she was grappling with whether to meet me. I didn't bring it up; pressure from me would not have brought her closer. Finally, reluctantly, she admitted that she planned to spend two days in Miami during the trip.

Knowing me... knowing what I wanted... it was clear. She never would have told me this unless she wanted it too. I immediately invited her to meet me for lunch, and she accepted... leading to now. To her standing just feet in front of me.

Still... the wait. It wasn't wise to keep a man like me waiting that long.

I smiled, rose to greet her. We both took off our sunglasses, and I gave her a casual hug and a kiss on the cheek that lingered. I inhaled her... she smelled fresh, just the faintest bit floral. I pulled her chair out and she moved like the nervous girl she was as she sat in it.

When meeting someone in real life for the first time after developing a relationship online, there is always some cobweb of awkwardness to swat away before proceeding... but something sick inside me -- the sadist, likely -- enjoys this. So I sat back in my chair, smirked, and silently looked into her eyes for a minute. She smiled back, likely aware of what I was doing... but that didn’t stop it from working. She shifted in her seat, her self-consciousness blooming under the heat of my gaze. “Stop it,” she said. Her mousy, French-accented English was even more disarming in person than it had been over the internet for all these months. I grinned... and waiting long enough to make it clear that her commands were never commands to me. And then I began our conversation.

It was easy enough to break the tension… that tension, at least. We talked quickly, first about her trip so far, then about the menu as we ordered, then about her interviews as we ate. But the real tension, the real reason we were both there, burned slowly under our friendly talk. Each of us broke out into sly smiles here and there. Any passerby who noticed us would have known what game we were playing. But that didn’t make it any less fun.

We finished lunch and I paid the bill. I smiled and proposed going for a walk. She accepted. I guided her silently toward the beach from the restaurant. Eventually, I pointed toward a cool, shadowed alley on the way, and we walked toward it. Once there, I took her hand. She stopped abruptly, shocked, wondering if it was starting now.

It was.

I stepped in front of her, an inch from her, and looked into her eyes, to her frozen expression of anticipation. And I kissed her. Holding her head. She stiffened and resisted, almost reflexively, almost ceremoniously. But I held her head to mine in my hands, and her mouth soon opened for me. She began to kiss back… and she melted. Her body slackened and she leaned into me. She didn’t even realize when I stopped holding her head to mine, when my hands drifted down to her waist. When I started holding her gently. And she began to kiss back harder, hungrily.

We lingered like that for minutes. I hailed an Uber and we got in, kissing in the backseat as we rode to the hotel I had already booked and checked into for this very purpose. A good, modern place; excellent sheets, a big bed.

We walked through the hotel toward our room. She was nervous, quaking here and there. I made fun of her, and she laughed. But I held her little hand, and she followed without resistance.

I unlocked and opened the door to the airy room and pulled her in. She admired it; she wasn't rich back home, but she had excellent taste and high standards, and I knew she appreciated the place. I led her to the center of the room, with space all around her, and put my hands on her waist, firmly. My grip told her to stop and stand, and she obeyed.

I stepped in front of her and pulled her into me, gripping her ass through her jeans as I kissed her again. Just as she started to melt again, as her last memories of protest faded… I pulled my face away from hers.

And I slapped her.

Not too hard... it helps to have practice. But enough to make it sting. She winced, and her mouth opened in silent shock, but her eyes didn’t leave mine.

“For making me wait, Maryam… Now… You’re mine.”

I stepped back a foot, looking her up and down. I set my hands at the collar of her shirt and easily ripped the “v,” tearing a straight line down the entire front. I would get her a new shirt later or give her one of mine. I hardly cared.

I pulled her gutted shirt back around her shoulders, exposing her bra. I was right, of course. It was black, lacy, and fit her small breasts perfectly. Her frame was so slight that I had always assumed her breasts would be tiny. They weren’t, at least not in that bra.

My eyes went dark and my jaw stiffened. I grabbed her bra straps and pulled them down around her elbows, flipping the cups off of her breasts. They were small, but perfect… unbelievably buoyant; sometime later I would have to explain to this girl how blessed she was. But for now, I leaned down and reached around her, squeezing her torso. My tongue was instantly on her right nipple. Hungrily. Licking, biting gently. Groping her with one hand while I continued pulling her into me. I have taken virginities before, and I was always very gentle when I did. But not this time. This time I wouldn’t restrain myself, focus solely on her, put on a pleasant performance for the benefit of a naive audience. Today, I would loosen the leash on my rougher instincts enough for Maryam to see exactly how much I wanted her.

I moved my head back from her chest, turning to look up into her eyes. I grabbed her wet nipple and twisted it, slowly, as I clamped it harder and harder between my thumb and forefinger. She closed her eyes, took in a breath, let it out slowly and shook… and melted a little more as she did.

My lips traveled down her chest toward her perfect waist. I had never seen her nude; she was 5’4 and she had told me that she weighed 84 pounds, so I didn’t expect many curves. I was wrong about that, too. She had a petite but perfectly feminine body. I admired it and kissed slowly down toward her belly button… but my right hand reached up, grabbing her throat. I gripped firmly, lifting her chin, but not hard enough to cut off her breath… at least, not more than her own fear and excitement had already cut off. She was shaking, and letting out the tiniest moan.

My head was at her jeans now, and I could feel a faint touch of her heat escaping against my face. I looked up at her, her eyes now closed, unable to take in all of her senses… and I smirked.

Slowly, very slowly, I unbuttoned her jeans and pulled down her zipper, without moving my eyes from her face. She was flustered, her cheeks red. Nervous. More turned-on than she had been in her life; that was a guess on my part, but a well-educated one. I exposed the top of her panties, lacy and black again, a low cut that rode her hips. I felt the hot breath of her pussy on my skin. And… I stopped.

I separated from her, rose to my feet. Walked around her slowly, an arms length from her, circling her like a shark circles prey. She opened her eyes and nervously followed me with them. Her neck swiveled as I circled her once... twice... my eyes on every part of her. She stood there, her shirt ripped, her bra around her arms, her pants open at the top, sagging on her hips.

After two more circuits, I stepped in close from behind her, grabbing the hair at the base of her scalp in one hand, her throat in the other. I tipped her face up to me and put my face next to hers, my lips at her ear. “Now… I want to taste you, virgin.”



I took my hand from her throat and moved it down her body, pressing into her neck, then her sternum, following the soft line down her belly. My fingers slid between her panties and her skin and I brushed the slightest tuft of hair. That was a concession to me, an act of submission; she knew I preferred some hair even though she thought most men would rather she be bald. I smiled... and reached further down.

She was already swollen for me, her thick wetness soaking the inside of her panties. Perfect, I thought. Her inner lips protruded just a bit, a woman's cunt, and they separated smoothly when I pushed my finger between them. I slowly coated my fingertip in her juice, though venturing into her panties had almost completed that job already. I moved my finger down, teasing her hole, then traveled up toward her clit, touching her as slowly and lightly as possible. I wanted her, and I wanted to be rough with her, but she needed to wait. That was fair; that was necessary.

I moved my finger back and forth over her clit, dipping just my fingertip into her here and there, with the lightest touch... I teased her until her body responded, her back tightening away from me as I held her hair in my fist, her ass pressing into me, her knees starting to shake, her breaths getting ragged... I brought her close to coming, probably far closer than she had ever been before...

And then I stopped. She needed to wait.

I brought my hand out of her panties and in front of her face, pointing my glistening finger up, and I tightened my grip on her hair. I wanted her to see how her body was responding to me.
""Look, Maryam."" ""Yes,"" she said. ""Your body already knows it's mine. Good girl, Maryam."" She nodded, the motion of her head constrained by my grip on her hair.

I brought my finger to my lips, still next to her ear. I sucked her taste off my finger, rolling her flavor on my tongue, taking time to release my finger from my mouth. “You taste perfect, virgin,” I whispered into her ear. “I want more.”

I let her hair go and grabbed her slight shoulders, pushing her down, hard, onto her knees, then forward onto her hands. Her breasts pointed down out of her shirt, her jeans slid another inch down her hips as she bent. I bent down and yanked her jeans down around her knees. I felt like I had just unwrapped a gift. The low v-cut of her lace panties accentuated her hips perfectly. Her ass was small, of course, but not the least bit bony, and her crotch was visibly soaked. I growled.

I hunched down behind her and set my fingers at her crotch, massaging her through the thin material. I was immediately between her lips, and she was almost immediately swaying with my rough motions. I leaned over her and set my lip at her earlobe again without stopping the swirls between her legs. “You look amazing, Maryam. Better than I imagined, and I want you even more. Do you like the way my fingers feel on your pussy, Maryam?” She nodded. I moved two fingers slowly and firmly up and down her slit, sliding the material of her panties against her, making her shudder. “Good girl, Maryam. You like that...

“And you are going to fucking love when I eat your cunt. Get up, virgin.”

I grabbed her hair again and pulled her up, facing away from the bed. Her body followed; she was so light I wasn’t sure if I had lifted her entirely myself or whether she stood up. I let go of her hair... and shoved her onto the bed by her shoulders. She tumbled back, her exposed ass landing on the bed a foot away from the edge, her knees still hanging off it. I walked toward her, smirking, unbuttoning a few buttons on my shirt and undoing my belt, throwing it near the bed, bearing down on her like a predator.

I pulled her shoes off, letting them fall to my sides. I grabbed her panties and jeans at her knees, lifting her ass in the air and pulling her closer to the edge of the bed, then slid them down her legs and tossed them aside. She was naked from the waist down, her wet cunt glistening between her clenched thighs, her arms still in the mess of her ripped shirt and bra straps, her nipples firm and pointing at me.

In one motion I separated her thighs, got on my knees at the edge of the bed, and pulled her hips to my mouth. My tongue dived into her cunt. Probing her pusssy deeply, hungrily consuming her… but mostly paying attention to that poor, ignored little clit of hers. Lashing it, licking underneath it. Flicking it, reaching on top of it with my fingers to press in, to pull her lips up, slowly increasing my pace and pressure on it. “That cunt tastes so good, Maryam. And I know my cock is going to agree.”

I focused my tongue on her clit and soon brought my right arm under her thigh. I dipped one finger into her… slowly… and I felt her carefully-preserved hymen, my prize for waiting all these months. I put another finger into her, putting the slightest pressure on her walls, stretching her just a little bit for me, still licking her clit and tasting her perfect pussy…

I brought my left hand under her thigh and back on top of her, reaching up to put it at her throat, pinning her to the bed as I watched her feel like she never had, hearing her moans find a rhythm, getting louder with each breath. She started to tense up under me, coming close, starting to shake. “That’s right, Maryam. Come for me. I won’t last long in you, not this time, and it will hurt. So come for me now, virgin.”

Her hands went down to my head, grabbing my hair, pulling me into her as my fingers went just a bit deeper, my tongue just a bit faster. I separated from her. “Come for me, virgin,” I growled. “Before I make you mine.”

And... she erupted. Shaking, yelping, her back bending violently, pushing her cunt into me, then into the bed, arching and spasming, her eyes clenched, her mouth open… I leaned into her cunt and didn’t stop, listening to her as the release for which she waited so long finally washed over her… she let out a long, loud note as she quaked and held my head to her.... And then she gradually released her grip from me.

I separated my head from her and smirked as I watched her spasms diminish. The view up her body was gorgeous, and her shakes accentuated her soft lines, her taut breasts, the firmness of her body.

I rose to my feet, still admiring her, still smirking. I methodically finished unbuttoning my shirt and took it off. She opened her eyes as I stepped out of my shoes, then my pants. She was looking at me, and when she realized what I was doing she craned her neck to see the bulge in my underwear. I pulled them off, my stiff cock bouncing out of them as I stepped free. “Now, Maryam. Finally. You’re mine. Get up.”

I took her hand in mine and pulled her up to her feet. I turned her around by the shoulders, making her face the bed. I removed her ripped shirt, then briefly debated how to remove her bra -- rip, unclasp, or up and over? Up and over. Standing behind her, I drifted my fingertips from the base of her neck to her ass, and back up, making her shudder again. I shuddered, too. I grabbed the back of her neck with my right hand and the front of her hip with my left… then I folded her at the hip, forcing her face into the bed.

“I need you, Maryam. I’m not going to go easy on you. If you need to scream, scream into the bed. Do you understand?”

“Yes, Sir.”

I let go of her neck, leaving just my left hand around her hip, using my right to carefully guide my cock to her, just barely making contact with her lips. Struggling to control myself, I pushed in less than half an inch, just placing the tip of my cock at her entrance firmly enough to stay there. I bent over her. “Are you ready for me, Maryam?” She nodded into the bed; I felt her body tense. I chuckled into her ear as I straightened my back, putting both my hands on her hips.

“No, Maryam. You’re not ready. But that doesn’t matter to me now.”



I looked down. Her long black hair fell on each side of her head; her face was already submerged in the mattress. Her skinny arms reached out in front of her. Her narrow shoulders, narrower waist, the curve of her spine. My hands on her incredible hips. I could feel her warmth on my tip…

And the time required to take that in… that was precisely as long as I was able to control myself.

I lifted my right hand from her hip, high in the air in front of me… and I spanked her in the fleshiest part of her left ass cheek. Hard, holding my hand into her skin after the strike. She yelped into the bed and clenched, but I held her to me. This would not be a spanking session. I would not put her over my knee, I would not even spank her again; I needed to fuck her, and now. But she needed to be reminded -- right now.

She shouldn’t have made me wait so long.

I put my hand back on her hip, tightening my grip… and swiftly buried myself in her, gliding easily and feeling her stretch, feeling the bump as I pushed directly through her hymen. Pushing up into where she’d never been touched, let alone filled like this. She yelped, only a few decibels escaping from the bed. I knew I would make her come from fucking -- obviously not now, not this time; she was mine now -- and I momentarily imagined what it would be like when she’s actually ready for me. But my imagination wasn’t going far. I was right where I wanted to be... and I held there, forcing her hips back into me even harder... groaning in my satisfaction at how tight she was... watching her back tense, her arms splay. I knew she was wincing from pain, and yet and feeling pleasure and relief at the same time.

Being that deep in her… Feeling the stretched depth of her cunt, knowing that this gift was mine and only mine, that not even Maryam had touched herself where my thick cock was now plunged… These thoughts had the simultaneous effect of tightening my grip on her hips and loosening my grip on myself.

I began fucking her.

Hard.

Impaling her pussy on my cock, pulling her little body onto me… I was more than twice her size; when I pulled us together, she moved. I didn’t. It made her whole body sway violently into me, dragged her face up and down the bed. Still, she pushed her face into the bed, making garbled sounds of pain and lust. Finally, she had the good sense to support herself on her forearms, her head still facing the bed. I continued fucking her… but when I looked down and saw the faint blood on my shaft as it partially emerged from her cunt, I let out a deep growl, stopping again to hold myself inside her as deep as I possibly could. I saw her neck crane, her head tilt up, and she let out a long gasp… a second later her arm shot out to grab a pillow. She pulled it under her and buried her face in the pillow, clenching her forearms around it. I knew she was gritting through this, yet I had no problem with that. She would be fine, and I knew she wanted to give this to me, to see exactly what effect she had been having on me all this time, to learn what desire she evoked in a man. I was so consumed by the feel of her that these thoughts scarcely lasted a second.

I resumed fucking her. I found my rhythm, found her angles, felt her ass smacking into my middle… somehow, I had stretched her enough to go even deeper, to feel her depth accommodating me, to bottom out. Her narrow fingers clenched the pillow. I grabbed her so hard that I knew the skin at her hip bones would be bruised. I was fucking her so hard that I knew her sit bones would hurt when she sat... even without spanking her there. Her cunt would feel me for days, but I wanted her to feel me in her bones... and she would. I grinned as I pounded her… she really shouldn’t have made me wait so long.

Her head twisted around to the side. She didn’t look at me; her eyes were still closed, and I realized that she was listening to me: I had started to rumble, a groan under my breath, like a bear waking up… a grunt with the rhythm of how I fucked her… I was close. I bent over her a little, still fucking her, but not as primally. I spoke. Hoarse, ragged. “I’m… going to come in you, Maryam. Deep in you… Now. You are… too good.”

I straightened up again, fucking her... watching her little body as I took on that crushing grip on her hips, that merciless pace and depth again, pushing her away from me and then ramming into her, my growls growing louder with each thrust…

After maybe ten more pumps of this, I held my cock deep inside of her, hurting her inside and smashing her hips and ass into me, coming in wave after wave as I emptied myself into her pussy… and I roared. I mean that. When I come hard -- and I came very hard when I fucked her -- I roar. She screamed into the pillow. My roar eclipsed it, but I heard her high note above my lower ones... and only then did I wonder whether she had been screaming into the pillow the whole time. It was entirely possible. I stood behind her amazing body for a few seconds, calming down, shuddering violently, my cock still inside her, my hands involuntarily still pulling her into me…

I leaned forward over her back, my lips finding her face, kissing her cheek just in front of her ear. She turned her face from the pillow toward me, and I kissed her lips, parting them as my sweaty chest slickened her back and stuck to it, as my hands reached up her arms to find her hands… still inside her, I pushed her forward on the bed, taking her off her feet and landing my weight on top of her… both of us broke the kiss to catch our breaths, and then immediately found each other again. Her eyes were still closed.

After more kisses, I whispered into her ear again, knowing that she would feel my smile against her skin, my hot breath. “Are you ok, Maryam? I couldn’t stop myself… I needed that. I needed you… are you ok?”

She shuffled her shoulders, snuggling into me, her eyes still closed. She winced a little, feeling the changes inside her body as she moved, as my cock softened inside her. She opened her eyes, looking through her hair into my eyes. She smiled. And nodded.

“Yes... Yes, Sir.”

“Good. I’m glad, Maryam. Relieved, actually…

“You really shouldn’t have made me wait so long.”"

At the end of July we will both be moving back home to save money which is a little under an hour drive, so not too bad. Since living together things have been getting difficult, in that I'm starting to get annoyed with his personality. Without going into too much detail, I feel that he's just really immature (won't apply for jobs in his field but complains about it, avid gamer with flat out rage reactions, never admits his faults, argues just to argue). Although we don't have huge blow up fights with each other, we argue all the time about stupid shit and never see eye to eye as we're both quite stubborn. However almost every time I have to be the one to let it go or admit that I'm in the wrong - but he NEVER does that. And he always ends with ""See? I told you."" Which boils my fucking blood. I work pretty much full time, also with an internship, on top of summer classes but he doesn't understand that I get stressed out. My need for affection/attention is much higher than his, but all he does is play video games. I also play video games, but sometimes I have to beg him to come hangout with me. I got an IUD put in little less than a year ago, and since then my sex drive is completely shot. We've had sex a few times since the beginning of 2017. I want to have sex but I just never feel the desire to do it. Was living together a mistake? The older we get, the less I feel we are compatible. I love him but I'm not sure I'm *in love* with him anymore and that's a scary feeling. I'm sure I know what anyone would say about this but it's the worst feeling honestly."
6mkhbx,8,2017-07-11,4 months have passed..,smelerby,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/6mkhbx/4_months_have_passed/,"..since you decided you couldn't forgive me for not trusting you. When you decided I wasn't worth fighting for, like you had always said I was. You said you were probably going to regret your decision and you hoped that we'd get back together some day. You said you hoped we were meant to be and everything would be alright again, but as time has taught us, we weren't meant to be. 

I still don't get how you went from those words to the cold person you are now. It's okay though, I've stopped trying to figure it out. I need my energy for more important things in my life. I'm heavily invested in my own life now and I feel alright again. My busy schedule gets me through the days.

4 months. That's half of how long we've been together. I'm amazed by how fast those months have passed, it also scares me a little bit. So where am I after 4 months? I still love her like I did when we were together, but she's not mine to love anymore. I'm just not one to lose feelings easily. I told this girl I'd love her forever and I'm afraid I'm going to keep that promise. I'm just learning to live with the reality of being in love with someone that doesn't love me anymore.

In general, I'm feeling alright again. She isn't on my mind 24/7 anymore, but still a lot more than I'd like her to be. I've gotten a lot better at pushing those thoughts out though. Also, the thoughts of her don't hurt as much anymore. The overall intensity of my pain has decreased, but it's still present. 

While my life is ""fine"" at the moment, I hate to admit that I'm unhappy. I work a lot, go the gym and hang out with friends occasionally and that's it. While she has summer break and is probably doing all kinds of fun things. I know that doesn't matter, but it sometimes crosses my mind.

I recently broke NC after 53 days, but it didn't affect me too much this time. I'm glad to say that time has been very good to me and I'm not afraid of breaking NC in the future. I know I can handle it. She said we'd talk again someday, but I don't think she will initiate it. If she does, it won't matter. I can have a normal conversation with her without feeling like shit afterwards. Of course, I still want nothing more than for her to come back to me, but I know that's not what she wants and I've accepted that. 

I think the next step is just finding someone new, but I'm afraid that's going to take a while. I'm working around 60 hours a week, my friends are moving or starting jobs and I will transition from working into another internship after the summer. So I have limited opportunities to meet someone for a while and I don't know what my life will look like after that. It worries me sometimes, but I'm too busy to be in a relationship anyways. I'd love to find someone again, but I guess I'll have to be okay with being alone for now.

Sorry for the long post, but for those of you who stayed until the end, thank you for reading and thank you for your continued support. I can't stress enough how important time is. I thought I'd never make it to where I am today and I still have a long road to go, but time really is the only cure. I hope you are well &lt;3"
6mkl0m,4,2017-07-11,Asking Employer about Medical Marijuana,tertial578,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/6mkl0m/asking_employer_about_medical_marijuana/,"Hey /r/trees,

I started work last week at a small (~10-15 employees) tech company in California as an intern. Since marijuana is legal here for both medicinal and recreational use, I've been considering pursuing medicinal marijuana to treat anxiety. I already obtained a doctor's recommendation, but I'm having second thoughts in the event that my company decides to drug test me. I haven't been tested yet, and I've already been working here just under a week.

I like to think I've made a good impression so far (I've done my best to go the extra mile and my boss has complimented me on the work I've done so far), so I don't think I give off the impression that I'm a slacker or stoner. While the workplace policy doesn't require drug testing, it does allow for random tests, and since my company does take on federal contracts, it seems possible.

My boss seems like a relaxed guy so I was considering sitting down with him one-on-one, and explaining that this was something I was considering after already having been to counseling, while emphasizing that I would never come to work under the influence or let it affect my performance, and that the job is my priority. Is this a bad idea? Could this reflect negatively on me? Is there a better way I can approach this?

Thanks for all the help!"
6mkrr5,1,2017-07-11,There's been a situation about this girl [20F] in the back of my [20M] head that's bothering me recently.,NaggingThought,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6mkrr5/theres_been_a_situation_about_this_girl_20f_in/,"I'll start this off by saying I'm at the point in my summer break where I'm a bit lonely, so that plus the nagging thought in the back of my head (hence the name) about this isn't mixing well and it's just bothering me.

Moving on, this situation is a couple months old and has some backstory to it. There's this cute girl that's the same major as me - same core classes up til the last semester, she was in most of them. Either way, I had talked to her previously, thought she was cute, and would've pursued but I was too afraid of messing up. That being said, last semester she was in my math class again, and I talked to her a couple of times before class. I'll break up how each one went just so it's easier to read, they're just the context of the ""situation"" mostly.

First time I talked to her, it was after some REALLY awkward kid had talked to her. I saw that, said I couldn't possibly do as bad, and did it, and it went good. She remembered me from the last few semesters, remembered we had the same major, and I got her number. She was responsive and nice, so I felt like it was good. I texted her a couple hours later for a follow up about an advisor, she told me the info and I said thanks and that was it. By next class, I was sick and couldn't talk. Next few math classes I did catch her looking at me whenever she walked into class, she sat directly next to me a few times (it wasn't a normal lecture hall, it was desks, so it's not very meaningful to me). Just couldn't talk, I felt terrible.

I got over whatever I had, then felt too scared to talk to her again and started overthinking what wouldn't be ""weird"" to talk to her about. And the 2nd time, it was weird. I remembered there was an exam coming up, and started talking to her about it. And the conversation lulled, and I just couldn't bring myself to change the topic to keep it flowing, so it stagnated and felt awkward by the end of it, and we just kind of walked into class and that was it.

Third time, after heavy overthinking and not learning my lesson, I talked to her in like the last week of the class. I was a stuttering mess, I just don't know what happened. I mean I tried to say hi and lead it off nice, but I caught her off guard at first, which sucks. I then got a bit freaked out in my head, and promptly forgot what I was gonna say. I said something about the class, she kind of was like, ""wtf"" and I just said I was tired and sorry and walked away.

I decided I had like one more shot before the semester ended, and figured I could try a text conversation, months after getting her number. So I faked needing help with the homework and texted her, and I received no response. I have no idea if it was delivered or not, no idea if she responded and I didn't get it cause my service at my house is terrible or what. Either way, I got completely fucked over, and at the time I did see her at a few finals studying with her friends before the exam, but I was pretty sure talking to her then would distract me and be a shitty time.

So here I am, months into a summer break wondering about this situation. I know from previous conversations she got accepted into an internship and is taking online classes next semester, so I'll probably not see this girl for a while. Do you think, on the off chance we do have class together/I see her again, that I'm totally fucked, or is just a lot worse in my head than it actually is and it wouldn't hurt to talk to her again? I mean we have the same major, wouldn't surprise me if we do run into each other.

**TL;DR:** I kind of psyched myself out every time I talked to this girl I had a crush on last semester, and it's been bugging me for a couple days thinking about it in the back of my head. I screwed up almost every time I talked to her, so I'm honestly wondering if she'd be weirded out or something on the off chance I try to talk to her in the future if we have the same classes or something. The first time I talked to her she seemed really nice/responsive thought :/"

Collectively the donors can change the law if organized. Start with the largest economies first: CA, TX, NY, and FL. (Crosspost from TheRedPill)",RageLionRising,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/6mkxdc/the_bill_of_family_rights_2_befriend_the/,"**TL;DR: Privately contact the offices of political donors to your state level government. The donor class of men are our key allies. They have the power and the logical self-interest to repeal and replace the state Family Codes.**          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 1: STATE LEVEL GOVERNMENT**          
&amp;nbsp;

The legal base of authority for the Family Courts exists at the state level — not at the city or national level. Our state legislatures are the only ones with the authority to completely re-write the Family Codes. To change the law overwhelming financial pressure must be placed on state level government.          
&amp;nbsp;

*Note to Civics 101 newbies: Your state level legislature is completely separate from your federal level legislature. Both legislatures are bicameral, meaning they have two chambers. The lower chamber is called the House of Representatives. The upper chamber is called the Senate.*          
&amp;nbsp;

*The state House of Representatives and state Senate are one level lower than the federal House of Representatives and federal Senate. They are entirely different people. It's the difference between the state Governor and the U.S. President.*          
&amp;nbsp;

The Family Courts derive their legal power specifically from state level laws called the Family Codes. This means the problem is very spread out. And it has lead to the current legal diaspora family men find themselves in today. This nationwide but decentralized legal structure raises the question: Where do we start to apply pressure? The answer is a matter of economics.          
&amp;nbsp;

Prioritize the states with the largest economies first. California, Texas, New York, and Florida. States with smaller economies will be inclined to follow their lead in a legal domino effect. A prime example of this occurred after Governor Ronald Reagan signed into California law ""no-fault divorce"" in the early 1970s. No-fault divorce soon went nationwide.          
&amp;nbsp;

To get started here are wiki links to the state legislatures for the big four states:

If state government politicians stonewall after you call them — they almost certainly will — then onto Part 2: Befriend the donors.          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 2: BEFRIEND THE DONORS**          
&amp;nbsp;

After contacting your state legislatures they will be on notice. However, the legal inertia will not be there for them to pass legal reform. Expect to reach an intern. The intern will take down your message, but a politician will likely not return your call.          
&amp;nbsp;

Here's why. Even if your State House of Representatives authors a bill, the danger always exists for any *individual legislator* that a media pile on will occur. This will be driven by female-centric advertisers and businesses hungry for the female dollar. The media tone would be like any Mike Pence post as written in the TwoXChromosomes subreddit.          
&amp;nbsp;

As a collective, the donor class can place a financial strangle hold on the legislature, and thus force a change to the state Family Codes regardless of media uproar. They have the power to eliminate the Family Courts profit motive entirely. *And it's in their personal best interests to do so.*          
&amp;nbsp;

The Family Courts are at their heart an evil business empire that goes straight for the heart of any man — his family. It makes sense on an economic and moral level to put these evil competitors out of business. The donor class can pressure the legislature to eliminate the current profit-driven model of the Family Courts into a tax subsidized one. The tax subsidized model will discourage the use of the courts in the first place. It's good for every man's wallet.          
&amp;nbsp;

Right now the political donors are the (unwitting) financial base of power that keep the poorly written Family Codes in place. They are a sleeping giant waiting to be awakened.          
&amp;nbsp;

Many of the donors are business men, union heads, and political action committees (PACs). All run by men — men who want to protect their children and hard earned wealth from the potential of vindictive ex-wives, psychotic ex-girlfriends, and the profit-driven Family Courts.          
&amp;nbsp;

The political donor class are our allies regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans. So when you reach out do not disrespect them. Even if they tell you to *fuck off* provide your contact information and stoically move onto the next donor. Leave the door open for them to join us down the line. The goal is to gradually slither our grip around the state legislatures like a boa constrictor. Once tightened the grip won't be loosened, but this process will not happen quickly.          
&amp;nbsp;

There are simply too many politicians for change to occur overnight. And those politicians are magnified by an even larger pool of donors. I want to emphasize: *each and every individual politician has a pool of donors.* Our work is definitely cut out for us.          
&amp;nbsp;

One lawmaker may have only ten donors. Another may have a hundred. The pool of donors is gigantic. There are too many donors to list here, but an effort needs to be made to contact all of them. These men have direct influence over our laws.          
&amp;nbsp;

Votesmart.org lists the major donors for state level politicians in CA, TX, NY, and FL. Ballotpedia.org and Followthemoney.org are also good sources, but I have found that Votesmart.org tends to provide the information with less clicking around and digging.          
&amp;nbsp;

**Once you have reviewed your state government from Part 1 above, make a list of their individual donors using Votesmart.org.** Build a telephone call list complete with street addresses. Find out the top guy at each donor's organization, and give him a call. Avoid dealing with subordinates as much as possible. You want to talk with the top guy. If you get them on the phone, be quick and to the point. Identify yourself. Inform him you are calling since he donated to X state House Member, X state Senator, or X Governor. Explain that Family Law is corrupt and places all men in the state in great financial jeopardy. The Bill of Family Rights aims to fix that. Tell him you need his support to enact such legislation because he holds leverage over the politician.          
&amp;nbsp;

The largest donors give away millions of dollars, and may not be reachable by phone. In those cases I recommend driving to their office and forcing an impromptu meeting. Expect to be told to fuck off. And again, provide your contact information and leave respectfully.          
&amp;nbsp;

A list of suggested laws for the Bill of Family Rights is provided below in the comment section.          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 3: ORGANIZING A ""CLOSED DOOR"" STRATEGY**          
&amp;nbsp;

I recommend creating a core group of ten to twenty men per each of the major four states. Utilize GeoTRP, the TRP IRC channel, or TRP.RED (if the forums are unlocked) to create a cyber team that is geography based.          
&amp;nbsp;

To defend against the feminist uproar it's best to avoid the limelight, stay private, and be systematic.          
&amp;nbsp;

It will be harder to attack us with independent state teams. Couple that with a slow and gradual befriending of the donors to our state House of Representatives, state Senate, and state Governors; and legal reform will become unstoppable. They will go after our jobs with a nasty doxx article. In response, we will slowly tear their asymmetrical feminist laws to shreds.... With a Mike Pence smile on our face.          
&amp;nbsp;

Make one-on-one phone calls, drive to an office, engage in closed door meetings, talk to guys on manosphere forums, e-mail your buddy or relative who got screwed in the divorce, text message your male friends, quietly inform your work colleague, etc. Keep spreading the word through any *private means* available. If you want to remain anonymous purchase a burner cell phone, communicate through TOR, and create throwaway accounts.          
&amp;nbsp;

With time the numbers could grow beyond a core group of twenty men to a thousand plus. Though a thousand men may be overkill as it risks becoming chaotic.          
&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, huge numbers will work in our favor to change the laws faster than just twenty men could. That's assuming we keep our state teams organized. A clear chain of command, a hierarchy prioritizing the duties, and clear instruction for each man would be necessary. Guys outside the core group could engage in simple duties like once-a-month phone banking or leaving messages with legislator interns.          
&amp;nbsp;

As a secondary measure of spreading the word, I suggest reaching out to Matt Drudge, Philip Defranco, Karen Straughan, Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, and Dr. Drew (narrator of Divorce Corp). I am pretty sure they would portray us in a fair light. Just understand that media attention is a low priority for us. The ""open door"" media path that feminists walk with ease is most often blocked to men.          
&amp;nbsp;

This is because advertiser supported media outlets are dependent on the female dollar (television, radio, public protests, youtube trending, reddit front page, etc.) And unfortunately MRAs have an awful habit of struggling in vain to obtain mainstream acceptance. They mimic victimhood culture, and they gravitate repeatedly to outlets that marginalize, laugh at, and ignore them.          
&amp;nbsp;

In contrast, our one-ally-at-a-time ""closed door"" strategy is not only indifferent to being ignored, it will push through any media uproar.          
&amp;nbsp;

It is the organizational equivalent of the Youtube honey badger video. The honey badger takes repeated bites to the face from the feminist cobra and keeps on going. It is a method not dependent on good luck, mainstream media approval, or widespread public sympathy. It *forces* a change to the law by applying increasing leverage to our lawmaker's financial pressure points.          
&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately, that application of financial pressure will be up to you, the silent reader, to make tangible. This post is nothing more than a rough roadmap for reform. Personally, I don't have as large of a dog in this fight as some of our older readers do. The guy who is not commenting or logged in right now — the one who is buried in draconian child support — has the most incentive. Not me.          
&amp;nbsp;

If you have the motivation, please speak up in the comment section below. A show of hands will tell other readers the potential strength we have. Based on my experience I typically see ten times the amount of readers than the number of votes. So if I get 200+ votes on my post I can see that there were 20,000+ readers who voted neither way.          
&amp;nbsp;

This means there is a silent majority. And the potential is huge. Whether that majority has the will to organize will soon be seen.          
&amp;nbsp;

-------------------------------------          
&amp;nbsp;

**PART 4: AFTER THE GOAL HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED DISPERSE**          
&amp;nbsp;

To avoid the same errors of 1970s 2nd wave feminism — which mutated into 2016 3rd wave feminism and a proto-form of authoritarian communism — any state group that has accomplished the goal of passing a Bill of Family Rights should disperse immediately afterward.          
&amp;nbsp;

Like Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus and President George Washington once the objective has been obtained it is time to step down from influence and go back to the farm. That is how we stand as a symbol to future generations of men, to serve the greater good of Western society, and to uphold the principals of civic virtue.          
&amp;nbsp;

**2. Create a list of donors for every state House Representative, state Senator, and state Governor. Votesmart.org, Ballotpedia.org, and Followthemoney.org list their donors.**          
&amp;nbsp;

**3. Avoid the limelight and stay private. Network with each other, the state lawmakers, and donors behind closed doors.**          
&amp;nbsp;

**4. My recommended changes to the law are provided below in the comments section.**          
&amp;nbsp;

**5. Disperse once the Bill of Family Rights is implemented in your state.**

6mljxw,2,2017-07-11,Considering a career switch from software engineering - lots of questions inside,teabagsOnFire,ATC,https://www.reddit.com/r/ATC/comments/6mljxw/considering_a_career_switch_from_software/,"First of all, I'll list my relevant background:

* BS in Computer Science from a top 5 university. 3.0 GPA.

* 1 year of full time work at a startup in Hong Kong after graduation.

* 2 full time summer internships during college.

* A variety of other work experience since 2011, including swim lessons/lifeguarding, course grading, volleyball officiating, and a food service gig.

* Depression/anxiety on medical record

* Age: 24

* Main appeals to me:

 *  Like I've seen others say, the problem solving itch is scratched but there are less 
 indefinite, multi-day problems to track.
   
  * No crunch time (in the tech project sense).

 * Lifestyle is fine in terms of shifts. I don't plan to have any children.

Questions:

* I've done a few searches within this subreddit and it seems that multiple people have switched from tech to ATC. Any others with this experience want to chime in? Would I be stupid to throw away my current path?

* Is depression/anxiety that was managed away years ago a disqualifying factor? The only place I've seen with details mentioned psychosis or other similar severe diagnosis as an automatic DQ. It certainly does not seem like I have a diagnosis of that level IMO, but figured I'd check on this.

* *Critical* question here. If I'm currently working overseas (not military by any means) and I apply, when would I expect to have to get to the US to take an assessment?

* Would you consider the basic outline of my application above competitive? I've got a solid degree and some work experience. I figure that at least puts me in a decent spot among ""off the street"" applicants.

* Just casually browsing the sub, I see it often mentioned that clearing $100k, $150k up to around $200k is possible within the early part of the career. Is there much potential for growth beyond this or does it level off? Are increased pretty much solely determined by moving to busier stations?

* It's pretty common in tech to take a full year off between jobs, but ATC by it's very nature doesn't seem to have many ""in between"" phases. Is there any way to work 7 years, let a contract expire, then take a year away from the industry and come back or do people grind it out straight through to 56?

6mm4si,1,2017-07-11,I [21F] believe I am bad for my bf [20M] long term and am considering breaking up with him to protect him from myself,anonygrl294739292747,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mm4si/i_21f_believe_i_am_bad_for_my_bf_20m_long_term/,"Let me first start off by saying I am head over heels in love with my boyfriend. We met 5 years ago in high school when my family moved from another country and we dated about a year before breaking up due to some personal issues of mine that interfered in our relationship. 

I suffered from depression pretty much all through my teen years and never sought help before a suicide attempt not long into our relationship. Safe to say, this wasn't the best way to start off each of our first relationships, however, due to circumstances in his past he was incredibly empathetic and was there for me through the whole ordeal. We were together pretty happily until the last half of our senior year when he broke up with me as I had a lot of issues that were driving a wedge between us.

After our freshman year of college we reconnected and met up a few times over the summer. Each time was electric and neither of us could deny the connection we felt (I confessed my love for him on the 2nd meeting). After the summer, we waited a while to commit as we go to different schools and wanted to make sure we could handle long-distance. By October it became clear that it was what we wanted and we've been together ever since then (nearly 2 years).

This summer we got internships in the same city and have been living together in the same apartment. It has mostly been great however I've been noticing things about myself that I believe make me rather incompatible with him - and maybe anyone. 

I have several bad personality traits that I have not been able to change, only slightly lessen since going through therapy after my suicide attempt, and sometimes I wonder if I'm even able to put in the work to change them. Here's a list: I have anger issues, I get annoyed easily, I can be cold, distant, overly sensitive, withholding, condescending, bitchy, unsympathetic and in general find I have issues with conflict resolution when it comes to him specifically. Basically I'm finding that I just constantly repeat patterns from my childhood in conflict where I'll get quiet, sensitive and super unwilling to discuss things while I process my emotions. I distance myself, and as my partner put it to me the other day, I put us in adversarial positions when it's possible to be on the same team and work through the issue together. 

These issues crop up maybe 1-2 a week max, however, each time I disappoint myself with how hard I make resolving the issues and it leaves me feeling really bad about myself and my ability to be a good partner to him. This makes me want to be better the next time however I can't stop repeating the same mistakes so I also feel incredibly defeated.

I know I haven't said much about my partner but he is, overall, much more emotionally mature than myself and great at conflict resolution and all the rest - I am the sole problem in these issues. 

Beyond all of this, I believe that to some degree I am sociopathic. I lie without abandon and will basically do anything to get what I want while convincing everyone around me I'm a completely different person. This includes: cheating on him with an FWB and being an on and off again sugar baby as I'm often strapped for cash... I *know* all of this will probably come back to bite me one day. I really don't want our relationship to end, however my behavior concerns me and I worry it will eventually hurt my partner. I believe that if I don't do anything we might end up together and I'll doom him to share a life with someone unable/unwilling to change their ways. Either this or we'll break up once he finds out how awful I really am as a human being and I'll be crushed.

All of this has recently led me to thinking I should break up with him at the end of the summer for his own sake. Should I go through with this or amp up trying to improve myself when I think I may be unable to change? How do I even go about that?


TL;DR: My bf is a fantastic human all-around and I love him deeply and think he is my One, however I have many faults I'm not sure I'll ever be able to resolve that I know will hurt him in the long run. Right now, I want to break up at the end of this summer and I'm caught between wanting to change but not knowing how and wanting to protect him from myself. What do I do?"

6mmgne,1,2017-07-11,"First time with depression - advice on managing fatigue, apathy, and memory problems",tinmanshrugged,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6mmgne/first_time_with_depression_advice_on_managing/,"TLDR; I'm a 22 year old female college student and my dad died last Fall. The depression started then and has been getting worse and worse. The past several weeks have been the worst so far and I just get so scared sometimes. I'm angry and scared about having no control over these really bad spells. My body wants to sleep upwards of 14 hours/night but I have to work. Wellbutrin and lexapro have had some issues, I'm on trintellix now. Caffeine, stimulants, and a low carb/high protein diet have little effect on my energy, focus, and memory. What else can I try? Also, how do you accept that you have a mental illness instead of berating yourself for not trying hard enough?

&amp;nbsp;

I think I've been depressed for a few years now but I never imagined I could have a mental illness. I thought I just needed to try harder to be happy, think of all the good things in my life, and work harder to find motivation. Then last Fall, my dad died unexpectedly of a heroin overdose. Thankfully, I have people who cared enough about me to see my depression before I did and push me to start seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants. 

&amp;nbsp;

The first med they gave me was wellbutrin, but I never really felt a difference from that. Then I started lexapro and it helped my mood sooooo much. It helped with depression and anxiety, it was great. After a few weeks though, I noticed I was just feeling really tired everyday. Caffeine didn't seem to help much and the adderall I sometimes took was way less effective too. I just had no motivation to do almost anything. I was on lexapro for a little over 5 weeks before the exhaustion became too much. I could barely function without a ton of caffeine and adderall, which gave me a little energy, but mostly made me feel sick to my stomach.

&amp;nbsp;

I stopped taking lexapro during finals week. I was exhausted (not from studying because I barely did) and fuzzy and I knew it was from the lexapro. It's been 2 months since then. I had a whole month of doing nothing after finals and I slept 12-14 hours/night, forcing myself to get out of bed by noon at the latest. I definitely could have slept more. I was exhausted all day too and I remember trying to do a chore for my mom. I thought that once I got into it, I'd enjoy the hard work (that's how it normally is) but it just wore me out so quickly. I worked really slowly and I had to stop after about an hour - I had done barely anything. This was very hard for me, because my mom means so much to me and I want to help her as much as I can. And it was kind of the first time I really felt that I wasn't just lazy - I had no control over my energy and willpower.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought things would get better when I started my internship and at first it helped a little. Has anyone heard of the study where they found that sleep deprivation alleviated depression?
 [link!](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-sleep-deprivation-eases-depression/) The first week went ok but things got difficult quickly. Even though I was getting 7 hours of sleep, my body really wanted twice that much.

&amp;nbsp;

2 weeks ago, I got to a point where I was so sad and angry and frustrated that I literally **couldn't** do the things I wanted to do. I *want* to do them, I know I'm *capable* of doing them, but actually *doing* them seems impossible. I was exhausted all day long, I couldn't focus for more than a few minutes, and I would forget things almost instantly - this scared me the most. I do tend to jump around a lot in my thoughts but I can always work backwards to get to the important ones. I couldn't do that anymore. I spoke slowly and forgot a lot of words I wanted and often completely forgot what I was going to say. I'd be talking to someone about a funny story I heard yesterday, forgetting that the person I'm talking to is the one who told me the story. I was so scared - I knew this meant that my depression was getting worse. I even felt suicidal at times. I hate this - not having any control over when I'll randomly get so bad. It makes me so angry and so scared. 

&amp;nbsp;

I knew I couldn't live like this and that I had to do *something*. I called my therapist that I see during the school year and asked her to recommend a psychiatrist and whether she thought it would be worthwhile for me to see someone new for 2 months until school starts. She's so nice, she offered to meet me in the evenings. I get off work at 4 and drive an hour and a half to the town my college is in. That first meeting after about 6 weeks was really great. I talked more than I ever have before. I really struggle with feeling guilty and selfish for dwelling on my own problems, which are so small compared to what many people have to deal with. She wants me to stop discounting my feelings though and I'm trying.

&amp;nbsp;

I also went to a walk-in clinic where I'm staying and told them what I've been experiencing. The doctor gave me a new antidepressant to try called trintellix and she gave me the adhd med concerta. Trintellix should start to kick in by next week, fingers crossed! However the concerta barely did anything for me. I felt the small ups and downs all day when the doses were released and then wearing off. I called after a few days of it not working and she gave me a prescription for adderall.

&amp;nbsp;

It's 20mg XR - the same dose that I used to take during the school year. I didn't take it every week and if I did take it during a week, it would be 1-4 times total. It helps more than the concerta and it's definitely better than nothing but it's still just a very subtle effect. I took 2 this morning to make sure it wasn't a tolerance problem. An hour and a half later, I was nodding off while driving to work.

&amp;nbsp;

Has anyone tried stimulants for their depression before? The fact that they're not working is very discouraging to me. I felt like they were my last hope of feeling normal. On the bright side, they are still **better than nothing**. They gave me the motivation to go grocery shopping for the first time in a couple weeks, which means healthy food instead of eating out, which *should* help with my symptoms too. I'm normally a pretty healthy eater though so I'm not hopeful of it making a big difference.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry it's so insanely long! I really want to find someone who's felt the same things. Tell me how you dealt with the debilitating physical symptoms. Tell me how you came to accept your mental illness and not feel guilty and lazy? What can I do when I have a really bad night or few days? When I'm sobbing alone in bed, wishing I could call someone but afraid that no one will care or that they'll be angry that I woke them up?"

I would control myself -- for now -- but she really shouldn't have made me wait this long.

I focused on what still needed to happen first.

I had invited her to this lunch. I was therefore hosting, technically, so I arrived at the restaurant early. I chose a table outside, under an umbrella, to showcase our Miami winter for my tourist friend. It was probably a bit silly. I knew Morocco didn’t lack for sunshine, breezes, and beaches. Still, I wanted to set the stage correctly, and this was right.

I sat down as the waiter set menus on the table, poured water, and started rambling. I smiled and nodded... but I wasn’t listening. Keeping my composure was going to be more difficult than I had expected. My guest certainly wouldn’t notice; I was as experienced at these types of meetings as she was inexperienced. But still… the wait. I wanted her, and it was affecting me.

Twenty minutes later -- and ten minutes late -- Maryam arrived. She got out of her Uber, thanked the driver. She spotted me from the sidewalk, smiled her girlish smile, and walked toward me in the uniform I had seen her in so many times on Snapchat: a loose cotton v-neck t-shirt, coral this time, and tight little jeans. Her shoes, sunglasses, and modest earrings added the slightest touch of elegance to the casual outfit, and all of the colors she wore accentuated her copper skin, long black hair, and almond eyes. She was a smart girl, sophisticated for a girly 23-year-old, and she knew what looked good on her. As simple as they were, her clothes fit her personality just as well as her jeans fit her skinny thighs.

She paid attention to detail... which is why I knew that her slender frame would be accentuated by perfect lingerie underneath those simple clothes.

I couldn’t stop thinking about that lingerie all morning, and not just for the obvious reasons. In my mind, I was sure she had agonized over whether to put on the lingerie when she got dressed in her hotel room that morning. After two years of talking, her in Morocco, me in Miami, I knew her well. She would be honest enough to realize that putting on that lingerie signaled her willingness. That she probably shouldn’t do it; that the very fact that she was considering wearing lingerie at all meant she should rethink whether to meet me on this trip.

But she would dismiss those thoughts... and put on that lingerie. “It won’t hurt,” she’d think. “Just in case.” She would know that these were lies, and foolish ones at that... but she would allow her desire to get the best of her.

Maryam was Muslim, but not particularly religious even by Moroccan standards. She was a thoroughly-modern, combatively intellectual girl earning her Master's degree back home. But she was traditional; conservative in ways. She kept the holidays, respected her parents, fasted on Ramadan. Her virginity still mattered. It should have gone to a Muslim boyfriend back home. Under ideal circumstances, even to a husband on their wedding night. It definitely, definitely wasn’t supposed to go to me.

I was a 35-year-old white American businessman with my own carefully considered, thoroughly irreligious set of ethics… ethics that, while sophisticated and rigid in their own way, permitted me to cheat on my wife, whom I loved deeply. Very rarely, and very selectively… but still. I was a married man, and by her own personal philosophy, Maryam should not have been going near me.

We had met on an anonymous chat app. She used it to vent and flirt, I used it to discreetly meet and screen potential affair partners. I didn’t usually talk to women on other continents, but she posted something funny about bad pick-up lines, and I was bored. I struck up a conversation with her… and we soon struck up a flirty friendship. We discussed our totally different lives. I was candid with her about my cheating and reasoning behind it; she was candid about her distaste for it. But we shared a sick sense of humor and a love of honest debate about important topics. She also loved hearing about my sexual adventures despite her objections to them. My deeply dominant side, the women I seduced, the submissives I put over my knee and tied up. She was unrepressed and loved learning about and discussing sex, despite being a virgin who had never been able to bring herself to orgasm… though certainly not for lack of trying. I flirted with her shamelessly, and she teased back just as shamelessly. She often admitted to touching herself while talking to me, and I silently hoped to bring her to her first orgasm with my words alone. It wasn’t to be.

I regularly invited her to visit me in the U.S. as we spoke. She always laughingly refused, despite constantly bemoaning the sorry state of her love life. Eventually, she found a boyfriend, an older student in another city in Morocco whom she liked and trusted. After months with him, she told me that she expected him to take her virginity. I was happy for her, and I had always known that my ideas of having her weren’t much more than a fantasy... but I was still deeply disappointed.

Three months into her relationship with her boyfriend, she found out that he was a player. He was flirting with other girls, and probably cheating, though the distinction didn’t matter to Maryam. He was something other than the boy he was supposed to be, and that dishonesty was enough for her to break things off. She cried a little, but she was frustrated, mostly.

In a few weeks she had righted herself emotionally, but she still needed a break. And she was more frustrated than ever before. By her relationship, by men. By her standards, her virginity, her inexperience, her pent-up needs. It was at that time that she planned her trip to the U.S., a welcome relief brought on by her career: she wanted to hunt for internships in her field here.

She mentioned the trip to me as she planned it, but she was unusually vague about details. I knew she was grappling with whether to meet me. I didn't bring it up; pressure from me would not have brought her closer. Finally, reluctantly, she admitted that she planned to spend two days in Miami during the trip.

Knowing me... knowing what I wanted... it was clear. She never would have told me this unless she wanted it too. I immediately invited her to meet me for lunch, and she accepted... leading to now. To her standing just feet in front of me.

Still... the wait. It wasn't wise to keep a man like me waiting that long.

I smiled, rose to greet her. We both took off our sunglasses, and I gave her a casual hug and a kiss on the cheek that lingered. I inhaled her... she smelled fresh, just the faintest bit floral. I pulled her chair out and she moved like the nervous girl she was as she sat in it.

When meeting someone in real life for the first time after developing a relationship online, there is always some cobweb of awkwardness to swat away before proceeding... but something sick inside me -- the sadist, likely -- enjoys this. So I sat back in my chair, smirked, and silently looked into her eyes for a minute. She smiled back, likely aware of what I was doing... but that didn’t stop it from working. She shifted in her seat, her self-consciousness blooming under the heat of my gaze. “Stop it,” she said. Her mousy, French-accented English was even more disarming in person than it had been over the internet for all these months. I grinned... and waiting long enough to make it clear that her commands were never commands to me. And then I began our conversation.

It was easy enough to break the tension… that tension, at least. We talked quickly, first about her trip so far, then about the menu as we ordered, then about her interviews as we ate. But the real tension, the real reason we were both there, burned slowly under our friendly talk. Each of us broke out into sly smiles here and there. Any passerby who noticed us would have known what game we were playing. But that didn’t make it any less fun.

We finished lunch and I paid the bill. I smiled and proposed going for a walk. She accepted. I guided her silently toward the beach from the restaurant. Eventually, I pointed toward a cool, shadowed alley on the way, and we walked toward it. Once there, I took her hand. She stopped abruptly, shocked, wondering if it was starting now.

It was.

I stepped in front of her, an inch from her, and looked into her eyes, to her frozen expression of anticipation. And I kissed her. Holding her head. She stiffened and resisted, almost reflexively, almost ceremoniously. But I held her head to mine in my hands, and her mouth soon opened for me. She began to kiss back… and she melted. Her body slackened and she leaned into me. She didn’t even realize when I stopped holding her head to mine, when my hands drifted down to her waist. When I started holding her gently. And she began to kiss back harder, hungrily.

We lingered like that for minutes. I hailed an Uber and we got in, kissing in the backseat as we rode to the hotel I had already booked and checked into for this very purpose. A good, modern place; excellent sheets, a big bed.

We walked through the hotel toward our room. She was nervous, quaking here and there. I made fun of her, and she laughed. But I held her little hand, and she followed without resistance.

I unlocked and opened the door to the airy room and pulled her in. She admired it; she wasn't rich back home, but she had excellent taste and high standards, and I knew she appreciated the place. I led her to the center of the room, with space all around her, and put my hands on her waist, firmly. My grip told her to stop and stand, and she obeyed.

I stepped in front of her and pulled her into me, gripping her ass through her jeans as I kissed her again. Just as she started to melt again, as her last memories of protest faded… I pulled my face away from hers.

And I slapped her.

Not too hard... it helps to have practice. But enough to make it sting. She winced, and her mouth opened in silent shock, but her eyes didn’t leave mine.

“For making me wait, Maryam… Now… You’re mine.”

I stepped back a foot, looking her up and down. I set my hands at the collar of her shirt and easily ripped the “v,” tearing a straight line down the entire front. I would get her a new shirt later or give her one of mine. I hardly cared.

I pulled her gutted shirt back around her shoulders, exposing her bra. I was right, of course. It was black, lacy, and fit her small breasts perfectly. Her frame was so slight that I had always assumed her breasts would be tiny. They weren’t, at least not in that bra.

My eyes went dark and my jaw stiffened. I grabbed her bra straps and pulled them down around her elbows, flipping the cups off of her breasts. They were small, but perfect… unbelievably buoyant; sometime later I would have to explain to this girl how blessed she was. But for now, I leaned down and reached around her, squeezing her torso. My tongue was instantly on her right nipple. Hungrily. Licking, biting gently. Groping her with one hand while I continued pulling her into me. I have taken virginities before, and I was always very gentle when I did. But not this time. This time I wouldn’t restrain myself, focus solely on her, put on a pleasant performance for the benefit of a naive audience. Today, I would loosen the leash on my rougher instincts enough for Maryam to see exactly how much I wanted her.

I moved my head back from her chest, turning to look up into her eyes. I grabbed her wet nipple and twisted it, slowly, as I clamped it harder and harder between my thumb and forefinger. She closed her eyes, took in a breath, let it out slowly and shook… and melted a little more as she did.

My lips traveled down her chest toward her perfect waist. I had never seen her nude; she was 5’4 and she had told me that she weighed 84 pounds, so I didn’t expect many curves. I was wrong about that, too. She had a petite but perfectly feminine body. I admired it and kissed slowly down toward her belly button… but my right hand reached up, grabbing her throat. I gripped firmly, lifting her chin, but not hard enough to cut off her breath… at least, not more than her own fear and excitement had already cut off. She was shaking, and letting out the tiniest moan.

My head was at her jeans now, and I could feel a faint touch of her heat escaping against my face. I looked up at her, her eyes now closed, unable to take in all of her senses… and I smirked.

Slowly, very slowly, I unbuttoned her jeans and pulled down her zipper, without moving my eyes from her face. She was flustered, her cheeks red. Nervous. More turned-on than she had been in her life; that was a guess on my part, but a well-educated one. I exposed the top of her panties, lacy and black again, a low cut that rode her hips. I felt the hot breath of her pussy on my skin. And… I stopped.

I separated from her, rose to my feet. Walked around her slowly, an arms length from her, circling her like a shark circles prey. She opened her eyes and nervously followed me with them. Her neck swiveled as I circled her once... twice... my eyes on every part of her. She stood there, her shirt ripped, her bra around her arms, her pants open at the top, sagging on her hips.

After two more circuits, I stepped in close from behind her, grabbing the hair at the base of her scalp in one hand, her throat in the other. I tipped her face up to me and put my face next to hers, my lips at her ear. “Now… I want to taste you, virgin.”"
6mn2wx,9,2017-07-11,Season 2 Pacing and Season 3 Arcs,mr_gauntlet,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/6mn2wx/season_2_pacing_and_season_3_arcs/,"In light of the recent episode titles and the new opening that just got released I would like to talk about pacing this season and how I thought the season was going to go and how the future looks for season 3. Lets get into this!

**Major Season 2 and 3 Spoilers Below!!!**

&amp;nbsp;

First I would like to talk about the pacing of this season so far. I had originally thought that this season was going to only cover the Festival and Stain arcs with some “filler” in the Festival fights and we would see some more of the other students’ internships. I kind of did want these “filler” moments because it is parts we have only seen small sections of and I thought it would be cool to see them.
 
&amp;nbsp;

I also had the thought that this would make season 3 a more cohesive season. Starting with the End of Terms arc and ending with the Rescue arc. The 3 arcs that are in this timeframe are all directly related to each other and I felt that they would have a better flow and some character arcs expand over the course of these 3 arcs and then stop (as of now). Also these arcs have some of the best action in the entire series with the last fight being the best one (most fans would argree).  Also the arc after the Rescue arc is one of the worst arcs and I thought it would be a bad place to end it.

&amp;nbsp;

This makes me sound like I don’t like the current pace and will not like season 3 when it comes. That is wrong. I love the fast pace that the anime is going now. I think the speculated end point for this season, the mall talk, will be a good end point for this season.
 
&amp;nbsp;

My main concern was that some of the season might feel disjointed. I saw it as the second best arc starts the season then the best arc is in the middle and then the worst arc ends it, this is my objective opinion. But after just rereading parts of the manga I noticed something. Season 3 could be one of the best seasons in terms of cohesion.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Season 3 would focus extensively on Deku, Bakugo, and All Might. These three would serve as the focal points of the season. Bakugo will be kidnapped and we will feel his anger throughout the season ending with his fight with Deku and his emotions boiling to the surface. We will see Deku finally see the power he has to face in the future and he will have to deal with the fact that his mentor cannot save him anymore. Despite this we will see multiple steps he will take to becoming the best hero throughout the season. Also he will have so many interactions with Bakugo. Lastly we will see All Might’s biggest fight and a good portion of the aftermath of the fight. All this ends with all 3 of these characters having one of the best moments together where they just are all honest with each other. I really cannot wait for season 3 because I feel it will be amazing.

For my internship, I need to make a 3D model of a hard drive with exposed internal components for a trade show advertising video.

I have a lot of experience in After Effects, but more on the titles and effects side than 3D models. Can I use After Effects for this or should I be looking into a dedicated program?"

We go to different schools, so we are long distance, but we are excited to be able to spend the summer together.

Recently, she has been having a string of absolutely terrible luck. She lost her only friend group at the end of last year when she realized she no longer had much in common with them and has been feeling very depressed about coming back to school and having no friends. She has tried so hard to find a group of people she can fit in with (joined a sorority, has a job, in multiple clubs, tries to talk to people in her major), to no avail. It confuses and saddens me, since she's an outgoing, fun-loving person who SHOULD have a lot of friends (she was pretty popular in high school, too). A few weeks ago, her roommates for next year bailed on her, leaving her out to dry for housing. In the past month, she has been towed and ticketed twice, neither of which she deserved, in my opinion. And if that wasn't enough, yesterday she accidentally dropped her laptop and broke it. These things might seem a little trivial, but for a broke college student who is working her ass off to save up money/pay off loans, it's really disheartening.

It all makes me feel really sad for her and ends up bringing me down too. I've spent most of my work day today worrying about her and feeling down. This, in turn, makes me feel selfish for being sad, since I am not the one actually experiencing all of it. She spends a lot of time crying and I think she might be going through a minor depression of some sort. Since we are both living away from home in a new city this summer, she doesn't have family or friends to really be there for her. I know that this means i need to put in double the effort to be there for her when she needs it. I try my best to comfort her and let her know that she'll get through all of this, but each bad thing that happens to her just makes that harder and harder. I really do wish I was better at making her feel loved and convincing her that everything will be okay. What can I do to help in this situation?

I will be a third year next semester, and have a few questions about interning. How necessary is it to intern during the school years? I prefer to focus solely on studying because ive had many friends get blindsided starting year 3 and dont want to make similar mistakes. But if i dont intern during the school years, will i fall behind on my hours? Could i possibly only do interning during the summers and still be on track with the intern hours?

Also as a side note, does the mandatory hours (I heard of) during the summer after year 3 count towards my hours? And what about the 6th year rotations, do they count? Im just very worried that i wont be able to make up the hours in a short time frame during only summers if i decide to go this route.

On a unrelated note, does anyone know if ceutics lab requires a formal dress code such as ipm lab? Might as well ask since im here haha. Thanks in advance"
6moe6q,1,2017-07-11,Me [23 M] with my gf [24 F] of two years has been away on study abroad and is asking for space.,kladkald,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6moe6q/me_23_m_with_my_gf_24_f_of_two_years_has_been/,"My girlfriend applied for a 6 week study abroad/work internship in New Zealand and much to her surprise she was accepted. She was very nervous at first which is to be expected, but nothing made me worry about the stability of our relationship. In fact after two years with her we have had no major issues at all. We've lived together for a year and just signed on for another year at our apartment just before she left on this trip. 


At first it was more difficult for me than I had anticipated, but she was doing a good job of reaching out to me when she could and definitely putting in effort to face time me when possible. As the weeks went on and she got a close group of friends this has slowly died down to the point where she asked me for space last Thursday. Now granted I might have been a little needy wanting to talk to her and know how her trip is going etc. There were a few times that I got upset when I was expecting to hear from her or have a conversation, but end up receiving no notice from her that plans had changed. I reluctantly agreed but started to become fairly worried. I'm leaving in a week to fly out to Australia and the plan originally was to meet up with her, but something about the way things had gone had me second guessing if she was going to meet up with me or not. 


Her mom has been checking up on me every few days to see how I am and after my girlfriend asked for space she's been checking up more. Her mom found out by emailing my girlfriend to see how the trip was going. Girlfriend brought up that she had asked for space and that her perspective about everything was changing. She had brought this up to me as well right before asking for space. The last thing she said to me was she obviously cared for me and loved me it was just hard for her right now. After telling her mom this and the fact that she's looking into traveling abroad after graduating, her mom reached out to me more. 


I gave in after 5 days of space knowing I need to plan for this trip up ahead and I just wanted to know if I should be planning it with or without her. I shot her a message, something along the lines of can we make time to talk on the phone. She agreed and that happened this morning. Unfortunately for me this conversation didn't go as I'd hoped. When I asked her if I was going to see her in Aus or not she just said she didn't know. Diving a little deeper she mentioned wanting to possibly get a work visa for two years and work in NZ. I asked if she could give me an answer by Friday (once again planning reasons) as to if I would see her or not.


After hanging up her mother called to see how I was doing so I filled her in on the conversation. Apparently she emailed my girlfriend about it because my girlfriend came to me and told me not to talk about this stuff with her mom. While I disagree that I should I told her that I would stop and I have. 


I went to work but could not get any of this off my mind and decided to send her a message. 
Here's what it said:
""Last message from me, promise. I've cooled down and sent you something on Facebook that you should read (note this is on instagram, wanted to get on a couple platforms so she would see the message). I love you and I hope this space will help you figure out your life so you can do what makes you the happiest."" 

FB Message: 
""Hey, forget about the yes or no by friday. I'm glad you're having fun in NZ and I'm going to give you the space you need to enjoy that. I'm going to follow the plan we had which is going to Australia. I love you and would love to travel together.""


Well now I am significantly more worried than I was before. I don't have issues with her doing anything that she's done or wants to do, it's her life and if that's what makes her happy so be it. I just wish she would talk to me about it. I feel like after two years together there should be some sort of respect or want to share this with me, even if it is difficult for her to do so. 


I can't help but think she's just so caught up in this trip that she's forgotten about her life here. She has so much stimulation, close friends, and almost no responsibilities. Am I crazy? Did I do something wrong? Is this just part of life? 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend away on trip and caught up in that current life, seems like she forgot about the one she left behind. Momentary wanderlust or is it possible to change perspective enough to tank a healthy two year relationship in 4 weeks? "
6montc,2,2017-07-11,Can/should I move out? (NL),Jaejae88,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6montc/canshould_i_move_out_nl/,"Hey PF, I'm Jae , I'm 19 and I'm starting school in September to get a Bachelor in finance. I'm starting uni a year later than I wanted to because I chose the wrong bachelor course and in the Netherlands you can't switch as easily as in the US.  This is going to be long but I included a TL;DR at the end if that helps.

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons and bear in mind I do not live in the US, I live in the Netherlands. Also sorry for any formatting errors - I can never get the hang of it.

I'm set in what I want to do and I've made a plan but I'm looking for some second opinions. Not to persuade or dissuade me necessarily but to see if there's something I'm overlooking.

I want to move out but I'm unsure if its wise. I have two reasons for wanting to move out. A) I've had a rough time at school social wise, I was bullied a lot and haven't really had any friends since I was 14. This was partly my fault as I wasn't very outgoing but nevertheless I want to change that and I feel living in a dorm will help me to socialize. B) I want my own space. I love my parents, they're great and they've done a lot for me over the years but I want some independence. Especially since I have to go live internationally for 2 years as part of my bachelor. 

Insurance is covered by my parents, as is my phone. I receive a public transport stipend from the government that I don't have to pay back as long as I get my degree.

My degree is a 4 year program, the last 2 of which I will spend the majority of abroad. Half a year of studying abroad, a half year internship and in year 4 my thesis internship.

Tuition is 2001 euros a year. My first year is covered by my employer, my second year may be.  I intend to persue a Masters, if I get it in the Netherlands it will cost 2001 euros as well.  

Alright now for the breakdown of month to month expenses

All amounts are in euros

Income Monthly Total = 1199
   *  Part-time job (20hr/week)= 720
   *  Government stipends (not including public transport) = 279
   *  Parent stipend = 100 (this is not set in stone but they assured my they would help. I don't expect or want 
       more from them)

Expenses Monthly Total = 1120
   *  Rent = 495 (Student accommodation comes with utilities)
   *  Food = 200
   *  Study supplies = 25
   *  Fun money = 150
   *  Clothes = 50
   * Saving = 200 (Depends on what I have left over per month but this is the base amount)

By august I will have 3500 euros set away for tuition (this will be filled to 4000 over the first year), 1200 euros for a laptop (I hope spend around 1000 max but I prefer to have more than necessary due to software etc) and 400 for books. I have around 1400 in my bank account at the moment.

My question to you PF, with all the context provided, is it wise for me to move out or should I stay at home?

TL;DR I want to move out when I start my bachelor. I have to study internationally for 2 years and want some solo-living experience before then and to help become more social.

I missed out on doing a big 4 internship the past summer and since the masters degree is full time in classroom during the summer after graduation, I cannot do an internship then. I should be graduating with the master’s degree by December 2018 after I graduate with my bachelors in May 2018. I would like to study and get the CPA right after just to get it over with, so I'd assume I shouldn't get a job with Big 4 then as everyone tells me that there will be no time to study because of the work hours. Also, the whole 'you can potentially be working 80 hours a week"" is deterring me a bit from actually going big 4 because I want a well-balanced life. A much smaller company I worked for as an intern locally pays great and also has wonderful benefits for full timers (and 40-45 hrs a week). Should I try and just get a full job there after the masters while studying for CPA and then see where that leads me or do you think the big 4 is an absolute necessity to starting my accounting career post CPA certification? My only intentions with the Big 4 is the learning experience and the name on my resume for future jobs. I have no real intentions in working there for a long period of time. Another thing to note is I am interested in fraud and crime and I would potentially want to pursue forensic accounting somehow. Any thoughts/suggestions/personal experience/advice/etc.?"

***
To set the stage, a little less than 2 years ago (October 2015), I was:

* Very unhappy with the way I looked
* My girlfriend at the time broke up with me
* I was always lethargic and had no energy
* Depressed and just overall in a bad place

[Here is one of the worst pictures of me I could find.](http://i.imgur.com/MzDS66O.jpg) At the time, I intentionally made a dumb face so please excuse that.

In one of my multitude of attempts to receive incentive, I must have been perusing either this sub or another one like /r/keto and I saw someone quote Socrates:
&gt; No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.

And something just *clicked*. 

I *knew* I had to do something about my weight and health because I don't want to grow old (or die young for that matter) without seeing the ""beauty and strength of which my body is capable"".

# Starting
***
My initial stats were:

* Weight - 303 lbs (137.4 kg)
* Height - 5 ft 9 in (175.3 cm)
* BMI (calculated) - 44.7
* Waist - 48 in (121.9 cm)

*Yikes*

Whenever I start something, I research it. This was no different. I decided I wanted to try **keto** first. I dove in.

My initial macros starting out on the diet were severe, but it returned results. I understood at the end of the day it all comes down to CICO (calories in-calories out). The macros were:

* Fat - 70%
* Carb - 5%
* Protein - 25%

Basically, I tried to stay under 25g of carbs per day and said to hell with the calories. I **LIVED** on deli meats, bacon, butter, and veggies. The pounds shed like nobody's business. Everyday I was able to step on the scale and see a solid reduction in my weight. I was starting to feel good. 

At this point, I had very minimal exercise and, frankly, was scared to do it. I felt intimidated going into the gym, I read that running would be bad on my knees at this weight, and I still didn't quite have the energy or willpower to do so. So, I didn't. For the next three months, I relied solely on the diet to handle my weight loss and it went well! By the end of 2015 I was about 240 lbs (108.8 kg).

# Incorporating Exercise and Kind of Slacking
***
When I was much younger, I played ice hockey and around this time I decided I wanted to play again. So, I got some gear and started to skate daily. (Breaking in skates sucks)

I joined a hockey league where I was living for a semester out-of-state and tried to play hockey as much as I could. I loved it. Most weeks I was able to get to the rink about 3 times. The combination of the cardio from hockey and the diet, the weight was still coming off at a decent pace. 

It was all going fine and dandy until I wanted to try some new food. I was:

* In a new place
* Surrounded by new friends
* With a multitude of new restaurants to try

And just like that, I was off keto for a while. I still maintained around 215 lbs (97.5 kg), but the weight loss stopped. 

[Here I am at my internship next to Robonaut ~March 2015](http://imgur.com/YihiGCM.jpg)  (it was awesome!)

For a lot of 2016, I kind of just hovered around 215. Didn't do anything different, kept playing hockey, but no diet. 

[Here I am after hiking up to Blackrock Summit ~ August 2016. ](http://imgur.com/TxlIXJv.jpg) Finally got rid of that damn beard.

# Getting Serious (Attempt #1)
***
I got back on keto.

15 lbs (6.8 kg) gone. 

Met a girl.

Stopped keto.

Maintained at 200.

#Getting Serious (Attempt #2)
***
It's now March 2017. Stopped seeing the girl, and decided to really get things going. 

**I LOVE FRUIT** and keto was keeping me from having enough to my liking so I decided to try just strict CICO this time. My macros at the start of it were:

* Fat 55% 
* Carb 20%
* Protein 25%

Basically, I upped my carb intake and lowered my fat intake. I also decided to specify a specific calorie goal. I used the following tools to help me with it:

* [MyFitnessPal (MFP)](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)
* [TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)](https://tdeecalculator.net/) Calculator
* Food scale

I ate pretty much anything as long as I hit my macros and was below my allotted calories for the day. At this point, I think I was at about 2000 a day. 

I started to incorporate more running into my routine, doing the C25K program, and [ran in my first 5K!](http://imgur.com/jtfH2tD.jpg) 

# The Gym and My Current State
***
Since about January 2017, I have been half-assing in the gym with my friend, but I decided it was time to whole-ass it. 

So, I looked up some recommended routines on /r/Fitness, and decided that Strong Lifts 5x5 was a good start. I did that for about 3-4 weeks and I didn't really like it. So, I changed to the PPL (Pull/Push/Legs) [routine that was in the wiki of /r/Fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/). It is a 6 day a week routine, and I am loving it. Because I want ***dem gainz***, I reevaluated my macros to help with that. They are:

* Fat - 30%
* Carb - 30 %
* Protein - 40%

My current lifts (working sets, never tested 1 rep max (RM)) (was and still am super weak):

* Deadlift: 205 - 1 x 8
* Bench: 120 - 5 x 5
* OHP (oh god why are you so difficult): 85 - 5 x 5
* Squat: 175 - 3 x 5

I am also now eating between 1600-1800 calories per day and feeling better than ever! I have been using /r/1200isplenty  and /r/MealPrepSunday  to help me with meals and ideas. Combining the two together is the best thing ever. No need to worry about macros throughout the week and it is all healthy, nutritious, and fits my macros. 

As of right now, I am sitting at 185 and still got a little bit to go and I still got a bit of a gut that I'm sort of self-conscious about, but overall feeling much more secure and confident than I was when I began this journey. 

Current stats:

* Weight - 185 lbs (83.9 kg)
* Height - 5 ft 9 in (175.3 cm)
* BMI (calculated) - 27.3
* Waist - 32 in (81.3 cm)

# Takeaways
***
1. Get your diet sorted. I've found it is like 80-90% of the battle. 
2. No seriously, it's the part that will make all the difference.
3. If you want to incorporate exercise, find something you will enjoy (most of the time). I loved (and still love) playing hockey, and that was one of the best things to get me started. Lifting weights now is like an addiction because I always want to do better every time I step into the gym. Same with running, always trying to run for longer, faster, harder. Find something you like the idea of and keep doing it until you enjoy it. Then keep doing it. 
4. If you have a cheat day (I just did this past weekend), don't even worry about it. The fact that you ***know*** you went off the wagon means that your mindset has changed. Before, it would have just been another day of eating, but now it is abnormal -  and that's good. Get back on the horse, and keep going."

The Music of the Night


by Redwall



...Night time, sharpens heightens each sensation, 
Darkness turns, and wakes imagination...





THREE YEARS AGO


I looked deep into your eyes, and fell deeply in love, it was our first date. You looked great in your suit; it was deep blue like your eyes. I remember that you had invited me to go with you to see the Phantom of the Opera at the local dinner theater. You made me fall in love with it. It was during the song,




The Music of the Night


You leaned over and kissed me, on the cheek. It was a shock, but I loved each second of it. It immediately became our song. It was during the final moments though that you accidentally spilled your Cream Soda all over my favorite blue dress, and we laughed. I was 16 you were 17 and I thought you were all for me.


...No more talk of darkness, forget these wide-eyed fears,
I'm here with you beside you to hold you and to guide you...



TWO YEARS AGO



We broke up, it was more of a test of our love, we really did want to see if we were really made for each other. I remember that night well, I cried myself to sleep, I nearly phoned you three times, just to hear your voice. It was three months before we got back together, you never once dated another girl, I did date another guy named Frank Hardy, it didn't work out, after one date we knew we weren't right for each other. That was the night I called you, you were very kind to me, and it was what brought us back together.



...Think of me, think of me fondly when we say goodbye,
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind...



SIX MONTHS AGO



We broke up again, this time, I was sure it was for good. We had changed; I listened to my copy of The Canadian Cast of Phantom of the Opera CD and turned the lights off. It was almost as good as having you there. I cried, and began to sing with the CD, no one was home but me, Dad had a date and Hannah had the night off. There was a distinct chill in the air, the chill of the oncoming winter. A winter without someone to hold me that was one of the cruelest September I could remember.



...Wishing you were somehow here again,
Wishing you were somehow near,
Sometimes, it seemed, if I just dreamed
Some how you would be hear...



ONE MONTH AGO



I had heard of your success at college, getting a full scholarship. At the same time, I had just gotten an internship at the police station. We ran into each other in the line at McDonald's, I had gone for a quick Egg McMuffin before my first day on the job; you were leaving after getting a double double decaff coffee. I was wearing a white tee and blue jeans my uniform safely in my car awaiting my arrival at the station, you were wearing cut-offs and a dark brown tee, it was a distinct color of chocolate. You smiled in your kind warm, boyish way, and invited me out on Valentine's Day. I graciously accepted.



...Father once spoke of an Angel,
I used to dream he'd appear,
Now as I sing, I can sense him,
And I know he's near...



I remember that Valentine's day well I wore my pink blouse and dark blue jeans; you wore a green dress shirt with black pants. I had my hair pulled back and you took me to the fanciest restaurant in town, Chez Renold's for authentic pizza just like if we were in Italy. Then you took me to the beach to watch the sunset. I was not dressed appropriately; you ended up loaning me a sweater you had in your trunk. Then just as the sun was beginning to set, you kneeled down and proposed. We decided to have a long engagement until you were finished college in two years time...



...You alone can make my song take flight,
It's over now the music of the night!



PRESENT DAY



We thought that night we would be married soon, me Nancy, married to you Ned Nickerson. That was until today, the day began like any other, me humming here comes the bride after seeing the ring a fresh every morning. Putting on my uniform, getting ready for a hard day of hunting criminals. Right after breakfast, the call came, break-in at the local convenience store. I plugged into the car lighter my siren, and put it on the roof of my car. I got to the store, and saw the ambulance leave; it didn't have the siren's going that only meant one thing the person inside was dead. It was then as I got out of the car the police chief, Chief Robinson pulled me aside. He told me the news, how you heroically saved the life of the owner of the store, even at the cost of your own. It didn't make it any easier to call your parent's and tell them the news. Even writing this note, in which after finishing I'll stick my ring and it into an envelope, has been the hardest. I don't know if I'll ever fall in love again.



Sincerely,



Nancy Drew, 
Goodbye my love for the last time.

THIRTY YEARS LATER




A little girl playing in the basement, discovered an envelope it was labeled, To my love Ned Nickerson. The little girl ran to her grandmother and handed her the envelope. The grandmother yelled, ""Joe, come see what Patty-Jo Hardy has found.""


""Coming Nancy dear...""

After yesterday's shock, I think I'm over it emotionally.  I've been saving that ""6 month emergency fund"" for years and got a severance package, so I'm financially floating for a small while.  I haven't had a vacation in two years, so I'm kind of taking a break.  But a series of questions are still flooding my mind:

* How long should this break be?
* This is my first time being unemployed since graduating,  I don't know what to do aside from looking for my next job.  
* Should I just start applying to every job that's remarkably similarly to my last one? **or**
* Should I go to grad school?  Would it be worth it? **or**
*  Should I pivot my life and take up coding intensive/bootcamp? (took a couple classes in college, but nothing worth noting &amp; I retained very little)  
*  Would that help me be a better asset to prospective employers? **or**
*  Should I continue the corporate nuance of life?  In spite of the stability, the whole ""can do, be an owner, go above &amp; beyond"" attitude burned me out over the years, is it worth it to go back into that fold?  While being burnt out, my practical/risk averse side states that this last point isn't a factor.  


I'm throwing a lot out there.  I just want some outside opinion.

6mq9zr,1,2017-07-11,My [20 M] girlfriend [21 F] of 4 years is volunteering/interning abroad and has an end of the term dance. She wants to go with a boy.,throwinaway_111111,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mq9zr/my_20_m_girlfriend_21_f_of_4_years_is/,"So I should start this by saying that we started dating in high school and now we both go to different colleges about one hour away from each other. When we first started college I struggled with jealousy issues and that caused several fights and strain on our relationship. I am working hard to get over my jealousy issues. 

For the past 5 weeks my girlfriend has been volunteering/interning abroad and it ends in a week. She told me that at the end of the internship the group that puts together the program has an end of the term dinner and dance for everyone involved.

She says that everyone pairs up with someone from the program and goes as a date to this dance. And she asked me if she could go with a guy if she gets asked. I asked if she thinks she will be asked and she said she probably would be because she has hung out with the same group most of the time there and it's pretty evenly split between girls and guys. I think it is like 5 guys and 4 girls in her group. She says if she can't pair up with a guy she will feel left out and lonely during what is supposed to be the last real fun thing she does before leaving the next day. I told her I don't know what to think and to let me sleep on it.

I feel her going to a dinner and dance with a guy is too personal for someone in a committed relationship and thinking about it starts to make me jealous. But I want her to have fun during her time abroad and I don't want her to miss out on something because I am controlling her or telling her she can't do something. 

If she goes with a date I trust her to just be going as friends with the guy and to not cross any lines. But is going with a guy to this thing already crossing a line? I sort of think so, but I am trying to not be that jealous boyfriend. Should I just let her go?

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend wants to go with a guy to an end of volunteering abroad dance and dinner. Is this crossing a line? Should I tell her its okay with me that she goes?"

6mqtat,1,2017-07-11,"Has anyone here ever broken up with someone even though they did nothing wrong...? (23M/24F, 3 years)",looking4ayumi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6mqtat/has_anyone_here_ever_broken_up_with_someone_even/,"Hey Reddit. It's taken me 3 glasses of wine to be able to write this, so... you can get an idea of what a coward I am when it comes to being honest with my feelings.

I met my current girlfriend of over 3 years on a dating site. We were both only 19. There was no instant ""spark"" when we met, but I felt comfortable with her *immediately*. I'm pretty introverted, so to hit it off with someone like that right away is really rare. Since then, she has been my best friend and biggest confidante. My girlfriend is the only person I can truly be myself with. She has told me that she feels the same way.

Here's the rub: I've had doubts about our relationship ever since it began. The reason I haven't ended it is because there have been some intermittent periods with no doubts where I convinced myself that I was better off with her than without her.  In addition, I guess I always told myself that the doubts would go away someday, and that we would eventually reach that ""in love and totally committed"" state. 

Lately, the realization that I've always had one foot in and one foot out the door has become difficult to bear. For example, during the course of our relationship, I moved away from our city 3 times to do internships. I told myself it was for my career, but now I wonder if it had something to do with creating a ""space"" between us because I had a feeling we would break up one day. The cherry on top is that I am about to move away for another year so that I can do my master's degree in another city (albeit a city that is only 3 hours away). I could have gone to a school in our city, but I didn't. Right now, my girlfriend is talking about dropping all her future plans so that she can move with me wherever I go in after my master's, and I am overwhelmed with guilt. I feel if she does this, we will end up getting married and being together forever. Instead of feeling like I have finally found my partner, I feel like I am living some sort of lie.

I don't really understand **why** I have these doubts in the first place. She is incredibly intelligent and kind. She loves me for who I am. She wants the same things in life as I do. I admit that our sex life has never been spectacular; our chemistry is more ""amazing friends"" than it is ""lovers"". A lot of the time when we have sex (even early in our relationship), I feel like we are not totally comfortable being vulnerable with each other. Don't tell me that it's because I'm a ""man with needs"". My girlfriend has a higher sex drive than I do.

I am confused and I hate myself a bit. Why do I feel this way when my girlfriend is the best person I have ever met?! Why was I all-in with my ex, who was a terrible person, but I have trouble feeling passionate about this amazing woman in front of me? The funny thing is that my ex made me believe she was all-in, and then dumped me as soon as her ex-boyfriend came back into the picture. It took me over a year to recover. Now I feel like I am doing something similar to my my girlfriend who doesn't deserve this...

My doubts sound something like this: ""I can't imagine spending the rest of my life with her, but I know I easily could if I wanted to. I can't imagine never falling in love or making love with someone else. My girlfriend deserves someone who is as committed to her as she has always been to me.""

Another cherry on top is that over the course of our relationship, I've felt strong sexual and even romantic attractions for other people, but didn't pursue them because I told myself I was committed to my girlfriend. The knowledge that I even had these thoughts just adds to my guilt. To be clear, **I never have and never will** cheat, but this is the first time I have ever felt that temptation lurking in the back of my mind.

Reddit, have any of you ever felt this way? Did you regret ending it? Am I being a total idiot and coward? How can you have doubts about someone who should be perfect for you, and who loves you completely?

Oh, and I should say, I have brought up my doubts with her a few times. I told her that it was a symptom of my anxiety issues and not her fault, and she was understanding. She didn't seem very worried. However, the last time I brought it up, she looked at me and asked ""Well, do you still want to be with me?"" I said ""Yes, definitely"", and I hate myself for lying... but I don't have the words to explain how I feel to her and I feel she deserves an explanation that makes sense.

I've even timidly brought up my dissatisfaction with our sex life. When I do this, a predictable pattern emerges: we both try harder at sex for a few weeks, to so-so results. I suggest we try something new (e.g. toys), but she's not comfortable with it, so I don't ask again. I feel depressed about our relationship after we have sex, because I don't understand why I don't feel more passionate towards her. She is truly an amazing woman. A few weeks ago, I brought it up more firmly than ever, but it made us even more awkward in the bedroom.

Honestly, if I could have it my way, I'd want an open relationship so that I have some breathing room to figure out how I feel. But that makes me feel like a scumbag. Anyways, my girlfriend has said many times that she would never consent to that, even if it was with me.

TL;DR: My girlfriend is the best person I have ever known, yet I have always struggled with doubts about our relationship. I can truly be myself with her, but our sex life has always been lackluster. I am about to move away for a year, and she wants to move in with me after the year is up. I am panicking. I can't imagine never having sex or falling in love with another girl again, but I feel like once we move in together, we'll never break up. How can I feel this way about someone who has done NOTHING wrong, and who loves me for who I am?"
6mrdbu,1,2017-07-11,Husband has excuses,MazelTough,ITCareer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareer/comments/6mrdbu/husband_has_excuses/,"At risk of sounding like /r/relationships, I am feeling really mad tonight and looking for some objective truth.

My husband (33/m) and I met working in the adventure/tourism industry. I have since become a teacher and am finishing up a very rigorous 14-month masters program. He worked for two different game companies in customer support but quit the second one and was laid off the first. Since then I convinced him to use his GI bill and go back to school. After one semester of utterly fucked records from his community college resolved through the president, he got his AA in IT. At the time I asked regularly about his certification exams and he kept saying he wasn't ready, wanted to do more test out, etc. I haven't seen him working since the first summer we were working. A year ago I had a small windfall from teaching and offered to pay for exams. He said no.

He got into a very high-ranking ranking public university in January but due to a poor orientation experience and messed up cc paperwork he didn't complete that transfer. Now he's in his first semester at a less-prestigious public school and really seems to hate his two general classes.

He has only had one it job offer which was for an internship in cc but due to pot use he was passed over. He didn't follow up on medical drop paperwork at cc which meant his first Basic Allowance for Housing payment went straight back to the VA. 

At this point it's been 8 months since he's brought in his GI stipend. He balked at me tonight asking him about taking his network plus and A+ courses, stating it's been a year since he's had computer classes and that he has two more years so doesn't want his carts now.

I get that but need to see some inkling that he will one day be eligible for work. I have looked at the a+ prep and think I could pass it. He has not had luck finding jobs and poooh-poohs my style of ground-pounding and making real in-person connections.

Is he just making excuses? Should he be looking for work while in school to employ his skills learned in CC?

We are looking to close on a home on the 21st but I am worried he won't really be contributing to the house for months and months. I don't know what to do or say at this point other than to start making ultimatums. I don't care if he fails the it courses, I just need him to get out and do them for a first time. 

Thanks

Hello Triangle folks.  I graduated with a Bachelors in CS in May, and I am interested in relocating to the Triangle.  It looks like a great location.  I currently live in rural Kentucky and would love to move to a bigger city with a strong tech pedigree.

I am looking for an Entry Level Software Developer/Engineer position.  I would like the chance to learn some good development fundamentals with some seniors and mentors who know what they're doing!  An established company in the private sector with experience training new grads would be ideal.  I did alright in school but I am not a superstar, ninja, 10x, etc.  I have had one summer job as a desktop developer where I learned a lot, and I have a previous career in business that you might value with soft skills (communication, management, planning, etc.).

I am stack-agnostic.  Object oriented and relational database programming would be ideal.  Most of my experience is in desktop Java but I would be willing to learn other stacks.  C#/.NET is interesting even though I have very little experience with it.  I only have minor experience with mobile (one semester of Android) and web dev (minor HTML/CSS/JavaScript) but those environments are attractive enough that I would be happy working in them with proper training.

I would like an Agile environment that follows best practices (good documentation, test driven development, code reviews, version control, etc.).  I would appreciate some occasional pair programming and mentorship but it doesn't have to be 100%; solo time is important too.

I am very interested in:  
Backend Application development  
Full Stack development  
Engineering/Planning/Architecture (unlikely as a new grad, but it's an interesting path)  

I could possibly be interested in:  
Dev-ops  
Project Management  
Database Admin/SQL Developer  
Data Science  

I am not very interested in:  
Front-end/design positions (some front-end with full stack is fine)  
QA/Testing only positions (testing tasks as a developer such as TDD is fine)  
Anything involving intense graphics (3D modeling, etc.)  
Most IT jobs  

I am looking for a direct hire, full time position.  I'm not greedy about compensation but I am looking for an actual developer salary (no training wages, internships, etc.).  Thanks for your time.

I'm a 24 y.o male, and I've been in a long-distance relationship, for the previous 3 years. I live in a country and my s.o live in an other one. We are not yet married and are planning it next year. This summer my s.o came to my country for an internship, so we had the chance to meet. The thing is, in my culture a girl can not have sex until she is married, so she was against it. However each time I visited her I brought it up, and wenever she hesitated or refused I was sad and partly angry, so she finally accepted it but wasn't comfortable. The last time we met she was depressed and sexually unresponsive. She didn't want me to touch her, and barely kissed me. She didn't understand what's going on with her, neither did I. Recently she told that she no more likes sex because she was't comfortable about it since the beginning and wanted to postpone it until the marriage and that she did it just to make me happy. It now makes sense to me that she is experiencing psychological reactance because she was doing something against her will, but I feel that our relationship is already falling apart. She is deeply depressed because of what she did and regrets it, and I don't know what to do about it. Any advice on what I can do to correct the situation?"
6mt3rn,0,2017-07-12,Some financial college advice (from exp),dmart030,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6mt3rn/some_financial_college_advice_from_exp/,"Ive been lurking here for awhile now and thought id give back to this subreddit since it has given me such great advice. This is my first real post and I thought it would be in how to help college students out with surviving in the U.S ( where you're basically bảntha  fodder.) If you aren't a student, some of this may may still help you (like the groceries portion) 

Somethings you have to know and maybe other commenters can expand on this if they like to.

1) groceries: you can get fresh and cheap veggies from the farmers market. And meat from say a rotisserie chicken from Walmart. This will save you tons in the long run and help your health. Plus you save more cooking for yourself than eating out. Win- win. 

Back in high school I would periodically starve due to family conditions,  however I was able to have a family member give me 20$ a week to help with food. From there I discovered places like Albertsons which offered poor boy sandwiches and a few bananas for less than 2$ . (I would only eat a single meal a day and that'd be it...)  I managed to portion what I spent and was actually able yo eventually eat twice a day which was great. In a few months I gained 30 lbs and was in a healthy weight thanks to my the food I was buying without going broke. 

A side note is for college students, you qualify for Medicaid unless your family earns enough and files you under their taxes.. if you do qualify for state insurance, you also qualify for the monthly/weekly food offerings at the community centers. This can help you immensely with the food problem. I don't know much about this since I found out about it after I graduated... go figure.  Ask your insurance representative about it. 

2) always watch your money, spend 5$ now means you have less for later so you gotta pay attention. Set a limit you can spend per week/month. And keep it, there's no going over under any circumstances.. ( it's more of a personal thing, you can of course go over, but try not to.)

3) loans are predatory (even if you're confident you can pay them back in the future, try to avoid them as much as possible). Your first goal is to find internships of which there are many.. (especially in the stem field where there are hundreds [check out research experience internships which provide housing and a great pay for a few months] **ask your professors**)).  I know situations are different for each individual, but never take loans out if you can survive without it.

4) housing: that's a tough one. Most people want to have that college experience and dorm their first year, of which I highly recommend never doing that if you want to live in your means. Consider where you live now if you can help it and calculate the gas needed to drive from your home to school per week. For me it was 200$ less a month, to drive 120 miles a day than to rent a room near my uni.  I had to give 2 hours total each day though to drive back and forth, but I saved enough to pay for my masters thanks to it. (I replaced my own oil and maintained the car as well)

5) electronics: this is a tough one. I did my b.s in physics so I didn't actually need a computer... taking classes such as intro to c++ was entirely possible on a mobile phone thanks to websites like i9.co... if you're  under a huge budget, ủi can always strike deals with your professor who normally have a laptop to loan during the school year. 

6) know the faculty.  My faculty at my uni, had spare books to lend me since they were the graduate TA copies for classes they taught.  This saved me several hundred in expenses ( you can also download pdfs of the books too if that's possible :) )

7) don't be afraid to dress in pj's, it's college. No one cares, you're not looking for a job yet. (If you are, you know to dress better). So what I mean is this, you don't need to dress to impress anybody, you van save that bit of money for later or for paying back your loans after you graduate. DO NOT DRESS IN PJ'S IF YOU'RE RESEARCHING/doing research. That's a professional environment and should remain so. 

There you go, I hope this actually helped incoming students and best of luck to your studies!!! Basically this is how I was able to graduate from a uni without any loans and any outside help (I paid for the uni myself thanks to the internships...thank god)"

If you aren't local (as far north as Newcastle and south as Canberra) then please don't message, I have had long distance in the past and every time has ended badly. I cant stand that pain of not being able to hug and hold the person I love every day.

I am doing this internship at a chemical computer mainly because I am good with computers and can use computation to help the company.

Everyone else? Not so much. So one day I am tasked with simply taking a spreadsheet full of 22,000 compounds and finding the CAS number for each of them. 

The problem? The compound names look like this:

Do you guys know of an advanced online search tool that can identify the CAS number based on the name of a compound?"

So my gf(21) of 2.5 years just broke up with me last week. It was all sudden bc we would constantly talk about marriage and our future. I had even asked her mothers permission for marriage. She told me that she still loved me but that things did not seem the same anymore and that she needed time to find herself and be sure of what she wanted bc she was also scared of the future. 

To give more context, I took an internship since Jan and we have been long distance. She wold tell me that the long distance sucked and was putting a strain in our relationship but I thought we could get through it and it would all be fine when we were back together. 

As much as it hurts I am willing to give her space and time. I feel like looking back I got lost in the relationship and was not as attentive as I should had been. Not going to lie, long distance was tough but I grew too comfortable with her that I did not continue to be spontaneous and interesting. 
She told me maybe things could change in 6 weeks when we are back together in our college town. However, I am worried bc if there is a chance it could fail due that she might go do student teaching at another town and then graduate. 

We have a puppy together and bc he went to the vet yesterday I ended up texting her and we texted for a long time. I tried to keep it about just the puppy but she also wanted to know how my day was and what I was doing this weekend. I then was dumb and told her that I was willing to make compromises to fix our relationship and she replied that she was comfortable with the situation but appreciated my effort. 

How long do you guys recommend before I try to contact her again? We have a puppy so ima have to talk to her when we get to school. I just dont want her to move to another town bc she all her friends were mainly mine and now she will be lonely.

Sorry for the long rant. This helped me and if you have any advice I appreciate it."

As a child, I liked to draw, and I hung out with another girl who liked to draw.  She was in the right place at the right time, and now is a professional artist.

As I got older, I got into making my own costumes.  My niece saw what I did, and wanted to do similar.  She convinced her mother, (my sister), to help, and now both are accomplished cosplayers.

But, yesterday I got the news of my greatest influence of this nature.

I grew up in the 70s and 80s, space was a dream for me.  My grandfather supposedly, (my source is not dependable), worked with a group of people who ended up starting NASA.  The moon landings, the ISS, the shuttle, all a dream out of reach, because, while smart, I'm just not that smart.

But my son is.

I have encouraged his education all his life.  I may have been handicapping him, as I encouraged him to focus on school, instead of getting work experience with summer jobs or whatever.  I have told him that I don't care what kind of debt I have to take on, that I want him to achieve what he wants to achieve.

Now, he's working on his Masters in Aerospace, focusing on Satellite propulsion, and after a cold call interview on Monday, (they called him), yesterday he got the news that he got an internship this fall, (his first job), with NASA Johnson Space Center.

I know that this is **his** accomplishment, but this mom is about to burst with pride.

Thanks for letting me share.

6mulvk,4,2017-07-12,Actually connecting to someone,RaimundoSilva,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6mulvk/actually_connecting_to_someone/,"So yesterday I experienced something I had forgotten for a long, long time. 

A little background for the story, I am doing an erasmus internship in Portugal and two weeks ago I got a new roommate. She's very open and honest person, very talkative and always smiling, so obviously I liked her almost instantly. After we met up with some people and it was basicly only us talking the whole night I decided to ask her to go for a drink with me the next day. She accepted.

So we were drinking vodka on my balcony looking at the moon. And maybe it's porn or maybe it's the stupid hookup-culture nowadays but I just thought it was only about kissing and not connecting to her. So I tried and she refused, after that I decided I was being stupid and I lay it to rest. I was ashamed that a long time of doing nothing with girls, porn and the hookup-culture had impacted my view on the whole dating matter by that much.
I quickly diverted the conversation and just took my distance. I decided to just let it be and continue our conversation. We ended up talking from 9PM to 5AM about our lives, relationships, culture, religion and a whole bunch of other subjects. At the end I gave her a big hug and thanked her for the wonderful night. It was a really amazing experience and I am very happy that somebody helped me straighten my view on people and helped me open up and share my beliefs and views on the world with someone. 
I really hope I can remember what this felt like and implement this into my normal behaviour, to see which people I can open up to and have better deeper conversations with them. Also not trying to kiss a girl at random but just connect which makes the whole thing so much better.

And as an unsuspected twist. As we were talking this morning it was really nice and I like I am able to open up a lot more towards her. As she was leaving for work I tried to give her a hug and made a joke about trying to survive the day (because we had three hours of sleep). But as I leaned in she just kissed me on the lips and then bolted out of the house. Obviously I couldn't understand but it was really sweet and nice. I wish to work on my abilities to connect to people and know their character and lower my own barriers I have built up over the years to everyone around me. It will be a long road, but by finding the right people and together with noFAP i'm sure I will come a long way.

Thanks for reading and have an awesome day!"
6mv60o,2,2017-07-12,[Need Advice] Problematic E92 (328xi),ABitterPanacea,BMW,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/6mv60o/need_advice_problematic_e92_328xi/,"Hey Guys, I was hopeful by someone could give me some help navigating my situation.

I bought my E92 CPOed at 33k miles from a certified bmw dealership at August of 2016.

I loved the car, it is my first BMW and I couldn't stop driving it.

One month after owning it I had a problem with the engine mis-firing. The replaced the spark plugs, checked the ECU, etc and was told in confidence that it should be gone.

Throughout the year however I would have the same problem and the dealership would keep on switching Spark plugs, sort of like a bandaid quick fix.

Now this is where I messed up, NY states lemon laws in regard to CPOed vehicles is working 5k miles of a cpoed car sitting at the 30k-40k mileage range at time of purchase. I have it at 50k right now.

I drive a lot for work, and in general, and I figured the misfiring is going to be a non-issue.

It's July of 2017, and my car has been at the shop for around 30+ cumulative days. My Vaccum break pump failed on me mid-drive almost causing a collision, I have been having oil consumption issues where I would need a liter &gt;500 miles, and my car is in the shop again probably caused by fried piston rings (would explain oil consumption issue and loss of power)

I contacted BMW following the vaccum break pump failure and followed through with their internal arbitration department/customer service. I told them my frustrations I've had with the car, constantly having to bring it back and forth, and especially feeling scared of the vaccum break pump failing. I'm not the only one who drives my car and if my family or anyone else were to drive my car and something like that happened they chance of a crash is that much higher.

After reviewing my case (and getting my car appraised for 3k less than the car fax trade in value) for 3-4 weeks, they offered me a one year warranty on top of my 3 year extended warranty.

I can't help but feel helpless, because this has been an ongoing problematic car that has things failing left and right and it's come the point where I just expect things to break in my car. I don't know maybe this is a usual thing for older BMW models to experience but from what I gathered the N51 is a relatively bulletproof and problem free car.

I asked BMW NA if there was any other option of putting me into a car of equal value of my current car and they said they would try but they would expect me to put money down.

I'm kind of at a wall right now and I need my car to commute to work and my internship but honestly I would appreciate anyone with advice."

***
To set the stage, a little less than 2 years ago (October 2015), I was:

* Very unhappy with the way I looked
* My girlfriend at the time broke up with me
* I was always lethargic and had no energy
* Depressed and just overall in a bad place

[Here is one of the worst pictures of me I could find.](http://i.imgur.com/MzDS66O.jpg) At the time, I intentionally made a dumb face so please excuse that.

In one of my multitude of attempts to receive incentive, I must have been perusing either this sub or another one like /r/keto and I saw someone quote Socrates:
&gt; No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.

And something just *clicked*. 

I *knew* I had to do something about my weight and health because I don't want to grow old (or die young for that matter) without seeing the ""beauty and strength of which my body is capable"".

# Starting
***
My initial stats were:

* Weight - 303 lbs (137.4 kg)
* Height - 5 ft 9 in (175.3 cm)
* BMI (calculated) - 44.7
* Waist - 48 in (121.9 cm)

*Yikes*

Whenever I start something, I research it. This was no different. I decided I wanted to try **keto** first. I dove in.

My initial macros starting out on the diet were severe, but it returned results. I understood at the end of the day it all comes down to CICO (calories in-calories out). The macros were:

* Fat - 70%
* Carb - 5%
* Protein - 25%

Basically, I tried to stay under 25g of carbs per day and said to hell with the calories. I **LIVED** on deli meats, bacon, butter, and veggies. The pounds shed like nobody's business. Everyday I was able to step on the scale and see a solid reduction in my weight. I was starting to feel good. 

At this point, I had very minimal exercise and, frankly, was scared to do it. I felt intimidated going into the gym, I read that running would be bad on my knees at this weight, and I still didn't quite have the energy or willpower to do so. So, I didn't. For the next three months, I relied solely on the diet to handle my weight loss and it went well! By the end of 2015 I was about 240 lbs (108.8 kg).

# Incorporating Exercise and Kind of Slacking
***
When I was much younger, I played ice hockey and around this time I decided I wanted to play again. So, I got some gear and started to skate daily. (Breaking in skates sucks)

I joined a hockey league where I was living for a semester out-of-state and tried to play hockey as much as I could. I loved it. Most weeks I was able to get to the rink about 3 times. The combination of the cardio from hockey and the diet, the weight was still coming off at a decent pace. 

It was all going fine and dandy until I wanted to try some new food. I was:

* In a new place
* Surrounded by new friends
* With a multitude of new restaurants to try

And just like that, I was off keto for a while. I still maintained around 215 lbs (97.5 kg), but the weight loss stopped. 

[Here I am at my internship next to Robonaut ~March 2015](http://imgur.com/YihiGCM.jpg)  (it was awesome!)

For a lot of 2016, I kind of just hovered around 215. Didn't do anything different, kept playing hockey, but no diet. 

[Here I am after hiking up to Blackrock Summit ~ August 2016. ](http://imgur.com/TxlIXJv.jpg) Finally got rid of that damn beard.

# Getting Serious (Attempt #1)
***
I got back on keto.

15 lbs (6.8 kg) gone. 

Met a girl.

Stopped keto.

Maintained at 200.

#Getting Serious (Attempt #2)
***
It's now March 2017. Stopped seeing the girl, and decided to really get things going. 

**I LOVE FRUIT** and keto was keeping me from having enough to my liking so I decided to try just strict CICO this time. My macros at the start of it were:

* Fat 55% 
* Carb 20%
* Protein 25%

Basically, I upped my carb intake and lowered my fat intake. I also decided to specify a specific calorie goal. I used the following tools to help me with it:

* [MyFitnessPal (MFP)](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)
* [TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)](https://tdeecalculator.net/) Calculator
* Food scale

I ate pretty much anything as long as I hit my macros and was below my allotted calories for the day. At this point, I think I was at about 2000 a day. 

I started to incorporate more running into my routine, doing the C25K program, and [ran in my first 5K!](http://imgur.com/jtfH2tD.jpg) 

# The Gym and My Current State
***
Since about January 2017, I have been half-assing in the gym with my friend, but I decided it was time to whole-ass it. 

So, I looked up some recommended routines on /r/Fitness, and decided that Strong Lifts 5x5 was a good start. I did that for about 3-4 weeks and I didn't really like it. So, I changed to the PPL (Pull/Push/Legs) [routine that was in the wiki of /r/Fitness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/). It is a 6 day a week routine, and I am loving it. Because I want ***dem gainz***, I reevaluated my macros to help with that. They are:

* Fat - 30%
* Carb - 30 %
* Protein - 40%

My current lifts (working sets, never tested 1 rep max (RM)) (was and still am super weak):

* Deadlift: 205 - 1 x 8
* Bench: 120 - 5 x 5
* OHP (oh god why are you so difficult): 85 - 5 x 5
* Squat: 175 - 3 x 5

I am also now eating between 1600-1800 calories per day and feeling better than ever! I have been using /r/1200isplenty  and /r/MealPrepSunday  to help me with meals and ideas. Combining the two together is the best thing ever. No need to worry about macros throughout the week and it is all healthy, nutritious, and fits my macros. 

As of right now, I am sitting at 185 and still got a little bit to go and I still got a bit of a gut that I'm sort of self-conscious about, but overall feeling much more secure and confident than I was when I began this journey. 

Current stats:

* Weight - 185 lbs (83.9 kg)
* Height - 5 ft 9 in (175.3 cm)
* BMI (calculated) - 27.3
* Waist - 32 in (81.3 cm)

# Takeaways
***
1. Get your diet sorted. I've found it is like 80-90% of the battle. 
2. No seriously, it's the part that will make all the difference.
3. If you want to incorporate exercise, find something you will enjoy (most of the time). I loved (and still love) playing hockey, and that was one of the best things to get me started. Lifting weights now is like an addiction because I always want to do better every time I step into the gym. Same with running, always trying to run for longer, faster, harder. Find something you like the idea of and keep doing it until you enjoy it. Then keep doing it. 
4. If you have a cheat day (I just did this past weekend), don't even worry about it. The fact that you ***know*** you went off the wagon means that your mindset has changed. Before, it would have just been another day of eating, but now it is abnormal -  and that's good. Get back on the horse, and keep going."
6mw2cj,1,2017-07-12,(CAN) Having trouble securing good finance rates despite great/excellent credit rating,Xdsin,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6mw2cj/can_having_trouble_securing_good_finance_rates/,"This is just as much as rant as it is seeking advice.  Scroll down to TL:DR if you don't want the details.

I am a 32 single guy (has a GF but not married), live on my own, in Burnaby, Canada.

My family was poor growing up to the point where when I told my Dad I wanted to go to university to pursue a undergraduate degree in Computer Science, he literally started crying because they had no way to support me and he told me that I would have to fund it myself. I was the first person in my family to achieve an undergraduate degree.

I went to school full time, took out a $10, 000 student line of credit at 6.5% financing that my grandparents co-signed for (interest rates were high at the time, this was before the crash in 2008) and started my university stint.

Part way through University I went into Cooperative education (think paid internship for course credit) which gave me enough experience and made an impression on my employer that I achieved the means of finding good full time employment while attending school. My school has full and part time flexibility. I was able to work at a $50k year job and attend school in the evenings part time at this point.

It took me 9.5 years to get my Bachelors degree. However, I was living on my own, graduated with over 5 years experience in my field and with less than 12k of debt (I acquired a 1500 limit Visa during my studies).

While I was at school, since both my Visa and Credit Line where classified as ""student"" credit, I was only obligated to pay the interest rates until I graduated and doing so did not effect my rating or impacted my rates. My visa was switched over to a normal one and pay-back plan was setup on the line of credit 6 months after I graduated.

That was over 3 years ago. Last year, I needed a new car badly. I had a Jeep YJ that was mainly a hobby vehicle that I worked on and a commuter 1995 Honda Civic that was on its last legs. Called my bank and they said that since my credit history was young, they could give me a line of credit for 50k at 10.1%. Through desperation I took the rate and bought a 2007 Honda Accord for $5000 and paid off the balance on my line of credit within a year.

In the last six years, I have never been behind on any bills or credit that I have on my accounts. I normally pay my credit card off each month or transfer the balance from my CC to my credit line (19% vs 10.1%) if I couldn't manage to pay it off in full.

Right now, I am sitting with zero balance on all my accounts with exception to my student line of credit which is under 5k now where I made monthly fixed payments on. I have been at my new job for nearly 3 years and make roughly $65 000 salary plus bonuses. I moved closer to work to save commuting time and money. My rent (I don't own) is $1037 per month plus bills which is exceptional in my area (average is about $1400)

I usually put away $500-700 easily into savings without making any changes to lifestyle.

I recently thought about consolidating my Vehicles by selling my Accord and YJ and buying a new or used (2012+) vehicle that fits my lifestyle and future life goals with my girlfriend. I wanted a vehicle that could last me 6 or so years at least and have enough capacity to support a possible family and still allow me to get away on the weekends.

I spent months researching how to prepare to get good finance rates, did my homework with strategies on dealer tactics. Before setting foot on a dealership lot, I wanted to come with a financing offer from my bank. I subscribed to the two big credit reporters in Canada (equifax and transunion). I am sitting at 855 with Equifax and 803 with Transunion so I would have ammo to negotiate.

I contacted my bank. They offered a reduction to my 50k credit line from 10.1% to 7.45% with interest only payment option. They said that my credit was excellent and that this was a great deal (maybe for a credit line but the dealer was quoting me 5.5% even before I set foot on the lot and allowed them to check my credit). I asked about an auto loan and the man said that the best that could probably do given my credit history was 6.69% but they would have to know the exact vehicle I was looking to buy (which neuters my ability to negotiate rates with the dealer). I expressed my displeasure and mentioned the quoted rate from the dealer and he said that if I owned my home, I could use my equity to get better rates (usually prime plus 1%, prime is 2.7% right now). He also said that the dealer can use a vehicle as a lean and therefore offer a lower rate.

Vancouver has the worst housing market. Condos here are going for 500k+ for single bedroom dwellings built in 1985. Houses are easily over 2 Million for run down shacks that require renovations.

When I talk to colleagues and friends. They all seem to be able to get good rates despite being in student, credit debt. Some of them leverage multiple finance payments with vehicles, homes, toys, CCs, etc. Does Pandora's box literally open when you own a home? Hell many don't even own a home.

I feel like I am being dicked around here and wondering if there is anything I can do to get better rates? Am I crazy to think I could get a rate that is less than 5%? 

TL:DR - I feel like I have been the poster child when it comes to handling my personal finances yet I am getting, what I think, is terrible finance rates despite great/excellent credit ratings with less than 5k+ debt to my name and the ability to put away $700 a month into savings. Am I doing something wrong?"
6mwidd,593,2017-07-12,The Ti[M]e I Gave A Blowjob Lesson To My Lesbian [F]riend [oral],milligan69,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6mwidd/the_time_i_gave_a_blowjob_lesson_to_my_lesbian/,"Lindsey and I had been friends for about six years. We went to the same school but met at an internship. While I always thought Lindsey was cute, she made it abundantly clear that she was into women. Standing 5'2"", she was fit but had an ample butt that wiggled as she walked and her beautiful breasts seemed to constantly test the strength of the buttons on her tops. Lindsey had a little extra on her bones but it was a healthy weight. If anything, she was a gym rat. She had dark brown hair that she always kept in a ponytail or a bun but on the occasions that she let her hair down, they would cascade over her cleavage, teasing me whenever I tried to sneak a peek. Lindsey had a perky disposition and was always happy to see me. We quickly became friends and she was happy to include me into her friend circle, which included her girlfriend Cassie. We hung out and I was always comfortable around them but besides our friendly chemistry, nothing came of it. 

About a year ago, Lindsey found out that Cassie had been cheating on her while at grad school. Devastated, Lindsey confided in me. I was always willing to lend an ear and it was then that Lindsey revealed something to me: Cassie was the only person she'd slept with. 

I was a little stunned. They had been together for about four years but I figured Lindsey had hooked up with other girls (or guys) before she that or before she came out. But after the breakup, Lindsey decided to change all that. She was going to go through a summer of sluttiness. Her first act? She was going to try going on a date with Colin, a guy she made out with before her relationship. In fact, he was the ONLY guy she had made out with. But after the date, when things got hot and heavy, Colin wanted a blowjob. 

The problem? Lindsey had never given head before. 

Their date ended with a bang as Lindsey decided to have sex with Colin but she complained that it was unsatisfying. Rather than giving a mediocre blowjob, Lindsey lost her (penetration) virginity. She went home that night, confused, and more lost than ever. We texted throughout the week and she went into explicit detail about what she wanted to experience that summer. It was hot, to say the least, but I didn't want to endanger our relationship. 

The following weekend, Lindsey went to a wedding and I went to a friend's barbecue. While the barbecue offered a lot of tantalizing prospects (a story for another time), my mind was set on the details Lindsey sent me. As luck would have it, my phone buzzed that evening. It was Lindsey. 

Lindsey: Hey, how's the barbecue? 
Me: Good good. Lots of girls lol. Maybe you should come here? Haha. How's the wedding?
Lindsey: Lol. Well, I'm drunk now and kind of... Thinking about something. 
Me: What's that?
Lindsey: Well... I want to practice giving head. But I don't really trust a lot of guys. Would you... Be okay if I tried it out on you? 

I swear on all that is horny that every detail of this story is true. 

I hesitated. Our friendship. Years of trust. All that we've been through. 

Eh fuck it. Blowjob! 

I said yes and we arranged for a time to meet the next week. We continued to text and I made sure that she still wanted to go through with the plan while she was sober. She did. It was on. 

On the night we agreed on, I made my way to Lindsey's place. She answered the door in a typically tight top and a revealing skirt. She made dinner (ironically, sausage), we made some small talk, and waited for her roommates to leave. When we were alone, we made our way to her bedroom. We set up a couple of rules: it would only be a blowjob, it was purely for ""academic"" reasons, and our friendship would not be ruined over it. I agreed to her terms and conditions. It was time to inspect the goods. 

Lindsey peeled off her top as we started to make it. She wasn't someone I sought for years or anything but it was enjoyable to finally break that seal. After enjoying some tongue gymnastics, I took off her bra and took her nipples in my mouth, alternating as she moaned in my arms. Remembering that she was still inexperienced, I guided her hands to my groin. She gasped as my cock grew to the touch of her fingers. I was about to pop out of my jeans. 

As I fondled her breasts, she practically tore off my pants. My cock sprang to attention, a full five and a half inches. 

Hey, I said all of this was true. 

Lindsey bit her lower lip in anticipation as she rubbed only the second cock she'd ever seen in her life. I laid down on her bed as I instructed her to move herself lower. Instinctively, she started to lick the tip of my cock. Lindsey had eaten pussy for four years. She had some skills. 

I told her to use her hands to handle my shaft as she continued to lick the head of my dick. She obliged, a willing and talented student. When she was ready, I told her to take the whole thing into her mouth. In between licks, she nodded, took a deep breath, and went for it. 

Oh. My. God. Her soft, wet mouth, and her talented tongue was causing me to moan and grow in her mouth. I was stunned. 

""How 'm ay goo-ing?"" She managed to speak with my cock in her mouth. All I could do was nod. 

I decided I wanted to reciprocate. ""Lindsey, have you ever wanted to try 69-ing?"" 

Lindsey looked up at me and smiled. I grabbed her legs and pulled her pussy toward my mouth. She gasped.  I hiked her skirt up and rubbed her clit through her panties. It was soaked through. I had a little taste of her before I peeled them off. It was delicious. After I took off her panties, her freshly shaved, wet pussy was ripe and waiting for me. With her blessing, I started playing with it. I didn't think I could be in anymore ecstasy. But once I got a taste of her sex, I dove in as hungrily as she devoured my cock. It was incredible. She moaned and writhed as I continued to lick and play with her pussy. She even came up for air to tell me that I was great at eating her out. 

Coming from a lesbian, that was the greatest sex compliment I've ever received. 

After a few minutes of continued instruction, it was time for her to experience her first cumshot. I told her I was close to coming and gave her the choice of where she wanted me to finish. While I wish I could say she was a naturally filthy cumslut and I came on her pretty mascara-run face, Lindsey wanted me to finish in her mouth so she could find out what cum tasted like. I was happy to oblige. 

I stood up and had her drop to her knees. I told her to open her mouth, look up at me, and stick out her tongue. She obliged and I shot a web of sticky ropes into her mouth, which elicited a smile from her. She took them on her tongue, and swallowed like a champ. Not bad for a first timer. 

Lindsey thanked me for the instruction and we remain friends. She dated a couple more guys, giving what she described as ""great head"" in the process, but ultimately realized she preferred girls and has been exclusively seeing women ever since. We never repeated what happened that night but whenever we do see each other, I do wonder if she ever relives it in her mind..."

Currently pursuing M Sc. in IT at HEC Montréal.  I was looking for some relevant articles regarding growth challenges in IT.
I am currently in an internship with a company that's close to attaining the Billion dollars revenue cap.

Any help is very welcome.  My research so far has yielded few relevant results in Gartner and IEEE databases.  I know there are tons of articles regarding this subject.

Could you hook me up with either some sources, articles, keywords...

6mxtel,5,2017-07-12,INTJ Engineers: I'm an INTJ EE Student seeking advise on how to develop Engineering forethought(?),EnvyMyPancakes,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/6mxtel/intj_engineers_im_an_intj_ee_student_seeking/,"Hi all,  
    
I'm a 20 year old INTJ majoring in Electrical Engineering (Haven't started major specific classes yet), interning at a major Computer/Server company this summer.     
    
**Overview/Background:**    
I've been given a project to program the firmware of a microchip located on a board that another Employee is developing. Simply put, this microchip will accept commands from another microcontroller via SPI and control other components on the board depending on the command.     
     
I started this summer having never programmed in SPI, no knowledge of anything regarding embedded systems, microprocessor architecture/operation, and with only 1 college course worth of experience in C/C++.    
     
**Now:**    
After ~5 weeks, I've gradually gained proficiency in these topics, even though the first weeks were like drinking from a fire hose. My issue is that I don't have any real ability to have a sortof foresight or forethought in regards to what will be the next step in developing my code. 
     
My mentor tells me to do x, I do it and let him know I'm done. Then he tells me to do y, I do it and let him know I'm done, and so on.
     
After doing a couple things:      
- Get SPI talking b/w a LabVIEW code I also created and the microchip     
- Allow pin outputs to be changed through SPI     
- Allow data to be written to Flash Memory     
- etc...     
    my mentor said I should try to look ahead and think of what will be needed down the line without his input.     
     
My argument would be I don't know everything the final project needs, so how should I be able to know what I need to do next.     
     
I'd like to say I'm pretty smart when it comes to seeing an issue and coming up with a solution in my  everyday life so far, but I'm having trouble applying myself towards the more advanced engineering issues I am facing during this internship.      
       
**My Questions:**    
When faced with an Engineering problem or task where you don't know what the final product will look like, or when you don't know enough about the subject to have every tool you could use in your toolkit: how do you go about imagining that product down the line, and what do you do to address any future tasks/issues you may come across in the duration of time that you're working on it?     
      
*How do you/can I develop the skill of using an engineering thought process to really go about solving a problem? How can I best apply my Ni and Te to do this?* Will it just come with time as I mature as an Engineer? Will it just develop more and more for every EE course I take?     
     
Thank you for your responses."
6my0e0,1,2017-07-12,Crazy for summer intern to contribute 75% to 401k?,Throwaway259952,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6my0e0/crazy_for_summer_intern_to_contribute_75_to_401k/,"Am 25 years old, single, and a rising junior in a computer science program. This summer, I am interning at a bank and I am eligible for 401k with 5% match. Here are my finances:

Income: $30/hr for next 5-6 weeks.
12 month emergency fund in checking account.
$6,600 in an old 401k.
Financial Aid: 12,000   Scholarships: 12,000
No loans.

Last year I received the same combined amount between financial aid and scholarships and my checking account did not fluctuate throughout the year. It doesn't make sense to put any more in. So, I figure I should contribute the max amount to the 401k. My only concern is my senior year where my scholarships will be reduced to 5-7,000. But, I have another summer in between and will likely have another internship at or more than $30/hr.

What are your thoughts?"
6my7e2,12,2017-07-12,Arrow writing overhaul fix,FreedomvsOrder101,CWArrow,https://www.reddit.com/r/CWArrow/comments/6my7e2/arrow_writing_overhaul_fix/,"Alternate story... seasonal changes starting Season 3! 

Season 3

1.) Merlin trains and lives with Thea 

2.) An Assassin breaks into Merlin's home and attacks him, Merlin defends himself to a stalemate against the assailant until Thea thrusts a sword through the assassin's back, Merlin thanks Thea, congratulates her and turns on the lights whilst unmasking the assassin to reveal it to be Sara lance.

3.) Thea is distraught and hates Merlin again. Merlin realises the league will never stop hunting him and now Thea too.

4.) When Laurel finds out Sara is dead she contacts Nyssa to find out who did it. On Nyssa's request Laurel brings Sara's body to Nanda par bat with her. Nyssa and Laurel beg Nyssa's father Ra's to allow Sara into the Lazarus pit but he refuses, Ra's allows Laurel to return with Sara's body to Star city. Instead Nyssa then asks for the right to avenge her instead and her wish is granted. Laurel tries to reason with Nyssa that it was an accident that Thea was protecting Malcolm but her cries are futile. Nyssa travels to Starling city to kill Thea but is met by The Arrow and The Dark Archer Merlin (informed by Laurel) Nyssa is outmatched. Oliver requests an audience with Ra's and upon meeting him. Begs for Thea's life when Ra's refuses Oliver challenges him to fight to the death. 

5.) Malcolm trains Oliver to fight the demons head Ra's al Ghul. Oliver loses this fight and dies. 

6.) Malcolm returns to Star city to protect Thea, Thea refuses to leave and wants to stay with team arrow. Malcolm needs allies to fight the league and protect Thea and team arrow are the only ones who can help. 

7.) Diggle, Roy and Laurel refuse to help Malcolm but will protect Thea, but when the team struggles to defend star city from Danny brickwell and other threats they initially seek the aid of Wild cat but he refuses saying he is retired and always worked alone. After Diggle struggles to hit a van with explosive Arrows in the Arrow suit, Malcolm takes the bow from him and hits the van throwing the bow back at diggle who then realises only Malcolm has the skills to be the Arrow now that Oliver is dead. 

Wild cat suit (example fan art) 
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/178103360243227761/

8.) Malcolm is smug and realises the ironic fashion and humour of him wearing the Arrow's hood and the symbolic nature it represents. Citizens even cheer during his activities as the arrow, providing him perspective on what Oliver did. Black Canary refuses to continue working with Malcolm and when she insists on continuing to take on Danny brickwell Ted Grant aka Wildcat notices her bruises and reluctantly agrees to help her take him down. During a mass brawl Wildcat comes face to face with Danny and lands some solid shots but is ultimately overwhelmed by the man's brute force beating him severely. Black Canary fights her way through the crowd reaching Danny she screams him into submission beating him in between sonic booms, Danny already somewhat beaten by Wildcat is put down hard by Black Canary, and arrested by Quentin lance of the SCPD. 

9.) Malcolm realises Thea will never be happy and accept him as a father for as long as he is indirectly responsible for Oliver's death and the team resent him for being the only one who can wear Oliver's hood and how he doesn't deserve the honour of it. 

10.) Malcolm decides to seek out Oliver's body at the base of the freezing mountain side, he kneels down and tells dead Oliver its time for the Arrow to return. Malcolm carries Oliver's body and the episode credits roll. 

11.) Malcolm the magician storms into the base of the league of assassins killing his way inside stealthy whilst carrying and dragging Oliver's body behind him, (funny and awsome!) he fights to exhaustion using all his strength and skill to avoid detection, traps and guards eventually he finally reaches the Lazarus pit. He submerges Oliver into the waters and defends Oliver's floating body from multiple league members until Ra's enters and defeats Malcolm, but before Ra's can kill Malcolm Oliver queen is reborn credits roll episode. 

Ra's apprehends both of them. Malcolm begs for his daughters life whilst Oliver comes to grips with his sanity. Oliver later speaks with Ra's whilst imprisoned and Ra's admits he has never fought a dual against someone as gifted as Oliver and the fact that Oliver was accepted by the pit foreshadows a destiny of ascension and succession to the title of the demons head. Ra's offers Oliver the chance to become the next great Raish al Ghul. Oliver accepts on the condition that Malcolm and Thea be released from their blood debts. 

12.) Oliver trains with the league whilst Malcolm returns to resume his activities as the arrow and inform team arrow of what transpired. Meanwhile Ray Palmer discovers Malcolm Merlin is alive and is the Arrow (using his X-ray facial capture software) and so he pledges to bring him to justice. Malcolm and the Atom fight. Malcolm defeats Atom and captures him, he drags Ray's metallic ass to team arrow and Ray swears he will bring them all to justice unless they can all prove Oliver is alive, Felicity does so asks for Ray's help in saving Oliver from the league of assassins. 

13.) Team arrow attempts to save Oliver in combination with Ray. They together fight the league but stop their attack when they discover Oliver is fighting against them alongside Ra's and his men. And so they retreat and reflect on the shock of what happened. 

14.) Little do team arrow know but Oliver is under the mental suggestion of Ra's from his exposure to the Lazarus pit and the Vituru drug. Oliver thinks he's working with the league in order to save Starling city. 

15.) Malcolm realises this and with the help of Ray, Cisco, Caitlin and Barry they synthesise an antidote to the Vituru drug and when Oliver arrives in Starling city to carry out the league's plan they ambush him to cure him, with the Flash Injecting Oliver with the cure. 

16.) In the midst of an epic battle between Ra's men and team Arrow/Flash and Ray. Oliver reclaims his sense of self. And turns on Ra's fighting him to exhaustion and an almost second defeat from Ra's but together with help from the rest of the team they all overwhelm Ra's and brutally Oliver kills him. Nyssa is stunned by Ray's less than lethal laser weaponry and detained by Quintin Lance and the authorities. 

17.) Ultimately Nyssa escapes police custody in star city and takes Sara's body from the city morgue and plundges it into the Lazarus pit. Meanwhile Malcolm appears wearing the demons head ring alongside several league members and Nyssa draws her sword as the credits roll.

Finally Oliver never leaves the island during his flashbacks all his hair growth in the pilot it's all real and all the threats he faced all occurred on the island until he departed. 

*******Post season 3, Added notes S4 and S5: *********

Btw 
*I would have had Thea become a proto version of Cheshire during her time training with Malcolm in season 3 several hints towards her becoming that charcater. She'd wear a Green Japanese dojo jiu-jitsu suit when first revealed to be training with Malcolm. 


Seasons 4 

I would have Anarky be the main villain of season 4 and instead of being written as a crazy joker like idiot that twirls sticks I would have had him be a 17 year old cyber hackivist and secret anarchist who works at Oliver's mayoral campaign office as an intern developing a romance with Thea, and developing a computer tech mentor relationship with Felicity. As an anarchist he believes in tearing down the government and despises all forms of authority. He wants absolute freedom at any cost from the laws of society and gathers a major cult like student movement of radical extremist social activist. 

Damien Dark successfully kills Felicty during the limousine attack riddles her corpse with bullets like sonny in the godfather and thankfully Laurel lives. Damien Dark is taken care of midway through the season killed by rage fueld Oliver, who continues his new found killing streak back into season 5. Curtis takes over Felicity's duties as tech expert. 

Later after dark is killed, Oliver regrets returning to killing and the city begins to fall into chaos allowing Anarky to thrive spreading hate online and gathering an army of loyal followers. Whilst Anarky's Anarchist youth try to burn down the whole city Oliver has to fight his way through hoards of teenagers without killing trying to offer hope to the citizens of Star city. 

Meanwhile Anarky hacks his way through Arrow caves firewalls and discovers Oliver queen is the green arrow and where their base of operations is. After tricking Oliver and Diggle out of the base on a red herring. Anarky arrives at the arrow cave and tortures Curtis cutting his eyes out. Oliver returns to find Curtis distraught and goes after Anarky with the will to kill. 

He takes on Anarky's goons brutally breaking the arms and legs of crowds of rampaging teenagers until he gets to Anarky himself and puts an arrow in his knees and arms but is stopped from killing by receiving a call from Curtis begging him not to kill him and have him face justice. Anarky is apprehended by SCPD and prosecuted by Laurel aka black Canary to life in prison. Curtis has the camera lens contact lenses developed into fully functional synthetic prosthetic eyes. Saving his vision plus a few upgrades, zoom 8k definition, internet and news feed etc also  it's the idea that saves the company from bankruptcy by helping millions around the world regain their sight. From then Curtis would be a true Mr Terriffic with eyes everywhere accessing CCTV and news all over the world, with Hyper fluorescent purple hued robotic eyes. As a result of Felicity's death Oliver inherits enough money to buy back some shares in palmer tech and pursues reclaiming his company with Thea becoming very Moira like in her pursuit of reclaiming their family company and mansion, Thea having run a successful night club since her late teens. 


Cheshire- First half of Season 4 Thea would be working for Argus as an assassin with Laila knowing about it. The money she earns she would pour into her continued pursuit of reclaiming palmer tech and rebranding it Queen consolidated. Later she would fight Roy at one point whist he tries to stop her from carrying out an assassination. Eventually she would become Artemis a much better version than the awful one we got in S4/5.

Spartan- Black T-shirt, black ballistic vest, thick black metallic gauntlets, knee pads and elbow pads. Ballistic face mask that Oliver wears in season 5 with a metal ridge on top of head 'Spartan' like with handgun on hip. And M4 assault rifle in his hands always! Plus Plenty of ammo pouches. A kite shaped ballistic shield on his back and a small club on left hip. A true Spartan! 

Wild dog- would later fight Wildcat, Carries a large wooden baseball bat. I'd have him be even more scrappy than depicted, an unpredictable mess of a charcater but somehow is of more use than not. A loose cannon, reckless and dangerous, yet very capable. 

Curtis- I would have made the T- spheres more realistic in there ability to fly, more drone like, less CGI floating cartoons. Curtis carries a Taser flick baton (for melee) and a medical bag plus science kit, essentially he's team Arrow's Doc / crime CSI / Tech exp. 

Black Canary- because she should never have died! District attorney by day Canary by night bagging and tagging criminals with Oliver queen as the true power couple of the DC CW Arrowverse. 

Roy- Captured by HIVE and experimented on, cloned this plot would account for the actors absence from the show. 

Season 5- 

Oliver's team would have been Curtis, Wild dog, Artemis (as Thea) and Black Canary. Dinah drakes part would have been carried out by the real black Canary into her part and be the full time girlfriend of Oliver queen with their long history and back story coming full circle in season 5's ending.

Wildcat takes vigilante's role as the primary anti-hero of S5 (alive, has 9 lives survived Danny brickwell). 

https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/178103360243227761/

Roy- 
At the beginning of season 5 Prometheus would fight Roy and Roy would get his arm cut off by a swing of Prometheus sword. Roy whilst being treated at Star city hospital would be captured by an unknown organisation and disappear not returning until near the end of season 5 with his arm missing Curtis creates a superpowered prosthetic arm for him by seasons end.

“Is this a joke guys? Who put my name in here?”

Stacy rolled her eyes, clutching the piece of paper between her fingers. It had her name on it, which meant she officially inherited the role of office slut/cumdump from Hannah.

“Oh thank god,” Hannah sobbed across the board table. The young dark-haired intern had been taking the job for 6 months running now. Every time Stacy returned from her lunch break, she would see Hannah bent over the printer, taking it up the ass from Mr Finnigan, who had a particular anal fetish. Sometimes he would request that Hannah wear a buttplug to work, just so he could fuck her ass any time of day he liked, and leave her plugged with his cum so it wouldn’t drip on the dreary grey carpets their office was covered in. Hannah’s moans and grunts from taking his large cock used to leave her asshole sore, which the entire office knew about. Everyone felt sorry for her.

She had a smear of cum across her cheek from when Derek facefucked her for her 3pm – Stacy didn’t have the heart to tell her. 

The other women at the table heaved collective sighs of relief. Of course they wouldn't get picked. Stacy was young, blonde, blue-eyed with perky tits. No doubt Jeremy had something to do with this.

“Come on, this is ridiculous,” Stacy said. “I did my time! Two whole years of it!” She was a junior executive now, no longer a fresh – or cum-drenched – face intern. The celebratory office gangbang at the end of her tenure still haunted her dreams sometimes.

“Exactly, and now it’s your turn again,” said Charlie. Stacy knew he had a particular fondness for her tits – back in the day he would make her kneel at his desk and pull them out of her blouse while he stroked his cock to them, spilling thick white cum all over her creamy skin. She remembered how hard it was to get those stains out of her blouse.

She wondered if Randy still liked having his asshole licked. That kinky fucker used to prop his feet up at his desk while he made her tongue and kiss his asshole for hours, before blowing his load all over her face. He enjoyed making her walk around the office for a bit before cleaning it off.

“I didn’t know we were taking turns,” she grumbled. 

“We are a fair workplace,” Mr Finnigan said mildly. When she was office slut, he used to bend her over his lap and finger her asshole in perverse fascination, buying larger and larger buttplugs for her to wear and making her pull them out at the end of the day, spreading her cheeks and winking her gaped asshole at him while he jerked off onto her ass cheeks. When he was particularly stressed, he would make her sit on his face while he busied himself ramming his tongue inside her asshole. 

Her asshole clenched up at the thought of taking his large cock up her ass.

Jeremy smirked at her across the table. “Don’t forget the uniform,” he said. Stacy groaned – of course. It comprised a blouse one size too small for her, the top two buttons undone and a skirt that barely covered her round ass cheeks and showed a peek of her pussy if she did anything so much as lean over. Underneath, a bra that pushed up her ample tits to show them off as much as possible, and lace panties that framed her puffy pussy and were often tugged down and up throughout the day whenever someone wanted to use her. Often, she would go home without any panties when one of the men took them as souvenirs.

“You start today,” Mr Finnigan informed her. “The gangbang will be commencing after this meeting, of course, Hannah, so do get prepared.” Hannah gulped nervously. “But it’s business per usual for you, Stacy. I expect great things from you.”

“I bet you do,” Stacy muttered.

*

Stacy emerged from the ladies’ bathroom in her mandated office slut attire. Everyone was just leaving the meeting room, zipping up their pants and tucking their shirts back in. Just beyond the glass walls, she could see Hannah bent over the table, her outfit a torn mess, cum slick on her lips and dripping from her two holes. 

“Stacy!” Randy exclaimed, still licking his fingers clean of Hannah. “You look better than I remembered in that getup. Come by my cubicle first, I want that tongue between my cheeks before lunch.” He winked, and walked away. Mr Finnigan was busy rifling through a cabinet in the office, full of dildos and ring gags and vibrators and anal beads and whatever else these heathens could come up with. He looked at her, smiled, and held up a thick butt plug.

Stacy groaned.

Hi DPP! So this is somewhat of a sequel or companion prompt to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6ltzwg/22f4m_charity_anal_booth/).

There are many directions this can take, but the role of office slut in this particular office is quite unique, in that everyone takes the position seriously and doesn't demean her for doing her job. Any kind of humiliation is more tongue-in-cheek and office-prank style than truly degrading. 

Take your time sending a response, and it is not a race. Responses don't have to be as long as the prompt, of course. I'm looking to make this a long term RP, so this doesn't have to be responded to in the immediate hours after this is up.

Smut is primarily on the agenda here, but a bit of detail to add a dash of realism and characterisation would be great! Please be literate and mind your spelling and grammar. This RP will be in **third person and past tense.** 

Kinks: rough sex, lots of cum, being used as a cumdump, spanking, dildos, buttplugs, anal beads, vibrators, anal, reluctant or forced orgasms, humiliation, ball sucking, rimming (giving and receiving).

Limits: name calling, scat, gore, ageplay, incest, ""daddies"""

6myhks,2,2017-07-12,I [25/f] need advice on how to deal with my co-worker [39/m],Naturl20,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6myhks/i_25f_need_advice_on_how_to_deal_with_my_coworker/,"I’ll start off by saying that I work at a really small company, we have no HR department and no extra desks or computers either of us could switch to, we just got a new intern and had to pull a desk out of storage and set it up in the hallway so she would have somewhere to work, so I’m stuck sitting five feet away from this guy for 8 hours a day. If I complained about it to my immediate supervisor it would only be to let her know, and she has a lot of stress in her life right now that I don’t need to add to. The good news is that he’s a temp and will be gone at the end of November so I just have to figure out a way to deal with him until then. 

We work in a really small office and as a tight team so it’s really important for us all to work together and get along, but this guy has managed to strangle every last one of my nerves. He acts super friendly to everyone but is constantly doing that by making snide comments and backhanded jokes. He also never shuts up. He’ll add in his two cents whenever there is a conversation nearby, even if no one is talking directly to him. When someone is talking to him, he’ll go, “yeah, yes, uh-huh, ok” etc. every three words which makes it feel like he’s always interrupting or not paying attention to anything you’re saying. He’ll even do this in meetings when there’s a lot of people and the speaker is speaking to the whole group. He only stops when he goes to open a bag of chips or plastic bag and starts eating, right in the middle of the meeting. He also keeps tapping, singing, and humming to himself at his desk. One time he actually pulled his headphones out of the computer so he could play music on his speakers and sing along. Did I mention we work with 6 people in a tiny office barely bigger than a studio apartment? He also chews with his mouth open and keeps a jar of peanut butter and a spoon at his desk so he can snack on it.

He looks for any excuse to stop working including striking up conversation with anyone who walks in the room. He’s on his phone half the day and will try to shirk off any responsibility that is a slight inconvenience to him. He goes on two 15 minute walks a day where he wanders around the residential neighborhoods near our building and pulls flowers from their yards so he can watch them die on his desk. Not the weed-like flowers that grow along the street but the beautiful flowers taken from the nicely manicured gardens that people put a lot of time and effort into growing. I’ve seen him take the one flower growing on a bush and pick it. He does this nearly every day. If anything, he’s started doing it more and more often even though the weather is getting hotter and the flowers are dying so there are significantly less of them. I’ve taken to going on walks after he gets back so I don’t have to listen to him hum to himself for the next ten minutes as he clips the stems, prunes the leaves, and arranges them in the mason jar on his desk. I know quite a few of the people who live in this neighborhood and if they knew how often he ripped up their plants they would form a lynch mob. Does he give a shit about anyone but himself? Clearly no.

The thing is, I wear my heart on my sleeve and it’s really obvious to him that I don’t like him. He’s responded by clearly ignoring me and being overly friendly to everyone else. I’m really happy that he doesn’t talk to me so I don’t have to pretend to care about him (when he still talked to me he would turn around to stare at my screen and make comments on whatever I was working on) but he will then do passive aggressive things to piss me off. Like push his chair back so I can’t get out of my desk or swing his chair around so it keeps hitting mine. I think it’s becoming obvious to the rest of my team that I don’t like him and that might be causing a rift in the office.

Reddit, I need advice. My stress levels at work have gone through the roof after having to work next to this guy, but no one else seems to be bothered by him. I feel like my qualms are lots of tiny things any nothing to get legitimately angry about or complain over, but they add up to something unbearable. I know if I didn’t have to sit so close to him I probably would be so irked by him but there is just nowhere to go. He stresses me out so much even when I try to take a break and get away from him all I can think about is screaming in his face. I have never hated or wanted to punch someone in the face so much in my life. I’ve never been bothered or annoyed by a coworker I’ve had before I met this guy and usually get along really well with the people I work with, but I’ve started to avoid being in the office as much as I can now because of this guy which has caused my relationship with all my other coworkers to suffer.



**TL;DR** New coworker drives me up the wall with lots of tiny annoyances that aren’t enough to complain to my superiors about but make every work day incredibly stressful for me. Feel like I’m reaching my breaking point and need to figure out how to cope until he leaves in November.

I have served as a summer intern for a church plant we are partnered with a few states away, been apart of the prison ministry team, and plus I have been busy with my coursework/ part time jobs.

I still have good relationships with my college friends, but the elders I look up to don't even seem to care. This bothers me a lot because I hoped that I would get some parting wisdom and advice from people I look up to before I start this new journey. Even my mentor has distant, but it is understandable since he himself is in the process of starting at another church. I would like to know I would do. Should I talk to my Sr. pastor? Should I just ride the wave out until I move and start a new church? or anything else? This experience has been really painful, but I guess everyone has to go through the ""hurt by the church"" process at some point or another. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! "

The official position requirements and forms are listed [here](http://alasconnect.com/jobs.html) under the Software Engineer 1 heading.

AlasConnect is a subsidiary of Matanuska Telephone Association, a telecommunications company which services part of southern Alaska. AlasConnect itself is a Managed Service Provider (generally Microsoft) and has clients throughout the Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Palmer areas.

I run a small team of developers which supports and writes software for both companies. The MTA side has a bit of C#/.NET and is fairly enterprise-y, although various new projects are being written in Haskell. On the AC side we are slowly gearing up to be a 100% Haskell using consulting/software development shop.

C#/.NET experience would be nice, but it's not a hard requirement. Just so there aren't any surprises, there's a chance you may be asked to help support some existing systems written in it. Given a long enough timeline we'll make Enterprise Haskell a thing though.

Answers to questions that I've typically seen come up in job posts:

* No remote, onsite only.
* No internships. This is a mid-career position, so a few years of practical software engineering experience is required.
* We are not in a position to sponsor visas, and therefore can only consider people authorized to work in the US.

Please mail all applications/resumes to hr@alasconnect.com

I talk to my supervisor at Company A about this and he said he is fine with reducing my hours significantly to take this opportunity at Company B. Great! Once it's over I will return to normal hours at Company A with all of the new skills I learned. 

My concern is this:
On my resume it will show that at one point it I had two internships at the same time (for about 3 months). Does this look bad to potential employers? Will this hurt my chances of getting my first full time job after I graduate? If they ask about it during an interview, what and how much do I say?

I have been trying to define how I really felt about everything for a while... and came to the conclusion that I might have been depressed for a few years.
It came little by little. I am someone who is really sensitive to things in general, and considers everything Im being told regarding my life, job, physical aspect or whatever.. To a point where I overthink remarks and it destroys my day, week, or even for a longer period of time.

I was a student a few years ago and life was quite nice... nice parties, nice people, nice internships abroad, nice experience... Overall I was quite happy with my life so far. I always had a friend who was generally a nice chap, but he would always try to pull me down if he felt undervalued regarding the studies, the internships, the girls or whatever. 
He would always try to make remarks that clearly werent nice such as ""Well you dont have any ambition cos you didnt do that, whereas I did"" or ""Oh well you hooked up with an ugly one as usual last night"". The sort of things that make you believe that no matter what you do, it will end up being shit.

Anyway I was quite happy with my last internship in a small town in England, as it is a very popular company that gave me tons of opportunities, and colleagues were great... but he decided to make the move to england as well for some obscure reason and did the move to London. There I got more remarks like ""Shit why would you be in this shit town, london's much better, my jobs great, i hook up, ..."" etc etc.
As I told you previously I dont deal easily with this sort of remarks and I started thinking (more) that I wasnt achieving anything in my life.
....
I ended up living in london where i wasnt satisfied with the new job at first (I am starting a new one in a few weeks) where... once again I would get more remarks about everything I would do or try. I also tried to start my own business with a friend as London is a great city for investors.. and once again I would get feedback from him that the idea is shit, and all this sort of things.
It sort of stopped when his booty call started flirting with me and I ended up sleeping with her.. He sort of got a slap in his face and never spoke to me again.

I am however facing a new issue... all these remarks really affected me after all these years and I am never happy with what I do now. I feel like what I do or any decision i take is worthless. I used to be much more outgoing and approach people easily but i really lost all confidence in a lot of aspect of life...
This sort of lost of confidence came little by little over the last 5 years, and I really dont know how to get out of this vicious circle without thinking that im just worthless ...

The company job is CFD focused, has the added bonus of nice pay, but I know its not going to be as relevant to my aspirations or technically challenging as the research position. However, I know I will get further research experience in my post grad.

I appreciate everyone willing to read. 

Me and my long distance girlfriend of one year, she is 19 and I am 24. She lives in Flordia, me in North Carolina. She has family here in NC. We've had the strongest relationship to date. She is currently living with her immediate family in FL while going to college. She has a 4.7 GPA and she is a wonderful girl. We've had a strong relationship, very open, very real. We never hid things, and we were always honest and we loved and still love each other deeply. I made trips there, she made frequent trips here. We've talked about our future as getting married. Where we would live, how we would manage everything. We discussed our wedding, what it would look like and so on. She even recently started sending me photos of rings that she liked. I even gave her a promise ring this last Christmas and she wears it every single day. I currently work at a church as an intern, I don't make good money, however, I have had good jobs in the past. She's never had a problem with that before. We discussed me quitting in September, and moving to Flordia to have a life with her.
I took a trip to Flordia and stayed at her house with her family last month. Her father died 2 years ago in a tragic Atv accident, so that has always been a rough thing. Her mother loves me, and gave me a place to stay, fed me and took me out to dinner multiple times throughout my week long trip last month.
We prayed together every night and face timed every single day. We were loyal and all of our friends knew we were going to me married. She recently came to visit me this last Wednesday to Wednesday. We had the best time! She finally got a chance to meet ALL of my friends! (It's hard to get all of them together when she's here) and she has dinner with my family (which they love each other very much) and we did many activities. It was beautiful. We had a wonderful time with no issues. Well, Tuesday before she had to leave on Wednesday, she face timed me crying, sobbing, telling me she talked with her mother and grandmother and I needed to get to her grandmothers house (where she was staying) because she needed to talk To me. I left work immediately and walked to the front door and she walked out crying and sobbing. She kissed me and said I love you more than anything.
We sat down, she started to throw up, and continued to cry as she told me that she was worried about our future being married, having a house, kids, etc. she said certain times I get irritated and over react to things harshly. Not against her, but certain life situations. She said a lot of times she has to be strong for me and tell me that things are never as bad as they seem. She said (in tears) that I didn't have any aspirations, that for the year we were together I didn't make hard strides to progress in my financial life. She felt that she was holding me back because I couldn't be the husband she needed me to be in the future. We exchanged tears and she said and screamed as she held a pillow I got her, ""I can't handle life without you, you're my prince and this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, my fathers death felt like this. I need you""
We talked a bit more and I went home. She texted me throughout the day saying ""I want so bad for you to prove everyone wrong and change. I need you in my life and I just need you to prove everyone wrong!"" Later that night she face timed me and was dying. She couldn't breathe and she kept scream crying saying she can't do it. She said we can just take a break. Still be in a relationship, text, call each other sweetheart, etc. but just not face timing every night so I can focus on growing and maturing. We agreed and said I love you and she went to sleep.
I texted her the next morning before her early flight home. She said ""good morning my sweetheart! I believe in you. I believe in us! Welcome to the first day of the new you!"" And we texted as normal before she got on the plane. She got home and said ""I made it sweetie"" and I texted her back, but didn't hear from her for an hour.
Her mother picked her up from the airport, next thing I got a FaceTime call from her saying she has to do this for me and for her. She was screaming crying and said she loves me and she feels she is only a distraction and she wants me to grow for myself, not for her. She wants our paths to cross again in the future because she can't imagine life without me, but she has to let me grow. She called me baby and sweetie during all of this. We prayed one last time. And she said she things she needs to block communication from me (fb, insta, text) for one month so that we have time to heal and she doesn't make a mistake by coming back. After that month we can try to be friends.
We said we loved each other and she said ""I'll never forget you I promise. I will call you in one month. Know I love you and you'll always be my prince. I believe in you my love""
And we hung up.
I haven't heard from her since. She changed the caption on her instagram and removed the ""Jon ❤️ 9.1.16"" and changed the captions of her photos of us to a black heart.
I know she loves me. I have a job interview next week and I'm moving in my apartment in two weeks. I am doing this but I hate doing life without my precious honey. She was my best friend.
Any advice on what I should do? Do I actually move on? I can't imagine life without her. She just let her mother influence her life and scare her by feeding her legitimate concerns but things that can change.
I feel like I'm dying. Most say give it time because they truly believe we're for each other, but my heart breaks every single day I don't hear her sweet voice comforting me.
I'd love to share a picture of our beautiful love, but I can't seem to figure out how."
6n2d7y,145,2017-07-13,"Me [30 F] with my Dad [60 M], visiting my parents and getting endless comments about my eating habits",jurassicchinhair,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6n2d7y/me_30_f_with_my_dad_60_m_visiting_my_parents_and/,"So I'm staying with my parents in their vacation home for an internship. My husband and kids are back home. My relationship with both parents is somewhat strained. 

I haven't lived with them since I've been married, and I'm finding them hard to deal with and some of their behaviors inappropriate, rude, demeaning, and hurtful. I'm struggling with how to deal with these behaviors and could use some advice apart from the obvious. 

So, since I've had 2 children I've gained weight. At my highest it was a net gain of about 40 pounds. Over the past year I've lost about 20. I feel pretty comfortable with my figure, although I'd like to lose another 10-20 in the next year. 

My husband has always seemed happy with my figure, extolling his love and lust for me, his desire, his appreciation for my body, etc. We've not seen a dip in intimacy. The weight loss was spurred entirely by me and my husband has been completely supportive of my hard work and even took is at an opportunity to get back in shape and cut out bad habits from his own life as well. 

The best thing I did for weight loss was go on a ketogenic diet. I was still on keto when I arrived, but it's pretty difficult doing it as a guest in someone's home with totally different eating habits. So I decided to stop keto and took the opportunity to enjoy things like beer which I haven't had in months. 

Comments started. My dad had been drinking and was looking for food in the fridge and I was like, ""Meh, I'm not in the mood for that."" and he started going off in a 'joking' tone about ""FOOD and MOOD don't go together! This is healthy! If you put food and mood together then all you do is eat steak"" (I had steak a few nights before when I was still on my ketogenic, 1200 calorie diet). I could tell he was taking a jab at me. The day after I had steak I brought home Reese's Peanut Butter Cups when I decided to go off keto. I haven't had Reeses in like 8 months haha. I brought home 3. Yep, it's a lot, I get it. 

This wee my mom and I are planning a day trip. I said, 'are there any good places to eat in that town?' and my mom was like, 'Oh yeah, there's X place,"" and I said, 'oooh is that the place with the good pies?' 'No, this is the place that has those amazing cinnamon rolls!' At this point my dad comes out of his office, and tells my mom, ""Okay hon, we're not really helping with the problem here.""

So I was like, ""What problem? What is he talking about?"" My mom laughed awkwardly and shrugged her shoulders, dismissing it as my dad being weird. But I kept insisting. ""What problem, dad?"" From inside his office he was like, ""You know...the....the healthy eating problem!"" in a half joking tone. I'm like ""Who's problem is that?"" and he trails off, ""Oh you know....it's my problem....it's your mother's problem....and some other people have the problem"". I was like ""HM 'SOME OTHER PEOPLE' huh?"" The conversation ended there. 

Last night we went out to eat. My dad suggested he get one entree, I get another, and we would share. So I cut my hamburger in half, and ate a piece of his fish and chips. I asked him if he wanted the other half of the burger, and he said no. So I started eating that, too. He starts staring at me with this smug expression on his face. My mom was like, 'what are you doing? lol' and my dad's like, ""Oh, I'm just observing here. I'm just seeing if she's going to reach a point where she's going to stop and say she's full."" 

Looks, I get it. I'm not my emaciated 19 year old self. I used to look like a model. I'm 5'10"" and for a time I was 120 pounds. You could see my ribs. Then I was 130 for a long while. This was still a slim frame, but healthier. I'd like to be back to around there. 

I'm now 150. I'd say I'm well within a normal range for my height, I'm usually a size Medium, I'm a size 10 pants, which is actually the same size I've been since reproducing. I went up for a while but since losing about 20 lbs I'm back to the size 10. My boobs are a lot larger now since I've had children. I hate them and they make me look much broader. 

But yes, I can eat a lot if I want to. I had pizza on my lunch break at home before going out to have a burger. 

The other night my mom brought home a piece of cake and I ate it when she said she didn't want it. I like food. 

At 5'10"" and 150 I'm by far the heaviest person in my family. My mom is taller than me and about 140 or so, my sisters are also probably around 130. My brother actually has trouble gaining weight. So, I'm definitely the fat one in my family.

How the hell do I deal with this? I think my eating habits are none of my dad's business, and that it's rude and bad manners to comment on my eating the way he does. Honestly the shit he's saying is what my anorexic friends' parents would say to them in high school. It's just not nice and not helpful.

I know what people are going to say, I need to just be clear and communicate. That would be ideal, but you have to take the dysfunction into consideration here. My dad has become more of an obnoxious bully in his old age, but at the same time he deeply loves and cares about us in the family. So he would be really hurt if I came on too strong, and then I'd feel guilty. 

I could go to my mom about it, but she is incredibly high strung, emotional, and a poor communicator. I'm afraid that her message to my dad will be this really high-strung dysfunctional word vomit and he will just get pissed. Any time he is corrected he feels like people are ""attacking him"". 

It's easier not to say anything at all. But this is a huge reason why my husband and I moved away, taking their beloved grandchildren. Over the years I've become the black sheep of my family, ostracized and bullied and blamed for things. 

Do I say something? Can someone help coach me on what to say and how to say it? I'm not good at this stuff. It's not as simple as being like, ""stop"". My dad won't stop. At this point this is hindering my ability and desire to have a relationship with them. Part of me thinks I need to make that clear. The other part of me thinks it will cause more drama than it's worth. 
 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Dad comments on my food and eating habits while I am staying with them. I think it's rude and hurtful and none of his business. Confronting him may cause more drama than it's worth. But if I do say something, I need help and coaching with what to say and how to say it. Help?"
6n2hsn,0,2017-07-13,[Rant] State of HotS,Zman1719,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/6n2hsn/rant_state_of_hots/,"This is just me blowing off some steam about HotS since 2.0 and the departure of Dustin Browder (Dbro).  Do I still like HotS? Kind of, I play 1-2 games per day and watch streams.


That being said the following bulleted list are changes that, to me, indicate that the game I used to love and play for hours on end is heading down a dark path:

 * Mount speed changes - I am still not *used* to this change and feel so much less involved and active in the game when this change was made.  I absolutely abhor this change and the reason the developers gave for it was because ""roaming gank squads were too strong"" which is just ridiculous.

 * Warrior rework - This change absolutely irritates me.  Warriors were fine before but they were changed to mostly be niche for spell or AA damage.  This is terrible and makes games much more heavily draft dependent than before and leads to all comps needing 2 warriors.  Why?  The community clamored for more main tanks and they turn around and throw this garbage at us.

 * Support changes - Like warriors, they seem to making only ""off supports"" and want us to play with 2 warriors, 2 supports and 1 DPS.  Why?  We wanted full supports and full tanks not these stupid half supports and niche tanks.  Plus, stun metas are awful but you remove cleanse or don't release a hero with it?  Why?  Every support should have cleanse.

 * Mana Creep - this irks me not because I love the mana mechanic (I don't btw) but because it makes newer heroes stronger just because they have less mana issues.  If you want to reduce the effect mana management has on the game then I am all for it but AT LEAST make changes more global and reduce mana costs of all the heroes to compensate for these new, might as well not have mana heroes.

 * Regen Globe timer(s) - This change just gutted all regen globe talents at the same time the developers made the talents require even *more* of them than before.  Almost no regen globe talents are worth taking.  If they are it's because you are on 1-2 maps or the other talents are terrible.
 * Mobility Creep - I don't care if the hero is dumpster tier but these high mobility heroes (mainly from OW) just make the game frustrating/annoying to play like a fly constantly buzzing in your ear.  And if you play these heroes enough then going back to a hero like Arthas feels awful.  Seriously, this game is not an FPS we don't need high mobility slippery heroes every other release.

 * Moving while shooting - This is related to the above.  Again, STOP TRYING TO FORCE FPS MECHANICS IN HOTS!  This is not an FPS game and never will be.  Moving while auto attacking is absolute cancer.


Those changes are all related to gameplay that directly affects my in game experience but HotS, like many other games, has out of game experiences as well and that's the next bulleted list:

 * Shop items - This is my absolute biggest gripe of 2.0.  Pre 2.0 you could buy whatever you wanted whenever you wanted it, seasonal items aside.  Also, we got a couple skins and a hero on 50% discount every so often which was great.  $5 for a skin with 3 tints was worth it.  Now, there are no more sales for skins just *featured* items that are basically just ""now you can buy these items for gems but you couldn't before.""  And the cost has gone up (heroes costs went down though).  Before, a skin with 3 tints was $10 and $5 on sale.  NOW, those same skins are $5 for ONE tint.  I mean...seriously!?  Oh, and to make it worse, they change a lot of cheaper skins to *legendary* with no rhyme or reason other than to make more money.  Absolutely disgusting.

 * Loot Chests - OK, I don't like them but they could at least have items in the shop cost gems permanently.  But, my biggest issue with Blizzard on this one is their laziness in skin designs lately.  They release 1-2 skins with 85 tints that are all Epic or Legendary diluting to hell the loot boxes.  Just another cash grab from them.

 * Starcraft Heroes - I love SC to death as I have been playing it for years, almost 20 at this point.  But, in HotS, almost every WC and Diablo hero fits their fantasy perfectly but the SC ones are just terrible: Probius (wtf is this thing anyway?), Tassadar, Stukov, Artanis, Alarak etc.  It's like the other universes get a dedicated team of good developers while the SC ones have an intern that was shown a picture of the hero only and told to make up some talents.  It's soul crushing whenever they release a SC hero.


Honestly, since the departure of Dbro the in game has become so dry, frustrating just not fun anymore.  The speed changes make me feel helpless, the warrior changes make drafting feel too impactful, playing support isn't fun anymore because 1 support just isn't enough these days, warriors feel like slightly less squishy melee assassins and mana might as well not exist.  Outside the game everything else just feels like a big cash grab that demotivates me to even bother because in a week 1000 more tints for existing skins will be released and will all be marked legendary making it even more difficult to get anything I want.  Oh, and skins never go on sale anymore either.

That's my rant that I just wanted to get off my chest because I truly loved this game for a long time but am feeling very discouraged from all the changes in the last 6-8 months or more.  I was excited for very little and the things I was excited about got changed or corrupted very quickly. "

I've been a good saver my whole life and by the end of this summer (after summer expenses) I will have about $10,000 (after taxes) from an internship, and $6,000 from past summer jobs. I hope the $6,000 for cover me for at least the next 2 or so semesters.  

My parents cover my tuition and don't need to take out loans. My parents also cover my gas and phone expenses.  

I might go back to an old job making ~$100 a week during the semester.  

I pay for:  
	* School supplies (including books)  
	* Apartment supplies (splitting cost w/3 other roommates)  
	* Clothing  
	* Eating out  
	* Going out  
	* Food (during school year)  
	-Still up in the air whether or not I will receive a monthly food stipend from my parents.   

My goals:  
	* Not have my money disappear after the 1st semester  
	* Have money saved for travel and spring break plans  
	* Live cheaply  
	* Be ahead of the game in terms of retirement  

Questions:  
	1. I already have a Roth IRA that I started last year and I have about $2,400 in it. How much more should I put in that account? (Currently deposit $50 a month)  
	2. What other types of investments/funds should I consider?  
	3. What's good way of splitting up and putting money? Meaning, I already have a checking and savings account, but I don’t want my $10,000 of savings just sitting in my savings account within reach. I don't want to be tempted.   
	4. Any good subreddits for cheap food recipes and cheap eating tips? Or any good college related subreddits? (I'm new here!)  
	5. Got any other good advice?  

I want to be as prepared for my future as possible. I'll have my degree in electrical &amp; computer engineering in 3 years, and it would be ideal if I could combine my job prospects with financial stability.  

Thanks for the help in advance."

6n2rav,0,2017-07-13,"I [25 M] started dating 2 girls around the same time, things progressed unexpectedly with both and I can't seem to find a way to get myself cleanly out of this situation.",throwdt2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6n2rav/i_25_m_started_dating_2_girls_around_the_same/,"I am 25y old male, I've only had one ""long"" relationship before, around 3-4 months, probably because I've never been interested in one or actively looking for it so I've mostly had hookups, one night stands and the likes and I've been very fine with it and with living the single life.


Now the problem is, I started dating 2 girls at around the same time, and eventually things started progressing with both in a way I wasn't expecting and I don't know how to get myself out of it without hurting someone or myself. Lets use Emily [21 F] and Sofia [24 F] as the pseudonyms of Girl1 and Girl2


Emily is a girl I've know her for a couple years, she was a foreign student who lived in our student house a couple months, before moving out to another place and eventually going back to her home country a few months later. During that time we became good friends, I showed her a lot of places in the city, she met my friends  and went out a bunch of times with us, and we hooked up one time (although nothing else happened) and after that she stayed a bit more distant and I only saw her a couple more times before she went back to her country. We kept friends on social media and still talked a few times in the meanwhile.
She came back recently for a short (2 month) internship in my country again and I kissed her again and she was really down to it. She confessed to me she has only had 1 boyfriend before and she only had sex with one person before (him), mainly due to her culture and her religion (she is muslim). Which I thought was surprising because this girl is super good looking (like a 9/10) and wealthy and has traveled a lot so I assumed she would be more experienced in that department, suffice to say, sex hasn't been particularly good nor interesting. She really seems very innocent/inexperienced and it really shows it's still kind of a big taboo to her. Which is a bummer because because sex is an important factor for me, specially in a relationship. Emily made it very clear to me that she has never had one night stands or casual things and is not ok with that, and she always looks for a relationship in a guy, probably due to her culture. Very recently she told me she even showed a few of our photos to her mom and aunt and she said they liked me. Which I felt super uneasy about. Her aunt even invited us both to her summer house in Italy. I've never met any of her family.



Sofia is a girl I met last month, a week before Emily arriving again. I met her at the end of a night out , she was with a couple friends and me too, we started talking and eventually talked for like 1+ hour until literally night turned day. I got her contact and I was feeling really good vibes from her so at the end when we were saying goodbyes we kissed very briefly. I reached out to her later and we arranged a date later that week. In that date we talked and talked and talked for like 5 hours without any kind of awkwardness, our chemistry was palpable and I've never been so comfortable with another girl in such a short time. Even she mentioned it was super weird that we were getting along so well, because it had never happened to her like that. So much so that on our 2nd date, after dinner we got to my place and she  said she didn't feel comfortable having sex because she felt that because we had connected so well she didn't want to spoil that by going too fast. I didn't force anything so we just slept and it eventually happened naturally in the morning and everything was fine. She confessed to me she is kinda tired of one night stands or casual things, and that this time it could be different but she also never indicated or insinuated we were in a relationship and even when we were having dinner and her parents called she mentioned she was with a girlfriend of hers (she said she didn't want to have the talk and explain the situation to her parents). This girl is also good looking, not as much as Emily tho, but the sex is great (not amazing but I've had very few of those experiences) and our chemistry is fuckin amazing. Our second date I spent more than 24h together with her (we went to the beach together the day after) and there was no awkward moment.


Now, I don't know how to get out of this situation. I really like Sofia, I feel we have amazing chemistry, I don't feel crazy in love with her (at least yet) but I feel a strong sense of friendship and very protective of her and I think its mutual. I see her as the girl that might finally make me settle down, at least for now and have a stable relationship. 


Now Emily on the other hand, shes a beauty, we get along well but not great (language is a barrier too), she says she feels very comfortable with me and has showed me to her family, I feel comfortable with her as well but she is going back to her country in 1 month now and I never considered we could be talking immediately relationship status. Now I'm not officially in a relationship with either of them, although Emily definitely's heading that way fast, but the more time this goes on the more I feel like I am cheating on either of them.  I've never cheated on anyone, mainly because I've never had many long term relationships, but I don't see a way of stopping this without breaking the heart of either of them. My plan at the moment is: I am trying to get by this last month of Emily here and eventually let distance take care of the rest and stay with Sofia, but I'm getting increasingly anxious about it. What should I do if not that?


Another problem is that my birthday is coming up and I was thinking about making a dinner with friends but now Emily has been asking about it and Im afraid Sofia is gonna mention it soon too and I don't know how I'll handle that, my best friend suggesting not inviting either of them and just going with close friends and if any of them asks, say it was a surprise dinner from them.

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: Started dating 2 girls at same time, girl1 is a foreign I knew before and we reconnected again, girl2 met in a night out, things progressed with both, have amazing chemistry with girl2. Girl1 is surprisingly very innocent/inexperienced and her religion and culture means she is about a serious relationship and is pushing that, but she is going back to her country in 1 month. I don't know how to get out of this situation without hurting one of them, or myself."
6n2rqf,1,2017-07-13,Easing back....,ASouthernOmlette,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6n2rqf/easing_back/,"The title seems self explanatory, but I'm having some mixed feelings about it.

Taking summer classes right now on a PTK scholarship. I'm really close to graduating, and I have no intentions of quitting. Not when I have a good opportunity in front of me.

I got hired to work in an intern program at an automotive plant in my state. The industry is really big, so it's a good job opportunity with a lot of perks. And I find myself more inclined to go the technical route than I have in the past. I'm not the best at it, but I actually want to learn more. I want to learn more from those experienced in the industry.

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. I guess I just need somewhere to dump this mental vomit in my head.

I get so impatient. I want to go somewhere else. I want my own place. I want to be done with school. But time seems to go by so slowly.

The lack of patience I have is starting to get to me. Especially with school. 

And then there's my attention span. Ive been finding it a lot harder to focus during summer classes than the spring. Idk why. Maybe because I was in spring semester and really wanted a break, but at the same time, I wanted to get closer to graduation. And being done with school for good.

And sometimes, I feel like I'm going to fail. I know I should welcome failure as a learning experience, and I try, but I fear that one day I'll screw up so bad it sets me back even further. Like if I get dropped from my internship or I fail a class. Fear. There's always fear in the back of my head.

I wish for once I could be at peace with myself. At least in regards to what goes on in my life..."
6n2s9t,1,2017-07-13,I'm having a hard time (23/m) and my girlfriend (26/f) doubts our future.,Japan1994,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6n2s9t/im_having_a_hard_time_23m_and_my_girlfriend_26f/,"Hello guys, first of all I am new here and English is not my native language. So if I make mistakes excuse me for that. For the people that read my story and reply, thank you so much for your time. I found myself in a hard situation. At least from my perspective. I try to be rational but it is very difficult for me some times. Okay, so I'm afraid to end up alone. I have a girlfriend that I love. But because I have personal troubles (working on it) and if I don't she doubts our future. I am 23, she is 26. Let me provide you some background information.


My environment sucks, no supportive friends nor family. I would describe my family as a dysfunctional family. I have non personal freedom, for instance I am forced to believe in god and to pray everyday. I can't talk to them, because if I point out things to discuss it's not true or they don't take me seriously. They don't communicate proper with eachother and end up most of the time into (screaming) fights. My dad is manipulative, controlfreak and disrespects my (personal) freedom. He treats our family like crap and my other family members ignore this fact. But I don't. I have had pointless discussions. So due to this, I don't argue with them anymore, because it's pointless.


Recently I have cut ends with my so called (activity) ''Friends"". I did this because the are very materialistic and have screwed me over before. So I made the choice to leave them. I don't find it hard that I left them, but that I don't have some nice people around my bothers me sometimes.
This is a bit of an insight of my environment, I hope I explained it well. Beside this, before I met these friends and my girlfriend of 8 months. I was very alone. Long story, but I had not very much friends and ended up being sad en maybe even depressed. Now the real deal what bothers me the most. Is that my girlfriend doubts our future. She explained what bothers her, and she is worried that in the end I can't help myself. Because, to improve my situation I want to live on my own. But due to the fact that I had to pay everyting by myself as a student, I wasn't able to. Now I am looking for an internship and after that a job. But that beside, she finds it sometimes hard to communicate with me, because i interpret things not always right. We both think my environment is messing with my head. She also don't like the fact that I have not been on my own (yet). Because this makes me not fully independent. We had discussions for days and she made breaking up jokes and was very distant. Now she constantly asks if i'm afraid to lose her, what does that mean? Things are back to normal now, after that we had a couple of arguments which lasted shorter.


That beside: She has not seen my family and she won't. She had a rough time herself, and I think it wil not profit her or our relationship, and I want to limit the shit that she has to deal with due to me.
Furthermore, due to stress I have gained some serious fysical problems. I suffer from it daily. Let me not describe it, because then it will be a too long story : ) At last, I have a passion. But I lost my motivation a bit and she also don't like that. Thank you for reading this. I have a lot more to tell, but also don't like to make the story too long. I appreciate that some of you take the time to read my personal crap. Prefer to be anonymously
TL;DR: So basically, I'm having a hard time we spoke it out and i'm willing to work on myself. During that time she doubts our future and made breaking up jokes and was distant. What does it for example mean if she constanltly asks if i'm afraid to lose her. And what do you think of this situation in general"
6n2y23,1,2017-07-13,"Married, 31, looking to buy a house while attending school",C4M4RO,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6n2y23/married_31_looking_to_buy_a_house_while_attending/,"A little bit of background. I am 31, married and going to school for a CS degree. I am a mechanic making $55,000 a year with the possibility to work as many hours as I want. My wife works at a restaurant, either at the bar or serving. Our combined income was $79,000 last year. We are renting an apartment and, hopefully, just signed our last renewal for $1,036 a month. Our lease runs out in August 2018. We are hoping to get into a house by then. The housing market is booming at the moment in my area but there are a ton of affordable homes for under $200,000. Which is around what our budget will be. We are also first time home buyers.




Combined, we have around $5,000 in savings. We have over $30,000 in retirement accounts, with $28,000 of that in a workplace 401k. We were married last October and we paid for it out of pocket, which is why the savings are so low. Savings are slowly building back up but I also hold about $4,000 in cc debt that I am paying off. She has $5,000 left on her car and about $10,000 in student loans. I have $15,000 left on my car, which was purchased used last September. My credit score is 732 which is lower than it used to be because of the cc debt. My wife's is not as good as mine. She has a few missed payments and a shorter history. I did add her to a card that has no balance and 9 years history. I recently got an increase on both cards I have, so my credit score should shoot up, but instead of brute forcing my $4,000 cc debt, I was thinking of getting a balance transfer card and making monthly payments until it is paid off inside the 0% period. This will clear up over $600 a month I was paying towards it(plus the $200 a month I would be paying towards the new car to insure it gets paid in full within the 0% period) and allow me to put that towards savings instead. But playing around with a credit app, it dropped my credit score. I know it shortens my average length of total credit, but I am unsure whether it would be higher for when I want to take out a mortgage next year. Which brings me to my next question.




As for school. I am at a community college that I am paying for out of pocket and will be transferring to a 4 year in state institution next fall semester. The tuition will still be affordable out of pocket, but it will almost double as a part time student. I am still on the fence as to whether I should pay for it out of pocket or take out student loans. It is also important to point out that this time frame will be my 4th year in school, so I will not be able to claim tax deductions from out of pocket expenses after this year. So a student loan would be more beneficial, tax wise at least. I could probably pay for it out of pocket since I will be applying for a mortgage around that same time, but it would be nice to get others opinions on the idea. I know at some point I will be completing an internship, and I do not know how that would play out with already working full time. A two month break from work isn't possible, but I could also use that opportunity to quit my job and complete my last two or three semesters as a full time student. I have also been learning html/css and will go to javascript/jquery to try to supplement my income with web design on the side.




So my questions are: Should I get a balance transfer card to increase savings? Would student loans be a good idea?"

GENRE: **Garage Rock**

Top Song Suggustions:

1- *Shut Up And Kiss Me*

2- *Unfucktheworld*

3- *Never Be Mine*

Hello guys! Today I wanted to catch up so today I got Angel Olsen for yall. Stunningly beautiful in voice and face, Angel Olsen is the queen of garage rock these days. With four albums to look through she has a lot of content. But by far her best work was the recent album 'My Woman' which has a variety of songs featuring clashing guitars and rock solid drumming as well as her amazing voice. Id probably say to look at her biggest break yet *Shut Up And Kiss Me* which is fantastic. She sounds like a Lana Del Rey sometimes, especially with  *Intern*, also listen to *Those Were The Days* and *Give It Up*. This show should be excellent as I would expect nothing less from her.

I absolutely love this subreddit and have been using it for more guidance than you could possibly imagine. I've been feeling a little behind in terms of financial progress. Just wanted to give a little intro on myself as well as get some advice.

Im a recent college grad (22yo) who just got accepted to Georgia Tech for a Masters in Computer Science specializing in AI/Machine Learning. I hope that the career prospects in the tech industry pan out to be pretty good after graduation but at the current moment im not employed or had any internships in the tech industry because I completed a full Pre-med track in undergrad as well as a full Computer Science Major. 

With the side jobs that i've had as well as a part time job I have working with special needs kids I've been able to put away $300 a month into a betterment portfolio and currently I have about $12,000 in the portfolio after the market increases of about 11% since inception. I previously put the money into a ROTH but now I deposit into a Traditional IRA due to the tax benefit.
Just wanted to hear some insight from anyone who's been in my place or has any advice at all on what should I focus on. Getting the degree without a full-time job? Trying to balance a full-time job with the degree? And am I far behind in terms of Financial Independence because ER for me doesn't seem like an option I like putting in work into projects I'm passionate about, which coincidentally are in the tech industry

Thank you all for lending your ear."
6n3mw3,2,2017-07-13,Just wanted to share how I've been feeling for the past few weeks.,nikemaker,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6n3mw3/just_wanted_to_share_how_ive_been_feeling_for_the/,"I've accomplished great things this year. I've improved my GPA after a steep fall my freshman year (due to numerous reasons that are hard to explain), I got a summer internship, and my family is beginning to recover financially. But why do I still feel so empty? Why do I still feel sad? Why do I still hate myself? 
For the past few weeks I've become more depressed than ever. I've written so many things in my journal about how terrible and draining life is and how I might never change. This week I  wrote what might potentially be a suicide letter. On Monday night, I stood in front of my closet for a good 5 minutes, contemplating on whether or not I should end it all. I ended up running outside my house to drive somewhere at 1AM. 

I'm really scared of myself guys. Seeing that I might actually have potential of committing suicide is probably one of the scariest things in my life because it felt like it came out of nowhere. I guess I felt tired of myself. It seems like I always sabotage myself from being happy. I try to exercise, eat healthy, and even start dating, but there's a part of me that keeps me from pulling through and bettering myself because I know that I'm going to be depressed again. This cycle of being motivated and depressed throughout my life is very tiring, which is probably why I wanted to end things. 

I don't want to die though. I can't stand the thought of my parents knowing that I ended my life. They give me so much love, and I feel awful that I want to die. I also want to feel better about myself, but everything just seems so hopeless and pointless because I know depression will keep crawling back. I'm also not in a good financial state to get medication, so I'm pretty much toughing it out now. 

If you've gotten this far, I commend you. I just wanted to share my thoughts and feelings right now. Not really looking for advice, but feel free to provide feedback :)"
6n3qcw,5,2017-07-13,"How do I get through this, without you?",Phelps1576,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6n3qcw/how_do_i_get_through_this_without_you/,"I knew you were going down to Florida for your internship while I stayed up here in NC, working my internships and taking classes. I was so happy for you when you got your internship, remember? We went to that dinner and I coo'ed and awe'd at all of the exciting things that a systems engineer does, and then later, when we cuddled, I told you how proud of you I was. God, I still am.

But you were so nervous you weren't going to make friends, and I told you I don't even know how many times that you absolutely would. I reminded you that, for all of the reasons that I love you, others would find reasons to say hi. I told you that within a few weeks you'd probably even forget to call me some nights because you'd be hanging out with your new intern-buddies.

The first two weeks were dope as fuck. I could tell you were having your ups and downs about living with a roommate as crazy as you have, and yet you did seem to be getting close to a few people down there. But through it all, our affection never faltered, and I was so excited every night to talk to you about your day, and bore you with the routine of mine.

But, then, you made a comment. You said ""I have something to tell you. When I'm with you, I don't even look at other guys. But, down here, some of my co-workers are pretty hot, and I think you should know."" I was so happy you told me that, because that's a hard thing to tell someone else. I wasn't mad. But then you told me something else: ""Last night, X and I got drunk (wait, when did you start drinking on weekdays?) and he asked if you and I have had sex. I said no, and he said that I should get on that because it's awesome."" I, still, wasn't exactly mad. More uncomfortable. Drinking, one-on-one with a guy, on a weeknight, and he's faulting your sex life, don't spell out something ""good"" exactly.

I told you that I trusted you, because I did. I still do. Fuck. As the next two weeks went on, though, you got so distant. Oh my God, I've never felt more shut out in my life. You would hang out with X until 10:30, right until you had to go to bed. I would ask if you wanted to schedule FaceTime dates, and you said you'd have to see what you and your friend were doing. I'd say I love you to you, and it felt like I was pulling teeth to hear it back. I'd send you encouraging messages to get you through your day when it became evident that you didn't like your job anymore, and I wouldn't even get a thank you back.

Then you came back to NC, exactly one month after you left, and broke up with me on a bench outside. Your reasoning, still, makes no sense to me. You said ""When I'm with you, I'm so comfortable, and you're so considerate and compassionate to my introvertedness and letting me just chill with you when I don't know people at an event, that I don't take social risks. I just feel like, maybe, this isn't the best."" I hated hearing this, but I agreed that if I wasn't making you happy anymore, then I needed to get out of the way. I cried so much, and you did too, and I wanted to hold and hug you, but we said goodbye. It rained a lot that day. 

The next day, I woke up to a message from you asking if we could get lunch. You said that you agreed with my rebuttals, and wanted to work things out. When we were reconciling, you told me that you'd flirted with X, but that you'd shut it down. Hurt, I pushed forward, because at least you'd stopped yourself. You asked how I felt about your relationship with X. I said that it made me feel a little odd, and that I'd prefer you didn't spend as much one-on-one time with him. I said that, since he had a girlfriend, too, that this whole thing just seemed a bit out there. You agreed. We cuddled, and I remember how good your hand felt in mine as we just talked and let one another in, again. 

The next week was magically loving. It felt like I had you back again. You said ""I love you"" first, and I woke up to kissy faces instead of just hollow ""Good Morning!""s. We had a scheduled Skype date (as per our action plan of how to approach sociability), and it was wonderful. My heart was so full for you. 

Then, the next day, you went to a movie with X. And then you got drunk with him. You told me about it, and you asked how I felt. I thought, blindly, ""Maybe they'd worked it out, and he'd respect it, now."", so I said, ""Yeah that's fine. Just, not too much, like we said.""

Then, the next day, after a lovely FaceTime call, you broke up with me. You said that you'd tried to use logic to get yourself back into our year-long love, but that you just couldn't. I asked if you didn't enjoy this last week. You said you did. I asked if you were sure that this is what you wanted. You, tearfully, asked me to not ask that. I asked if you still loved me, and you just cried. I was so lost. I still am.

I know what actually happened now. Your roommate told me everything she witnessed when she visited you and about what you texted her (she showed me) because she's disgusted with your behavior. She told me about how you hung all over him, about how he would undermine our relationship out loud and encourage you to end it and how you would never defend us or me, and about how, within the same five hours of breaking up with me the second time, you made out with him and that you're now dating him. 

But she also told me that she's heard from you that he's pressuring you to get over me even though you're not, that you're trying to pretend that you are, and that you're miserable in a way because you know you did this all wrong. She told me that she told you that, yes, sweetie pie, you cheated on me, and that, no, I don't know about you and X but that I still am devastated over here. Finally, she told me that, when she told you that, you didn't deny it, and simply cried. My heart broke for you in that moment, because I don't want you to live with guilt or doubt or anything. I want you to be happy. I don't want X to fuck you and leave or fuck you and manipulate you to stay (although literally all of your friends think that's going to happen). I just want you to be happy in who you are and what you do and who you surround yourself with. I don't care if I'm anywhere in there, I just don't want you to be sad.

Liam died yesterday of Glioblastoma, and when the news hit me, I just slumped down and cried. I didn't want to tell anyone else but you, but I know, in my heart of hearts, that you wouldn't want that. You've got someone new to talk to, to open up to, to share yourself with. I want you to know how badly I hurt right now. I've lost five pounds, I can't sleep well, I can't socialize with my friends because now I think that I'm not good enough for anyone's attention or companionship because the person I love most in this world wouldn't even fight for the friendship we'd built.

You royally messed me up, and for someone who just over a month ago was telling me how deserving I am of love, you sure have a funny way of showing it. Yet, through all of this, I do want you to feel like you can talk to me if you need a friend. 

You told me that all you want is for *me* to be happy? Well, then please be safe, please have more fun than I guess I was capable of providing, and for the love of God, please don't ever let anyone treat you less than I did."

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

However the country I would like to visit has no schools affiliated with RPI so I have been doing some research. For reference, I'd like to attend an institution in Japan.
I'd like to say I'd have a good plan or at least list of schools/programs to show the office of international relations or whatever it's called when I come back in August, but I'm not sure where to start. Should I start by talking with them? Or should I already have some plans or ideas when I first meet with them? Basically, how do I start planning this?
Additionally, I DON'T WANT CREDIT. I'm already at my transfer credit limit so I can't get anymore credit from a semester abroad. I just want to get research or an internship with some institution in Japan (I am a Bioinformatics major, so anything microbiology or computational related would be good) and don't want to worry about credit. If it was a paid internship or research that would be great obviously but I'm not picky. 

One last thing, who is the best person to contact during the summer if I want to ask someone who works on this type of thing? 

If anyone has made their own program I would love to hear from you. Anyone with any experience with the office of international programs also has more experience than me so all information is welcome. Thank you!"
6n42t5,22,2017-07-13,Wasted opportunities,violetia,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/6n42t5/wasted_opportunities/,"I've watched Grey's time and time again, and I've always been curious on opportunities you found ""wasted"" on the series. For example, very early on, Addison says that she sees a talent in Izzie as an OBGYN that you don't see everyday, but after Izzie ""fails"" Addison's ""test"", this is never, ever expanded upon after that and throughout the series, Izzie lacks a surgical focus and mentor.

iirc, Heigl rejected a nomination for an award because she didn't think Izzie's storyline was good enough to warrant it, and while I don't necessarily agree with that kind of slap in the face, I do understand why she might be dissatisfied with Izzie's storyline, because while I understand Shonda Rhimes' character Izzie was, out of all five interns, the one to be the most emotionally invested in her patients and that kind of thing held her back, but the problem was she never moved past it and found a focus and succeeded as a surgeon - she was always lagging behind her peers. I do think it would be out of character for Izzie to just be okay with what Addison did, but I'm sad that she never moved past it and became Addison's student and I think it was a waste that Rhimes never gave Izzie any sort of career-based success.

I also really did not care for or like Sadie that much, but I did think the character was interesting - it would've been very interesting to see her turn around from a spoiled, careless child to a hardworking, competent surgeon. She made a lot of mistakes, but if they make her grow from that and then share her experiences from it - I always just felt like it would've been great to watch her grow into a proper doctor.

I also never understood why they bothered having that episode where DeLuca tells Alex why he doesn't want to be a peds doctor, which is because he heard a mother crying over her child and that was too much for him to think of being a peds surgeon. I was thinking they were going to set DeLuca up to be Alex's student - it would've been a growing opportunity for both of them, I think. DeLuca's growth is straightforward - from an intern to a doctor, but also Alex, because Alex isn't known for his patience or being a great teacher, but he no longer has anything to learn from Arizona, and it would be nice to see him grow now not as a surgeon, but as a teacher. Arizona said she picked Alex because he cared, and while she may have meant that it was because Alex cared about the kids, I wondered if DeLuca's concern about that mother would've constituted as the kind of ""care"" that Arizona mentioned.

I also don't know why, at the end of S13, they introduced all these new interns, and only kept two - DeLuca, the ""prettiest"" one, and Cross, for comedy.

They also tried to push the new ""Plastics Posse"", but they're failing, and I think it was because you never actually see Jackson mentor Warren, except once. You don't see him teach Warren how to be a better doctor. It's like all they do is walk around looking cool.

I also thought Leah was wasted on Grey's. Yes, she started off extremely insufferable, childishly pursuing romance over surgery, but the thing is, she never grows from it. She never looks back and thinks that she was being immature, and tries to focus on her work. Rhimes didn't develop her at all, and it was such a waste. ""We brought her back as a new and improved doctor and Pierce's student""? First of all, what charmed her so much about Pierce that she didn't think to pick cardio when she scrubbed in with Cristina? Second of all, we saw her once, and never again. It was like she's not even there. It's a waste. The only intern whoever got any real growth as a doctor was actually Shane. Development for Brooks was being presented (Derek stating that she was too underconfident to show her true talent, hence her unusual behavior), but we all know what happened to her.

I feel like there are so many opportunities for Grey's to have pursued certain storylines that could've led into very great characters and/or dynamics between characters. I always had many gripes for what I perceived to be wasted opportunities, so I'm curious if anyone else feels like there are other wasted moments in the show."

Do I take him back?",Slip9,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6n5bj8/my_boyfriend_m22_the_one_who_helped_me_out_of_the/,"Last summer I spent a couple months backpacking Europe over the summer. During that time, at age 19, I was in the closet, never really accepting the fact that I was in fact emotionally and physically attracted to other males. I don't mean to generalize homosexuals, but I never felt like I could connect to them. I like to play physical sports, spend my time at the beach, etc. While I know other gays are like this, I felt like an anomaly. I never thought I would ever come out of the closet.

 Near the end of the trip I met another guy in a train station in Germany. We became close quickly, and both realized that we were going through the same thing. Closeted, alone, didn't feel a connection with the gay community, scared.

Since then I finished my trip and went back to school in California, where I live. He finished his internship in Germany and went back to school where he lives on the east coast. Despite the time zone difference, we relied on each other and slowly helped one another become comfortable with our sexuality. We spent our free time connecting through our phones, and finally worked up the courage to come out of the closet.

This kid meant everything to me. Half my friends left me when I told them I was gay. My immediate family, although loves and accepts me, does not look at me the same. But I didn't care. I had him and that was all I would ever need. Since meeting him we have been to multiple major american cities, his birthplace in South America, and more. We had such good times

He graduated this may. In a week he was supposed to come to my house in southern california to give me his dog for a year and then drive up to San Francisco (where his job has located him). The place he will live in doesn't allow animals and no one else can take care of the dog.

He went to visit his cousins in Boston last week before moving out to california in a week and long story short I found out he was using Tinder. A gay guy that had no mutual friends that was from boston followed him and I asked why. He said he told his cousin that he was gay and she said he was instagram famous and eye candy so he followed. I said that was a lie because no one he knows follows that guy. He changed his story and said he just randomly found him on instagram. I said that was a lie because that doesn't happen and he finally told me he got the instagram from Tinder. 

His male cousin stayed in the boston apartment as he went out with a college friend that lived in the city. When he got home that night, his male cousin was asleep and he was locked out. He called his female cousin, who was out of the city, and while complaining to her about being locked out jokingly told her ""guess i have to tinder myself a place tonight"". From my understanding, and after talking to everyone involved, he rationalized being locked out as an excuse to go on Tinder. I have reason to believe he did not do anything with anyone but he did in fact swipe, and admittedly swiped until he ran out of swipes (in a major city, must be a lot of swipes...) I am unsure of the conversations he had on tinder but I do know he didn't meet with anyone. Whether because he wasn't given the chance, didn't have enough time, or really just was windowshopping, i'm not sure...

I'm just a naive, stupid 20 year old kid that isn't sure of what love really is but I do know that I cared for him enough to never do that to him. It's not even that I care about him enough to not do that. I didn't feel the need to, I was more than content. I was in a fucking dream. I want to find someone who feels like a dream when they're with me too. Now when I look at him or think about him I don't feel the same

He's begging for my forgiveness, and I can tell he is genuine, and I can tell he thinks he loves me. He seems just as heartbroken as me. But can someone love someone and still be able to do that to them? Can you go on tinder and then give your boyfriend your dog for a year a week later and move to SF, the gay capital of America? He says its love but I don't think my love would ever do that

I don't know why I wasn't enough and while it hurts I am ok with it. I want the kid to find someone who makes him feel like he doesn't need to go on tinder. If I can't do that that's completely ok. He is the most incredible person i've met and despite his actions he deserves that. But I also think I am pretty awesome and I deserve so much love in this world. I don't think i deserve that. I know it sounds selfish but I don't want to settle for anything less than I deserve. 

I need some advice, opinions, anythings. Honestly I am scared of any answer. Scared of people telling me to give him another chance because it's not fair...he doesn't get to pull this shit and then get me back so easily. I am so good to him. But on the other hand I am so scared of people to tell me to ditch him. He changed my entire outlook on life, made me comfortable with myself, and waking up to a day without him seems fruitless. 

Maybe this post was solely to rant, and I know it's overly long filled with pointless details, but anything helps.


TLDR:: caught my boyfriend who helped me out of the closet on tinder. He was going to give me his dog for a year right after, too. I love him but do not think he truly loves me. He is begging, crying, and leaving voicemails and I don't know what to do with myself. This tldr is weak, please read the whole thing.

6n5hcm,3,2017-07-13,Mental Health Update,CaptainQuint77,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/6n5hcm/mental_health_update/,"Hello, first I wanted to thank everyone for responding over the past week. I thought I should post an update on how things are going.


I made it to my therapy appointment on Wednesday. We talked about my symptoms (insomnia, feeling hot, feeling foggy and disorientated, missing details, headaches, stomach issues, physical and mental pain, overly sensitive and easily overwhelmed by senses, isolating, not enjoying anything, headaches, exhaustion and tired mentally and physically, constant discomfort and suicidal thoughts). We determined that this is probably a medication issue because recently I was taken off one of my meds and things have been worse since that happened. While there has been a lot of behavioral issues (not being in class, stressful family trip and time off leading to unstructured time) I had returned to work and a routine and hadn’t been improving with that either. Clearly I am in worse health than I have been since my hospitalization last summer which lasted a month.

We talked about if I should be hospitalized and she thinks it could probably be a good idea. I’m worried about leaving work for an undetermined amount of time but need something to happen because I don’t know how long I will make it like this. I’m seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow and my therapist recommended that we talk about all of my symptoms and medications, possibly go back on my old medication (ability) and discuss the possibility of being hospitalized again. 

We also talked about what to do in the meantime. She said it would be a good idea to take some of my old leftover sleeping pills so that I get some sleep at night. I am going to try to wake up at the latest 9AM and try to go to bed at the same time every day. She also wants me to start logging my moods and what is going on during them. We also talked about setting small goals for me to do every day so that I feel like I am moving forward with something. Today my goal was to take the dishes out of my room and put them in the dishwasher. I feel really pathetic and ashamed that I’ve been reduced to this level where I can barely do that. I’m trying to deflect the self hate and acknowledge that I’m sick but its hard. It makes me so sad that I can barely do anything and that everything has become overwhelming and that I’m constantly in a state of distress. We also talked about my suicidal thoughts. It’s not good that I have a plan but its better that it’s more of an escape thought than a compulsion. I’m pretty much right on the line though where if it gets any worse I will have to be hospitalized. We also talked about how to find a support group for depression so that I can get some support and understanding around others like me. I also sent an email today the the social worker at the hospital where I was at last summer to get some information and to see if my new insurance would help cover or be accepted and am waiting to hear back on that. I don’t know if I can even afford to be hospitalized right now. I’m also supposed to look at my Dialectical Behavioral Therapy workbook from the hospitalization last year to try to review some of the material, the crisis survival stuff in particular. I haven’t been able to get myself to do that yet though.

I’m worried about tomorrow. Its a new psychiatrist and I’m worried I will be hospitalized against my will if I say the wrong thing. I’m also worried about what I will have to tell work if I am hospitalized and my professor who I’m supposed to be meeting with soon to come up with a plan for my fall internship with her. I’m terrified about living like this though. It feels like I’ve been feeling this way for months even though it hasn’t been that long and it feels like I’ll never feel better than this. I know logically that it will probably not always be this way but I can’t shake the feeling. I guess I’ll try to update tomorrow after my appointment but if I’m hospitalized I might not have access to the internet or my devices. I know I really need help but I’m so early overwhelmed right now that I’m scared of everything and don’t know what to do. I’m just so miserable, it’s hard to even describe how bad it is."
6n5qz0,1,2017-07-13,"My girlfriend and I are giving each other some space, where do I/we go from here?",quick201290,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/6n5qz0/my_girlfriend_and_i_are_giving_each_other_some/,"My girlfriend [21] and I [26] almost broke up Wednesday the week before last. The talk we had she said her feelings had changed, and they weren't as strong as they were before, a lot more was said in that talk, more positive than negative, but it ended with us still wanting to be together, but her saying she just wants things to be good again.

We met at uni, were friends for at least a year before starting to date in December last year, we'd see each other everyday at uni, sit with each other in classes, had the same group of friends at uni, so we've been use to having each other around as friends before eventually getting together as boyfriend and girlfriend at the end of January this year, so we've almost been together for six months.

Now before I go on I've got to say she seems very confused about her feelings and what she wants, she gets very very stressed and this stress gets to her easy, this all came up while we were doing 2 intensive learning classes at uni, and just the week before she was saying how happy I make her, that she likes being around me and that we're compatible. Before dating her, mutual friends said that she was happy being single, that she didn't want a boyfriend, but I still went there, and I was the first guy she went on a date with, kissed, and eventually called her boyfriend, everything is new to her, and for someone who doesn't really go out and socialise she doesn't have many examples of what to expect. Only since becoming her boyfriend did I find out that she has a fear of relationships, she told me that her parents were on the verge of divorce for seven years, and they only stayed together for her and her sister's sake, she said that really messed her and her sister up, not wanting to get into a relationship due to the fear of getting hurt, family is everything to her and she does most things with her sister, cousins or family as a whole, so it all adds up as to why she has these relationship fears.

There has been nothing to suggest that our relationship is in trouble, we always go out and have such a great time together, people always comment on how good we look together and how happy we look together, and just the simple things like introducing each other to our families,and the way she smiles and blushes at me.

We had another talk on Friday, last week, again it was the same sort of talk, we were pretty much going around in circles with why things aren't as good as they were, but at the same time why we're good together. She was saying things like I'm everything she could ever want in a boyfriend, I tick all the boxes, we're good for each other, we understand each other, I'm her best friend, she doesn't want to lose me, but she thinks she should have more feelings, like she did at the start, you would think that all those things she said, that's what you'd would want in a relationship, so that left me confused. She said that her emotions are going up and down, saying that when we're not together she doesn't know if these feelings can come back, but when she hears my voice, sees me, is with me she feels the complete opposite, wanting to be with me. Eventually we talked about a few things which we've never brought up before like, we've just been doing things together but not living our own separate lives as well, like going out with friends, looking after our health etc. we also brought up how we don't really communicate properly (more so her), like if I'd ask if she wanted to do something she'd sometimes hesitate, and she thought that she shouldn't be hesitating, I asked her why she's hesitated in the past, and she said it's because she's either had things that she's needed to get done, or she just needed to rest for a day, we both agreed that if she'd have just been honest with her hesitation it would've been fine, and I would've understood. One more thing that was brought, by me, was that I thought I was being clingy, even though I asked her this months ago and she said I wasn't, this time when I brought it up she agreed with me, but said I wasn't overly clingy, I told her I've realised this and have been trying to back off a bit, I told her that that was probably the biggest thing that changed her feelings, and I'd feel the same if someone was like that with me, there were obviously other deep emotional issues with her contributing to all this like her family, but I didn't explicitly say that to her.

Considering that we established I was being a bit clingy, we needed to communicate better, and we needed to get our life back on track, look after ourselves, see our friends catch up on work etc. we decided to stay together, but we needed to give each other some space, not a break, we were sure not to call it that, just some space for our own individual lives, because neither of us wanted to give up on all the good we shared.

It's been a week since giving each other space, in that time we've still snapchatted each other good morning and goodnight, as well as the occasional Facebook tag, I've been going out with friends, and putting that in my snapchat story, not sending that directly to her, but she's still viewed my story, seeing that I'm living life, and not just locked up in my room being sad. We've got an assignment due tonight which we're both naturally stressed about, as well as preparation for a 10 week internship starting next week. I really feel like the ball is in her court, but I don't want to let her know that, regardless of the outcome of our relationship, good or bad, we will need to see each other soon to talk, but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. What do I do? How long should we give each other space for? Should I contact her? Do I wait for her to contact me? Is this internship going to make things difficult? I'm lost, any advice?

TL;DR My girlfriend and I are giving each other space in hopes to make things good again, but I feel that the balls in her court on where we go from here, and I don't want her to know that, but I don't know what to do?"
6n5x83,3,2017-07-13,Thanks for Everything and Other Thoughts,Grimmore,TheCreatures,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCreatures/comments/6n5x83/thanks_for_everything_and_other_thoughts/,"Above all else right now, I want to say: Thank you.  You guys (Jordan, Dan, Seamus, James, Gassy, Aleks, Ze, Chilled, Sp00n, Sly, and even Junk) got me through a lot of times; both good and bad.  I want that to be known first and foremost with this, whether any of them actually see this or not (I hope they do).  Now for the biggest part.

I've been following the guys since Minecraft was in Alpha.  When they were just messing around in Minecraft doing their own thing, going through a custom map (Carnival of Doom will remain my favorite series), and just being funny.  When the first Creature house was announced, I was both ecstatic and saddened.  I was so happy they were going to be together, making videos, and just having a fun time.  I was also sad, that they didn't see eye to eye and see that this was a good thing.  I might have even been a little angry (at Chilled and Junk) that they didn't understand what this meant.  I feel bad I was angry at them, but it didn't really go to anything (I was still subscribed to everyone).

Things were good and fun for a while.  Then Gassy was given the axe.  That hurt a lot.  I liked Max and I wished they had tried harder to make it work, but that's the way things go sometimes.  Even after all that, the content was still good, still fun to watch.

Eventually the Office came around, and I felt the content got even better.  They streamed from time to time in the office, they played big pranks on each other, they messed around while they were recording, and it was good.  At this point, Aleks had joined the crew (after the...disagreement with the decision of letting Gassy go between Jordan, dan vs James [mostly]).  I will admit; I only knew a little about Aleks, mostly since he was friends with Sly.  I thought it was cool, though, that the Creatures sort of took him in (that might sound offensive, but I don't mean it that way honestly).  Sly would eventually leave as well, but the feelings this time was better.  It was for the better of Sly and his family and it wasn't a rough leave.

I feel like I could go on (and maybe I should) but it's almost like the cycle starts becoming repetitive; someone comes in, some people leave (Dex, Spencer, Intern Joe, Artist Joe, Stef).  Most people here probably know what has happened; bad things happened, but they seem to roll with the punches.

Some people are saying the CowChop leave proved to be their destruction.  That could be true, but I don't think it is entirely right.  I think they could have continued on for a lot longer, but circumstances somewhat prevented that.

I don't blame James and Aleks either, but there is one thing that bothers me.  They didn't agree with some of the decisions (which is fine) and took action.  I'm somewhat annoyed that they almost advertise as ""We're just dudes playing games, look at us!"", which isn't strictly wrong, but it isn't right either.  CowChop itself is a business and they can't get away or try to say they are something different.  I will also say; I did watch CowChop as well, after they left.  For a long while, I will not go into detail but I will say that now I haven't really watched them as much (I feel somewhat that their ""model"" has become very stale; Cut out the audio from one video and paste onto a different gameplay and it will pretty much be the same as the original).

My final thoughts: I want to cry.  I'm a guy who wants so badly just to cry (seeing Dan cry makes it harder) because I feel like one of my dogs was just put down.  But I want to stay strong, I hope that the guys find success where they are going (I want Jordan to keep making videos and stream, but his full time job worries me).  I want to say Thank you, for every laugh, for every tear, for every ""Brown"".  Thank you for everything.

Make and Budget.,CoolGiraffe97,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/6n6drt/recommendations_for_a_first_car_appreciated_make/,"Hi all, I've been skimming many posts here and it looks like I should be able to get some answers here.  I'm looking to buy a car next year, but I want to start my research now. I am currently a college student and through scholarships and other awards it appears I will graduate debt free so any money I am making I'm saving for a vehicle and emergency fund. If I make between 6000-8000 annually through internships and campus jobs what is a reasonable amount to spend on this car? I will likely have 18,000 saved at the time of purchase. 

I also have two other criteria I am looking for:
1. A car that will be as cheap as possible to insure for a 21 year old male in Michigan
2. An American Model. My family is extensively employed through the American auto industry so I suspect rolling in with a Toyota might not be appreciated. 
Criterion 1 is obviously more important than 2. 

This car would be used during the school year very sparingly and then during summers on a daily commute. Ideally this car would last beyond college years so i suspect plenty of driving use ahead. 
Any suggestions or recommendations would be awesome!

6n6nny,1,2017-07-13,I just want to feel happy again,canaanhowell,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6n6nny/i_just_want_to_feel_happy_again/,"Hello. I don't usually post anything but I don't know who to talk to about this. I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety about 8 months ago, but anyone who knows me would never guess it. First let me give you some background info, I am [21M] about to start my senior year of college. I've been told my whole life that I'm extremely good looking. I am athletic, having played a variety of sports growing up. I have a well paying job so I don't have to worry about money. I have an excellent GPA, and I have an internship lined up with a very prestigious company. I'm very close to my parents, and I have a girlfriend of 2 years. 

Now, having read all that, it sounds like I should be the happiest mother fucker in the world right? Well I'm not. Not even close. I know that I used to be happy (before college), but it's been so long that I don't remember what it feels like. My medication (Cymbalta) took the hopelessness out of my depression, but I'm still far from feeling normal. I started smoking weed about 3 months ago because at that point I was so sick of my life that I just wanted to run away, but I knew I had to finish college. At first it was magical, it made me feel so good. I started smoking every day. Recently that artificial happiness has run out. I decided to quit smoking about a week ago and have been tapering down my intake since then. Today is my first day without smoking, so it feels like an appropriate day to write this. I also play a lot of video games and watch Netflix because it is a good temporary escape from life. Unfortunately those things are getting old as well. I don't know what else to turn to.  I've tried pursuing Christ multiple times in my life, but each time makes me resent Christianity even more. I consider myself agnostic now. I feel so sad and lonely. I've cried myself to sleep the past few nights because I just don't know what to do. I've tried to talk to my parents and my girlfriend but they just don't understand. 

So all of that was just the depression side. Now let me tell you about my anxiety. It all started on a post-graduation vacation (of all things). I was invited to go to Florida with some guys I didn't know that well but had always liked. I thought ""free trip, why not."" Well it was one of the worst experiences of my life. After the first day I was homesick. These guys were wanting to party all night and I just wanted to sleep. Of course when I told them that they just made light of what I was saying, jokingly calling me a pussy and what not. It was this time in my life that I first got familiar with alcohol. I realized I was gonna be stuck with these guys for another week, so I decided I would just stay drunk the whole trip. (We were 18 but it wasn't hard to find alcohol). This helped my get through the vacation, but I still cried in bed every night. I was never the same afterwards. Moving into my dorm to start my first year of college was a nightmare. I was an anxious mess, crying every day. Eventually I became familiar enough with my environment that i wasn't such a mess, but I was still having a great deal of anxiety. I was then prescribed xanax for my ""anxiety attacks"" as they became known. Fortunately the medicine helped a lot, so much that just knowing that I COULD take it if I needed to made me feel better. After that the anxiety was a lot less frequent. However, today I still can't go anywhere with large groups of people unless I'm driving separately and have the option to leave at any moment. My idea of hell is being stuck with people that I'm not comfortable with and am unable to leave. 

All of this has given me a very cynical view on life. I can't help but feel like it's all just a sick joke, like if there is a god he is just sitting up there laughing at us. ""Look at these dumb mother fuckers, all trying to find something that doesn't actually exist: happiness.""  

I guess my main goal in posting this is to just hear if anyone else has experienced something similar. I would love to hear your advice as well, as long as it's not related to Christianity. (I live in the south and have heard enough of that). 

Thank you for reading this far.

6n7nbp,4,2017-07-14,I (21F) keep receiving threatening messages from my ex-housemate (21M) of 3 years after a blowup involving a potential subleaser. [non-romantic],exhousematethrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6n7nbp/i_21f_keep_receiving_threatening_messages_from_my/,"Hello everyone! I’ve had a really rough past month and I could use some advice regarding a tricky ex-housemate situation. It’s really long, so I apologize. I suppose I just really need a space to vent. 


TL;DR-- I found a subleaser for my room and all of my housemates liked him. One roommate was gone when the subleaser toured the apartment and wanted to meet him before he moved in. However, she would not answer my texts/calls and refused to meet me halfway. I gave her a firm deadline to meet/talk with him and give me a response and she failed to come through. I elected to give the guy the room, and housemate’s boyfriend did a complete 180 and flew off the handle. I am still receiving abusive messages from him almost a month later, despite moving away and blocking them. 



The people involved are me (21F), my ex-roommate C (21F), my ex-housemate K (22F), and K’s boyfriend/my ex-housemate D (21M). Here goes:


I just graduated college about a month ago, and the weeks leading up to it were absolute chaos. I advertised everywhere for a month and a half trying to find a subleaser for my shared room, as I was leaving to start an intensive graduate program two days (!) after graduation and didn’t want to lose money over the summer. I had no help from my own roommate during this process, and absolutely no help from the rest of my apartment. I was working three jobs and an internship on top of being a full-time student and getting my things packed up to move. Needless to say, I was incredibly stressed, and was really hoping I wouldn’t lose out on over two months’ worth of rent for the summer. When I finally got a response from a subleaser who was interested, I was thrilled and asked him to come tour the apartment and meet the rest of my housemates.


My roommate C and housemate D and I met the subleaser and we all agreed he was an awesome guy who we would all have been comfortable living with. He was a friendly, straightforward person who seemed to have his act together and got along with everybody. D said that he wanted to sign him on the spot, but his girlfriend K was unsure because she had gone home for the weekend and wanted to meet him first. Our two other housemates (who would both be staying in the apartment for roughly half of the summer) were fine living with this guy and they didn’t even bother coming downstairs to meet him. They told us that they trusted our opinion and would be okay with whoever we decided on. 


The subleaser was a nice, somewhat older (early 30s) guy who was working out on the Air Force base nearby. His rent would be covered by the military, and he was going to be a full-time student for the entire two-month summer period. For the first portion of the summer, he would even be gone from 7 AM to midnight for his job. He was basically using this apartment as a crashpad between school and his job so he wouldn’t have to commute. It seemed like an ideal situation. 


K wanted to get the chance to meet him before he moved in, because she was not present when he came to tour the apartment. This was understandable-- I would have wanted to do the same thing if possible. However, the subleaser wanted to lock down a place that week so that he could be all settled before summer session classes began. He was nice enough to wait a couple of extra days, but he clearly wanted to get things set up as soon as possible. K had gone home to visit a sick grandmother and wasn’t going to be back until right before the guy wanted to move in. I personally dealt with two dying relatives recently, so I understand that okaying a subleaser isn’t necessarily your top priority when you’re trying to visit with family. I tried to be as sensitive as possible, but I really needed an answer. 


I gave K every chance I possibly could to get to know this subleaser, but she was totally unwilling to meet me halfway. I tried my best not to pester her, but she never texted me back and never picked up any of my calls. The subleaser was willing to set up a skype conference so that they could meet, but when I finally got a text from K, she told me that she “didn’t have the time” because she was “spending the day with her mom” instead of returning to the apartment at the time she told us she would be back. I sent her the subleaser’s phone number and asked her to just send him a text to establish contact, but I received no response. I tried so so hard to meet her halfway, but she was completely unwilling to compromise. The guy was about to bail, and I felt that it was a little bit... rude? that K was tying the entire process up because she wasn’t willing to make a phone call. 


So basically what this whole problem boils down to was the fact that K insisted that she meet this person, but wasn’t taking any action towards doing so while I was bending over backwards to accommodate her. I was incredibly frustrated. 


K was concerned because this would be a stranger, and she would be living with him for part of the summer. As a young college-age female, I get that apprehension. I really do. But I would have okayed any subleaser for her in a heartbeat-- in fact, I DID do the same for her this past year. I was away for the summer and they found a tenant to take over the year-long lease, but since I was not able to come up and meet her, I trusted my housemates’ opinion and gave them the go-ahead because it would be rude to hold up the process (and potentially increase everyone’s rent if she bailed) for my personal comfort. I blindly agreed to living with this girl, and she ended up being a complete nightmare. I said yes to this tenant for the overall happiness of K and our whole unit, because I recognized that it would be selfish of me not to. I recognize that this isn’t exactly the same thing, as this was a female tenant, but I had to endure this girl for an entire year. I was angry that I was willing to agree to any subleaser for the sake of my friends, regardless of the subleaser’s gender or whether I had met them or not, but K was unwilling to do the same.


And it’s not as if K would be completely alone in the apartment with this subleaser-- the other two girls who live with us would be in and out, because one lives less than an hour away. The other was going to stick around for the entire second part of the summer. K’s boyfriend was also staying in the apartment all summer, but he was thinking of taking summer courses. Literally the only times K would potentially be alone in the apartment with this subleaser would be when D was in class, which he rarely ever attended anyway, and if the subleaser happened to have work off that day. The subleaser was taking a full class schedule on top of working, so there was really not going to be any overlap in when he was going to be home with only K. Additionally, K lives downstairs with her own room and bathroom, while the subleaser would be upstairs with his own room. 


I would have hoped that K would have trusted our collective decision, seeing as she has been friends with us since the beginning of college. At the very least, I would have hoped that she would have trusted her boyfriend’s opinion on the new subleaser, since she was unable to get back to us with her thoughts.



So I was completely stuck. I talked with my parents, friends, and coworkers, trying to decide how to proceed. I scoured other reddit posts trying to find similar situations. They all said the same thing-- if the majority had agreed on a subleaser and K was not communicating her feelings, I should give this guy the go-ahead. I gave her plenty of time and a hard deadline to respond by. I asked my roommate C’s opinion as well every single step of the way, and she had my back the entire time. I was trying to be sensitive to K’s needs, but because she was not responding and the situation was time-sensitive, my hands were tied. I told K she had until noon the following day to give me her decision or I would add the subleaser to the lease. If she talked with the subleaser and determined that he would not be a good housemate, I would tell him to look elsewhere. But I at least needed a response. 


I communicated this decision to D, and was immediately met with cruel, threatening texts that came out of absolutely nowhere. I was shocked. He hurled all sorts of abusive messages at me, telling me I would “sacrifice my friend’s well-being for a guy with a fucking checkbook” and many more deeply hurtful things. I was out with family at that moment and couldn’t believe what I was reading. I had to have my mom drive back to my house to help me deal with the issue because I was a complete emotional wreck. It was embarrassing, having to ask my mom help me deal with my problems, but I was legitimately scared to go back into my house alone when D was saying such terrible things to me. 


My mom logically laid out what she had heard about both sides and tried to help us come to an agreement, but D immediately did a complete 180 and put on a macho-man act about “protecting his girlfriend”. I was so confused, because just a few days before he had been excited about living with this subleaser and sharing video games and such with him-- he had been wanting to sign him on the spot!! But all of a sudden, he had completely backtracked and started talking about how his girlfriend could be attacked. He was spouting off all of these completely garbage reasons as to why he all of a sudden didn’t like this guy, while C stayed silent and totally didn’t come to my defense at all. D was grasping at straws, trying to come up with anything he could think of even though he knew he was being irrational. He said to my mom, “would you want your daughter living with a strange guy you didn’t know?” My mom then pointed out the fact that that was something that had already happened-- she explained how she’d had absolutely no idea who D was when I moved in with him, and for all she knew, he could have been some dangerous criminal who was only moving in to attack her daughter. That shut him up, thankfully, but I was so upset that I stormed out of the house and told the subleaser that I had was sorry for wasting his time and that he should start looking for another place.


I kept receiving abusive messages from D, so I blocked my housemates on all platforms and tried to enjoy time with my family. Thankfully, I had spent the week prior packing up all of my stuff so I didn’t have to return to the apartment. I got on the plane the day after graduation, accepting that I was out in terms of the rent money and hoping that I could just leave everything behind me. 


But then this past week, almost a month after the blowout, I received another nasty message from D. It turns out C had finally picked up the slack and found a subleaser, because she decided she didn’t want to lose any more of her money and recognized that I was no longer willing to deal with the issue. The person wanted to pay cash up front, so C asked D to send me my half of the check because she was not there to deal with the new subleaser. I’m assuming she gave D my email address, because I received another abusive message. The subject line was “count all your friends on one finger”, etc. etc.... you get the picture. They wanted me to give them my new address so the subleaser could send me my share of the money. The email contained more horrible, horrible things. I had my boyfriend help me block his emails, but the damage was done. I burst into tears and had my boyfriend call C and told her that D needed to send her the money and she could Venmo me, because I was not at all comfortable with giving him my address. I just know that if he were to find out where I lived, he would only have another way to send me nasty, threatening messages.


I have been nothing but kind to these people over the past four years-- I have stayed up countless nights proofreading their papers, cleaning their messes, giving them rides, offering emotional support… I got them jobs, wrote essays for them, the list goes on and on. Hell, I can’t even count how many assignments I completed for D over the years because he was too lazy to do his own work and had to meet a deadline. I was nothing but supportive and compassionate towards these people, and they suddenly responded with horrible, vicious attacks over a disagreement about a subleaser. I was a doormat to them for so long and was not prepared for them to turn on me so quickly when I finally made a decision for myself.


This latest message came a month after the whole situation had exploded. His words play over in my head every day, and I just feel so defeated that I don’t know what to do any more. Every single part of me wants to send him a long, angry letter detailing just how much I despise him for how he's treated me. I want him to be hurt. I want him to know how upset I am. However, I know that this is my anger taking over and this wouldn’t be constructive. It would only serve to make me feel better. 


I dealt with this the best I could, and I cannot see anything that I could have possibly done any differently. I wasn’t getting any response from K and was forced to make a decision. I believe that anyone else in my position would have probably done the same thing. I’m really not sure what I have done to receive all of these cruel messages, and I’m so so frustrated that they would throw four years of friendship in the garbage because of a lack of communication on their part. The fact that they tracked me down to hurl more abuse at me really hurt, and I’m terrified that they’re going to find another way to contact me after I’ve gone through such lengths to remove them from my life. What should I do? Should I send them a letter telling them my thoughts? Part of me wants to explain my actions and call them out for being so unreasonable and shitty. I want them to know that what they did was not okay, and that they had no right to treat me this way. Another part of me just wants acknowledgement that I made the right decisions-- what else could I have done in this situation? How do I move on from this?


Please, I could really use an outside opinion on this because I have been playing it over and over again in my head for weeks. Thank you again for taking the time to read my post.

6n8n9v,12,2017-07-14,"Boss is being harsh/dismissive about my pregnancy migraines - halp! Also, question about Fioricet.",PNittleBrittle,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/6n8n9v/boss_is_being_harshdismissive_about_my_pregnancy/,"I am a nanny for 15mo twin boys, been with them since birth. Boss lady is an attending physician in the PICU of a very prominent hospital, and is very Type A, serious, particular about absolutely everything, needs things done exactly her way, overprotective, you get the idea. So far we've gotten along really well, as I am also very particular and respect that she needs things done ""just so"" (for example, even at 15 months I still write down the time and content of every single meal and snack on spreadsheets she made and keeps on the kitchen counter). 

The day I told her I was pregnant, in a rare show of emotion, she cried. She said she didn't know what they were going to do without me, and the thought of hiring someone else was daunting. I understand that, and as her husband's family is out of state and her parents live over an hour away, I am the ONLY person who can take care of the boys properly. Her parents will drive in if necessary, but they need a lot of direction and specific instructions from boss lady (I think they're terrified they're going to do something ""wrong"" - not to her specifications - and I don't blame them).

That said, in my 15 months of employment, I have called out ONCE, when I got a stomach bug and was uncontrollably vomiting. I know her schedule isn't negotiable, and when she's required to be at the hospital, there's no wiggle room or alternative; she has to be there, and I have to be at the house with the boys, because like I said, no one else can / is allowed to care for them.

So here's the rub: I'm 14w and have been getting sporadic, hideous migraines. At my 12w appointment my OB Rx'd me Fioricet. Wanting to be up front about it all, I told boss lady that I was getting really bad migraines that I couldn't control, but that the doc gave me meds that hopefully will help. Her tone instantly changed from friend / mama of twins to attending physician speaking to an intern. 

She said things like, ""I think you are not being honest with me, or yourself, when you are not in a position to work. Would you drive your car here under the influence of Fioricet and work like that?"" She made it clear that she isn't comfortable with me being around her boys 1) with a migraine, or 2) under the ""influence"" of Fioricet. I'm not sure what to do, because the alternative is me not showing up at all, and there is no one else to care for her kids, and she can't not go to work. 

Yesterday I felt a migraine coming on, and in trying to be as transparent as possible I told her that I could feel it and I was worried about working today. I apologized profusely and said I wish I could control them, but if she doesn't want me to take the meds around the boys, or work with a migraine, then I guess I can't work tomorrow. Trying to be self-deprecating and lighten the mood, at the end I said, ""I guess I know why pregnant women got fired for decades"", to which she replied ""I think they just quit their jobs.""

...so I'm supposed to quit? And then who would take care of her boys? I don't know if this is just stress on her part, or frustration over dealing with a symptom of something she so badly didn't want to happen (me to get pregnant), or if she's internally rolling her eyes because she had an easy, uneventful, symptom free pregnancy with the boys, and I clearly can't handle being pregnant with one. 

Do you ladies have any advice on how to handle this? I feel like I'm backed into a corner, and other than pretending like I don't have a migraine and everything is fine, or taking the meds secretly and going to work anyways, I don't know what to do. This is the SECOND DAY I haven't worked in 15 months. I feel like my previous friendship with her is effectively ruined, because she's upset I got pregnant and will need to replace me, and she isn't giving me any outs on dealing with the migraines. 


END RANT


Follow up question: Bumpers who take Fioricet - how many doses does it take to work for you? Yesterday I took doses every four hours at 9a, 1p, 5p and 9p and OH MY GOD IT HURT SO BAD, the meds didn't do anything. I did wake up this morning feeling better (but not 100% better). How does it work for y'all?

I started at a firm this summer and I got my first review back.....and it was....okay? I exceeded in the 'asked for feedback' area, met in most, but got below in the 'did good work' category. I think it was a little harsh though, reading the categories I really think I exceeded in many areas. 

Basically I made a bunch of math typos while testing contributions to a benefit plan. They were corrected really quickly, and we actually finished the plan with time to spare, but I know I could have been more efficient. I honestly just think I was going too fast and not paying enough attention. 

The senior said I was a little below intern expectations in that front, which I'm worried about because a feel like intern expectations aren't that high in the first place.

Should I be worried? An offer at the end of the summer would make my life much easier...... "

Aguilar Passes Critical Amendment to Allow Dreamers Access to Federal Employment

Last night in the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Pete Aguilar passed a critical amendment that was added to the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee appropriations bill, which would allow Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, also called Dreamers, to be eligible for federal employment.

“These young men and women identify as Americans, living in the only country they have ever called home. Denying Dreamers the opportunity to serve their community and country through public service stands in stark contrast to our nation’s core values,” said Rep. Aguilar. He continued, “Expanding the pool of applicants for our federal workforce will ensure we can get the best and brightest applicants, whoever they may be. This amendment makes a commonsense change to give Dreamers the opportunities they deserve and our nation the workforce it needs.”

“DACA recipients are going to school, preparing for careers, and contributing to their communities,” said Appropriations Ranking Member Nita Lowey. “Yet because of something they had no control over – their parents’ entry into the United States – they are deemed ineligible to serve their country through federal employment. I am extremely proud Rep. Aguilar’s amendment correcting this grievous wrong passed in the Appropriations Committee, and we will work together to defend the amendment as the process moves forward.”

Currently, DACA recipients must use third-party organizations or fellowship programs to access federal internships or employment. Rep. Aguilar has been a fierce advocate for the immigrant community and is a stalwart supporter of comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Rep. Aguilar’s amendment passed unanimously by voice vote and was added to the Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee appropriations bill, which will be considered by the full House of Representatives. Rep. Aguilar’s amendment can be read in full here.

TL:DR jordan fucked up﻿"

within the past year, i've had my confidence shaken. i transferred to a four year university from a community college and feel so behind in terms of what i should know.  there are very few women in my major, and most of them hate other women because they're so focused on being ""one of the guys"" or are viciously competing to hold the ""token girl"" role.  the men either try and hit on the women in this major, hate them vehemently, or are too awkward to interact with.

i had to quit my job at the tech retailer after working there since i was sixteen because one of my bosses was sexually harassing and touching me.  this stemmed from me being transferred into the retailer's tech support department and him making inappropriate comments about how 'good' my new uniform looked.  i was ostracized and harassed by other employees after the manager was fired as a result of me reporting him to HR.  

this summer, i started my first tech-related internship at a startup and after helping the owner find more interns, i then was forced into the role of ""secretary"" instead of learning what i was told i would during my interview and first few weeks.  i had private discussions with the owner multiple times about my desire to learn other things, but he was disinterested and kept me in a clerical role rather than letting me work with the interns i helped him hire (who were all guys...go figure).

i'm just starting to hate being a woman in tech. i hate being a 'special unicorn', i hate being treated like i'm an idiot, i hate having these stereotypical roles pushed onto me. i never get any credit for what i DO know because of my race (people love to point out that i'm both asian AND in the tech field). it's just so mentally exhausting, but at this point i'm going into my senior year and it's too late to change my mind as to what i want to do now.  

i feel like i'm having a quarter life crisis and have no one to talk to about it."

Heyo, simulators of the world! Wow. That's all I gotta say. Just, wow. I got a *bunch* of applications for this season. I mean, I had some applications left over from last season too, some of which I used for this season instead. So, thanks to everyone for applying to my series! I'm glad I have so much interest :D But yea, I had so many applications for this season, that I decided instead of making it a half-user-submitted characters and half my characters, that for this season I'd make it two-thirds characters submitted by you guys, and 1/3 characters created by me, just so I could fit in more characters! **That being said, if your character didn't make it into this season, or a character you submitted for season one still didn't make it into this season, don't worry! They are still in the consideration pool for season three, and will be along with the season three applicants.**

So, 'nuff about that stuff! Let's get into the part you guys were all anxious and waiting for--the season! This season, we have twelve players--all newbies, of course--and this time, the Power of Veto competition is in play! Which means that players have more chances to save themselves, and I also have more segments to write per week in the game! Yay! :D

So yea, [the season is right here]( http://brantsteele.net/bigbrother/03/r.php?c=laheLg62) (the first page is broken, just don't mind it, it fixes itself after that) and [the write-up for the season is right here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zIHVD_5Unsh7zPeRHjWQqNUQcgfcqhYgkamery07aY0/edit?usp=sharing) Otherwise, the player bios are down below if you wanna read up on those!

If I'm lucky, these people will be so passive and stupid that I'll get away with it in the first few weeks. If not, then at least I'll be going out with a bang and at least contributing something to the game, which I'm sure is more than what some people will be able to say once this season is over.""

It was always really fun to watch, and I was curious how I would do at something like that myself? So, I applied for this show, and I managed to get on! My strategy is to just find other fans like me and hope to get far with them by using our geekiness to outsmart the others. I also plan to win a few competitions to get some respect in the house, as I know people will just see me as some dumb and immature kid, but I think I should be treated as more of an adult, because legally, I am one! So, yea, gosh, can't wait to play this game. Can we start yet?""

""Hey, I'm Jon, and I'm a 42 year old accountant from Boston. Despite what people may think from first impressions, I'm not a namby-pamby numbers guy that's had an easy ride in life. I've had to battle my way to the top from harsh beginnings on the wrong side of the tracks and I plan to use that mindset to win the game and the $500,000. I'm more than willing to be the villain and I have no hesitation to cut someone's throat to benefit myself because to be honest, outside of my immediate family I have no loyalties to anybody except myself. My strategy is to play it off like the nice paternal figure in order to get people to drop their guard and then strike when the time is right. Beyond that, I can emphasize that I'm a free agent with no fixed loyalties that an alliance can use as a number, after which I can look for cracks and worm my way into the inner circle of an alliance. I think my greatest asset in this game will be my intelligence, both intellectually and street smarts, because I can think 5 moves ahead of anyone else. As for my liabilities, I definitely have to work on my social game as I go along, because jury management is important. To the other contestants, there's only one thing I have to say to them: just bring it.""

""Hello everyone! My name is Juliet, and I'm a happily married woman who teaches kids social studies for a living. No children...yet. I'm personally not quite ready for them, although my husband has expressed interest in a child. Tyson, if you're watching this, the answer is still soon, by the way! Anyways, I'm a girl who just enjoys the little things in life. I enjoy hearing little tidbits of information from people's lives, I like those quirky little moments that people have, and I love just living in the moment and taking in everything and being grateful for it. Coming into a game like this, I just want to take in as much as I can from the experience. Whether that be money, friendships, or just growing as a person from meeting new people and going through a situation like this, I want to come out of this game with something. And I'll make sure to take in every moment I'm in the game to ensure that I do come out of this game with something. I hope you enjoy watching me in this game! Oh, and Tyson, honey, please make sure not to leave the oven on after you're done cooking. You remember what happened last time! We don't need more shirts catching on fire!""

IT'S BECAUSE I CAN CRACK SKULLS OPEN IN MERE SECONDS! AHAHA! No, for real though, this one time I was out hunting with my friends and we took those photos where, like, we step on the deer we just killed right? So I step on the head of the deer I just shot dead, and I end up literally cracking and crushing its skull! With just my foot!! Since then, my friends have always called me Cracker as a nickname. So! This game!! I am so pumped to play in it, man, I just really hope to find people who are also willing to rock this house and just have fun and be loud and big and unafraid to do so! My strategy is to be the party animal that people get along with, and if need be, to use my HUGE MUSCULAR BODY to win some competitions every once in a while. Or maybe just to show off, haha!

""Before I say anything else, I want to make it clear that this definitely is not my first time doing something like this. Apparently there are a few dozen of these shitty Big Brother wannabe sideshows, and I've played in a different one known as Drama House. I played in there twice, could've been three times if my weak-ass team won that opening challenge in season eleven, and made it to the finale both times, so I know what I'm fucking doing coming into this game. However, I don't need anyone else knowing that. I'm assuming no one else in this house knows who I am, so I'm going to use that to my advantage in order to try and hide my villainous nature and gameplay early on. As for all the shitbags I'm going to have to deal with in this game, I'll stay nice with them until they give me a reason to play rough. Although, I must admit, it will be difficult to hold my sassy and negative nature in. It *could* slip, who knows. Honestly, don't think it'll matter if it slips or not. I'm a god damn strategic mastermind that's made it to the end in a game like this twice before, won one of those times, and I'll go on to win once again, this time in a different series. #BowDownToLars.""

I don't want to have friendships, I don't care if I leave with a good or bad reputation, I don't even care if people think I float to the end. As long as I get to the end, and at least get the runner-up prize money--preferably the grand prize, but I'll settle for any amount--then I don't care what else goes on with me or the other people in this game. I'm willing to be the 'sexy librarian' and flirt with other people if I have to, and I'm willing to lay low and go with the flow if I have to. Whatever I need to do to sway people, I'll do it. However, I also won't be afraid to let people know how I feel about them, and if someone asks me something I'll answer them honestly. Sometimes it may be brutal, but the truth is what it is, and if you can't handle it then you can continue living behind your lies for all I care. Alright, I'm done with my interview. Can I get back to napping? I need my sleep before I get in the game and have my ears blown off by eleven other people constantly talking to me.""

6ncfnt,2,2017-07-14,I Hate Myself,IAmTired_throwaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6ncfnt/i_hate_myself/,"I really shouldn't.
Growing up I had a loving family and have always been well provided for. The opportunities before me are bountiful. I am training for a well respected profession and am quite skilled at it. I have made myself into a very talented individual: I am an adept cook, possessing the ability making any number of dishes large and small in scale, I have a conversational understanding of 2 languages besides English, I am capable of playing 2 instruments well, I am knowledgeable in many subject areas, capable of holding conversation in any thing from history to politics, film, art, sports, television, literature, poetry, and several other topics.
Physically I am rather good at snowboarding, archery, swimming, and racquetball. I am well versed in multiple types of dance including tango and waltz. I also do my best to be the hardest worker I know and more often than not I am.

I try to be a positive person: friendly, welcoming, well measured. I try to speak softly and put thought into everything I say. I hold no serious vices: I occasionally partake in a cigar or a cigarette if I really need to calm myself, I drink only lightly and in social occasions but never enough to cloud my judgement, I don't gamble and try my hardest to avoid being dishonest. When I'm in a group I can hold my own well enough, I can be happy and a part of the action.
These are all things I am proud to say about myself. What follows is the reason I hate myself.

Despite doing everything I can to make myself a better person I can't help but hate myself for my shortcomings.
The thing is I'm not an attractive man. I'm overweight despite multiple attempts to get in shape. I can never hold the lifestyle change for more than 6 months it seems. I try hiding this behind being well groomed and dressed but it doesn't hide it from myself and that thought infects all the others. At 24 I can count on one hand the number of dates I've been on in my life; with one kiss in an embarrassing high school situation being one of the many memories of shame that keep me up at night. My trip to second base only exists because of way too many to drink at a strip club for my cousin's bachelor party; the result is me being thrown out of said club: This among all others brings the most shame to me. It doesn't help that my brother who was there likes to share the story with all my friends and mock me with it any chance he gets.

In high school while so many of my peers got their copy of ""What to do after you like someone"" mine got lost in the mail. I ran away from interaction, retreating to positions of responsibility to ensure things got done. In high school as president of the Student Council I was directly responsible for just about every social function at our small school, and I never once allowed myself to partake in these activities, instead using my ""job"" to hide. Conversation became less and less easy for me after high school. I didn't go straight to college, instead focused on earning money. One of the few dates I had happened with a coworker but that didn't turn into anything and I became more withdrawn. Each job I held I found myself conversing with coworkers since it was necessary and the more we were together the easier I found it to open up. But it didn't happen often, it required a great deal of time before I felt comfortable around each new group of people.
Once I found my true calling I went to college. I was only a few years older than many of my peers at this point but it proved a challenge to build anything but acquaintances. I was never active on social media so the sharing of everyone's lives I was absent for. Throughout college I clung to my strong friendships from high school, thanks to the power of internet gaming. I spent far too much time a recluse, only connecting via the web rather than socializing in real life.

During my final year of college I had a wonderful internship opportunity and as a result found myself rooming with a wonderful person from college. Well it is hard not to become attracted to someone when you live with them for 4 months, especially when you are like myself and have never had a meaningful relationship with anyone. The relationship wouldn't have worked out for a multitude of reasons, not completely being my own failure at human interaction. But were those external factors not present that still wouldn't change the fact that I don't have the capability

Part of why I think my life still feels so empty is I don't accomplish hardly anything for myself. Almost everything I do is to make up for the fact that I hate my outward self so much that I want to make my inner self attractive. In my attempt to be well mannered I'm afraid I come of as stoic, uninteresting, and weird. I am not a funny guy, I don't make people laugh. But it also doesn't matter since I can hardly share myself with anyone, women especially but not exclusively. With my failings as a social animal leaving me lonely new memories hardly get made to replace the old.
When I am alone late at night with nothing but my thoughts to keep me company feelings of shame at past actions taken, regret at roads not traveled, and anger at my inability to fix these things fill my head an make it difficult to ever sleep. Times where the feelings are fresh or coming to a head, where I feel primarily anger at myself, and a whole host of emotions, make me more tired than ever and that's when I need to chase thoughts out of my head that would destroy me. I am tired because I spend so much time running. I am tired because I don't sleep.

I have tried prayer and meditation, but the one thing that feels better than anything else is crying myself to sleep. And I hate it but I don't know what else to do.

Our fathers are best friends, and run a law firm together. As a result we spent a fair amount of together while growing up. We were never best friends, but we got along well enough and enjoyed each others company.*

*However, for years I've wanted you. You're four years older than me, when you were fifteen and I was eleven you joined your high schools cheer squad, your uniform fit your body perfectly, and the sight of you in it practically jump started puberty for me. And as we got older you only got hotter and my lust for you grew. When I was thirteen and you were seventeen our families went on a joint vacation to the Caribbean, while we were there you and I took a picture together on the beach. I kept a copy of that photo in my room, and would often jerk off to it. Your body was so perfect, especially in the bikini you wore that day.*

*I never acted on my desires, fearing that you'd reject me or that it would make things weird given how often we saw one another, but by the time you left for college I could barely keep myself from getting hard whenever I was around you.*

*After you left, my lust died a little bit, you were still without a doubt the hottest women I'd ever seen. I still wanted you, and I still used that photo when horny, but I wasn't as filled with desire for you. I'd even dated and fucked one of the girls who had joined the cheer squad your senior year. But each time you came home, I noticed you become even hotter.*

*This past year I started as a Freshman at the college you attended. You were doing an extra semester and my parents had asked you to show me around and watch out for me while you were still at school. As a result we ended up spending more time together in a few months than we had since you left for school.*

*It drove me mad! You had spent all summer at an internship for a company you wanted to work for. I hadn't seen you since the previous Christmas, and since then you'd somehow gotten so much better looking. The lust I'd had for you in my early teens returned tenfold, but I still didn't act on it. You were fucking perfect, and I couldn't imagine confronting you with my desire.*

*You found out though. For Christmas this year, your parents decided to go on a second honeymoon. As a result you were staying with my family through the holiday. I tried not to, I didn't want to risk it with you sleeping down the hall, but I broke. Earlier that day I had walked in on you changing, you were only wearing a bra and panties, and I couldn't get the picture out of my head. That night, when I thought everyone had gone to bed I jerked off to that picture in my head. Moaning your name under my breath, almost grunting it.*

*You caught me. You'd left your phone charger in my room and came to get it, and instead you found me, half naked, hard cock in my hand, moaning your name. Before I could react you had stripped down and mounted me. We didn't fuck long, I had already been close when you barged in. But it was the greatest pleasure I'd ever felt. You seemed to have enjoyed it as well. Before you went back to your room you told me* *""Just let me know if you want to do that again."" *

*It's been a week since then and I haven't taken you up n your offer, fearing that it was some kind of joke on your part. Meanwhile you've grown impatient, and have decided that if I won't make the first move, you will.*

In this Roleplay, I want you to seduce me. How you do it is up to you. Maybe you just tease me until I snap and pin you to the ground. Maybe you still have your high school cheer uniform and decided to fulfill my earliest fantasy. However you do it, I want to be teased and seduced by you. Don't worry, you won't be in charge the whole time. Once you break me down, I'll be much more aggressive. ;)

Kinks: Being seduced, teasing, semi-rough sex, spanking(giving, not receiving). Breastplay, anal, oral, and cumplay.

Turn offs/Will not do: Toilet play, incest, rimming.

6nd8bw,342,2017-07-14,He followed me in broad daylight,jokesonme63,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/6nd8bw/he_followed_me_in_broad_daylight/,"I decided to stay in my college city between my junior and senior year to intern, and wait tables to help save money. I would intern Monday - Friday from 7-2, and then wait tables from 4-10. My internship was only a mile from my apartment so I would walk there, and then get a ride with a coworker to my waiting job.


But I will never forget the day that I was followed.


It started out like any other day. I woke up early and walked to my internship which only took about 20 minutes. The day seemed to be dragging and when it hit 2 I was excited to head home and eat lunch. I thought I would have just enough time for a quick nap before heading to the country club. I grabbed my things, and headed outside. Traffic was pretty steady and I was waiting to cross the one way street when I saw a dark green car, with peeling paint and dirty windows. Finally a break in the cars opened up and I jogged across the street. I walked one block and saw the dark green car coming my way, which was weird because this was another one way street going in the opposite direction, which meant that this car pulled a u-turn essentially. I knew I had just seen this car a minute ago.


That's when the guy pulled off to the side of the road right in front of me, and got out of his car while I was crossing this street. He walked in a wide semi-circle so that now I was in between him and his car, and he began bombarding me with questions. 


""How's your day? It's pretty warm outside, isn't it? Did you braid your hair yourself? Where are you going?""


The hair started standing on the back of my neck and my heart was racing. Something just felt off. I'm a small women and I'm pretty used to having men ask me questions and harass me while I walk the street, but this was different. He was closing in on me, and he wasn't giving me any time to process his questions or allowing for any break between them. He had his hand out to shake, and I *still* don't know why to this day that I went to shake his hand. I didn't consciously shake his hand, and it wasn't until my small hand was in his large hand that I realized what was happening.


""I like your shirt! It's really pretty. It looks good on you.""


Uhh, thanks.


""Where are you heading?""


At this point he had let go of my hand. But he had been continuously walking towards me, and I was walking backwards in the middle of the street. I was always positioned between him and his car. My heart was pounding out of my chest and I knew I had to get out of there. I said, ""I'm sorry, I have to go."" and managed to get fully across the street and onto the sidewalk. I was still looking at him though, and walking backwards.


""You're a waitress, right? At the country club up the road?""


I panicked. I wasn't in my uniform for the country club, and I was 100% positive that he wasn't a member there. I thought maybe he knew me from my old job working at a sports bar, but I'm pretty good with faces and I would have remembered him. He was about 6'4"" with dark hair, and had thick rimmed glasses. I would have remembered his face. There couldn't have been any way he knew that I worked as a waitress at the country club, and I doubt that my old bosses would have mentioned it to him if he DID know me from my old gig.


""I'm sorry, I really have to go.""


I turned around and began fast paced walking/jogging as fast as I could. I usually took the scenic route home through the old ""neighborhoods"" in the city, but I decided to change it up and take the busiest street I could think of near me. I turned around when I was about half a block down and saw that he was getting into his car.


I called my boyfriend at the time to try and calm down, but he was in a work meeting and couldn't answer. I texted him about the guy, and I was terrified. I turned right to head to the street that had a playground and a popular restaurant knowing that I would pass tons of families and people out for a late lunch. I couldn't relax though.


I finally reached the busy street and had to wait for a break in traffic to cross the street again. Luckily I was right and there were people everywhere, tons of cars driving by, families at the playground, and people enjoying the weather. 


I started to relax and look around, trying to convince myself that he must have met me at the sports bar. That's when I saw the dark green car a block away, driving at a snails pace. He was staring right at me and he had a disgusting smile on his face. We locked eyes for a moment, and he sped off.


By this point I was only a couple of blocks away from my apartment, and I ran. When I finally got into my apartment I had a panic attack and started crying. My sister's boyfriend was home and I told him what happened. My hands were shaking and I couldn't breathe. I was paranoid that the guy had followed me home. And then I thought if he knew that I was waitressing at the country club, what if he knew where I lived already? I couldn't calm down, and I didn't sleep soundly for a few weeks after. 


I didn't see him again while living in that city, and I hope to never meet him again. The only regret I have is not reporting it to non-emergency police, but I figured telling them that I was creeped out wasn't a good enough reason to alert them. I wish I had.

-----

TRUE: There is a stretch of the I-4 Highway in Florida known as The Dead Zone. It allegedly sits upon a grave where four German immigrants were buried in the 19th century. It is rumored to be haunted. It has a high number of car-accidents each year. And it has a significantly higher percentage of deaths-to-accidents than other parts of the highway.

-----

CHAPTER 1 : Invisible Girl

-----

The girl with blue eyes was drinking a Coke in the hallway at my middle school, Florida Cedar Middle School, when I bumped into her.

""Sorry,"" I said.

""Wait,"" she said. ""What did you say?""

""What?""

She had started walking backwards right in front of me. She pulled her dark hair over her shoulder, and she squinted at me with her blue eyes. She wasn't wearing a uniform like the rest of us 8th graders, and she didn't have a backpack either. But she looked about my age, fourteen years old, or maybe thirteen. She moved her face up close to mine, like she was checking me for something.

""You can see me?"" she said.

She was slowing me down. There were still about five minutes left, but Wednesday Art was my only class with Brigidde Smarton all week. And I was going to ask Brigidde to the 8th Grade Dance. I wanted to get there early, so I could save a seat for Brigidde, because my dad had told me that high-school was like real-estate: Location, Location, Location. I figured that if we sat together she would have to say yes.

But my heart was bumping, because it was Now or Never (as my dad also said). The Dance was in two weeks. And I wasn't really listening to the girl with blue eyes and dark hair, who wore a long-sleeve white shirt with a dog stitched by the collar, because I was thinking about Brigidde. I felt kind of sick. I was trying to rehearse what to say.

""This is my classroom,"" I told the girl with blue eyes so she would leave. ""Art Class, Room 202.""

She looked behind her.

""You said that to me, right?"" she said.

""What?""

I went in, but she followed me.

-----

I think it's the job of an Art Teacher to be both weird and oblivious. So, Mr Ease didn't even say anything when this girl walked in behind me. She had never been in our classroom before, and she had a can of Coke which wasn't allowed, but Mr Ease just looked up and nodded. Then, he went back to working on some clay on his desk. He was cutting it into the shape of a small man with a scalpel. 

""Why are you ignoring me?"" the girl with blue eyes asked when I sat down.

I took out my sketch-book and my pencils. I started drawing, but she got in the desk beside me.

""Are you going to stay here?"" I asked her. ""I'm sorry I'm being rude, but I'm just really nervous right now and - ""

""You ARE talking to me!"" she jumped up again. ""I knew it! But wait, does that mean like... you're the same as me?""

""What?""

""I mean like... what are you?""

""Don't you have a class to go to?"" I asked her.

And then Brigidde walked in. Brigidde walked in with her green eyes like shallow seas in the sun. She was of Scottish descent with freckles, and her hair was red like fire and sunrise. Brigidde was forced to wear the school-uniform, like the rest of us, and it made her look mousy and introverted. And some people thought she was a nerd because she loved old books and already spoke seven languages. But I knew she should be robed in only moonlight and flowers. She was special, beautiful. I felt a lump in my throat.

""Hey, Toe,"" said Brigidde.

""Hey,"" I said.

""Oh my God,"" said the girl with blue eyes and a Coke. ""Are you talking to her, too?""

""What?"" I said.

""What?"" said Brigidde.

""Sorry I wasn't talking to you,"" I said.

""Okay,"" said Brigidde.

""You weren't?"" said the girl with the Coke.

Then I looked up, and Mr Ease was standing over me. He was staring at my sketch-book on my desk, where I was drawing to try to control my nerves. Mr Ease had hard brown eyes and short wild hair that was like black and gray wool, and he was watching me closely, with his weird thin scarf wrapped around him like he was in the desert, or like he was trying not to breathe on me. The other students were coming in, and Mr Ease held up his hands to make them stay quiet. He looked down at me.

""That's right, Antony,"" he said to me. ""That's what Art is. It's all the voices. You have to hear all the voices, and you just don't stop, because it's Art. IT'S ART! It's no weasel shrinking from the vast and empty, but it IS. IT IS! Don't let me stop you, Toe. You're in it! Keep going, keep feeling it!""

""What?"" I asked.

""Wait, he's talking to you, too!"" said the girl with blue eyes and a Coke.

But, suddenly, I could feel everyone. Everyone in the class was crowding around my desk, where I was drawing. I could feel their body heat. My left hand was shaking under the desk, even while I was sketching with my right hand, because it was Now or Never. But I couldn't talk to Brigidde with everyone watching me. I couldn't ask her to the Dance with Mr Ease standing over me like a crazy uncle. I wanted to talk to Brigidde alone. I was going to say: *People think this whole 8th Grade Dance thing is over-rated, but it's cool, too, right?* And she was going to say: *Yeah, I actually think so*. Then our hands would just sort of come together, like it was meant to be.

But then I realized I was drawing Brigidde! And everyone was watching. It was too late, because forty minutes had gone by - like that! - and I was already finished with the drawing. I was putting the final touches on it while everyone hovered around me. Now, they would all see Brigidde on my paper. Even from the gray of my pencil, they would know it was her green eyes like seas and her red hair like fire. They would know how I felt!

""Oh, it's beautiful,"" said Brigidde. ""Who is it?""

""What?"" I said.

-----

""May I?"" said Mr Ease.

He leaned forward and drew up my sketch-book. Like a proud mother, he turned it around to show the class - but the girl in my picture suddenly looked like she had dark hair, with eyes that somehow seemed blue in spite of the pencil's gray.

""You're a psycho!"" said the girl with blue eyes who had followed me into the room. ""Is that how it happened? Is that like - wait, are you a stalker or something and you killed me? And now I'm supposed to - ""

""I don't even know you!"" I shouted. ""Get away! I didn't draw you! I drew Brigidde! But you changed it and it's ugly! You ruined it!""

My nerves had snapped, and I was on my feet now, shouting, in front of everyone. The girl with blue eyes started crying. Everyone was looking at me. Then, the girl with blue eyes turned and ran, with her dark hair streaking behind her like a shimmer on the water at night. The classroom's blue metal door opened as she went out, and everyone looked at the door when it swung closed again. The bell rang.

""Thanks Mr Ease,"" said the whole class and they left.

I sat down again, alone, in the Art Classroom. I ran a hand through my hair. I pulled my sketch-book to myself slowly, because it wasn't even Now or Never anymore, it was Too Late. Mr Ease was back at his desk, chiseling at a little clay doll. The next class was already coming in, in their lumpy white shirts and maroon uniforms.

""That's the kid who my sister said just totally flipped out today,"" one of them was saying. ""She said the door just opened by itself after he shouted.""

""But she said the picture was amazing, right?"" said another. ""I'd love to see it.""

I got up and walked out. The whole day was like a hazy dream after that. In Biology and History, I sat in the back and drew in my sketch-book. I sketched through Applied Science, too. And, even after school, I sat in the courtyard and sketched while everyone went home. The school turned eerily quiet, like something that had just died. The teachers stayed in their classrooms, making occasional noises like ghosts. Then, they left, too. 

I was alone, still sketching in the courtyard, while the sky softened as evening fell. Then, the low sun suddenly flashed on a dome on top the school. It was like light in a blade, and I flinched - and a cold hand grabbed my neck. I turned around, and there was a haggard gray face staring at me.

""It's Art!"" said Mr Ease.

He smelled like the homemade rum that my uncle and grandfather made from the sugarcane on the big farm they owned near the Everglades.

""It's art and it knows that I killed her!"" said Mr Ease. ""I killed her and she came in through the door, and she was there on the picture to get me! To get me! Because it's art and it's alive and it knows!""

""Knows what?""

""Good heavens!"" Mrs Sippi appeared. ""Let's get you home, Mr Ease. What are you doing?""

She took Mr Ease by the arm to lead him back to his classroom. Mrs Sippi was a delicate-looking older woman who always wore loose floral tops and dark slacks, but her grip on Mr Ease was strong. She had sharp blue eyes and silvered hair that was done up today in a bun above her glasses, and she was always kind to me. But now she seemed brisk, like she was hiding Mr Ease from me. She told me to leave while she called him a taxi.

-----

I walked home under the green June trees. I was still wearing the blue blazer and tie of my school uniform, but there was grass pollen in the air - it made my eyes water like I was about to cry. Or maybe I secretly wanted to cry, because I was ashamed. I had missed my chance to ask Brigidde to the 8th Grade Dance. 

But then, when my front door opened, Brigidde was standing there, like the luckiest break of all time.

""Hey, Big Toe!"" my dad said. ""We've got the new neighbors here for dinner, but I think you already know one of them.""

It was like a dream when he pulled me in and closed the door. He had his hand on my head, scruffing me, and I didn't even care that he still treated me like I was eight years old, because Brigidde was there. I had another chance! 

Brigidde was with a man and a woman, and suddenly I understood. She had been talking about moving for months. The house next door had a *For Sale* sign that went up and was taken down again. It was them. This tall man, with the gray vest and reading glasses in his pocket, was Brigidde's father; and this friendly round woman with the curly red hair was Brigidde's mother. These were my neighbors. Brigidde was going to be right here next to me.

""Location, location, location, am I right, Big Toe?"" my dad asked. ""Why don't you head back and wash up for dinner.""

""Oh, and Brigidde told us you were amazing in Art today,"" said my mother. ""Bring us out your picture. It was a girl, right? And get your brother, too.""

""Breda always talks about you,"" said the woman with the curly red hair.

Breda. That was Brigidde's nickname at home, she had told home. She said it was Celtic for healing, and, when I had heard that, I imagined her clothed in a glowing wind on the Scottish moorlands. I had drawn her like that. But I always changed her just a little - I made her long red hair less wavy and her eyes more like the characters in my manga comics - so that no one (like my brother) would know if they got hold of my sketch-book. I *always* changed her, I suddenly realized. 

""That's impossible!"" I said to myself, and I suddenly ran back to my room to check my sketches.

It wasn't just today's picture - I had drawn the girl with blue eyes in all my sketches. Since I rarely used color-pencils, there was no real way to know the hair-color and eye-color, but it was her everywhere. I flipped through my smudged pages. Every time I had tried to draw Brigidde, I could see that she was the girl from school today. It made my skin prickle to see her in my own sketch-book. I turned around to throw my backpack into my closet, but, when I opened the door, the girl with blue eyes and a Coke was inside.

""Jeez!"" I jumped backwards and fell against my dresser.

I had hit my bed, too, and my pillow and a sweater fell on my head. By the time I had pulled them off, my brother was in the room. He was my twin. He looked just like me, with hazel eyes all mixed of color like Florida wildflowers, and dirty-blonde hair that tangled up like brambles when it grew except that his hair was cropped short because he was a swimmer.

""Someone called for me?"" he asked.

""Christophe, shhh,"" I said quietly. ""Someone's in that closet. Open the door and stay calm. Maybe she has a weapon.""

""What?""

He turned and threw open my closet and screamed.

""Oh God! It's got me! It's eating my face! Oh God! What is this thing? Oh God!""

The closet was empty, and my brother fell back onto my bed laughing.

-----

I hung up my blazer and tie, and I rolled up my sleeves while my brother grabbed my sketch-book. He was flipping through the pages.

""Where's the one from today, Toe?"" he asked.

""It's the last one. Bring it with you. And you should have been out there already helping get dinner.""

""I *was* out there helping. I just came back to make sure my Bitcoin miner was running. Getting that cryptographic loot, son. You know I just made a hundred dollars and lost it again in a week.""

""Way to go.""

""The new neighbor thought it was cool,"" my brother said. ""I told her and she kept asking me questions. She's fun to talk to. We're going to the 8th Grade Dance together.""

""What?""

I had walked past him to the bathroom in the hallway, where I was washing my hands. But, now, I stepped out. I was just standing there, unmoving, with my hands still wet while my brother shrugged.

""I asked her and she said Yes,"" he told me. ""No biggie.""

""Oh.""

""Man, you should just see your face right now! Of course I didn't ask her!""

He pushed me back into the bathroom and ran down the hallway into the living room. He slid on his socks. He was only twenty minutes younger than me, but he always acted like he was nine years old. I heard him ask our dinner guests to look at the amazing picture that *he* drew in his spare time today. He said it was more precious to him than any amount of money, but, if someone was interested, he would start the bidding at five dollars. My mother told him to sit down. Then, she cleared her throat like I should have been at the table by then.

I dried my hands and walked down the hall. My mother held up the picture from Art Class when I joined everyone at the table.

""Tell us about it,"" she said.

""Just a girl.""

""He keeps her in his closet,"" my brother Christophe said.

My father laughed as he passed me the potatoes.

""She shounds kind of *shelf*-ish,"" my Dad did a Scottish accent.

""But has she been in his drawers?"" my brother said.

My mother's face colored. Her dirty-blonde hair was pulled back behind her earrings in a thin elegant hair-band. She was dressed in a light collared top because she had been playing tennis earlier in the day and she was still cooling off. She glanced at my father - who was a big man with a chest like a barrel and hazel eyes like mine and Christophe's - and he looked sternly Christophe.

""Dinner talk, Little Toe,"" my father said to my brother.

""I'm shorry.""

""He was amazing, though,"" said Brigidde. ""It was like watching... I don't know. But everyone was watching. A picture like that would have taken me hours. I couldn't even do it anyways. It's hyper-realism, right? That takes forever. But it was just amazing. Who was she, Toe?""

""The girl sitting beside me?"" I asked.

""No, the girl in the picture.""

""She was sitting beside me.""

""She's in our class?""

""No, she was just there today,"" I said.

""I didn't see her.""

""She was right beside me when you walked in.""

""You were alone when I walked in,"" said Brigidde

She had the sketch-book, which everyone had been passing around. She handed it to me across the table - and our fingers touched. She smiled and looked into my eyes.

-----

""Wait, I recognize that girl,"" said Brigidde's mother.

She put down her napkin, and she squinted at the picture as I held it up to her. And Brigidde's father, too, seemed to go remarkably still in his chair, like he was watching my face for something. They were nice people. I had met them at a parent-teacher talent-show the year before, when Brigidde recited from the Cathach of St. Columba. I had shown some pictures then. Afterwards, they had asked me about our Art Teacher, Mr Ease. They wanted to know something about his drawings, and Brigidde's father Mr Smarton had kept hooking a finger over his tie to loosen it, like he was having trouble breathing. But I couldn't remember much of that conversation now.

""She's a child model on TV, right?"" Mrs Smarton wondered. ""No, that's not it, but I've seen her somewhere. Anyways, that's just like school! Somebody right there and you don't even notice them. Can you believe Wilbert and I went to the same high-school and never knew each other? We had the same classes, too. It wasn't until we started dating in college that we figured it out. To be young!""

""To be young!"" my parents raised their glasses.

But Mr Smarton sat back and drank his wine - he was still looking at me.

""You should walk Brigidde to school tomorrow,"" he said.

""I should?""

""Yeah, it'd be good for her. This'll give her a chance to get to know the area.""

Brigidde made this sort of smile - it was like she had bitten into a lemon with only the left side of her mouth. It was beautiful to me, but her father laughed.

""Can you be outside tomorrow at seven, Antony?"" he asked me.

-----

It was very early in the morning while I walked with Brigidde to school. There was a lake on the way, and the sky was pale above it, with a crescent moon shining on the water. We stopped. It was a Second Chance. It was Destiny. I was just about to ask Brigidde to the 8th Grade Dance, when she said she was cold. She stepped close to me, and we kissed for a long time.

""Brigidde,"" I finally said.

""Who?""

The girl with blue eyes was in my room, and I jumped up in my bed. I had been dreaming. It was 3:00am. I pressed my back against the wall, while the girl with dark hair and blue eyes watched me from where she was sitting at my desk.

""What are you doing here?"" I asked. 

""I don't know,"" she said.

She looked at the floor. I leaned quickly to the side of my bed and got my old baseball bat.

""You're going to hit me?"" she asked. ""Isn't it enough that you already killed me?""

""What are you talking about?""

""I'm talking about your sketch-book, Antony McStalkerton.""

""What?"" I asked. ""Were you in the closet earlier? Did you steal my sketch-book? How long have you been here?""

""Yes. No. And long, but not long,"" she said. ""I was mostly in your brother's room - oh my God, he's such a hunk.""

I put down the baseball bat. She was still wearing her jeans and her white shirt with the dog stitched at the collar-bone, like I had drawn her in my picture. She was still drinking her Coke.

""He's my twin,"" I said. ""He looks the same as me.""

""In your dreams,"" she said.

""We literally have the exact same DNA. He is exactly the same as me.""

""Yeah, but he has that haircut,"" she said, ""and that body. What is he?""

""He's a swimmer.""

""Oh my God, I love swimmers,"" she said.

""Yeah right. Name one other swimmer in the world.""

""Michael Phelps,"" she said.

""Name another one,"" I said.

""Your brother.""

""You're an idiot.""

-----

There was a noise from the wall behind her. She got up and moved sideways to my open door, and I picked up my baseball bat again. But it was only my brother. 

He came out into the hallway. He was wearing his boxer shorts, and his cropped hair was matted at one side of his head. He stood there, sleepwalking. It used to freak me out when he did that, but now I usually just waited for him to go back to bed. The girl with blue eyes got up and went into the hallway, too, beside my brother. She started jumping and throwing her arms out to the side. It looked like a kind of dancing.

""Whatchu gonna do if I do THIS!"" she shouted. ""Whatchu gonna do if I do THIS!""

She started thrusting her hips around.

""Stop!"" I whispered. ""What are you doing? Shh! You'll wake my parents.""

""Whatchu gonna do if I do THIS!"" she shouted.

""Uh,"" my brother groaned.

The girl with blue eyes was right in front of him, but he stumbled past her as if she weren't there. He went back into his bedroom. I heard him fall on his bed, and the girl with blue eyes stopped dancing. She sighed. She came back to where she had been sitting at my desk.

""I just don't think you're a murderer,"" she said as she sat down. ""But you're also the only person who sees me, so there has to be a connection.""

""Who sees you?""

""Come on!"" she said. ""Haven't you been paying attention today? I'm not wearing the school uniform! Nobody sees me. Not your friend in class, not even your brother.""

""He's a heavy sleeper.""

""A heavy sleeper?""

She walked out of the room again. Then, I heard her in my brother's room, screaming at the top of her lungs - it sounded like a cat was has having its fur pulled out. It went on and on, for a good four or five minutes. Then, the girl with blue eyes walked back into my room again, where she dusted off her hands like she had just finished some hard work. Her can of Coke was balanced on top of her head. She took it down and drank.

""You see?"" she asked.

""You're trying to tell me you're a  - ""

There was a scratching in the wall again. This time the girl with the Coke jumped.

""What was that?"" she asked.

""My brother.""

""No that came from the window,"" she said.

I leaned forward to pull back the curtains.

""No, stop!"" she said. ""Stop! Stop! What if you open it, and it's like a face or a monster or something. I'm scared of ghosts.""

She got up on the bed with me and grabbed my arm. Maybe I was still half-asleep. But I looked at her and shook my head. I threw the curtains back. The girl with the Coke screamed and lightning flashed, and a face appeared in my window - it had eyes that were green like seas and hair that was red like fire.

-----

Brigidde crawled in and sat with me on the floor. We pulled the blanket down around our shoulders and leaned close to each other. She had a book of ancient writing.

""I'm really glad you're awake, Toe,"" she said. ""I want to show you something.""

""She's always reading,"" said the girl with blue eyes and a Coke, who was sitting at my desk again.

""You know her?"" I asked her.

""Who?"" said Brigidde.

""I've been sleeping at her house,"" said the girl with the Coke.

""She's been sleeping at your house?"" I asked Brigidde.

""Who?"" said Brigidde.

""She can't see me, you idiot,"" said the girl with the Coke.

""Just be quiet,"" I said.

""What?"" said Brigidde.

""Not you.""

Brigidde looked around the room. She looked right at the girl with the Coke, who started flipping her hair and whispering - it looked like she was going to do that awful dance again (""*Whatchu gonna do if I do THIS!*""). But then, Brigidde just shrugged and opened the book.

Brigidde's fingers went across the strange writing, and she pronounced something I didn't understand. Then, she pointed at a sketch. It looked like a squat clay man, with short legs and huge arms and a body like a box. The clay man had strange letters on his forehead. Brigidde leaned close to me so I could see the picture better, and I smelled her hair. We were sitting right next to each other on the floor. She looked up into my eyes and my brain went soft.

""Did you see what Mr Ease was doing on his desk today?"" Brigidde asked me.

She took out a printed picture. It was an image of Mr Ease's desk, with the clay that he had been carving with his scalpel. He was making a figure that looked exactly like the figure in the book.

""My friend took this picture with her phone today,"" said Brigidde, ""because you know my parents won't let me have a phone. Reeeee-diculous! Anyways, she emailed it to me so I could print it. It's a golem. Mr Ease is making a golem! They come from Germany and Prague, and they can come to life!""

""It was almost Too Late,"" I said.

""What? They come alive! They protect you from evil - but then they become evil themselves, sometimes. And they can communicate with the dead.""

""They communicate with the dead,"" said the girl with the Coke. ""Maybe HE knows something!""

""Quiet!"" I told her.

""What?"" said Brigidde.

""People think this whole 8th Grade Dance thing is over-rated,"" I said to Brigidde, ""but it's cool in a way, right?"" 

Brigidde looked at me and her lower jaw fell open. Her lightly-freckled face went blank. Her green eyes went clear and far away, like she was looking past me into the distance. And I felt something cold go into my heart. I wished my Dad would have said Timing, Timing, Timing, because that would have been better. I had screwed up again. Suddenly, I couldn't move because it was like the air was made of needles. Brigidde stood up and pulled the cover off her shoulder, and she turned to the window, which I had left open.

""I have to go,"" she said.

""No wait,"" I said. ""I'm sorry, Brigidde. I - ""

She was already outside.

""Good night, Antony!"" she said.

She took off running. There was a soft drizzle of rain starting, and she disappeared at the pine tree between our yards, going around to her back porch. I heard her sliding glass door close in the distance. I slumped on my bed.

""Oh my God, that was so awkward,"" said the girl with blue eyes.

""Please, be quiet.""

I pushed my face into my pillow.

-----

""Did you really mean what you said... about your picture today?"" the girl with blue eyes asked me.

""Huh?"" I said into my pillow.

""Today, earlier... you said I... your picture was ugly.""

I turned around on my bed. I pulled up my blanket, which was halfway off the mattress onto the floor, where Brigidde had dropped it. The girl with the Coke was still sitting at my desk, but she was only using half the chair. She was leaned forward over her knees. She had put down her cold soda-can between my cup of pencils and my stacks of American and manga comic-books. She was touching her lips with her finger-tips.

""What's your name?"" I asked her.

I sat up and closed the window.

""I don't know,"" she said.

""You don't know?"" 

""I don't remember.""

""You know Michael Phelps,"" I said. ""But you don't know your name?""

She shrugged.

""Well listen, Blue-Eyes,"" I said. ""I think you're very pretty. It's just I had a lot on my mind today, and I was being an idiot. It had nothing to do with you.""

""Was it her?'""

She looked at the window.

""Yes,"" I said. ""It was her.""

She nodded to herself. She stood up and crossed her arms, and then she pulled her shimmery dark hair to one side, so that it covered the dog that was stitched on her shirt. She was looking at the floor. She was wearing blue socks with white stars on them. She had her weight on one foot, with the other foot on top of it, like she was trying not to take up too much space while she waited for something.

""Blue-Eyes,"" she said. ""I like that. You can call me that, if you want.""

""Okay.""

""And I'll make you a deal,"" she said. ""If you'll help me figure out whatever I'm supposed to be doing, and why I'm here, then I'll help you get that that girl with the book to fall in love with you.""

""It's all so easy.""

""Maybe it is. We can start tomorrow.""

""But we'll never see each other again.""

""What?""

""Nothing,"" I told her. ""I just said I was tired. I'm sleepy. But it's a deal.""

""It's a deal?""

""Sure,"" I said.

She smiled, and a softness went through her, like she had taken off something heavy.

""Thanks,"" she said. ""Well... good-night, Antony McStalkerton.""

""Good night, Diana Blue-Eyes.""

""Who?""

""Good night.""

I turned and faced my wall and yawned. The next thing I remembered I was waking up again, with my alarm clock going off.

END CHAPTER 1

CHAPTER 2 : Golem

-----

I pulled a sweater on over my pajamas. I staggered tiredly out to the back porch with my sketch-book, where my brother had left a stopwatch on the wooden bench. I sat down, and my brother waved at me from the end of the dock behind our house. He dove into the lake. He started swimming free-stroke, with his toned arms alternating over the surface like jumping eels, taking him toward the far shore, where the highway went by a kilometer off. I stayed inside the screen-porch and kept time for him. 

""Sharks are salt-water, Toe,"" my mother said.

She had just come out onto the porch, looking at the sketch I was doing. It was a drawing of my brother swimming into the jaws of a mutated Great White Shark in the lake. My Mom had a mug of coffee, and she sat beside me, pointing at the picture.

""I know,"" I said. ""But if I had drawn an alligator, it would have upset you.""

""Actually, yes. It would have.""

She was wearing her purple pajamas with the long purple socks. She yawned and nudged the little foot-stool in front of her straight with her feet. She pointed at my brother, who was already half-way across the lake.

""How does he do this every morning?"" she asked.

""I had one of my dreams again last night,"" I said, ""like I used to have before I started drawing.""

""Scary?""

""No, just really real. It was like... There was the girl from class yesterday, the one I drew, and the neighbor, Brigidde. There was Wonder Woman, too, I think. There was also Christophe, but maybe I was awake for that part.""

""Doesn't sound too bad.""

""Yeah, it wasn't like when I was a kid.""

""You're still a kid,"" she said. ""You're only fourteen. Anyways, thank you for telling me about it.""

She went back in, and I heard a pan on the stove in the kitchen a minute later. She would be watching us through the window while she made breakfast. 

I had a hyper-active visual cortex. Or something like that. I had never talked to a doctor, so I wasn't sure. But I had always been seeing things, everywhere, since I was a kid, and I had suffered terrible nightmares until I started drawing. Now, as long as I sketched, my dreams were mostly good. Drawing was like exercise for my brain. So, just like my brother swam and my father worked, I was always making pictures. My mother said we were all three weird. She said she was tired, and she wanted to live with normal people who didn't have so much energy. I could understand that, but I knew that she was really proud of us.

I hit the stopwatch.

""How was it?"" my brother shouted.

He had already finished swimming across the lake and back, and now he was walking up the dock.

""About 29 minutes, but that's with the time you were walking up here, too.""

""That's fine.""

He was still huffing and drying off as he came into the porch. He leaned over my shoulder to look at my drawing.

""Don't drip on it,"" I said.

""I saw something like that over on the other side this morning,"" he said, ""you know, where there's that patch of mud and clay in the bank. What is it?""

""A shark?""

""No, the little box-man.""

I didn't remember drawing it, but it was there in my picture. It was small on the page, but it was big for the way I had placed it on the shore in the distance. It was a giant, watching, from far away. 

""You saw that?"" I asked.

""Yeah, but it was more like a pile of mud over there. But definitely the same idea. What is it?""

""It's a golem.""

-----

I showered and changed into my school uniform. When I sat down on my bed to put on my socks, I pulled my comforter up off the floor - the girl with blue eyes was lying on her back staring up at me.

""Jeez!"" I jumped backwards.

She jerked and banged her face on the bed-frame.

""OW!"" she said. ""What? What happened?""

""What?"" I said.

""What?"" my mother said.

My Mom was at the doorway, where she had come in from the hallway. She was wearing her jeans now, with a clean olive top, because today was her meeting with her women's hobby group. Her hair was pulled up in a soft cotton cloth from after her shower. She came around and stood in front of the girl with the Coke. She looked at me.

""You okay, Toe?"" said my mother. ""I thought I heard you yell.""

""I just... saw a spider down there on the floor.""

""Did it have that red hour-glass thing?""

She crouched and looked straight at the girl with blue eyes.

""It was a daddy long-legs,"" I said. ""Isn't it still there?""

""I don't see anything. Come on and eat some breakfast.""

She went out, and the girl with the blue eyes climbed up with her face still puffy from sleep. She was rubbing her head where she had hit it against the bed.

""It's you,"" I said.

""What?"" said the girl with blue eyes.

""But that means that I really said that to Brigidde yesterday.""

""The Dance thing?"" she said.

I glanced at the window where Brigidde had gone out.

""Why do you sleep with your eyes open?"" I asked the girl. ""Why were you under my bed?""

""I don't. I wasn't.""

""What?""

She yawned and walked out. I sat there, holding my socks, looking at the can of Coke that she had left on the floor over by my dresser. It had little bumps of water on it like it was still impossibly cold. When I reached out to touch it, my fingertips got wet. I pulled my hand back. I tried again and picked it up. I put the can of Coke on my dresser and ran out into the living room to put on my socks.

-----

Diana Prince was Wonder Woman, and I had called her ""Blue-Eyes"" when I was four, because my father had sat with me on the floor to read her comics. She had black hair and a singlet that was blue at the bottom with white stars. She was beautiful. I still had several Wonder Woman comics on my desk, and I often drew her for fun - except I made my Wonder Woman younger, like me. So, while I ate breakfast, I was shaking, because my particular Diana ""Blue-Eyes"" Prince, or someone who resembled her, was sitting at the table with me. The girl with the Coke had blue eyes and dark hair. She was beautiful. She wore blue socks with white stars on them. My brother was beside us, and I kept glancing between him and her.

""What's up with you, Toe?"" my brother suddenly said. ""You're all kind of, stiff, or something.""

""Me?""

He turned to look at the calendar on the wall in the kitchen beside our dining room - he was looking right through Diana Blue-Eyes.

""Is it the 8th Grade Dance?"" he asked me.

""Are you going with anyone?"" I said.

""I'm going with myself. I'm the only person hot enough for me.""

""Are you basing that off looks?"" I asked.

""Yes.""

""But I'm your twin.""

""Well if you want to ask me, just ask me.""

""You're an idiot,"" I said.

""I'll go with him,"" said Diana Blue-Eyes.

""She'll go with you,"" I said.

""Who?"" 

""Blue-Eyes,"" I said.

""Wonder Woman?"" he said.

""You remember that?"" I said.

""He remembers me?"" said the girl.

My brother got up and washed his plate off in the sink. He went back to his bedroom - he was a whiz with computers, and he had special permission from school to stay home for two hours each morning. He was like an intern for an online Bitcoin company (whatever that was). He was already typing on his computer.

""Five percent!"" he shouted.

Diana Blue-Eyes went back through the hallway into his room to look. 

I cleaned up my plate, and I left as quietly as possible, sneaking away from her. I went over to the bottom of Brigidde's driveway to wait. But, when Brigidde came out at seven, she only turned up the road like she hadn't seen me. I remembered what I had said last night. I wanted to explain. I even quickened my pace to catch up to her. But the closer I got, the more I felt awkward, like there was a lump of hot coal inside my chest. I wouldn't be able to talk to her anyways, even if I knew what to say.

I put my hands in my pockets, and Brigidde walked on ahead of me, getting further away.

6ndk51,2,2017-07-14,I moved to a new city for an internship year but nothing I do is making me happy,acurlyninja,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6ndk51/i_moved_to_a_new_city_for_an_internship_year_but/,"Hey. I moved about five hours away from all my friends and family to start an internship year at a video games company. The job is great and whilst I'm there I think of nothing else except my work. But when I'm not there I'm constantly depressed. When I moved here, I moved away from the first person I truly loved. Saying goodbye has always been really hard for me but this person was especially difficult to say goodbye to. I find it really hard to get close and comfortable around people, but I was both with her since day one.

I do stuff on meetup.com every now and then and go out with a group of drinking buddies in my new city. But I can't help feeling super fucking alone 24/7, even when I'm out with a group. The one I left behind and I did basically everything together and we would hang out 5/7 days a week. It doesn't help that she's finding it a lot easier to move on. It's been well over a month that I've been feeling this way and it seems to be getting worse.

I think they took the goodbye really badly because they blocked me on basically everything but I really do miss them. I've met probably over three hundred people since I've moved here and no one even comes close to the synergy we had.

I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome like almost two years ago and in the time that I knew this friend they helped me in so many more ways than they can ever imagine. I feel like they were the only person who ever really saw me.

I've never posted on here before but I've been a long time lurker. This is clearly getting worse as I've been thinking about posting here for a few weeks but haven't...

If you are reading this friend, I really do miss you and I still read your letter often. "

I've been extremely stressed with my current job and situation that I started applying for a new job and one specifically in my career path, it's a paid internship until I graduate in cyber security at my university and was wondering if you guys had any tips to help and any previous experiences you guys may have had regarding a situation similar to this.

Thank you guys in advance!

When I left, my boyfriend was planning on finishing his degree and coming down in December 2017. What's a year, right? We had been together for 2 and had some distance between us before.

After a couple of months he told me that he would need to take 20 credits for his last semester therefore finishing in winter was impossible. Our gap was made larger. For a couple of weeks, I was bummed out. Another 4 months was ticked on and we decided that he would come down when he graduated in May 2018. 

Just yesterday, he has been offered a job at a place he interns at during the summer. I told him I would rather him apply to positions in TX and keep his ME position as back-up. He rejected that plan and explained his reasons for why he will be accepting the position. 

I am so terribly sad. We are a quarter of the way done with our LDR, which is great, but I feel like this gap is going to keep getting larger. It has already happened twice - what's to stop it now? All the ""what-ifs?"" I had in my head are coming true. 

I do not mind going through an LDR with him. I am mostly scared that we will lose attraction for each and/or love after a while. All this time and additional heartache we are going through to stay together might end up for naught. 

This thread was just made for hopeless venting. If anyone has advice though, that would be great."

- **STRICTLY GAME AND DESIGN RELATED QUESTIONS**

**Q: What's the reason for announcing an expansion and not revealing new cards in the following weeks only to dump ~40 cards a few days before the expansion is released instead of having a steady stream of reveals?**

A: We used to do a steady stream of new reveals of about 1 card a day, and it kinda dragged. The feedback we were getting was that hype was slowing down as we got closer to the expansion, and i think that's the wrong direction. Un'Goro had a dip in excitement, but ramped way up towards the release and used a similar strategy. Un'Goro felt awesome - let's see how this one goes!

**Q: In the past you mentioned cards that have been previously nerfed might be un-nerfed and moved into the Hall of Fame in the next standard rotation, what is your/Blizzard's current stance on these cards, specifically Molten Giant? #HoFMolten2018**

A: I'm a little torn. I think there are pros and cons. The potential downside I'm most worried about is our ability to make Handlock really insane in Standard going forward with new cards, without pushing it into insanity in Wild. We'd like to make Handlock a thing again - and we can do that in Wild by moving the card that and buffing it, or by making new cards in Standard that are good in both formats. This doesn't mean we won't move/buff it, it's just something we're thinking about.

**Q: Has the team ever considered creating a set of free cards that rotates weekly? These cards would be usable in casual and maybe have a crafting discount.**

A: Yeah, but I think there's some complexity there. There are goals you are trying to solve with that suggestion - we are looking at other options that I think hit the similar goals that are maybe a little less complex.

**Q: Has the team thought about releasing a few (1-3) cards each month to help keep the game fresh in-between sets? This would provide Blizzard with the opportunity to print hate cards like Golakka Crawler or Eater of Secret earlier or to support decks that did not pan out as you guys had hoped and could serve as ""balance patches"" in less severe situations.**

A: Yes, we've considered that, limited-time cards that come back from Wild into standard for a while, and other crazy ideas to mix up the meta in between sets. I think it's one of Hearthstone's biggest opportunities. We took a stab at it recently with increasing the total number of cards each year. There are obviously downsides to that, and I think a lot of the ideas we've seen so far to tackle this problem have their own unique downsides. I don't think there's a silver bullet here, but we're trying some crazy things internally, like - what if we change the ladder format for the last month of a set? We tried ""block constructed"" and it wasn't as fun as we hoped, but maybe there's other formats that mix the game up in crazy ways that are really fun?

**Q: Can you confirm that each class will have a hero card and a legendary minion in Knights of the Frozen Throne?**

A: Confirmed.

**Q: In the previous live stream you mentioned that a new ladder experience was in the works, can you share any progress on that?**

A: We have a design that we are excited to try. I'm not sure it will be perfect out of the gate, but hopefully players will help us iterate into a great place. I wonder if just mixing it up is the right answer - like doing a new ladder format every 5 or so years. Once we know how long the feature will take to implement, we will start building it. There's a lot of iteration in that process, and once we start honing in on our final implementation, we'll communicate more about what we're planning. Our major goals here are: reduce the monthly grind for top-level players; increase progression for bottom 25% of players; get better match-making. We have another goal for improving the new player ranked experience - that's a separate change that's coming later.

**Q: What are the odds of Hearthstone coming to console?**

A: If our players are playing a lot on console, it's the type of thing we'd consider. Right now it's pretty easy to whip out your phone or tablet anywhere - so it's not currently something we're considering.

**Q: Rotate Ice Block when?**

A: We wouldn't be doing Wild Rotations out side of Hearthstone New Year. It's definitely a card that matches our red flags for cards that maybe shouldn't be in Standard forever. That doesn't mean we don't want combo decks or freeze mage - it's just that we want things to change each year!

**Q: can the card reveal livestreams show the non golden version of the cards?**

A: I will pass your message along to the folks who set those up!

**Q: Ben, will the collection manager get more attention?**

A: Yeah - We recently added way more powerful search functionality (i personally love searching for 'extra'), and deck copying/exporting. We'll continue to add features and refine current ones.

**Q: Can you give us an update on Hero skins? When I made my article about the [progression in Hearthstone (or lack of thereof)](http://www.gosugamers.net/hearthstone/features/44844-the-ancient-relic-that-is-hearthstone-s-progression) it struck me as one of the features moving rather slow. We are 2 years in since the release of the first skin, Magni and even now we are not yet at a point where all classes have one. On top of that it is not all of those we got that are available with Tyrande being locked behind twitch prime at a time when basically only NA had access to that. No good for EU players like me.**

A: We will eventually make a new Druid and Warlock hero. :) I can't spoil how we plan on making them available just yet.
Regarding Tyrande - our goal was to find alternate ways for regions that were not eligible for the offer to get access to Tyrande and we've been working with our regional offices to make that happen. We've already done it in many regions - seems like we haven't hit yours yet and I'll follow up on that.

**Q: Hi Ben! Something I've always thought could be utilized more, especially on the pro level, is an increase in cards that focus on board position. Flametongue and Meteor are fantastic cards that can actually be more valuable if you put some thought in during previous turns.**

A: Yep, there will be more minion-placement cards. Glad you like the mechanic!

**Q: Are you ever planning on making more stats available for players? Stuff like highest ranking ever achieved and in which season, most played class, class winrates, etc.**

A: Yes. I don't really like ""profile"" pages, but I want to do this in a different way. Hopefully more details later this year. Although, I'm not sure it will be handled the same in every region.

**Q: What are your goals with the upcoming ladder rework? What are your biggest challenges? Any idea when you’ll have any news to share regarding this?**

A: 1) Reduce grind for top-level players. 2) Increase progression for players stuck at rank 20-ish. 3) Get better matchmaking for bottom 25% players. 4) Make the experience better for new players. We're hoping to make 1-3 better first. #4 is a separate feature for us and is coming later. 

The biggest challenging is making those things better without losing what we like about our current system. Our current system is SUPER clear about what you need to do to rank up, and I think that's upside. I'm pretty confident we can do both here, though. 

We have a design we are excited to try out, once we know how it changes through implementation, we are going to announce the details. Hoping for later this year.

**Q: What is the official end date and time of the double quest gold?**

A: You know, I'm not sure. I kind of feel like Ragnaros has got a big head about the whole thing. Someone needs to take him down a peg. Like, c'mon, chill out, man.

**Q: Hey Mr. Brode, Longtime fan of the priestly dark arts here. I've always wanted to make Shadowform (and a more aggressive Priest deck with Shadowbombers and stuff) work but it seems like it never really does. Do us shadow Priests have anything to look forward to in the near future? Will Shadowform ever be viable somehow?**

A: Some day we will make Shadow Priest work, together.

**Q: Hi Ben! Do you have any plans for improving the spectating experience? Almost every tournament I've ever watched seems to involve some kind hatchet job to get around the limitations of the client.**

A: Yes. This is definitely a place we have a lot of room for improvement.

**Q: Hi Ben! What's the hardest thing to update in the hearthstone codebase that you would love to update? What are some stories/lessons learned deploying and maintaining the hearthstone app?**

A: I used to do a lot of client engineering on Hearthstone, but I haven't gotten to do that in a long time. That's probably a better question for one of our Engineers, sorry!

**Q: Hi Ben, what are your thoughts of Hearthstone being too expensive for the average player? Will there be some sort of compromise to keep the game affordable and player numbers healthy? Thanks!**

A: We are definitely seeing players compete at high levels without spending any money at all. If you want literally every card in the game, that's tougher to do, but we are listening to community feedback here. We recently made pretty big changes to the way our Legendary drops work in packs, and are giving everyone a free Legendary Death Knight Hero with the new set. There will also be a lot of opportunities to earn packs of the new set, through some upcoming events and through the single player missions that will be free with the new set.

**Q: Mr. Brode, greetings friend. I want to express my concerns about the lack of a legendary Totem in Hearthstone.
We have a legend card for every race except for Totem race. When would you bless us, the Totem Shaman players, with a legendary Totem card??**

A: This is a gross oversight on our part. I will see what I can do.

**Q: Do you have plans for reducing costs of dust for wild cards,? it's painful to craft any wild card just because you can only use in one mode.**

A: There is already a perception that your cards reduce in value over time because you can't use them in Standard. I think that's not a healthy perception for the game - and this kind of change would exacerbate the problem. We are going to bring back Wild cards for sale, which should make Wild more accessible.

**Q: Have you considered (or tested) changing core values in the game, like player health, starting hand size, deck size etc, since the game released ?**

A: Deck size is the one we've discussed. But we aren't currently considering any changes. Game length has remained remarkably consistent over every meta, and it feels pretty good (about 7.5 minutes on average).

**Q: Do you have any plans for adding another woman avatars for classes? I especially want to see one for Warlock, Warrior and Druid classes.** 

A: Yes!

**Q: Also would it be another opportunity to obtain Tyrande Whisperwind for a new player?**

A: Eventually we'd like to find ways to get things like old Hero Skins and card backs back into the hands of newer players, but this isn't something that I think we need to do right away and we have a couple other big fish to fry.

**Q: Thanks for doing this AMA señor Brode. As someone who played lots of quest rogue (a more casual version without including Stonetusk Boar and Southsea Deckhand) I was a little bummed to hear that the quest was going to be be nerfed. I felt that this was a great opportunity to instead address Charge and its place in the game. It feels like another cool deck took a hit because Charge hasn't aged well in Hearthstone. How do you feel about charge as a mechanic/keyword?**

A: Charge sometimes is great. I love the Hogriders, and I love the Charged Devilsaur. Charge makes you feel powerful, and that's important. But you're right, it's been our biggest balance challenge. I'm not sure what the future of Charge will be. We might just keep nerfing Charge cards over time.

**Q: In your opinion, which card is most guilty at limiting future card mechanics?**

A: Stonetusk Boar

Donais just walked by and I asked him this question - He said ""Boar, but also Prep, Innervate, and Malygos.""

**Q: What is the teams current stance on additional, full classes? Has it changed at all with time?**

A: A class needs unique ""space"" - i.e. things they can do that nobody else can do. Only Paladins get Divine Shield, or ""setting Attack/Health"", or 1-mana Secrets. Mages are the best at AoE and Blasty single-target spells.
I think we are already having trouble carving out awesome space for 9 classes. I want us to find more unique things for Warlock to do, for example. I think adding a 10th class makes this problem much more difficult, as we could be using that space to make our core 9 classes more fun.
Also, you would be less likely to open cards of your favorite class in card packs, the more that we have in the game.
Something I often think about - what is the 'perfect' number of classes? What would be too many? Is 15 too many? How about 50? I kind of think the number even be less than 9, except that we have some important fantasy considerations.

**Q: is the dream really dead now? Are Death Knights, Monks and Demon Hunters ever going to be able to represent themselves in Hearthstone?**

A: I'm actually super excited about the way Death Knights are coming to Hearthstone! Making a Death Knight starting hero means making an ultra simple Hero Power.... but now we've been able to create much crazier hero powers.... and we've made NINE different Death Knights. I'm super pumped.

**Q: Brode, what's the takeaway of the team regarding Un'Goro? Why do you guys think it was so successful and what did the team learn from it to make the next expansions even better?**

A: One of the biggest things that helped was the rotation. I think adding the Hall of Fame and hitting those 6 cards allowed us to see the ""freshest"" meta yet. This is a bit more of a challenge for the last set of the year. I think if anything, we could have gone lighter mechanically, and saved some of our new mechanics for set 3 of the Year of the Mammoth.
But I think the team did an awesome job on the set, yeah. Dinosaurs!

**Q: Have you ever played Magic? And if so, what would you say are some things that exist in magic, that could eventually be incorporated into Hearthstone?**

A: Yes, love Magic. There's a lot to learn from a game that has a 20+ year history. Not many games manage that, and I'm hoping to grow old with them together. :)

**Q: A while ago, arena rewards were discussed, and how getting common cards is such a ""feelsbadman"" reward. Is this still being looked at, and what are some of the reasons (maybe things we as consumers don't think about) for including such cards as rewards?**

A: Yes, we are planning on making a change in an upcoming patch. Details to come.

**Q: What are your thoughts on the current affordability of Hearthstone? It feels, as a player, that the real thing that locks us out of certain decks is the high numbers of epic cards. The fact that a dusted legendary gets you one epic is a very expensive trade. How was this ratio decided?**

A: It's something we continually evaluate. We're currently seeing some players getting large collections without paying a cent, and that's pretty awesome. We've recently made big changes to the way Legendaries drop in packs, as well as giving everyone a free Legendary Death Knight Hero in the new expansion.

**Q: Hi Brode, thanks for doing this. I have a question, is there a tournament mode on the works?**

A: We've been thinking about it a lot. It's a feature we think makes sense for Hearthstone, but we have nothing else to say regarding it right now.

**Q: Given that we've had the Diablo-themed Cow King Tavern Brawl, will we see similar special events or perhaps even expansions included in Hearthstone from other Blizzard properties? For instance, would love to see the Overwatch heroes and lore characters as Hearthstone cards/heroes, or perhaps... hero cards?**

A: Cool idea! I don't think we'd see stuff from other games outside of Tavern Brawls and Card Backs, though.

**Q: Would you ever consider separating the mobile and desktop clients to make the desktop client more feature rich? Lobbies, Tournament modes, 2v2? Would love to see more features, would pay for them too!**

A: I don't feel like we have basically ever been restricted on cool new features due to the parity we shoot for between platforms. We have wildly talented UI Designers who are up for the challenge.

**Q: I wanted to ask why the decision was made to make Hero Cards of the hero (Rexxar, for example) behave in a way that ignores your alternate hero portrait?
I couldn't care either way, but I'm seeing many people have qualms with (or at least, questions about) the way it was handled. They paid $10 to hide Rexarr and rock Alleria, so I think they're a bit bummed that the card doesn't shift with the deck to become ""Deathstalker Alleria"" or something. Was it due to the extra work it would require? Would it cause inconsistency and/or confusion?
I think that Hero Cards are an astounding idea, but I can see where people are disappointed in this unique case where they're themed off of our hero entities (Rexxar/Alleria the Hunter class, opposed to say, Hemet Nessingwary as a Hero Card replacement).
Will these Hero Cards ever be non-heroes? Will they ever be depictions of Alleria, Magni, Medivh, etc.?**

A: Hero cards are a new thing that replaces your hero, not transforms them. It's a bit weird because these 9 hero cards feel like a transformation, but it's possible to turn from Anduin -&gt; Jaraxxus -&gt; Deathstalker Rexxar -&gt; Jaina DK Hero -&gt; Uther DK Hero, for example. (assuming you do some weird thoughtsteal shenanigans.) I think seeing the art of the hero helps you understand what's going on in the game, and what Hero Power your opponent is going to be using from now on. If you play Deathstalker Rexxar as Jaina and then it looks like Jaina still but with the Rexxar power... I dunno, that seems very weird to me.

**Q: When working on expansions, how much of it is done in advance? Do you work expansions ahead of the current set or even the upcoming set?**

A: We are nearly done with design on set 3 of the year of the mammoth. We are hard at work on the first set of next year, and are brainstorming ideas for the second set of 2018.

**Q: Are there any card designs that you've either not been able to get to work (a la Patches in TGT) or that haven't found a place in any set so far? If so, could you share your favorite scrapped card ideas with us?**

A: Yes and No

**Q: When will we be able to buy Naxx again?**

A: Soon! Hoping for sometime this summer.

- **OTHER QUESTIONS / MEMES**

**Q: Hey Ben! On behalf of /r/hearthstonecirclejerk, I have a genuine question for you. What is your favorite Hearthstone meme or copypasta that the community has created?**

A: I have played so many card games in my life - Magic, Overpower, Wyvern, Netrunner, Pokemon, Battlespirits, WoW:TCG, the Mortal Kombat TCG, Rage.... I freaking love this genre.

**Q: as a director of Hearthstone, what has been the most difficult job you had to do while being in charge?**

A: Trying to figure out how to be a Game Director. It's kind of terrifying. The advice Dodds gave me: ""Don't fuck it up""

**Q: Do you play other blizz games like overwatch or wow? What is the relationship between the developing teams of different games?**

A: Yeah, definitely. We are very close. I often have lunch with the directors of the other teams. A lot of people on the other teams meet up with each other to share ideas.

**Q: Any advice for people looking to get into voice acting, specifically within video games? How would somebody go about applying with Blizzard for voice acting jobs/positions?**

6nfs45,3,2017-07-15,Not sure what to do next?,ChangusSean,spinalcordinjuries,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalcordinjuries/comments/6nfs45/not_sure_what_to_do_next/,"Hey! I'll start by introducing myself a little bit.
I'm a 20 year old college student that was in a MVA on 1/30/2016. I sustained a burst fracture in T-12 and was diagnosed as a T-10 Asia A. I was in Shepherd Center for all my therapy and my gosh was it such a great experience. I left Shepherd with some anxiety, however, I tackled everything I could right away. Learned how to drive, went straight back to summer school to make up for my missed semester, and moved out with a friend in the city (I had to change colleges cause it was more convinient). 

I'm only a year and a few months post injury, but I'm feeling very comfortable with myself. Not saying that I've completely given up the hope of being able bodied again, but I've come to be real with what a SCI actually means. I'm basically independent in terms of still doing things I did before I got injured. I go school, I go to the gym, I still go out with friends, I still travel around the world, and etc. I live a very privileged lifestyle and I am quite thankful for eveything my parents do for me. As of right now, I'm an T-12 Asia B (YAY BUTTHOLE!!) and have both hip flexors and adductors at level 2 while my hamstrings and glutes are a level 1. So a bit of return but not a lot, but I am greatful for whatever comes back!

The issue that I face right now is that my dad refuses to give up on me walking. I've had a talk with my mom and she said ""As long as you're happy and taking care of yourself I'm here to support you all the way"". My dad on the other side sees me as someone who can't do anything for himself although I'm just as active as I used to be. Granted it's a bit more inconvinient now than I was able bodied, but I understand that it's not a magical fix. How did ya'll tackle with parents not wanting to admit that their child now has a SCI? My dad is constantly sending me to therapies he thinks will make me walk again. It's gotten so bad that he wants me to give up on school and my internship (that I just got!!!) so I can only focus on recovery. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks :)

6nftev,8,2017-07-15,How did I get here?,saloums7,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6nftev/how_did_i_get_here/,"Little context. So I had been dating this girl, my soul-mate I thought, for almost two years. I was going to pop the question next year. I was ready.


So I'm a University student in software engineering. Never really worried about my grades my whole life, I always did really well. This past year (last 2 semesters) I got stuck with the shittiest partners for pretty big projects. So naturally I started freaking out. One of them even tried to plagiarize on the biggest project I've ever worked on and the rest of my team (team of 6) refused to go see the teacher.

Things at home weren't too great either, mom had a herniated disc, spent 2 years without work (so 4 people living off of 1 salary). Dad is always stressed since he works nights.

My escape from all of this was my girlfriend.

Early may, I started a new internship. A week in, she decides to break up with me. Her reasons being : I am stressed and can't deal with it, I get angry for no reason (at random people, never treated her like anything else than a princess), she felt I hated people. And sex. If my mind is busy thinking and worrying about shit, how am I supposed to give her what she needs?

She would help me through it, help me forget it all. But it was too much on her.

Ever since, I've been feeling like total shit. No motivation whatsoever to even finish my internship, things keep going wrong (uncle tried to commit suicide, aunt got into a car accident and almost died).

I've been seeing a therapist for about 6 weeks now, but I don't feel it's helping. Directly after leaving I'll feel okay, I'll walk out with my head held high. The next day I'm back to my self-loading, panic attack, social anxiety daily life.
I am disgusted by how I am reacting to all of this... 
But how could I not?

The only person I found comfort in being with, just dumped me like a bag of garbage and won't even say hi anymore (she claims she wants to be friends).
How can I be okay when the only person I want treats me like yesterday morning's shit.

I've lost my mind... I've lost all motivation to do anything. I've lost weight (I barely eat), didn't have much weight to begin with either... The only thing I haven't done was act on those pesky dark thoughts I had that first weekend...

I hate my life."
6ngjae,3,2017-07-15,[M4F] Care of Magical Creatures,Dr_JS,Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/6ngjae/m4f_care_of_magical_creatures/,"*It was hard for Hagrid. Hogwarts had been the only home he'd known since his childhood. He had shed blood here, in battles and to the blast ended skrewts. He had made friends here. He had found family here.*

*However, with Professor McGonagall's retirement last year, the last familiar face was gone from the school. Flitwick, Trelawny, Vector, and Sprout had all moved on to other career opportunities or to the contented boredom of retirement.* 

*Plus, at 89 years old, he was no longer as spry as he once was. His bushy beard and wild mane of hair were as silver as Dumbledore's had been. His joints ached and his back was tight. He could no longer, single handedly, carry the 12 Christmas trees into the Great Hall. He could no longer remember the names of the Centaur foals or keep track of his teaching duties. It was time to retire.* 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had some large shoes to fill, both figuratively and otherwise, taking over duties for Hagrid. He had been the grounds keeper for longer than many could remember and a very capable Care of Magical Creatures teacher to boot. He was my favorite teacher during my time at Hogwarts and, if I allow myself a hint of immodesty, I believe I was one of his favorite students. Not to take away from the famed witches and wizards that he knew. But, I think he saw a bit of himself in me. Most wizards, after all, are an indoor lot. They relish their libraries, their bubbling cauldrons, and dark lairs of contemplation. Hagrid and I were of a different sort. 

Growing up, I relished the woods behind my home. Hiking. Swimming. Climbing. Running. Searching every nook and cranny, aching to soak up each droplet of sunlight and understand every square inch of my small kingdom. I had an affinity for animals, even then. They found me, ran with me, played with me, and protected me. I didn't know it, then, for what it was... Magic. 

Muggle born and unsure what to think when I received my letter, I arrived at Hogwarts and, unlike my classmates, felt drawn not to the Castle with all of its glittering candles and translucent ghosts but to the forest and the lake... I could hear them, calling me. Their voices were so much more complex than the ones I had heard growing up. The animals behind my house were babbling toddlers and these creatures were speaking. I could hear the unicorns, the squid, even the acromantula. I relished the subtle variations in their auras, the minute differences in the way I sensed them. None of this even came close to my elation at meeting the Centaur or the Merpeople. 

I was sorted into Ravenclaw and thrived in all my subjects, though Care of Magical Creatures was my speciality. I earned 8 OWLs and 5 NEWTs (Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Herbology, and, of course, Care of Magical Creatures). Yet, I didn't spend my free time studying in the Library. Instead, every spare moment would find me running through the grounds, climbing in the forest, swimming with the giant squid, or visiting with Hagrid. 

He took an interest in me. Tutored me. Fostered my love for all creatures, the magical and the mundane. When I graduated, he even contacted a close friend of his, Charlie Weasley, and got me a summer internship studying Dragons in Romania.

After graduation, I spent the next 5 years following in the footsteps of the great Newt Scamander. I explored the wilds of the world, cataloging and updating many of his entries in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" and trying to make my own mark on Magizoology. 

I was in Greece, studying the mating and nesting habits of Griffons, when I received Hagrid's letter. He told me of his plans to retire and that he had suggested my name to the new Headmaster as his replacement. He asked if I would be interested. I dropped everything. Like Hagrid, my time at Hogwarts was the happiest of my life and being a teacher there had always been my dream. Once more, the old game's keeper was looking out for me. 

And, so, a new adventure begins... The sun glinting bright off the windows of the castle and the surface of the lake, I stand, awaiting the arrival of my very first class. So much to learn, so little time.

6ngv9s,2,2017-07-15,"My [21M] first ever girlfriend [21F] of 3.5 years suddenly broke up with me, and I am not sure what to do now.",xGibz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ngv9s/my_21m_first_ever_girlfriend_21f_of_35_years/,"This post will probably be lengthy, but I will try to be as concise as possible.

As the title says, my girlfriend of 3.5 years suddenly broke up with me. For the most part I did not have any idea that it was going to happen. We both started full time summer jobs, so we were not able to see each other except on the weekends. In our relationship she has been the one who needs more affection and attention than I do, so I knew that not seeing each other daily would bother her somewhat. However my job was just an internship lasting 3 weeks, so I thought that we would be able to get through it without much of a problem. Then one day after work she texted me and said she was going to come over, which I thought was just a nice surprise because she is usually so busy, but then we talked and said that she thought we should break up.

The break up completely blindsided me. For almost our entire relationship, we always said how much we loved each other, how excited we were to get married one day, and even talked about names for our future kids. Even if I made a joke about us not being together she would get sad and say something like ""Don't joke about that, I never want to lose you"". I never would have thought we wouldn't end up together.

She was my motivation for everything. Anytime I was struggling at work or in college I would just think of her and building a life together after school and I would push through. Since the break up, I haven't had much motivation to do anything. I have been on anti-anxiety medicine since I was 10, and the break up is causing the anxiety to spike. I don't think I am depressed, nor do I have any thoughts at all of self-harm, but I just don't know where to go from here.

This was my first girlfriend ever, so I have never had to get over any sort of break up, let a lone one of this magnitude. She said her reasoning behind the break up was that she wanted some time to herself to decide what she wants to do with the rest of her life. She said I did nothing wrong, but we talked face to face about a week after the break up, and she told me somethings that she wanted out of a relationship. She also said that she needed some space and wasn't promising we would get back together, but there was a chance we do. I want to tell her my thoughts, such as I feel like she never told me what she wanted out of the relationship until after we broke up, and that I want a second chance.

So overall, I am unsure where to go from here. I want to give her the space she needs, but I also want to talk to her and explain my feelings and asking for a second chance. I really do love her, but I feel like I am in purgatory waiting on her to decide if she wants to try our relationship again. Thanks for reading the post and giving me a place to seek advice.

6nh23e,1,2017-07-15,18[M4F] Tease Me Till I Snap,TheSilentWatchman,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6nh23e/18m4f_tease_me_till_i_snap/,"*You and I have known each other our whole lives. Our fathers are best friends, and run a law firm together. As a result we spent a fair amount of together while growing up. We were never best friends, but we got along well enough and enjoyed each others company.*

*However, for years I've wanted you. You're four years older than me, when you were fifteen and I was eleven you joined your high schools cheer squad, your uniform fit your body perfectly, and the sight of you in it practically jump started puberty for me. And as we got older you only got hotter and my lust for you grew. When I was thirteen and you were seventeen our families went on a joint vacation to the Caribbean, while we were there you and I took a picture together on the beach. I kept a copy of that photo in my room, and would often jerk off to it. Your body was so perfect, especially in the bikini you wore that day.*

*I never acted on my desires, fearing that you'd reject me or that it would make things weird given how often we saw one another, but by the time you left for college I could barely keep myself from getting hard whenever I was around you.*

*After you left, my lust died a little bit, you were still without a doubt the hottest women I'd ever seen. I still wanted you, and I still used that photo when horny, but I wasn't as filled with desire for you. I'd even dated and fucked one of the girls who had joined the cheer squad your senior year. But each time you came home, I noticed you become even hotter.*

*This past year I started as a Freshman at the college you attended. You were doing an extra semester and my parents had asked you to show me around and watch out for me while you were still at school. As a result we ended up spending more time together in a few months than we had since you left for school.*

*It drove me mad! You had spent all summer at an internship for a company you wanted to work for. I hadn't seen you since the previous Christmas, and since then you'd somehow gotten so much better looking. The lust I'd had for you in my early teens returned tenfold, but I still didn't act on it. You were fucking perfect, and I couldn't imagine confronting you with my desire.*

*You found out though. For Christmas this year, your parents decided to go on a second honeymoon. As a result you were staying with my family through the holiday. I tried not to, I didn't want to risk it with you sleeping down the hall, but I broke. Earlier that day I had walked in on you changing, you were only wearing a bra and panties, and I couldn't get the picture out of my head. That night, when I thought everyone had gone to bed I jerked off to that picture in my head. Moaning your name under my breath, almost grunting it.*

*You caught me. You'd left your phone charger in my room and came to get it, and instead you found me, half naked, hard cock in my hand, moaning your name. Before I could react you had stripped down and mounted me. We didn't fuck long, I had already been close when you barged in. But it was the greatest pleasure I'd ever felt. You seemed to have enjoyed it as well. Before you went back to your room you told me* *""Just let me know if you want to do that again."" *

*It's been a week since then and I haven't taken you up n your offer, fearing that it was some kind of joke on your part. Meanwhile you've grown impatient, and have decided that if I won't make the first move, you will.*

In this Roleplay, I want you to seduce me. How you do it is up to you. Maybe you just tease me until I snap and pin you to the ground. Maybe you still have your high school cheer uniform and decided to fulfill my earliest fantasy. However you do it, I want to be teased and seduced by you. Don't worry, you won't be in charge the whole time. Once you break me down, I'll be much more aggressive. ;)

Kinks: Being seduced, teasing, semi-rough sex, spanking(giving, not receiving). Breastplay, anal, oral, and cumplay.

Turn offs/Will not do: Toilet play, incest, rimming.

I absolutely hate my job, hate my boss, and the majority of the people I work with. I'm currently working on getting my masters so I can get a new better job, bachelor in social work doesn't get much for the area we live. 

In the spring I have to start an internship, so I will be working full time and having a part-time internship, which leaves basically no time for baby or husband. Hubby has offered to pick up a part-time job, serving so not too many hours but good tips, that way I can quit, work on completing my degree and getting a better job, and stay home with Orson almost full time(only daycare when I'm at my internship). It would be totally temporary and once I graduated and got a new job Orson would go daycare fulltime and hubby would drop the second job. But this would then leave no time for hubby to have with baby and me. 

So the advice I need is what would you ladies do? Am I crazy for trying to do this all right now? I basically have three options: suck it up and never see Orson for almost 5 months while I finish my internship and do my full time job, husband take the fall and never see Orson while leaving me to stay home and complete just my degree, or drop the schooling and start again once Orson and any future kids are older. The last option leaves me at this current position however. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel selfish taking my husband's offer, a slacker for not finishing my degree, and a terrible mom.."

Now that I've finally achieved ""older man"" status, my lust for cute, college co-eds (and alliteration, apparently) has only grown. I'm hoping to meet a very specific girl for an ongoing sex-based relationship. To clarify: I'm searching for a rich, innocent-looking, virginal/inexperienced girl who is craving sex and to live out all of the desires she's kept locked up in her mind until now.    
    
I imagine your body is aching for sexual release, but you're so, so shy. You're not big into partying, and you're worried about what will happen to your reputation if your social circle discovers how much you're craving sex. I'm *very* open-minded, so regardless of whether your fantasies are very mild or really dark and twisted: I'm here to help you get the toe-curling orgasms you need without any kind of judgement. No one will ever know what we do together.    
    
Maybe you're a midwestern virgin transplant who grew up in a conservative house and wants to break loose and lose your virginity while learning how to be incredible in bed without anyone knowing? I'm skilled in the sack and will help you through your first time so much more thoroughly and considerately than the clumsy fumblings of some clueless kid you meet in class or at a party. Or perhaps you have certain fetishes you think about but are too embarrassed or ashamed to ask anyone you know to try them out with you. Ask me, instead.    
    
I'm from a similar background as you, intelligent, very handsome, athletic, sane, clean, and sexually experienced. I will make sure you always feel safe and comfortable, and will never cross your boundaries until you tell me to.    
    
You attend classes at a good university here in the city (or are here for a summer internship) and live alone in a nice apartment that your parents pay for. You're always shaved/waxed with smooth skin, have tons of designer lululemon gear for your expensive workout classes, and are the classic ""girlie girl"".    
    
Come get the dick you need. I'm waiting to hear from you!"

Speaking about not deserving you start thinking even shittier stuff, you time in high school where you were made fun of by your so called 'friends' but it wasn't actually their fault because you were a vulnerable fuck and they were successful in life ad even more social and they could speak to girls but you found solace in playing computer games all day. Your mom used to say stop playing games and youll regret but then you used to make shitty online friends who were strangers on facebook and used to think you got social life all figured out but then you realized you expected too much from yourself and still ended up lonely even though you parents warned you ad today you have hatred for your parents because you think they spoiled you a lot even if you convince yourself not to hate them. 


Then your high school friend calls and rants about how things are going well in his life, the jobs and the money he is earning at a top ivy league school and getting better contacts and in general having a good social life while just taking in his words and thinking to yourself how shit your social life still is and you speak to your roommates just because you really have to but it gives you false confidence of speaking to new people outside but then you fuck that up in the first go and go back into submission again. Then your friend opens up about his problems then you feel guilty about you having problems because your friend is probably successful because he worked hard and you did not and your problems are insignificant beacuse you are a lazy fuck and in retrospect you never actually did anything to improve your life and blame your parents to spoil you. Then you try to find motivational stuff online about depression and anxiety which calms you down and motivates you a but but then you think that it is too late to change at 22 and you might as well fuck yourself up even more(thanks brain) and then you keep doing jack shit on the internet instead of studying for interviews and learning new skills but then you are reminded that you came to a new country thinking you will be a new man but its the same shit but the weather is cool. But then nothing has changed because your inner  core is still an asshole piece of shit and you remember the times where you thought when you were the victim but actually the way you spoke and behaved was objectively wrong and embarrassing. And then you feel sorry about yourself because you took 60k in student loans just to study in a new country and could no keep your own promise of changing into a better person and you feel guilty for wasting your parents money while you see everyone else in your university responsible, gettings jobs, working out managing their time well, and then you still think its too late to change because you have embedded irresponsibility in your brain for the past 22 years you might as well continue to be a fucking disgrace to everyone else and your entire family while still being surprised that everyone feels aversion when talking to you and you are not invited by your classmates to outings because you said 'no' everytime they invited you before. Then one of your roomates says that its not too late, just keep preparing and working hard you will be successful then you realise they had worked harder than you in the last 22 years of their life then you will ever do in your life times 100. 

But your fucking brain gets motivated for a fleeting half and hour but then you waste your time looking at posts on getdisciplined subreddit to validate yourself but then it speaks about how you have to actually get your ass off the bed and work on things, but instead you use that motivation from the advice to fucking play video games all day because you think you have everything figured out but a little bit of gaming wont hurt. But then the motivation leaves you and you see a message from you mom and dad from home and then you miss home. You dont want to hate your parents but your brain makes you blame them for your shortcomings because in fact, it was actually your fault for being such a pussy. Then you start behaving like a fucking child and attention whore to your parents even at the adult age of 22. You try to take medication but then it would allow you to objectively assess yourself as a fucking asshole and you are too scared of realizing that. Might as well wallow in your own victim speak and self pity to realize what a fucking disgrace you are to this world. Then you resort to reading and laughing at memes on this subreddit because you think laughing at your own insecurities is good but then again you arereminded about your current responsibilities and go back to your bed. This makes you perform worse in the university you have so far come to another country to attend and that in tirn makes you feel bad about your parents hard earned money and student loans. But you mom and dad still say that they love you and you feel like crying so you are crying all night in your bed. Then the cycle takes place you feel sad further because you are crying at age of 22 while you classmates are partying or spending time studying during the weekends. Then thinking all of this basically makes you stoic but its not actually that but its because you are broken beyond repair but your brain thinks you have life all figured out..

6nikzf,16,2017-07-15,"Well, today was not a good day",Fuzzy3Cat,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6nikzf/well_today_was_not_a_good_day/,"I've been lurking around this sub for about a year now, so I'll quickly share my story before my rant.

In August 2016 I was offered a full-time contract in the company where I was doing an internship. I was required to fill in some paperwork for the health insurance, which included a questionnaire asking for my height, weight, blood pressure and overall health info.

So I went to a pharmacy to have my BP and weight measured. And, well, it scared me. I was the heaviest I had ever been in my life (123kg), and my blood pressure was high. I mean, I was fat all my life, but my BP was always OK!

I found this sub some time after that (I guess I was looking for weight loss tips) and that's when I downloaded MFP and started CICO. I was on and off CICO since then, and got serious back in June. I'm currently at 115kg.

So, moving to the post title.
Today I gave in to a binge. It's Saturday, I was home alone. I was lazy. I got bored. And you know what happens when you get bored. I gave in. And I ate. Above my maintenance, I believe.

So here I am, feeling crappy about this binge day. In addition, I've been feeling like a fake the last days regarding my weight loss whenever I mention it to someone. 
I mean, CICO (plus walking and some dancing) is working for me, but whenever the subject of weight loss comes into conversation, I feel that telling people ""I eat pretty much everything including candy and just make sure it's under a calorie limit"" sounds more like fatlogic than saying ""I am doing this new diet where I just eat chicken and broccoli every day"". I know, I know, I shouldn't worry about what people think and all that. But yeh, eventually I do.

So, this is it. Crappy thoughts, a binge day, and trying on a t-shirt that I bought last year at my heaviest and noticing it fits exactly the same. I know I just have to stick with this. I know tomorrow I will try to stick to my deficit. I know eventually I will get to my first goal, and then set another goal and get to it, and so on. 

But today I feel crappy, and decided to post here, hoping to get some support.

The silver lining? My binge today was nothing compared to when I was at my heaviest. I mean, I could eat a chocolate bar, a large bag of potato chips, a bag of cookies AND top everything with chocolate milk. I don't want to list what I ate today here so I won't feel worse (but don't worry, I tracked **everything** into MFP), but clearly wasn't near my worst days. So at least there's that :)"
6niy7h,1,2017-07-15,[Programmer and Graphic Artist Needed] Text-Based Gangster Game (PBBG) [RevShare/Hobby],higherpower420,gameDevClassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/6niy7h/programmer_and_graphic_artist_needed_textbased/,"EDIT: Created new post to fix typo in title as it was addressed in numerous PMs. This is a rev share project to begin, but contracts can be determined. 

Looking to get together a small team to create a text based gangster game similar to mafiareturns.com ; barafranca.com ; and mafiamatrix.com

I DO NOT want to do a clone. I want to create our own PBBG game that borrows some of the elements from the other games.

Before I get into game details, I would like to describe what I need first and what roles will be filled.

* Producer/Writer/Partial Coder - Me - To be honest, I do not have extensive experience in PHP, HTML, or CSS. However, I managed several of these games in the past and can dabble in a little coding. I also have a little experience in MySQL, but again not a lot, so I will not be the lead coder. I will handle production and storyline mostly. I will write the story of the game, the bible (tutorial/wiki), as well as flesh out any random events that we want in the game. 

On the production side, I will host the website, get the necessary resources. I will also submit our site for advertising as well as on voting websites to get exposure as well. I'll also set up social media, etc.

* Lead Programmer - **VACANT** - This person will be the LEAD programmer and will handle most coding duties. You will need to be experienced in many web based coding languages as well as server side ones (PHP, HTML, AJAX, MySQL. Perl, Java, and others are a plus!). You will also work with me in balancing the coding for attacks, items, cron jobs, and more.

* Lead Graphic Designer / Artist - **VACANT** - This person will lead and handle most of the UI and design aspect of the game. We will discuss user-friendly colors and interface in detail. This person will also handle images in the game as needed such as default profile pics, etc.

* Coders/Designers - **VACANT** - This position will be filled as needed. These people will assist the lead coder and designer in completing projects that will be implemented in-game.

* Admins/Moderators - **NOT OPEN AT THE TIME** - This position will be filled as the game is developed into a playable state. These people will be the first testers of the game and will help us balance it out. They will also Admin and Mod the game when we allow players, in order to maintain a fun and safe environment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I will discuss the game details to answer any potential questions and peak interest.

GAME DETAILS:

Persistent Browser Based Game - Text Based with Graphics such as map, avatar/profile pics, etc.

Gangster Theme - Time period can be discussed. But I was thinking of a modern feel. This will allow us to avoid any issues with historical accuracy.

Players will sign up and create an account. They will then create a new player if it is their first time (or died). Players then have a choice. Live a life of crime, a life in law enforcement, or be a business person.  From there they will work their way up that path and interact with other players.

The idea is for players to choose an initial lifestyle and see where it leads them. Other players can influence it as well.

For instance, Player A joins as a law enforcement official. He has been doing many jobs and is working his way up the ranks of law officials. Player B is rising to the top as a mobster and has been running his crew for some time. He's ready to expand. Player A is making decent money but knows he can make more. He also has been able to sting some of the other lazy gang players and has drugs that he can turn in or sell. Player A and Player B interact in-game and Player A explains that he can help Player B in his city if Player B promises to keep Player A's pockets filled. Player B agrees and Player A uses his law influence to crackdown on rival gangs giving an advantage to Player B. Meanwhile, after months, Player C who is the Head of Law in that city finds out about Player A and has him killed.

I think it will be interesting how players interact. Who will be snitches or crooked, or actually be loyal to their respective people.

I also want to implement a PVP system in which players can kill each other and death is permanent. If a player dies they must restart only gaining a small bit of money from their previous account.

Below is a basic idea of how different paths can flow:

Crime: Gangster does crimes and ranks up until they can join a crew or create their own. Crews also have their own ranks that players gain XP and work towards. The ultimate goal is to become Godfather or Kingpin of the city and ultimately the game.

Law: Recruit does jobs until they rank up high enough to join a district or become a private investigator. Then they work on missions to take down NPC and real player gangsters/businessmen to gain XP and cash. The ultimate goal is to become Head of a City Department or join the Feds.

Business: Interns start doing 'odd jobs' until they are ranked high enough to work for another business or start their own. Then they continue to do jobs and projects making more cash. The ultimate goal is to become a top business person in your city or join the Illuminati.

And again, every path can interact with each other. For instance, business people can hire police or gangsters to disrupt other businesses, or a business person can kill another business person.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't want to bore everyone with details, so if you would like to discuss more, please PM me. I am also working on a GDD so I can organize notes a bit better. 

If anyone is interested in working on this project with me, please PM me. I am looking to get the domain name and hosting ASAP so we can get started. I will edit this post and fill positions above as they are filled.

Also if you are wondering how revenue can be paid while still keeping the game enjoyable and not pay to win, I can discuss that as well."

6njgqv,15,2017-07-15,"Idea for new healer: Talon Scientist, ""Philosopher.""",TheCaptainCog,Overwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/6njgqv/idea_for_new_healer_talon_scientist_philosopher/,"I think they need to do the Talon Scientist next. There was a post earlier about one earlier. I took the idea and ran with it.

Talon Scientist, code named, ""Philosopher"", better known as Logan Scott. He's a Canadian born scientist who, at a young age, was entranced by the idea of the super soldier Jack Morrison. He wanted to be a super soldier himself and create his own army to beat the bad guys. In his high school days, he revered the newly created Overwatch. After much hard work, he eventually landed a scientific internship on the Overwatch research and development team. Here he began to increase his experience and scientific knowledge. 

Over his time here, Logan came to be labelled as a prodigy in medical augmentation technology. Logan managed to make break-through after break-through, increasing Overwatch's already incredible technology. Then, he got his chance to really shine. He was appointed senior research assistant to Angela Ziegler. Together with Angela, they managed to perform the most advanced and heaven defying operation done to date. They managed to take a man who had literally half and arm, a heart, and his head left, and save his life. They gave him a robotic body. They saved a man who had literally been cut in half. 

From here, Logan gained the trust of most of Overwatch, and had come to hold a high amount of respect in the scientific division. Now he began to perform the research he really wanted - superior human transmogrification. He wanted to create soldiers tens or hundreds of times as powerful as Jack Morrison, whom he idolized. 

After years of research, he had the formula. He had successfully turned normal mice into tiny super soldiers. He presented to the team of Overwatch, including Jack Morrison, only to be rejected. He begged them to reconsider. They denied. Because of this, he almost lost his position. If it weren't for his genius mind and contributions, he would have been fired already.

Devestated, Logan began to make other arrangements. If Overwatch didn't want his genius, maybe some other organization did? This was at the time of Talon's beginning. It could barely be considered a terrorist organization now, as it had a few people leading it with no real experience. One of the meaders names was Akande Ogundimu. 

Akande was a man of pride, intelligence, and decisive action. He prided strength and evolution over all. Which was why, when Logan offered services to Akande, he realized this opportunity. Secretly, Logan and Akande began to collude, and Talon as we know it began to rise. 

Soon after this, a young girl by the name of Amelie Lacroix was captured and brainwashed. Logan had been tempting an idea to replicate the insane accuracy of Ana Amari. He realized, through some medical surveys, the Ana actually had the ability to slow her heart rate before she made her shots. Logan thought, ""Why not simulate this?"" His first attempt was with Widowmaker. He created a way to simultaneously decrease heart rate while maintaining normal function of the body's cells. The purple colour that arose was because of the lowered heart rate from the treatment. But conversely, the amount of oxygen carried by each blood cell was increased 10 fold. Amelie only needed to breath once every thirty seconds now. 

At the same time, Logan began to hate Overwatch and everyone in it. Except for Gabriel Reyes. Gabriel was different from the others in Overwatch. Gabriel wanted more strength for the team, but was opposed by Jack and the rest. Soon Logan and Gabriel became friends. This relationship was vehemently opposed by Jesse McCree. Jesse saw something in Logan that was too similar to his past self. But Gabriel didn't listen. And this led to the present circumstances. 

The downfall of Overwatch occurred. Gabriel Reyes was killed, and Mercy tried to revive him. But for some reason, instead of saving him, Gabriel was turned into a wraith-like form; an undying soldier. This was the work of Logan. He had created a new formula for testing. He called it, ""The Undying"". Logan and Angela performed medical procedures together now. It was Logan who turned Gabriel into Reaper. But the only one who knows this is Logan. 

After the incident and Overwatch disbanded, Logan naturally went to Talon. Logan and Akande were watching Gabriel the whole time. After his ""treatment"", Gabriel began to spiral into depression. He couldn't return home. He couldn't work anywhere. Just the sight of his half-exposed bones made people run in terror and summon the local law enforcement. Reaper became a mercenary. And an effective one. The very sight of the cloaked figure made his targets void their bowels. The name, ""Reaper"", became a legend in the underworld. If Reaper was called on you, he would take you without fail. Then, Logan stepped in. He offered his friend a position in Talon. Now Gabriel had a place again. It was like the Overwatch days again. 

Then this leads to the present day. Ok, there was a lot of stuff here and it was pretty much a dump, but I can see a Talon scientist fitting in perfectly in this way. 

Playstyle wise, i was thinking he would have augmented his own abilities with super charged fluid.  His whole playstyle is around healing and augmentation. His primary fire shoots blobs of healing fluid as a projectile. The longer you hold it, the further the shot goes. On impact, it explodes into a small aoe area. His alternate fire dumps fluid in a cone in front of him. It heals for half of his blobs, but will hit anyone around him.

His passive is, ""Damage Transmogrification."" Any damage he takes is changed into energy, which creates activated fluid. Activated fluid adds 25 - 50 to healing abilities. Activated fluid is rapidly depleted. Any health lost on Logan will be healed by activated fluid. 

His first ability is, ""Pain Transmogrification."" He shoots a bolt of electricity into an ally which alters their perception of pain. For 5 seconds, any damage dealt is halved, with the other half delayed until the ability is used up. After the 5 seconds, all delayed damage is released. This delayed damage can be healed before the ability finishes. 

His second ability is, ""Damage Transmutation."" Logan shoots a cloud of nanites at an enemy. Half of the damage dealt by this character is converted into Active Fluid. This effect lasts 3 seconds.

His ultimate is, ""Undying Elixir."" Logan shoots an ally with the completed form of the chemical cocktail used on Reaper. For 3 seconds, an ally hero becomes untargetable by anything. 

Philosopher would be a 3 star healer. It is hars to hitbhis projectiles, and timingbhis abilities with allies will make him a god or a peasent.

6njlv3,1,2017-07-15,Sunday-Thursday schedule,Nikiflix,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/6njlv3/sundaythursday_schedule/,"I'm looking to move up in my company and currently have a Monday-Friday schedule. The new job position I seek is Sunday-Thursday. It also involves on-call responsibilities once every 8 weeks. I am a full-time graduate student and I'm looking to intern soon too. I am unhappy in my current position as I am not learning any thing new. The new position also pays significantly more than my current position. My partner is supportive of this schedule but I'm unsure if this responsibility is fitting. I really like the job and that it's pays much more, but I'm fearful I will not be able to handle it. I do have a slim chance to use the new position as my internship but it's not set and I still have to ask. The position would greatly help my career in the long run. It boils down to taking more responsibility and saying goodbye to my Sundays off.

Any advice on what I should do and does anyone work Sunday-thursday have advantages or disadvantages?"

**Alternate Friends Title** - The One where Callie’s Dad Is the Hotel Manager from Pretty Woman [(clip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91ET3y4q5Os)

**Random Thoughts**

- I’ll start with an unpopular opinion. This is one of my favorite episodes. The future of Izzie and George aside, I really enjoyed the angst of that Izzie and George scene when he remembered what they did.
- So Elizabeth Moss was totally in this episode.
- Cristina’s patient in the clinic. I felt so bad for him. This is why I don’t go to the doctor. You come in with a small problem and leave without a foot.
- Alex was so sweet with Ava as he was showing her the faces.
- Mark stole Bailey’s idea with his “right now” plan.
- Callie’s patient’s daughter not wanting the interns to touch her mom. Yeah, I’ve never gotten the appeal of a teaching hospital. Is it cheaper or something? Because I want my doctors to know what they’re doing.
- I just felt bad through that whole lunch scene with her dad. She didn’t even know that her marriage was over.
- Cristina wants a simple wedding. Too bad Burke turns out to be a bigger bridezilla than her.










**Quotes**

- “The laughing, the drinking, the music. Okay, nobody, I mean me, needs to hear George's rendition of Sexy back at 3:00 in the morning.”
- “What am I? The go to person for adultery?”
- “Messing up. It's what makes a person. It's how we learn, where we find joy. And the things you don't plan for are things you never see coming.”


**Questions**

- When you first saw this, how did you initially feel about the George/Izzie hook up?
- Do you ever get frustrated with Cristina’s lack of empathy/terrible bedside manner?

6nk06q,0,2017-07-15,I genuine don't know how I've made it this far-- and I'm terrified,actuallydumbirl,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/6nk06q/i_genuine_dont_know_how_ive_made_it_this_far_and/,"Okay, so I'll preface this by saying that I met with a researcher the other day who is basically giving me a major role in a project involving a *massive* company in the industry and an Ivy League collaborator. It's high stakes, it's long, and he wants me to play a major role and get a major publication. 

I don't know wtf is going on 

First of all, I'm not a good student. I'm a solid B student in pretty much every class, even some of my chemistry courses. I'm garbage at physics (retaking E&amp;M this Fall, at that, but I didn't fail it before). I also don't think I'm generally smart at all. But I've done a lot in chemistry for my age (3rd year university undergrad), which I also think was a fluke. 

And I can prove my incompetence mathematically! GPA aside, or not, I applied for over 30 internships last year and got zero offers. I even got some interviews and wasted my precious time (which could have been used studying, which I need to do a lot of because I'm dumb af), and money, which I also don't have a lot of. But yeah, nothing. Because my GPA is low (above 3.0, but like... barely) and in interviews they probably saw that I'm a dolt anyway. 

But... I accidentally got a job in a lab in high school by being in the right place at the right time, and after high school, got a recommendation from my boss to work for another scientist in industry R&amp;D, did an internship, got an offer back and *rejected* it (for external reasons), but then they recommended me to work with one of the top researchers in my specific field for the year, which I did (but I wasn't given a project or anything, which kind of sucked, but it was good experience anyway), and then the PI there, as well as another person from industry, recommended me to work in a semi-different field on the analytical chemistry end, who recommended me to work with this particular supervisor who wants to give me this massive project. And that's after publishing my work from this summer. 

But again, none of this was organic. If I were to simply email a professor, as I have in the past, they'd either ignore me or tell me that I'm not qualified. When I try for opportunities like normal people, I have around a 10% success rate (since I did get into one lab freshman year, but I didn't love it anyway and only spent the semester. Also, didn't publish or present anything. Bleh). I'm scared that all of these people are recommending me because they're nice and they see things in my *future*, but now I'm actually being given a major project and I don't think I'm smart enough to do it. I'm *terrified*. What if I screw it up and waste millions of dollars? What if I get there my first day and have no idea wtf I'm doing? I know how to *use* a lot of instrumentation, and I can learn pretty quickly, but I hardly know any theory and I guarantee the majority of my peers would do a better job than me. But I've entered this whirlwind of nice people being nice and I've finally been given the pie-in-the-sky project I've always dreamed of, funded, signed, sealed, delivered... and I don't know if I'm good enough for it. I don't know how I even got here. I feel like a child who lost their mom in the supermarket but I'm also on one of those electric carts and I don't know how to turn it off. What do? I'm afraid if I turn down this project, it'll be like, that's it, no more offers for me. 

And also... the project sounds really, really exciting. I'd be working on my favorite instrumentation, in one dank-ass facility, studying a subject that I'm obsessed with. The literature is interesting, the implications are amazing, and the work, if I can do it, sounds fun as hell. But why *me*? I'm not smart enough for this. I'm not even sure I'm smart enough to be in the major half the time. But I like it... and I always have. But some intelligence is just inherent, and I know that I'm lacking in that compared to my peers. So. That's the situation. Any suggestions? Anecdotes? Textual xanax to calm me down?

6nk5ck,2,2017-07-15,"University not recognized by US Government (Yet), and need a visa, what is the best course of action to take?",NightElemental,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/6nk5ck/university_not_recognized_by_us_government_yet/,"I am a student who might be heading to school 42. A programming school created by french billionaire Xavier Niel. That has large success (And government recognition in France). However the new campus is the US opened last year and has no recognition yet. I would be starting in 4 months. What would be the best course of action?

Here is some info that might help.

* I do not have family in the US, however we have multiple friends there.

* My cousins lived in the US before (Not anymore)

* You start payed internships 6 months after you begin the curriculum.

* Dorms are available for the first year.

* I have a swiss passport.

* The cursus is 3-5 years, but since I have previous experience it most likely will be 3 or under.

* I was given a B1/B2 visa to participate in the bootcamp to see if I was good enough and if I was ""Good enough"" to enter.

Because its not recognized by the US government I probably wouldn't be able to get a student visa. Thats' why I am worried.

Basic Info:
-6' 2""

-178 lbs

-Blood Type: AB+

-Eye Color: Gray

-Skin Color: Tanned

-Hair Color: Black

-Age:29

Occupation: Vagabond, Archaeologist

Nen Type: Transmutation

Background: Noel is the byproduct of a prostitute and an unknown wealthy business man. Living in the slums of New Gustav forced Noel to steal, lie, and frame other people for crimes he committed. Though he is the very definition of a dick, he always had a fascination for discovery. After breaking into the home of a world renown archaeologist, Nathan O'hara, he was reformed from a petty thief to be the man he wanted to be. Noel had no formal education, but under the wing of Nathan O'hara, he was given the chance to enter the country's most renown university at the age of 16, and graduated with a PhD in Archaeology by the age of 24. However, Noel learned a lot more from Nathan than the university he attended could have done. He learned and mastered Nen from Nathan. Noel would later travel across the known world, and learned many things about humanity and himself. 

Personality: Noel is reserved and stoic in the face of change of the environment or situation. His moral code permits him to still lie, cheat, and blackmail. However, he will not kill based on principles and morals, but will kill if it is deemed necessary. He's a lot more willing to make compromises than still stubbornly pushed his own agendas but will make sure the compromise gives him the most benefit.

Fritz: The Travelers Many Arms - Transmute nen into fiery arm constructs, however they come in different colors with different abilities. Each type can exist as separate limbs or cling onto arms, similar to a long sleeve shirt. However only two type of arms can be sustained at a time, but the max amount of arms that can be produced are two, with each being the same or different combo.

-Punishment (Red) - Transmutation and Enhancement
   
Cling Onto Arm: It's basically Ko, similar to many enhancer abilities. 
   
Separate Limbs: Punishment can basically be used for climbing, attacking, and basically being an extra set of 
   arms the user. Punishment can stretch 10 meters, and can lift objects that a normal human wouldn't be capable 
   of lifting (about 2 tons).  


-Health Care (Green) - Transmutation and Enhancement
   
Cling Onto Arm: Can heal anyone as long as the users palm is placed on the target's wound, and the target is 
   stationary.
   
Separate Limbs: Health Care can heal anyone, as long as the target is within 10 meters. The healing isn't as fast 
   as the cling version, but will take at least 3 minutes to heal minor wounds and severe wounds about 20 minutes 
   or more.


-Halt (Blue) - Transmutation and Conjuration
  
 Cling Onto Arm: If the user touches the target, the target will not be able to move as long as the user keeps 
   touching the target.
   
Separate Limbs: The arm will wrap the target, however this ability can only be used within the users range of 20 
   meters. It will also cause pain to the target, as the arm will be covered with thorns similar to a rose. The arms 
   can only maintain this bind for 5 minutes.


-Truths (Yellow) - Transmutation and Conjuration
   
Cling Onto Arms: ""Truths"" will coat the user arms in a yellow aura, and at the palms an ankh symbol will appear. 
   When the user place his palm on the target's head, and then ask a question, any information relating to that 
   question will then be received by the user. However, this ability can only be used once a day on the same person.
   
Separate Limbs: Can tell someone is lying or not, if the ankh at the palms of ""Truths"" glows.


Strategy: Was trained in many ancient martial arts by Nathan, and was trained to confront when deemed necessary. And will mainly fight in close combat, or at mid-range. Noel specifically trained to adapt to any environment, and is very crafty and cunning in a fight. He never wins by overpowering his opponent, but by outsmarting them.


Creator's Note:
Noel's hatsu was originally called ""Hammurabi's Arms of Laws"" but then changed to ""Fritz: The Travelers Many Arms"" because I wanted to base it off of an ancient and dead god that Noel might have learned of after his first archaeological dig as an intern."
6nkl1g,13,2017-07-16,The time I fucked someone else’s fiancé,bayareabull,cuckoldstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuckoldstories/comments/6nkl1g/the_time_i_fucked_someone_elses_fiancé/,"I had just graduated college and was spending the summer dicking around still working my on-campus job before shit got serious. There was a girl in my same major and we showed interest in one another but never could coordinate hooking up, she had this and off boyfriend and I had a few women in my life some of which I was trying to be faithful to. Well it was my last fucking shot with this girl and when she popped up in a dream I decided to say fuck it and call her. She was down to get together and catch up, grab a beer no big deal it wasn’t explicit but it was definitely not a date. I forgot to mention how fucking hot this girl was she was 5’10” and thin but with nice curves, Latina with latte colored skin and so chill. She’d turn heads easy in any room she went into but had this awesome personality to go with it. Anyways we get together for this beer and fuck she’s wearing a goddamn ring. She tells me her on and off boyfriend had graduated too and decided to propose to her, they’d been together for years and it was a “logical next step.” Something was up though but wasn’t sure what, so I pursued and found out he was out of town. He was in finance and had some bullshit internship in another state, white dude a total fucking douche bag but was going to have money and would easily be able to support her. We had a good time though and we agreed to get together again in a week. Next time she comes out all dressed up, and wearing makeup I didn’t know my dickhole from drainhole but I immediately knew this chick wanted to fuck. This time was more of date, fucking ice cream, I can’t knock it for working but that shit is so cliché. We chilled for a bit and it was going well so off to drinks. Drinks go well so fuck it, my parent’s have a hot tub and live about 30 mins away so let’s do it. And shit she was down, we went and got her fucking swimsuit and everything. Drive all the way out there mom and dad are already asleep and don’t give a fuck anyways so we go in the hot tub and she starts hinting about having an understanding. We go back to my old bedroom to change and sitting on the bed together kiss and she just busts out with “I want you to fuck me.” But not now and here we need to figure out another time, and it’s cool with her fiancé but can only be a one night stand.

All of these terms were agreeable on my part she got naked in front of me for the first time and I was fucking planning. I did something weird at this point though and had second thoughts up to this point it was only fucking other dudes girlfriends, marriage or at least a proposal seemed more serious. What if I broke them up, or she hold this over his head for the rest of his life? Boyfriends are like favorite shirts and while they might inspire strong feelings they are usually short and replaced with something more reasonable/professional. So I decided let’s have a real date first, I know weird thinking of doing that shit now but she was down and was willing to go the extra mile to close the deal. We met up at a bar and she bought me a drink and that was it, my favorite line from her that night was “Do you want to talk to him?” She wanted to make it clear that he knew she was going to get fucked and wasn’t trying to hide it from him at all. I said no, it wasn’t necessary and I didn’t give a fuck about him anyways, but honestly I was thinking of stealing this chick from him. I wanted to break them up, I was going to fuck her like she’d never been fucked before and maybe she wouldn’t be mine forever but I wanted her to fucking love me. We made out in my car and she rubbed my dick, and looked at me shocked and asked just how fucking big is it? Here’s a tip for you long dicked dudes even if you’re eight inches say seven and half because they have that shit on another level and will be shocked when they think you’re only an inch or two bigger than their man. Under-promise and over-deliver. 

She schedules a day in near future and her roommate won’t be around so we can fuck at her place. Awesome, day comes and blow one out right away as a preemptive measure no minute man shit and got a bottle of wine and some flowers because I’m a pussy. She gets embarrassed by the flowers but she still loved that shit. We drink a glass of wine and it’s on, she strips and is wearing sexy underwear but self-conscious about it, it was fucking cute as shit. She gets naked quick and gets on her knees pulling out my hard cock and says “fuck you have such a perfect cock.” She fucking surprised me at this point and started to shove my cock in her throat, it was such an aggressive opening move and fucking awesome. After a little work I dared her to get all the way down to my balls and she went for that shit gagging along the way but fuck if she didn’t make it. It was amazing, it was the first and only time I was really deepthroated. Every girl tries some bullshit move but end up gagging and tearing up, she got balls deep. She told me how easy it was to have her fiancé throat fuck her but she would start gagging with a couple of inches to go on me. I looked down and there was this big fucking rock staring at me in the face, she was left handed so she was using her hand to stroke my shaft while her mouth worked the head. I mentioned the ring and she paused to tell me that it was a family heirloom passed on to him by his grandmother and had been in the family for generations. Honestly I had a minute here that I thought about karma and how this would come back to me but it sure as shit didn’t stop me. 

So we start fucking and she’s super nervous because she’s not on the pill and she’s Catholic so if she does get pregnant she’s keeping it. She bought these shitty condoms that were to tight and too thick and I couldn’t feel shit so my dick goes soft on her. Fuck, it was the first time this shit have ever happened to me and I started kicking myself for wanking one out earlier. Anyways we take a minute she goes back to sucking it and I put on a condom I brought that I was more familiar with and it was on. I pounded the living shit out of her for hours, we were both covered in sweat and it wasn’t warm that night. She was screaming the whole time, the entire apartment complex knew my name after that shit. I blow a load inside her with the condom on, and we chill there on her bed for a minute and she starts spilling all kinds of shit. First about the fiancé that he was telling her how he was tired of jerking off without her around so she told him to go fuck someone else, but that’s why the door was open for her as well. Then goes into all this shit about how she’s a lesbian and the first person she fucked was this girl in her Catholic High School favorite quote was, “She was fucking ugly but she was down.” The best story of the night was about a friend of hers that was a horsefucker, like literally had a horse at a stable nearby that she fucked on a regular basis. She said when the horse would see her he’d get a fucking hard on. There’s more to that story but this is already too long.

We’re laying there and start kissing again and I’m ready for round two and this time I’m going all out because she’s already cum one hundred times and there was nothing to lose. We fucked for another couple of hours until I knocked this container of change off a shelf near the bed and it hit her right in the face. She took it like a fucking champ and pushed the change off the bed and begged me to keep pounding her. I couldn’t get the second nut out no matter how hard she tried and really went the extra mile, it would have been nice to cum in her throat while she was balls deep but such is life. We got dressed and she noticed that someone had shoved her man’s mail under the door while we were going at it. She was screaming so much we never heard it. Then I learned that her fiancé lived in the same building and his roommate was dropping off his mail to her door while he was away. So now the whole apartment complex full of college kids would totally know what was up, so much for being subtle. 

I left feeling like she was mine at least sexually and she agreed to hooking up again, if I could find another girl that was down to fuck us both. We got together again a short time later when she was on the rag and something was off, she was over it and started pulling away. She’d rub my cock for a minute and then trail off, I wanted more but it didn’t happen. Then it was not returning phone calls and it was over a couple weeks later. I hit her up over email several months later to see what she was up to. She said that they had broken up, it didn’t have anything to do with me but she realized they weren’t a good match and it wouldn’t last. While we were hooking up she went to this house party and met this other dude, they actually got married about a year after she graduated. I was the stunt cock, she liked me but had other dude that had his own house, well educated and world traveler. If I was her I would have made the same decision, get my brains fucked out while I could and get someone else to pay the fucking bills.

I am rising senior at my university studying Physics. (I would have done aerospace engineering but because of my family situation I had to go to this school which doesn't have that program). During an internship this summer I worked quite a bit with controls and autonomy of UAVs. It got me really excited about the field and I want to pursue it in graduate school. I realize that this field would require a strong foundation in computer science and I have only taken 2 computer science course that were, for the most part, introductions to languages. This is where I have 2 big questions that I'm hoping y'all could help me with.

1) Are grad schools with aerospace engineering controls and autonomy programs less likely to accept me because of how few CS courses I have taken?

2) Should I take an extra semester or even extra year to take as many CS courses that I can to be prepared for grad school?

Thank you all for your time and advice!"
6nl0mb,1,2017-07-16,I take horrible decisions,lgdm17,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6nl0mb/i_take_horrible_decisions/,"So a little background, I'm in college (not in the US) and last year I had the chance to go to the US for an awesome summer internship which paid really well. If I did well then I would get a full time job after I graduated which would have been this summer. Guess what, I didn't get it, cause I'm a big fuck-up. So anyways, I push back my graduation a semester to get a lighter course load and had an extra summer vacation. 

After last summer my goal was to get a  job back in the US, specifically at the same company, but it started to consume me little by little. 

Now, my school offers this pretty cool summer programs abroad and I thought I should take one of those. My girlfriend also took one of those in Europe, and I could have gone to the same one, but for some fucking reason I decided to go to a place 4 hours away from where my internship was to a fucking stupid course which was stupidly expensive and it sucked. Halfway through I realized I could have spent the summer in Europe with my girlfriend for a fraction of the price and then spend the rest of the money traveling around the world but I was so fucking blinded by my desire to go back that I never saw the opportunity. Now I've spent almost all my money and even though I had a pretty cool summer in a new city I've been so depressed and my mind can't stop thinking about what I could have done so I haven't been able to enjoy any of it. 

I guess the good part is that I've learned a lot about myself. Mostly that I'm a fucking idiot, I take horrible choices, and I can't appreciate what I have. 

Now I feel like I missed an opportunity of a lifetime and I'll never get it back. 

I fucking hate myself. "

Currently, I am taking about approximately 27k a year for my state college. 7k is in unsubsidized student loans, and 20k from a state loan program.

Currently it will look like I will graduate with with everything equal:

* 28k in Unsubsidized Loans at 4.5%
* 40k in State Loans at 4.5%
* 40k in State Loans at 6.6% (rate went up this year)

Income wise, I have signed for an internship next summer that offers a prorated pay of 85k for the 10 week program, so about 16k in total. This is in a major city in a low COL state.

Most likely, I will stay with that firm full time and will receive a 85k salary with a 30k-60k bonus, so a total compensation of 115k-145k. This will be the same location but I will need to have a close apartment to downtown due to the hours, but will be able to split with friends. COL would probably be around 30k-40k from my estimates.

Overall, after utilizing my employer match on 401k, would seem like a reasonable goal to pay off that debt in 3-5 years? What factors am I not considering that are not ""in the math"" to help me plan? Thanks!"
6nldnl,5,2017-07-16,"Idea for new healer: Talon Scientist, ""Philosopher.""",TheCaptainCog,OverwatchHeroConcepts,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchHeroConcepts/comments/6nldnl/idea_for_new_healer_talon_scientist_philosopher/,"I think they need to do the Talon Scientist next. There was a post earlier about one earlier. I took the idea and ran with it.

Talon Scientist, code named, ""Philosopher"", better known as Logan Scott. He's a Canadian born scientist who, at a young age, was entranced by the idea of the super soldier Jack Morrison. He wanted to be a super soldier himself and create his own army to beat the bad guys. In his high school days, he revered the newly created Overwatch. After much hard work, he eventually landed a scientific internship on the Overwatch research and development team. Here he began to increase his experience and scientific knowledge. 

Over his time here, Logan came to be labelled as a prodigy in medical augmentation technology. Logan managed to make break-through after break-through, increasing Overwatch's already incredible technology. Then, he got his chance to really shine. He was appointed senior research assistant to Angela Ziegler. Together with Angela, they managed to perform the most advanced and heaven defying operation done to date. They managed to take a man who had literally half and arm, a heart, and his head left, and save his life. They gave him a robotic body. They saved a man who had literally been cut in half. 

From here, Logan gained the trust of most of Overwatch, and had come to hold a high amount of respect in the scientific division. Now he began to perform the research he really wanted - superior human transmogrification. He wanted to create soldiers tens or hundreds of times as powerful as Jack Morrison, whom he idolized. 

After years of research, he had the formula. He had successfully turned normal mice into tiny super soldiers. He presented to the team of Overwatch, including Jack Morrison, only to be rejected. He begged them to reconsider. They denied. Because of this, he almost lost his position. If it weren't for his genius mind and contributions, he would have been fired already.

Devestated, Logan began to make other arrangements. If Overwatch didn't want his genius, maybe some other organization did? This was at the time of Talon's beginning. It could barely be considered a terrorist organization now, as it had a few people leading it with no real experience. One of the meaders names was Akande Ogundimu. 

Akande was a man of pride, intelligence, and decisive action. He prided strength and evolution over all. Which was why, when Logan offered services to Akande, he realized this opportunity. Secretly, Logan and Akande began to collude, and Talon as we know it began to rise. 

Soon after this, a young girl by the name of Amelie Lacroix was captured and brainwashed. Logan had been tempting an idea to replicate the insane accuracy of Ana Amari. He realized, through some medical surveys, the Ana actually had the ability to slow her heart rate before she made her shots. Logan thought, ""Why not simulate this?"" His first attempt was with Widowmaker. He created a way to simultaneously decrease heart rate while maintaining normal function of the body's cells. The purple colour that arose was because of the lowered heart rate from the treatment. But conversely, the amount of oxygen carried by each blood cell was increased 10 fold. Amelie only needed to breath once every thirty seconds now. 

At the same time, Logan began to hate Overwatch and everyone in it. Except for Gabriel Reyes. Gabriel was different from the others in Overwatch. Gabriel wanted more strength for the team, but was opposed by Jack and the rest. Soon Logan and Gabriel became friends. This relationship was vehemently opposed by Jesse McCree. Jesse saw something in Logan that was too similar to his past self. But Gabriel didn't listen. And this led to the present circumstances. 

The downfall of Overwatch occurred. Gabriel Reyes was killed, and Mercy tried to revive him. But for some reason, instead of saving him, Gabriel was turned into a wraith-like form; an undying soldier. This was the work of Logan. He had created a new formula for testing. He called it, ""The Undying"". Logan and Angela performed medical procedures together now. It was Logan who turned Gabriel into Reaper. But the only one who knows this is Logan. 

After the incident and Overwatch disbanded, Logan naturally went to Talon. Logan and Akande were watching Gabriel the whole time. After his ""treatment"", Gabriel began to spiral into depression. He couldn't return home. He couldn't work anywhere. Just the sight of his half-exposed bones made people run in terror and summon the local law enforcement. Reaper became a mercenary. And an effective one. The very sight of the cloaked figure made his targets void their bowels. The name, ""Reaper"", became a legend in the underworld. If Reaper was called on you, he would take you without fail. Then, Logan stepped in. He offered his friend a position in Talon. Now Gabriel had a place again. It was like the Overwatch days again. 

Then this leads to the present day. Ok, there was a lot of stuff here and it was pretty much a dump, but I can see a Talon scientist fitting in perfectly in this way. 

Playstyle wise, i was thinking he would have augmented his own abilities with super charged fluid. His whole playstyle is around healing and augmentation. His primary fire shoots blobs of healing fluid as a projectile. The longer you hold it, the further the shot goes. On impact, it explodes into a small aoe area. His alternate fire dumps fluid in a cone in front of him. It heals for half of his blobs, but will hit anyone around him.

His passive is, ""Damage Transmogrification."" Any damage he takes is changed into energy, which creates activated fluid. Activated fluid adds 25 - 50 to healing abilities. Activated fluid is rapidly depleted. Any health lost on Logan will be healed by activated fluid. 

His first ability is, ""Pain Transmogrification."" He shoots a bolt of electricity into an ally which alters their perception of pain. For 5 seconds, any damage dealt is halved, with the other half delayed until the ability is used up. After the 5 seconds, all delayed damage is released. This delayed damage can be healed before the ability finishes. 

His second ability is, ""Damage Transmutation."" Logan shoots a cloud of nanites at an enemy. Half of the damage dealt by this character is converted into Active Fluid. This effect lasts 3 seconds.

His ultimate is, ""Undying Elixir."" Logan shoots an ally with the completed form of the chemical cocktail used on Reaper. For 3 seconds, an ally hero becomes untargetable by anything. 

Philosopher would be a 3 star healer. It is hars to hitbhis projectiles, and timingbhis abilities with allies will make him a god or a peasent.

6nljxb,30,2017-07-16,[Spoiler][Theory] Jackson And April,Maeriii,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/6nljxb/spoilertheory_jackson_and_april/,"Let me just say that this theory MAYBE far stretched but I'm a major Japril shipper so what can I say?

Into the theory: Okay so in the Japril Movie (Episode 11, season 12), we were shown Japril's developments present into past. The last scene when they shows April and Jackson starting as interns at Mercy Death, April states she wanted to have three children. April wants to have two boys and a girl; She already birthed a son and a daughter. So that leads to the question, can she be pregnant again? 

Before you start disagreeing just think about it, in Japril The Sequel (Season 13, Episode 16), they did have a hook up at the end. However, wasn't it mysterious that the filler episode didn't have any buildup to their relationship? I thought so too, I was beyond mad and disappointed. 

However, in the season 13 finale, April confronts Maggie. Telling Maggie somewhere along the lines of, ""Maggie, Jackson likes you. Ask him out. I'm telling you this because I feel like Jackson likes you too."" But you can tell there might've been a little tension.. just by April's tone and how she tried to get to the trauma quick. Also earlier in the finale, when Jackson needed some oxygen. Both Maggie and April yelled at him, but he paid more attention to Maggie. Oh, man, you can tell that April noticed that. Poor Apes. 

Concluding this theory, either April's pregnant from that hotel hook up... or we're gonna get another love triangle with none other than Maggie.

Edit #1: Also, Shonda Rhimes makes sure that no detail goes to waste, so fingers crossed, April's pregnant"
6nm1al,40,2017-07-16,My Experiences: First Rough Fuck,gaythrowaway4444,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/6nm1al/my_experiences_first_rough_fuck/,"For those who haven't read my first few stories, just a reminder: these are my true experiences as a gay early 20s twink in New York. I'm 5'10, body with decent enough definition, brown hair and eyes.

Lucas and I kept up our fuck buddy relationship, having sex at least once a week most weeks. All the while though I stayed on Grindr looking to see what else could happen. I chatted with tons of guys, most of whom flaked, and a few where the sex was pretty disappointing, so I won't write about those. In January, a new face appeared. He was 32, lived in the city, and was visiting his cousin at my school. A little older, but you could see he had been crazy cute when he was younger, and his burgeoning dad bod hid some still solid muscles from playing hockey. I'll call him Jim. We chatted for a few days, getting more and more bold with our conversation, until we set up a date at a gay bar in Manhattan.

I was anxious at my internship that day. I'd never been to a gay bar before, and I'd never met up with someone off Grindr who didn't go to my school. When I got to the bar I walked past it a few times, working up the nerve to go in. When I finally did, he was sitting at the bar and had saved me a seat. He was still wearing his suit from work and my cock jumped a bit in my tight underwear. I sat next to him and we chatted for a long time, before he led me over to the lounge area of the bar where we sat close to each other until he cut off the conversation and asked if he could kiss me.

I nodded, blushing, and in a flash we were making out. He was an amazing kisser and as I moaned around his tongue he told me his apartment was just a few blocks away. I bit my lip and decided to go. We stayed as handsy as you can be in the cab, and the whole way up the stairs to his place he kept his hand on my ass. When we reached his studio he got more aggressive, demanding that I strip and blow him from my knees. I was so horny I couldn't say no, and suddenly I was completely naked, on my knees, with the cock of a fully besuited man poking its way down my throat. And I loved it!

Jim eventually pulled out of my mouth after me attempting to deepthroat him for what seemed like forever, and pulled me to my feet. He kissed me, ignoring the slobber that trying to deepthroat his magnificent thick 7 inch cock had left, and roughly spanked my ass. He shoved me onto his bed while he got undressed, then picked me up and pushed me back down face down. Next thing I felt was Jim's thick talented tongue pushing into my tight ass, getting me nice and wet. I was moaning and moving my hips, trying to fuck myself on his tongue, when he spanked me so hard I saw stars. He lubed up after rolling on a condom, spit in my crack, and thrust in, hard. It was all I could do to stifle my scream as I was still pretty tight and he was in to the hilt and fucking me in seconds, no taking it slow.

Eventually the pain subsided and I started pressing back into him. He noticed and started fucking harder, getting more vocal, calling me his fag slut and asking me if my twinky pussy liked having a mans cock in it. I could barely answer, only moans and a quiet ""fuck me daddy"" could escape from my lips during the fuck. After a while of this he spun me around and, on my back increased his pace and started choking me. This was all I could take and my battered prostate shot stream after stream of thick salty cum into the air. Jim kept going for a while, finally finishing in the condom inside me and collapsing on top of me. All of a sudden he was the sweet guy from the bar again, kissing me lightly and asking if I needed anything while cuddling me. We made out for a little while then I needed to head home, satisfied after a wild fuck.

We saw each other a few times after that, but in March he got a new job in Boston and had to move. And while the later fucks were each amazing, none were anywhere near the first.

Thanks for reading guys! As always comments are welcome, as are dms!"

She broke it off but we remained friends with a benefits / still emotionally involved. After a few months of that being frustrating for me (I just wanted some stability and clarity of where things were heading) I decided to essentially cut contact and let her live her life. She was attending university at the time and I was already graduated. I figured she would move on and have other relationships.

At the start of 2017 we got back in touch and hit if off really well. She has been on an internship out of the country for the past 8 months but we have been talking and rekindling that emotional bond and old feelings. I visited her once and spent the night with her, we were physically intimate and everything is going great. We've talked about trying again for a more serious relationship when she finishes her internship. All good things!

When she first came back into my life this past January, we talked and asked each other if there had been anyone else in the time that we weren't together. We both said, no there hadn't been. Last night we were talking about some old pictures she had put online during that period, one being a photo of her and a guy that went to her university. As it turns out they had went on a few dates but nothing further. At one point he had feelings for her but she didn't reciprocate, at another she had feelings for him but he shut her down.

I told her it was OK that she had tried to get involved with other people why we weren't together. I understand that completely and am fine with it. But for some reason it bothers me that she didn't tell me about it in the first place. It's not that I think she's keeping things from me.. It's just that for this to work (after things breaking down in the past) I want us to have good and open communication with each other. She said that she didn't think it was a big deal and had never gotten over me anyway, that she was only considering this other guy because I wasn't there. (I don't think she's being manipulative, I think this is honesty, but it still makes me feel funny..)

TL;DR - Getting back together with ex-gf. She first said she never was involved with anyone while we were apart, then says there was a guy who she became very close to for nearly a year. Feel confused why she would keep that from me when we're trying to have open and honest communication."

Around 3 years ago, she started have sexual conversation with him on the video chat. She did that while me and my sister were in the same room with her. I didn't know what to do so I tried to talk loudly to my sister and my mom to make her stop doing those things. In the mean while, she kept whispering to him these disgusting things and thought that I didn't realize that. Please keep in mind, we came from a very different culture from the west. She must have thought that i know nothing about sex or not pay attention to her at all. I wondered if my dad knows since she is not even trying to hide the affair, but for some reasons, he doesn't want to acknowledge it. They don't sleep in the same bed anymore. 
 I have met the that guy and talk to him through my mom many times. I want to sceam at them for doing such things to me and to my family. I tried to pretend that nothing happens and my family is still this normal, functional, happy home. My parents always fight over little things and my mom always says that dad doesn't support this family and gives what my mom deserves. I get that mom supports the family financially while my dad doesn't care much about his career or promotions. She paid mostly for everything we have: the car, the house, the land. She paid for my education to study abroad and I'm thankful for that. But I can't help it but hating her and blaming myself. I know that I can't never be successful as her. Im not smart, beautiful and ambitious according to her. After all, I can't even get a job with my accounting degree where I studied at. I went home being the costly disappointment. Right now, I'm doing an internship at her company since I can't get interviews where else. I try everyday pretending to be happy and normal but I don't think I can continue doing that tmr. I keep having negative thoughts in my head and I can't barely do anything. I don't want to find a job, to socialize, and to be in a relationship like other 21 years old women. I don't know what to do anymore. "
6nmtxy,46,2017-07-16,[Happy/Funny] 1000 miles away and couldn't be happier!,spacepunch,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6nmtxy/happyfunny_1000_miles_away_and_couldnt_be_happier/,"TL;DR: dreamt about telling my N(ish)Dad off, and it felt great!

Backstory: my father and mother decided to build their dream house.   We (themselves and my brother) did most of the labor, or they wouldn't have been able to afford it.  They designed it themselves, and that was part of the problem: it had to have EVERYTHING that both of them wanted, and it had to be PERFECT, and they changed their minds a number of times. Guess who had to go back and undo things he had just spent weeks doing (yeah, I did). I felt like they didn't value my time and effort.  (I felt really validated when a contractor they hired told them to quit being ridiculous once... too little too late though.)  

Another factor was that every morning, they would sit down to plan the day's work, which really meant arguing acrimoniously about minutiae and changing their minds every 5 minutes. Then they would chew me out for not being ready to leave the MOMENT they decided they were done, even though they would often go back to arguing again for another hour. It made me feel like they didn't care about wasting my time, and they also would interrupt what I was doing without warning and demand that I stop right away. My father always had to be right about everything, not just factually but morally, so I never felt like I had any ground to stand on when criticizing/challenging them.  This house project turned me from the GC to the scapegoat.  

(Funny sidebar: I realized there always had to be a scapegoat, although I called it ""the demon.""  Someone had to be the carrier of ""the demon"" each day.  On the few days that it wasn't me, it was my mother or brother.  They felt exhausted and angry at the end of those days, and I felt waaaay better, and it made me realize there was something messed up with our family dynamics.)

Why did I put up with this? (1) They guilted me that because they had sacrificed a lot for my education (that's another story...), I owed it to them to work on their project now.  I bought it at the time.  Thanks to this sub, I see know how messed up that was. 

(2) I looked around for other jobs, but they didn't help/encourage me.  They had also hammered into me from a young age that service work was too low-class for our family, so I never even considered normal things like waiting tables.  I did try to get them to pay me: ""If I had a different job and got paid, would you take the money away from me?""  They actually agreed with my logic, but then snowed me with excuses that they couldn't afford it. Another issue was the fact that they didn't encourage me to get a driver's license at all, and in fact encouraged my fear of learning to drive. This was part of a general pattern of not really setting me up for independence/adulthood.  

(3) They were inspired by another (similarly authoritarian) family who had built a house this way, and claimed it was a great family bonding experience.  In fact, everyone at church thought it was so cool, and that my parents were great for having raised such obedient children.  I felt like I couldn't vent/complain/seek validation because nobody wanted to hear that my parents were being shitty to me and that I hated working for them for free. 

I finally found an escape in the form of a paid summer internship on the opposite side of the country.  It was pretty prestigious, so they liked that and were actually supportive of my going.

The first week of my internship, I dreamt that my father called me up and expected that I would fly back every weekend to work on the house, just as I had been coming home from college and working on the weekends.  In my dream, I just laughed and hung up on him.  I woke up with a huge smile on my face.  

PS: They still aren't finished with the house, more than 10 years after starting it. (I told you so, Dad!!!).  The following summer, I had another internship, and then I left for graduate school, also very far away.  I think they finally realized how much help my brother and I were when we had both moved out and were no longer working for them; things slowed down dramatically because (A) they didn't have the labor (B) they didn't have anyone trying to hold their perfectionism in check.

6nn2af,1,2017-07-16,In limbo,yawaworht107,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6nn2af/in_limbo/,"I [M/24] wrote this after my girlfriend [F/23] said she wanted to go on a break on Friday. I don't care that I sound like a 15 year old girl. I needed to write this. Names have been changed.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I think a lot about that letter I wrote to you in college.  I slid it under your apartment door and tried to take it back.  I asked Lauren to find it and give it back to me, but somehow it made its way to you.


There's so much that goes on inside my head. Back then, my focus was on getting grades that would land me a job, as if grades really mattered. I thought if I tried hard enough, my grades would make my resume glisten and somehow I'd be guaranteed a great job.  It was all about making myself look good on paper, when I'd really be evaluated on so much more.  I put all of my raw and honest thoughts on those pieces of paper I wrote to you, thinking if I articulated myself well enough, you'd soak in the words and understand.  We never talked about that letter much.  I figured you weren’t ready to know me that deeply. After almost a year of dating, I was diving headfirst into what I hoped would be the rest of our lives. I wanted to share those thoughts with you so you could understand me better than anyone else ever could.


I wanted to understand you too.  We grew up in such different environments. We both have an older sister, went to public schools, and had friends drift in and out of our lives according to what stage of school we were in.  You had the backdrop of upper class, Vineyard Vines Connecticut, and I was raised in Old Navy, PBR New Hampshire. I had visited Connecticut a dozen times or so in our first couple years of dating, and felt I had a decent grasp of the cultural differences. I understood Katherine Hepburn and fine art were a part of how you were raised. I really admired how you could be handed any section of the newspaper and handle your own.


It was easy enough to reconcile the differences between the places we were raised in and how we were raised.  I could put myself in your shoes in certain situations and understand how you could feel a certain way about something based on what you were taught by your parents. The part of you I struggled to try to understand was how you felt about losing your dad, roughly 5-6 years later.  Everything you felt I wanted to understand so I could talk about it with you when you wanted to talk about it.


I came into your life shortly before Jason came into your mom’s life.  You had seen Jason maybe three or four times before I met Jason for the first time shortly before the 2014 calendar came to a close. The emotional process of having your mom date someone new was something I could never fully understand. That frustrated me that I couldn’t relate to you. If I couldn’t relate to you, I couldn’t be someone you could talk to about it and feel like the person isn’t just hearing the words and giving nothing back. You were alone in that regard, and I really, really struggled with that. I felt guilty that I had both parents and was powerless to help you fill the massive void in your heart, or even just to conceptualize the void itself. I’ll always carry that guilt and frustration, as pointless as it is.  The only time I felt like I understood what you were feeling with regards to Jason back when he and Pat first started dating was at a Sunday dinner at your house. Jason made a comment about Brody jumping for food as looking like he was hanging himself. Everyone went silent, and you looked at me instinctively.  I did the same to you. Victoria was at the table and it would have made much more sense if you looked at her, but you looked at me for validation. I felt in that moment that I wasn’t quite in your inner circle with respect to those feelings, but maybe I knew where the inner circle was located at least.


We’ve circled back to the letter. In that letter, I expressed that I felt paternally towards you. I had never felt that way in my life until I met you. When we met, you were going through a self-proclaimed identity crisis at 19 years old. You smoked, wore tie dye, and were almost hyperactive with your energy level. Being my no-nonsense conservative self, I must have subconsciously categorized us as having a wider age difference. I considered you younger than you really were, and possibly in need of a father figure. I wanted to fill that role. You’ve changed so much since then, and as you changed, the paternal feeling I had towards you went away. I wrote about these feelings to you after having known you for barely a year. I wanted to get that letter from Lauren because I realized you’d justifiably run for the hills after reading that. You didn’t, and I always found that as a complicit sign that maybe you didn’t need a father figure, but maybe someone to have your back. I took the responsibility of protecting you seriously.


Usually, when I think about people changing, it makes me sad because people so often lose who they are. You were the complete opposite. You were looking for an identity at UNH when you drove up to Randall Hall. In the last couple years, you found it. You’re a different woman than the girl I fell in love with at UNH. I fell in love with her, and I’m in love with who you’ve become. I’ve changed too. I used to be much more guarded, but you broke down my walls. Since then, I figured you cracked the code, and as long as I had you, it didn’t matter what anyone else saw.


This weekend is the reason why it took me almost five months to ask you to be my girlfriend. My sophomore year, I broke out of the depression that crippled me and made me rot inside for six years after experiencing loss for the first time. After we learned Lucas was terminal, every day was a massive struggle solely for the purpose of delaying the inevitable. I gave up religion when I was 14 because I refused to believe a perfect being who could pull all the strings would choose to torture an innocent baby for two years before draining the last bit of life out of him. He was born August 29, 2007, and a few days later I walked into high school with no friends because my middle school friends went to a different high school. Those two factors combined to snatch the kid from me and replace him with a shadow of a human being. I lived as a shadow of myself all throughout high school. Leaving Goffstown and going to college was exactly what I needed. Depression loosened its grip on me, but the scars will always be there. I chose to move on from it some time in 2013, the first year I didn’t get drunk and cry myself to sleep on August 29.


The ultimate resolution I made to myself was to never put myself in a position to slip into that kind of depression again. I couldn’t control that situation, but I could control the people I let into my life. In you, I saw someone who was spontaneous, full of life, unpredictable, irresistible. Someone who had never been in a relationship, and admittedly went bed-to-bed during her freshman year. I was terrified because I had no control over how I felt about you. I liked you and couldn’t stop. I wanted to stop because if we started dating right away, there was a good chance you’d get bored with me in three months and crush me. I knew that kind of crash and burn would send me right back into the humid, thick, dark swamp I just fought my way out of. I needed to be sure I wouldn’t end up back there. Ultimately, I was testing you to see whether you really liked me or I was just the next best looking guy on the floor after Sam. That wasn’t fair to you. It was self-defensive and probably qualifies as the first selfish thing I did at your expense.


We’ve both acknowledged we’re both stubborn. Being stubborn is a choice, often a binary one about who’s right in an argument and who takes the loss. Sometimes we decide to be stubborn about certain topics. I don’t know when, but at some point I decided I would never compromise my relationship with my parents to appease you. Yes, this is the Tom and Katie section. The jagged, fragmented relationship between you and my parents is one of my biggest regrets. They really did love you, Mary. They wanted you to be a part of our family. I wanted you to embrace them and create a similar dynamic to what Victoria and the Godfreys have. Wanting what others have and projecting it onto our own lives is something we both need to work on.


There’s no one person to blame for the degradation of any chance that you and my parents had of having a warm relationship. All four of us have to wear it. It was a collective failure, and since I was the fulcrum, the buck ultimately stops with me. The worst sin may not have been what I did or didn’t do, but rather what I should have known. In 2015, your mom bought me socks for my birthday, which you brought from Connecticut after Thanksgiving. I opened them with you and my parents watching at the island in the kitchen. Some of the socks had brighter colors than ones I usually wore, and my parents said something along the lines of they were gay. I believe it was my mom who made the comment, and of course she said it in a less direct way, but the point was clear, although I believe not intentionally malicious. This upset you for a long time and rightfully so. I put myself in your shoes, as I always tried to do, and eventually I stopped trying to defend my mom for that misstep. At first, I tried to downplay and minimize what she said because the Victoria/Evelyn/Ryan dream for you/Tom/Katie was still alive and very much attainable at that point in my mind. That was the first Jenga piece taken out of the tower and it was right at the base.


That initial example should have told me all I needed to know and realize. The cultural differences between how we were raised manifest themselves in the interactions you have with my parents. They talk a certain way and their filter isn’t always at the right setting. Stupid things slip through the cracks and you catch every one of them. I should have known that would happen and should have worked with my parents about being more thoughtful with what they say. I should have engrained in them that you aren’t an in-law of 20 years who grew up in the area; you’re from a different generation from a different area that follows different etiquette. Their fault lies in not articulating and communicating well enough. My fault lies in not preparing them and giving them too much credit. The attitude you developed toward my parents was your fault. After the first couple Jenga pieces were removed, you began to look for the negative in them. You became so aware that they could say something misguided and began seeking it out. You were wrong for doing that. It surprised me because I had never known you to do that to anyone.


Up until your graduation from UNH in 2016, the circumstances in our lives aligned in a way that didn’t require us to put much effort into physically being with each other. We started dating while living on the same floor, then the same building, then just one town apart. Inertia was on our side. The summers were tough, but we made it work. We were both busy and in some respects, it worked out.  Once you graduated from UNH and landed your internship, your path back to Connecticut became clear. As the summer turned to fall, I knew 2017 was the year everything would change, for better or for worse. Your experience at Merrimack with Tammy combined with living in Goffstown soured you on New Hampshire once and for all. I never attempted to gauge your interest in living in New Hampshire beyond your internship because I knew it would never happen. Your family is in Connecticut, and the white picket fences shielding a massive colonial can only be found within the confines of the nutmeg state. I was resigned to that fact. We both knew but never acknowledged that there was a crossroads that awaited us in 2017. I spent the second half of 2016 procrastinating the existence of that crossroads. I didn’t want to face it, because both roads were tumultuous. The combination of spending our fourth Christmas apart, embarking on our third trip to Stowe, and the calendar turning to 2017 made me realize where my future needed to be. We toasted at the Whip to our resolutions, mine being a move to Connecticut.


On my first day back to work after Stowe, John asked me to go to a Board of Directors meeting the following month in Cancun. The timing couldn’t have been worse. A few days prior, I promised Victoria and Brady I would help them move into their new house on the second Saturday of February. The meeting was set to close the day before. I ultimately kept that promise after a night of sleeping with one eye open on the floor of the airport in Newark, NJ. My mind wasn’t clear that day due to exhaustion. I say I kept my promise, but in the technical sense. I was physically there, but not mentally. That was the lesser sin I committed by going to Cancun.


You noted I would be gone on Valentines Day, which is our anniversary. I wanted to go to Cancun, and to justify it to myself in my head, I convinced myself you would understand if we celebrated the weekend before. I still don’t know how your mind works with dates. Some years, March 1 is important. Other years, it’s treated as a regular day when everyone knows it’s not. The date of my birthday doesn’t seem to matter, but celebrating on the day of Valentines Day does. It frustrated me that I would be gone on that date and that celebrating the weekend before wouldn’t suffice. At the end of the day, I wasn’t considerate enough of how you felt. Every girl loves Valentines Day. I shouldn’t have surmised you would be flexible with that. Taking that trip may have been the most glaring example of my selfishness.


Maybe that was a turning point. After Victoria and Brady moved into their house, the end-of-the-year stress began to devour you. Your isolation from Tammy at work graduated into isolation from my parents in Goffstown. It was around that time I began to look for jobs in Connecticut and piece together my escape route. You and I have been limping ever since, both individually and in our relationship. We spoke in earnest about the upcoming summer in March. You dreaded and refused another summer of a part time relationship. I was holding out for more answers on your end. This was before you fully decided you would live with your mom beyond the summer. I told you I didn’t want to make moves until I knew more about where you would be. That was probably true, but my fear and anxiety was trying to further procrastinate. You told me I had until August, the first ultimatum you gave me since we were both at UNH. Faced with another summer apart and an ultimatum, I began looking for jobs four days later. I underestimated how difficult the processes was, a process you and I are still navigating today. After two months of looking, with the backdrop of your graduation and permanent move back to Connecticut, I hatched a plan I should have thought of months earlier. I decided to put the cart before the horse, with every step made with the August ultimatum in the back of my head. Again, fear was driving me.


I gave my work an unconventional three months notice. I moved from Epping back to Goffstown, then Goffstown to Hartford within six weeks of your graduation and a month before my deadline. You rescinded your ultimatum and began having questions about us. The process of my move was well under way. You began to yank the rug from out under me under the guise that we didn’t talk about my move enough. You were right. The move had been talked about since January, but once the weight of 2017 took its hold of us, neither of us communicated to the level we needed to. I was fixated on creating a future for us and I took your radio silence as unspoken agreement that a move to Connecticut was the right decision. Maybe I didn’t engage you in enough conversation about it because I was afraid of what you might say.


Once I gave my notice, the immense pressure to move the process along began to strangle me. Another summer apart had begun. I had moved back in with my parents, something that I was ashamed of. Connecticut was the place that would return my freedom to me and restore the normalcy of seeing you on a daily basis, a luxury we hadn’t had in years. The adjustment of moving from Epping didn’t even register. All of my thoughts and time were dedicated to moving to Connecticut, and I do so as quickly as possible.
My parents’ communication issues, lack of foresight and consideration for your family, and general flakiness made it much easier to say goodbye to them. They unintentionally drove a wedge between us, caused everyone stress and grief, and left. Breaking down on I-95 was the cherry on top of a miserable first few days in Connecticut. The Dispatch concert felt surreal. We hadn’t spent time together like that in a long time. A simple date felt like an out of body experience. It made us both realize how much we missed each other and what the future promised to be, or so I thought. I thought the concert represented a new beginning, but it was apparently a lifeline.


I visited you at work on Thursday, July 13. I needed to give you a check for the concert and flights to Chicago, but before you even brought up the check, I wanted to see you. I pictured you sharing a booth with me for a few minutes at a time, just enjoying each other’s company. I arrived during a dinner rush and ended up leaving sooner than I planned. We smiled and joked during the few minutes we did have time to talk. This was another example of the time we could now spend together. I left disappointed we couldn’t talk more, but happy that seeing you didn’t have to be meticulously planned nor a production.


The next morning, you called me sounding like you had just woken up after working a double. You said you wanted to see me. This raised a flag, but I wrote it off as you wanting to see me before Lauren and Catelyn came down for the weekend and I went on call. I postponed a phone interview and you came over earlier than expected. We ate leftovers and laughed, then finally addressed the move-in weekend in a way that gave us both closure. You then broke down and told me you didn’t know what you wanted anymore in the face of so much imminent change in your life. You said you wanted to make new friends and begin building a life. I wondered why you were pushing me away during this time of change. I thought you would want to face this change together, now that we could finally consistently spend time with each other. My confusion sounded like anger, but I needed to make you say the words. You couldn’t leave me hurt but not know why I was hurting. You said the words and left. I felt the walls closing in around me. I screamed into my pillow, only stopping because my chest felt tight. I had to go back to work and pretend I could feel my arms and tell people my voice was suddenly hoarse due to a phantom oncoming cold. Being on call, I couldn’t run. I had nowhere to run to. I had no recourse to try to process what had just happened. I could only sit in my apartment and let my thoughts torture me, oscillating from frustration to devastation to panic.


I don’t know what’s next. You need your time and space to figure out what you want. All I have is time and the obligation to myself to build something resembling a life to keep me going. Whatever happens, I need you to know my perspective. I love you more than words can say."
6nn818,5,2017-07-16,Haven't had a friend in 6 years,Jj8i,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6nn818/havent_had_a_friend_in_6_years/,"TLDR: I'm sure this story's been heard before, but I have had plenty of acquaintances but no friends in years.

I had friends in high school, just people I'd met through classes or grown up with.  I went to college and kept in touch with high school friends for about two years but got in an argument with one of my high school best friends over something and we stopped talking.  I then lost contact with that whole group, but it wasn't the best crowd so not sure I'd want to reconnect anyway.  I had some other friends in middle school/early high school, but no one I was still in touch with by college.

In college I never made any friends.  Freshman year I was shy, and I don't drink for personal reasons and was really self conscious about it, which didn't help.  I've always been a bit introverted so my first few weeks of college were overwhelming and I just wanted time to myself, so after orientation sessions/classes, I'd just go back to my dorm.  There were a few instances where if it seemed like people were going to hang out, I'd make excuses and pretend to be busy before anyone had a chance to ask me to join- because I was mentally drained and needed some me time, or because I was nervous about being in situations where everyone was drinking and not partaking.  This was really only at the beginning of freshman year but that's when a lot of people in college make friends.

Later in college I got much less socially awkward, and I made plenty of good acquaintances in classes, at my part-time job, through volunteer work, and at my internship.  But I never had any actual friends who I'd see outside of class or study sessions or work.  Through all of college I never went to anyone else's dorm besides my own.  I actually got into a ridiculous habit of pretending I had friends and things to do so that people didn't pity me or think i was weird.  For example, every year on my birthday I would leave my dorm all day and go shopping or walking around the city or to the park or something, just so that I wasn't home so that my roommates thought I had something exciting to do on my birthday.  I'd usually tell them I hung out with friends and went out to dinner or something.  I think most of my acquaintances assumed I had friends.  I'm not that weird or annoying or anything, and I don't think I'm that bad at small talk.  It's just that nothing ever moved from acquaintance to friend who I'd actually hang out with.

Senior year it got a little better- there were a couple times when I went out to bars with groups of people.  For example, all the interns would go out one night after work or going out with a group after a session at a place I volunteered at.  But this was really late in college and only a handful of times, and shortly after, I graduated and moved to another city.

After college I moved closer to my hometown which was less lonely because family was there but I didn't get in touch with any of my high school friends.  I lived in a suburban area and there weren't really easy ways to make new friends outside of work.  Sometimes I'd go out for happy hour after work in a group, but I never had anyone's phone number or kept in touch outside of work.

I now live in a bigger city (recently moved for a new job), and again I have acquaintances from work, and we go out for drinks or dinner every few weeks after work, but no one who's a real friend.  Also a lot of my coworkers seems to come from a more upper class background which can lead to not feeling like I have a lot in common with them- for example talking a lot about travel to foreign countries and going out to nice restaurants- nice people but I don't know if they're people I could relate to as really close friends.  I don't have a lot of hobbies like sports or anything, and I spend most of my time working, and then after work I usually just come home and don't do much.

I think I've gotten too complacent with not having friends.  I'm not depressed or anything - I like having time to myself and it's not a big deal day to day.  The hardest part is when people are asking me what I did over the weekend or on New Year's or other holidays, and I usually just make something up and say I hung out with friends.  I don't think anyone thinks twice about it and it's easier than saying I did nothing and getting stares.  While I'm not outgoing, I don't think I'm *that* awkward.  There's sometimes a little bit of awkwardness when people find out I don't drink, but I'm long over the self-consciousness about that.  I work in consulting in a client-facing role and do well in it, and I do OK in work networking situations.

It'd be nice to have some close friends who I could joke with or call when I'm having a bad day.  Or sometimes I'd like to go to the movies or a restaurant, or a concert, and sometimes I'll go alone but it's always kind of embarrassing and I get scared someone I know from work or something will be there and see me by myself and judge me.  Right now my close friends are my parents and siblings- they know I have no friends but also know that I don't like to be pitied so they don't point it out.  I've also never had a boyfriend or kissed a guy - and while I'd love to meet someone, the worse part is my self-consciousness about what other people would think about me if they knew I'd never had a boyfriend.  It's embarrassing.

I have a good life.  I am 26 and make over 100k and have a job I really enjoy.  Just a little lonely sometimes.

I'm trying to get more involved in volunteer work again.  I'm also setting a goal to try to start working out.  I'm a little heavier than average but not a lot so - but I've never really exercised (besides walking places, I live in a large city), and I've been thinking maybe if I join a gym and go somewhat regularly that might be a good way to meet people.

Props if you read all this, just wanted to get off my chest.

Edit: Just wanted to add something that triggered this post. Recently a few of the best friends I've had in my life have gotten married. Neither of them invited me to their wedding. I understand, since we haven't spoken in years. But it's a reminder that you don't have friends when the people you used to consider BEST friends don't even consider you a friend at all - even when you know you're not friends anymore, still hurts.  I'd known I'd probably never be anyone's maid of honor or anything but knowing I'll probably never even have a friend who would invite me to a wedding hurts. "
6nndl9,8,2017-07-16,4 weeks left in a research internship I dread.,SunWolf1215,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/6nndl9/4_weeks_left_in_a_research_internship_i_dread/,"I've posted a similar topic about this a week ago but am feeling down so looking for more insight/advice

It is a Sunday while I am writing this and I feel this absolute sadness of thinking about having to go back to my research internship tomorrow. My internship is 10 weeks and is a 9-5 from M-F. I have four weeks left to go but the thought of going in on Monday just saddened me.

I don't hate my research in my internship but rather am frustrated and annoyed with my ""mentor"" in my internship who I consider to be a bully to an extent. He is constantly criticizing me for the littlest of things and looks at me with faces of disgust randomly when he is in a bad mood which is a lot of the time as he is very stressed (Hes a postdoc and is applying for many jobs right now). 

I've survived the first six weeks so far by keeping close contact with my family and close friends. I always talk to them whenever I have the chance to destress and let out my frustration. I've also made small treats for myself after work like getting dinner with my mom or watching Netflix. I also make long term treats like going to a BBQ and watching movie during this upcoming weekend. Doing things like this for the past 6 weeks is what has gotten me so far.

However, now it's a Sunday and even with Game of Thrones coming on tonight, something I love, I feel the happiness sucked out of me whenever I think about the fact that tomorrow is a Monday and I still have four more weeks to go in this internship.

Some of my friends and family have suggested I quit but with 6 weeks done already I just want to see this program through. 

So, I'm here looking for advice from people who were in my situation before and what they did to get through an intimidating boss or an internship they dreaded. Even just some encouraging stories or words would be greatly appreciated. I apologize for the long post but I'm just dreading work right now and I just need an outlet to let my feelings out.

Tl;dr I'm 6 weeks into a 10 week internship I dread because I have a boss I don't like and I'm looking for advice on how to get through the last four weeks."
6nnpcq,35,2017-07-16,"Hi, new to this sub, LONG first rant on FMIL and FSIL - unfamiliar with the acronyms, be gentle",MissInvisiblity,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6nnpcq/hi_new_to_this_sub_long_first_rant_on_fmil_and/,"Hi all, this might be a long post so I will do my best to shorten where necessary. Created this account specifically for ranting in here so I apologize in advance if I misuse the lingo/acronyms! I completely understand if nobody can fully sit through this. I’m happy to hear any input or lessons from personal experiences you have regarding my relationship with FH and his family, but please for my sanity, withhold comments towards my Father if they’re going to be negative.

Bit of backstory, I'm 28(f), and next month I will be celebrating my 5th anniversary with FH, who is soon to turn 23. We're not engaged, but I refer to him as FH because he talks about marriage often and wishes to wait for my terminally ill Father to be released from prison so he can attend the wedding

Naturally his whole family didn't like me from the beginning, given the age gap, he was 18 and I was 23 when we started dating. I don't come from a great background myself, mostly absent father and toxic alcoholic NMom. Didn't go to college, but started working my back off as soon as I got my high school diploma and now I have a great job in the finance industry. Pay is so-so, but I have been supporting him financially for the last 5 years while FH has lived on student grants and loans, how they see me as any kind of burden to him is beyond belief.

From the beginning of the relationship, FMIL has always controlled every aspect of his life, right down to where he ended up going to college. He didn't get accepted into his first choice nearby, so she instantly put him down for a 4 year degree (1 year out on internship experience) at a college across the country without saying a word to me, then packed his bags and told me to deal with it. Pushed him to sign documents for a shared student home across the country, keep in mind at this point we had been dating for a year so naturally I didn't get a say in it, but I would have liked a heads up, or some kind of alternative options to discuss. Due to this, FH and I spent a year long distance, taking trains on weekends to see each other. Her plan to separate us worked against her, as he insisted on living with me in my apartment, contributing partially towards rent and taking trains to university 3 times a day (his classes became reduced and more homework focused from second year onward.) There was no way I could expect him to pay half when I was the only person on a wage at the time, even though mine was minimum back then. His family were aware of my situation, that I had no parents to use as a safety net, was completely independent and did everything myself, but couldn't even have consideration for me when it came to letting FH and I share an apartment not only to keep me company, but to take a slight burden of the rent off.  He has only recently started to develop a spine, and up until this year he let them ignore me, read his text messages from me, pass insults and walk all over me.

Cutting to the most recent events last year, FSIL is my age and of course hates the idea of me dating her baby brother, she is the eldest child in the family, very protective of him, has said to us multiple times to stop holding hands and kissing on the cheek around her because it’s “creepy”. He’s 2-3 inches taller than me and I have a young face, so it’s not like I come off as an old cougar. When he told her we were going to be living together for his second year of college, she started ranting about how it was a bad idea, and that he needs to mix with different people, go drinking and ""truly experience college life"". Sorry FSIL, but we can't all be go-getter extroverts like you! FH and I enjoy nights in watching movies and playing games ourselves. He has always told me he appreciates his family, but he still always feels like the odd one out being so ""quiet and nerdy"". Probably why I like him so much and have a hard time connecting with the rest of them.

To point out some hypocrisy, he brought up the subject of proposing to me around them a few years ago. Not implying he was going to do it soon, just talking about the future with them. They half-jokingly said “no, don’t even TALK about marriage for the first 5 years!” and they were adamant against any kind of discussion about it. Well 4 years into our relationship last summer, FSIL gets knocked up by her boyfriend of 18 months; they decided to keep the baby so he proposed to her after the child was born. FH’s family was incredibly receptive, took dozens of pictures, and gloated about the wedding announcement and their first grandchild online. I can’t help but notice if it was FH and I, we would be met with pitchforks and nothing but opposition. He once overhead FSIL, FBIL and FIL drunkenly talking in the kitchen about how I “ruined” a family event because I’m so depressed all the time. It’s difficult to get involved when they ignore me at these things so I always end up in a corner “looking” sad. FH stormed out of the house, got into a huge argument with them, demanded an apology, which I never got because it was more of a “we’re sorry you’re offended” kind of thing. Any fake apology they give me is always a front to appease FH and they go back to silently hating me.

My Father got a 5 year prison sentence last summer for alleged sexual assault, the same time of FSIL’s engagement and it broke my heart. We only saw each other 5-7 times a year after he divorced my NNom, but he was hard working, provided from a distance and never abused me like she did. I still feel he’s wrongly convicted, that the accusation against him was a spiteful lie for revenge, but that’s for another sub. He met my FH several times before imprisonment and said he was “like a son” to him, took him drinking, chatted with him, they both got along great, my FH described him as hilarious and kind, Father was incredibly supportive of our relationship, encouraged us to marry and stick together no matter what FH’s family tried to do. It felt like horrible timing, but FH and I decided to take the bad news of his imprisonment on the chin and hold the wedding off until he was released and able to attend it. FMIL showed some concern for him, FBIL and FIL too, but now that he’s been imprisoned for a year, FSIL has been so awful, never asked once if I was doing ok, has been treated the whole situation as though my Father committed the horrible crime. (He took a plea bargain because the prosecution took advantage of his poor memory and bluffed against him, there was never any evidence he committed any crime.) Having a history of verbal, narcissistic and physical abuse from my NMom, this was the last thing I needed, and for FSIL to ignore my situation made me feel so low. FMIL didn’t help. When I told her my Father’s appeal to shorten the sentence was turned down, and that he contracted COPD, a terminal lung disease, she pressured FH to take an interview for a graduate job overseas. He told her he couldn’t abandon me at a time where I need to regularly visit and deal with my Father being so ill, that there was a big market for his field at home. She waited for him to go to the bathroom on one of our visits and said to me “I understand you are saving up to put a deposit on your first home with [FH]. If he accepts this job overseas, maybe you can share the house with your Father instead when he gets out.”

I wanted to slap her in the face right then and there. I told FH on the way home and he was baffled at her behavior, and promptly turned down the job offer when he passed the interview. He ended up getting several better offers close to home, but she still berated him in front of me for turning down such a great opportunity”. I wanted to snap at her “maybe he doesn’t want to leave his partner of 5 years behind, now that her parent is horrendously ill?!” But nothing came. 

FSIL’s wedding is being held overseas and the whole family is flying out for it, so while I was in work at my desk a few months back, FMIL thought it would be a great idea to phone FH and tell him how she is booking the flights **right now** and that he’ll just **have** to book mine separately when I get home, as she can only pay for his flights and everyone else’s, but not mine. She knew I would have no access to a computer to pay for my flights when at work. FH was alarmed and texted me about this at my desk, I told him to be firm with her, and tell her that FH and I would pay our own way and get our tickets together as soon as I got home, but she still insisted on paying for his flight. He then told her he wasn’t going to get on a flight with them and risk leaving tickets to sell out so that I would have to travel alone on a separate plane, so she huffed and agreed to pay for my tickets too, as long as I transferred money to her as soon as I got home. FH found her behavior bizarre and distanced himself further from her, as we could both see it was another attempt to separate us. FSIL had her bachelorette party and I was surprised when FMIL invited me to it. I should have known in hindsight that it was entirely FMIL’s idea to invite me to it and not FSIL’s. They ignored me all night, took pictures without me, and left me sitting awkwardly in a corner. The realization that she wasn’t going to take this as an opportunity to ask if my Father was doing ok since he now has a progressive illness sickened me to my core. I went home early in tears, and it was obvious she knew about it for the whole year because FIL and FBIL asked FH if my Father was doing ok. FMIL gossips to everyone. FH saw the pictures on social media the following day, and could even see she deliberately didn’t upload pictures she took back at the house that had me in them, skipped over them and uploaded ones of just her and FMIL getting ready. It only drove a bigger wedge between FH and FSIL, and we were debating not going to her wedding next month. But we knew that would be held against the both of us.

Jump forward to yesterday and FMIL’s bullying has gotten worse. She is aware I am wearing a light beige dress with burgundy accessories to the wedding, and is dead set on dictating what her 23 year old son wears. She told us both to come along with her to help her choose something for him. “OP go find some other shirts for him while he tries these on”. I find burgundy suspenders and a cute cream and beige shirt, bring them to him saying it would be a cute subtle way to coordinate our colors together. His eyes light up, says it would be flattering on him because of the vertical stripes and FMIL is initially ok with it, but then starts referring to it as “an ugly shirt” and “an old man’s shirt”, insists he tries on other shirts instead, saying that her choices are better and “there will be other formal events leading up to and after the wedding when we fly there, just take these blue shirts so you have a variety for the other dinners we’ll be having there.” She waited until we both got home to text him saying that he’s not wearing the “ugly old man shirt” to the wedding, that he can wear it to one of the dinners instead, and that blue is “the theme of the wedding” so he “has to wear it”. News to me that the wedding had a theme! Why even ask me for my opinion if you’re just going to insult my taste for the rest of the day? I’m just glad FH and I have the same tastes. We’re both at a loss of what to do. We’re already planning on showing up to the wedding and being obnoxiously happy together, since they hate seeing us together so much, but we’re concerned she’ll pull something like “forgetting” to pack his beige shirt, or messing up my flight details. We’re not surprised by anything anymore. We feel we’re being punished for being sensible, saving for a house together, taking my sick father into consideration and not rushing things or getting knocked up. He’s the youngest child in the family, but he’s definitely more mature than the rest of them.

If you had the patience to sit through all this, (and if you have, thank you for giving me your time!) is there anything you guys would do differently in our situation? Not sure if going NC is an option, as he hates their treatment of me, but they live nearby, help him financially sometimes and they were never abusive to him. He’s trying to be firm with them, is getting a home with me next year against their wishes, and is intending on wearing the beige shirt to the wedding too, but it’s exhausting both of us."
6nnvmg,2,2017-07-16,You broke my heart for the second time in three years,KravMagic,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6nnvmg/you_broke_my_heart_for_the_second_time_in_three/,"This requires a long backstory. Be prepared, this will be a wall of text. Also, I already have an idea for some of the advice people will give or the responses to this. I'm not telling you to not give your input, but do understand that I already know and considered for a while some of the things you're likely thinking, and I'm making this post more to get it out there than to seek advice, if that makes sense.

Let me set the stage. This starts three summers ago when I was 19. I've struggled with depression and especially a lot of social anxiety in my life, and up until soon after this point, I didn't know that feeling how I felt wasn't normal. I soon learned it wasn't, and then I started going to therapy and such, doing something about it. And I'm much better now than I was back then. But, at the time, I was a very lonely, pessimistic person with bad social anxiety, and was particularly awful with women (not that I'm great now, but so much better than I was). It's not like I was incapable of speaking to women. I had plenty of female friends from high school and college at that point. I was just really bad at anything romantic and never got any romantic or sexual attention whatsoever (at least as far as I know, I guess). Hopefully this helps you understand the kind of desperate state of mind I was in.

When I was in HS, I used Omegle a decent amount. It let me connect with people and work on my conversational skills without the pressure of thinking on my feet or having another person starring at me. I don't know if it was a good idea, but I was teenager and I liked it then. After HS, I slowly stopped using it, but when I was 19, if I was really bored at night, I'd still go on. So I go on and start this conversation with this girl, let's call her Lucy, that goes really well. I learn she's 15, which is a little too young, but it's a conversation on Omegle, what does it matter? She's witty, the back-and-forth is great, I'm enjoying myself so who cares about the age? We talked for more than an hour, and then before we could exchange any contact info, the connection disrupted and I lost her. That sucked, but it was just an Omegle conversation, so whatever. I continued. Maybe about 20 or so minutes later, we reconnected and realized who the other person was after maybe five minutes of talking. That was surreal. We talked for a few more hours, then exchanged snapchats. I was apprehensive because of the age difference, but it was the summer so I was pretty bored. Basically I figured hey, she will hopefully bring some entertainment.

There's no reason to go super into detail about the whole story, but basically we got to talking a lot. After a month, she developed feelings for me, and after a few more weeks, I felt the same way. It felt very wrong because of the age, and in some ways I felt very weak to fall for a girl on the other end of the country without meeting. But it was attention from a girl, which was something that was pretty new for me, and that was exciting. Plus I did genuinely like her. So I went with it. We texted, snapchatted, talked on the phone, FaceTimed, etc. in some variation every day. We wrote each other letters, sent song lists, and so on. I loved it, she loved it, it was great. I never told anyone for reasons that should be obvious. We also didn't know when or if we would ever meet, so we said we weren't exclusive. Neither of us dated anyone during that year, but it's important to mention that, because that's how we got to the first heartbreak.

Toward the start of the next summer, she met a guy around where she lived closer to her age. He was interested, and she decided to give him a chance. Basically, she dumped me in favor of him. That sounds more cruel than it was. In reality, it was a reasonable decision to make. Obviously it still really hurt, though. It legitimately felt like I had been broken up with by someone I had dated for a year. And I couldn't tell anyone, so I had to just put on a happy face for everyone and pretend I was fine. This was a bit of a wake-up call for me, and I joined a bunch of online dating sites and figured fuck it, I'm putting myself out there. Expecting to never hear from Lucy again, I moved on and I ended up finding someone else through online dating, let's call her Becca, and a couple months later, began a relationship with her. Toward the end of the summer, Lucy messaged me, ending multiple months of silence. Turns out the other guy was a dick, and with that and other things going on in her personal life, Lucy was in a very bad state. She didn't know who else to turn to but me. I told her I had a girlfriend now, but we could be friends. And so we were.

For roughly the next year, I dated Becca and was faithful. I maintained a friendly relationship with Lucy, but it didn't become romantic, I never cheated, etc. But she continued to be one of, if not my best friend, and visa versa.

Toward the end of last summer, it became clear to me that it wasn't working out with Becca. It was very difficult for me, but I had to break up with her. After a few months, I re-developed feelings for Lucy, and we restarted where we left off more than a year earlier. It was fantastic. We were each so much more mature than we were when we first met, and everything was just better. At this point, we said we would be exclusive (despite still not telling anyone) because I was graduating college and she was graduating high school at the end of the year. That meant we could actually meet in the coming summer. Finally, after three years of talking nearly every day, two of which were spent romantically and legitimately loving each other (I don't think I've ever been ""in love"" with her, but I definitely love and have loved her, and if we met in person I think I could easily ""fall in love"" with her), the dream could become a reality. In the fall, I secured an internship for this summer halfway across the country and made plans to live alone for those months. Not long after, we planned her trip to come see it. We started counting down the days at somewhere in the 180s (can't remember the exact number). We made it to 10.

Two Saturdays ago, while I was working, she texted me that we needed to talk. For the last week and a half or so before that, I had noticed she didn't want to FaceTime as much as normal, she wasn't responding to texts very much and seemed much less excited about the trip, which was odd considering we were under a month away and she couldn't contain her excitement before. There had been some other things I noticed that I won't mention, but in the context of our relationship, they were red flags that something was up. I didn't mention anything because I thought she was about to come, maybe she's just nervous, it'll be fine once she's here. In the back of my mind, though, I was a bit worried. When she said we needed to talk, I knew it was bad.

I asked some questions and basically she said she didn't think she should come visit anymore and was breaking up with me. I was sent into a state of shock. I finished my work as quick as I could and asked she call me right then to talk. She said she was working and couldn't (she works for her friend). I told her to tell her boss it was an emergency and to call me. She said no, but that she could call the next evening, more than 24 hours later, to talk about it (that was the next time either of our schedules would line up together for it to happen). I was furious at that, because that's absurd to make me wait to be broken up with. Over text, she more or less said that she felt we were heading in two separate directions and wanted too different of things in life, so it would be best to end it. On the drive back and once home, I did some soul searching, realized that I had a lot of growing up to do myself and that making me wait that long was both insane and would cause me serious pain, so I texted her and said basically I don't want any explanation further than what you've already given me, I'm done, please never contact me again.

We're now two days away from when she would have come to visit me. I'm feeling such a mix of emotions. I feel very isolated where I am. My networks of friends and families are in cities hundreds of miles away. If I'm not working, I basically spend all of my time alone here. I tried, but I never really was able to make friends with the other interns for a number of reasons. My depression seemed to be seasonal, and in the past it hit me hard in the spring, but now for the last two years it has been in the summer, so I was already having a rough time with that even without the break up. This time, I had to tell someone, so I called and explained everything to my best friend from college. Fortunately he was very understanding and that helped, but I don't have any other outlets. I just have to pretend I'm fine all the time. It has been much worse this week than in years. I'm not suicidal, but for the first time my life, I get it, if that makes sense, and that alone is very scary. And I don't feel like I really have anyone to turn to about it. That person used to be Lucy. It was always her, and I was always that person for her. In my experience, the worst thing about break ups is that you have this pain that you would normally alleviate by talking to your partner, but now the pain is doubled because you don't have that partner to confide it. After having her for three years, constantly having someone to confide in every day at basically any time of day, it's incredibly difficult for that to go silent.

It hurts so much worse because of how close we were to meeting. We went three years talking almost every day, becoming best friends, and counted down for six months for a trip that she cancelled 10 days before it was to happen. I'm at such a loss for why. Even if you have your doubts about if we could work romantically in the long term, if you're in that situation, why wouldn't you just come, use the tickets you already bought months ago, meet me and just see how it is? Maybe we find out we're not a good pair romantically, but we can still remain friends and know we want to stay in touch. Or maybe it goes great and we plan accordingly. But how can we ever know if you cancel 10 days beforehand? It just makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. She trying to find her husband early, and that was something I was always iffy on. And that's a totally reasonable thing to end a relationship over. But why wouldn't you at least come and spend two weeks with me to find out if changing your life was worth it, maybe I'll think changing my life plan is worth it, or we decide no, we'd rather stay on the paths we're on? Basically, what's the harm in finding out? That hurts so much to know that we were so close to finally doing all the things we talked about for years, only for her to pull the rug out from under me because at 18 (!!!) she is thinking she needs to find a husband in the next few years, and I'm not worried about getting married right now or likely for the foreseeable future. That's just insane to me to not come after all this time because of that.

I know that this outlines a maturity gap between the two of us. I know that her interest in marriage in the near-ish future would have been a massive problem for us moving forward. I know that we are in different stages of our lives, and it can be difficult to maintain a relationship when the people are in that situation. And yes, I also realize that this needs to be a wake up call for me to be more mature myself. But that doesn't make this any easier right now, and I will never understand why you wouldn't just come visit me for a couple weeks at this point when we're already so close to time? If we were five months out from the trip then okay, but 10 days? Your existential crisis couldn't wait for 10 fucking days? You couldn't wait 10 days to see if you're wrong? And if you're right, then you lose nothing, so why not at least find out? That's what really, really kills me. We were finally going to find out how being together physically was, but now neither of us will ever know.

In two days, on the day when she would have come and I would have come home from work to her sitting in my apartment waiting for me, with a big hug and a kiss three years in the making, it's going to be incredibly hard. All day I'm going to think about what could have been, and in my opinion what should have been, one of the defining days of my life in a positive sense. Instead, it'll now be a negative day, and I'll come home to same empty apartment I've come home to all summer. Before, when I felt isolated and alone, I had her visit to look forward to and it kept me going. When I was nearing college graduation and afraid for my future, I had her visit to look forward to. And now it's never going to happen."

To be honest, he was the first guy I have met who checked off every single item I have on my list. We had a lot in common and because of that, we became really good friends and spent a lot of time together, just the two of us. 

I'm going to list the things he did that made me think he might be into me here. Please let me know if he was interested. I'm really unsure since I'm really inexperienced;

When we went out for drinks, he would help me finish the drink I couldn't finish but too embarrassed to leave it there;

He brought me to a restaurant he really liked. Even though we had a lot of troubles getting there, he insisted on bringing me there before I leave the city;

One day he was in need of a tie but did not bring one to the internship. He asked me to go shopping with him to help him pick a tie;

One day we were out having dinner with our friend group in a tiny restaurant. A bunch of us (including the guy and I) ordered the same dish, so they ran out of the plates. They ended up bringing a big plate with two portions on it. That guy decided immediately that we could share with me; then he moved from sitting next to me to sitting right across me;

He would share the food he cooked with me (we lived in the same apartment building);

Whenever we were taking group pictures, he would try to be right next to me and put his arm around my shoulder. 

After the internship ended, we went back to our normal lives. I go to school on the west coast but he goes to school on the east coast. We are still in contact but because of the distance, nothing else happened. Since the summer, he has always been on my mind and that makes it really hard for me to find other guys interesting. I want to take the initiative but don't want to make a fool out of myself, so I want to make sure that at least he was interested to some extent.

6no68m,8,2017-07-16,What to say about scars to young teenagers who notice them.,Suzanne-V,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/6no68m/what_to_say_about_scars_to_young_teenagers_who/,"Small introduction. I have hurt myself (cutting, burning, hair-pulling, bruising, head banging) when I was going through depression at age 13-15.

I'm now 24 so I quit 9 years ago. Still carry around the scars that remind me of that period, but I'm okay with that. They're part of my body and I'm in a totally different phase of my life now so I rarely even think about it anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been in situations before where people notice my scars. I'm not really sensitive about the subject, so when I feel it's the right situation I usually tell a bit about my background story and the mental state I was in when I was physically mutilating my body, to help people understand and break the stigma.

Small children have also noticed once in a while. Here I could get creative with stories about fighting with bears or tigers, or falling into barbed wire and stuff like that. I'm talking about kids age 4-7, who would immediately believe that and react enthousiastically and will then just go about their business because they're young little innocent children. No problem there.

&amp;nbsp;

But now to get to the point. Ever since my experiences as a teenager I was dedicated to go to college and becoming a mental health professional, and also being kind of creative I decided I wanted to become an art-therapist. I will graduate next year, and from february '17 through to july '18 I'm an intern at a special needs school for children through the ages of 5 to 12.

As an art therapist I'm more interested in working with the older children at this school because you can often get a bit more serious about the art-therapy, since their understanding of the world and their ways of communicating are a bit more developed than with younger children.

&amp;nbsp;

I haven't hidden my scars in years because they're just a part of me. Hardly anyone ever even notices and usually I'm not afraid that anybody would notice or ask about it. But recently I've experienced something different. One of the girls (age 11 or 12) I gave therapy to noticed my scars and asked about them, while I was in a different conversation with her and her friend. I couldn't get away with some kind of bullshit story here but I also didn't feel like actually telling them what's behind them.

When I was 12 years old I learned about self-harming through an informative documentary on TV, and even though it wasn't a triggering programme, it planted a seed in my young fragile teenage brain that self-harming was an option to cope with hardships and setbacks in life, hence I started trying it myself the year after that seed was planted.

This refrains me from telling the young teenage clients at my internship-school about my scars. I deflected the question with something like ""that doesn't matter right now"" and continued with the conversation I was actually having at that moment. I didn't want to be the one to plant that seed into the young girls minds, remembering my own fragility as a teenager.

&amp;nbsp;

But what if this ever happens again? What would you guys recommend me to tell them when they ask? Especially after 9 years I'm not one to hide or cover my scars, when it's hot I'll just wear short sleeves to work, never even thinking about my scars. 

I don't feel like lying or ignoring questions, but I also don't feel like explaining where they came from to young teenagers that might remember it in the back of their minds as an option on how to deal with depressing experiences in their future. I don't want to be the seed-planter, as that was how it all started for me all those years ago.

How would you guys handle things like this if you were in my situation?"
6no84q,1,2017-07-16,"Should I start dating (19, M)?",whodoisauce,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/6no84q/should_i_start_dating_19_m/,"Hi there. I feel like I've made a lot of improvements in my life since I was 16, when I was a massive shut-in with no friends who felt that I was going to die unloved at an early age. Over the past three or so years I've realized that I am not entitled to other people and I have made some improvements in my life that I am proud of. I do want to try out online dating, but do you think I would be dateable?

I work 40 hours a week in general administration as an intern but at the end of the year, I hope to have a full paying job. I am learning to drive and I'm doing pretty good so far. I'm average looking but I go to the gym at least three times a week to build myself up. I also use skin care products.

I enjoy reading, watching shows and movies, writing and going to the gym/running. I'm also learning Origami and Cooking, and try to do one new meal a week. I wish to get into nature/hiking in the future so I can stand around in the woods and annoy our ancestors who would kill for air conditioning. I also enjoy podcasts and very occasionally video games. I also get out the house once a week for a meal or a movie. I try to write at least an hour or more a day and hope to someday get published (I'm quite new to it).

I have 1 or 2 friends as I prefer a small social circle. I don't drink alcohol or enjoy the club scene like a lot of people my age as I hate loud noises, flashing lights, and crowds. Does having a small social circle with one or two friends put people off? I've also never been on a date and have no experience with relationships or sex, which I'm a little anxious about as I am quite old to not have that experience.

I am a very quiet and reserved person but I try to be social whenever I can, but I usually just talk to my family and my friend, whom I meet up with weekly and I'm quite close to. I might want to start a family in the future and I'm not too bothered about marriage (not against or for it really).

I tried Match.com but I noticed people rarely, if ever, have descriptions about themselves in my area, which seems strange to me. I live in a town/city of about half a million so I don't live in a really small town or anything.

Any advice for somebody like me? Am I even dateable? There are a few things I'm worried about:

My age and lack of experience. Most people who are 19 have experience in relationships and in bed. If a 19/nearly 20-year-old is lacking this, would that be a red flag? I also don't really like the idea of sex too much, but I am willing to learn.

My friends. I like having a small circle of friends but I feel as if this won't be enough for a relationship. I am close to the one or two friends that I meet up with regularly and I'm happy with them myself. My friends are also kinda lame but I enjoy hanging out with them. Would having a close friend and family be enough? I'm not at all clingy or needy and I enjoy being emotionally independent. I'm more of the guy who helps you feel better than a guy who relies on others for emotional support. My best friend is a little 'special' and odd looking so to say, but I enjoy hanging around with him more than I enjoyed hanging out with my friends at school. 

I guess I'm not very 'manly', so to speak, and this might be an issue for a lot of people. I like myself fine but that doesn't matter if others don't like the way you are. I'm not great with my hands and I have very gender neutral hobbies/interests. I'm also not really well traveled as my friend and family are busy and have some money issues, but I am open to traveling with a partner.

Please let me know your thoughts below!

Repeating stability issues.  When are they going to stop releasing old problems?   I use to play this game A LOT. Its been like a year sense I have played. I come back to check and see if a qualified Dev team is finally bringing this game out of alpha.

Turns out its the same shit.   The same problems that only get fixed for a week or two then somehow the new update brings back the same problems we use to have... Which those dont get fixed for a week or two.

Sony Online Entertainment had this game in way better shape, back when it was first released, than they have it now!    SOE was the best Dev team to have this game. From that point on its been a slow, smelly trip down hill with this turd that never seems to dry up.

One day, these Devs can say they did something great. Until then we will wait for them to learn and build on their skills. Its like interns running a show and they only get better with experience. This game is just a stepping stone for Devs to start somewhere and move on. No one with the actual skills at hand will ever take this game to where it deserves. Because no one with those skills wants to take a potential A rating game and try to bring it up from a class D.  The several Dev teams that have had their hands on the game fucked up the ratings and lost so many people to dumb, money driven concepts that pushed Survival to being nothing but a never ending cluster fuck of frustrations.

I will keep waiting though. For some reason I have a soft spot for games like theis... I will also keep being disappointed. No matter how much I hope and pray, it wont get us a Dev team we deserve.

To be honest. There are TONS of tiny shit that should have been refined and completed 100% before they starting to bring in new things. They should have been addressed a long time ago.  Which is probably why they struggle so much with this game as a Dev team..  Dont worry Dev team!  Your not the only ones to struggle with this game  :D  The guys before you did the same shit.   It's expected with new rising game developers.  Not every developer(s) come out and make something amazing their first OR even their second project as a professional. You guys keep working on developing your professional selfs ;). Your by far better than the last Dev team."

6nqq0k,14,2017-07-16,Rookie (intern) in need of tips on marketing myself as a clinician,nnamzzz,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/6nqq0k/rookie_intern_in_need_of_tips_on_marketing_myself/,"Hello, everyone.

I've just received my intern # as a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor (but I'd be a PCCI; Professional Clinical Counselor Intern) and ready to get started and pick up some clients.

I'm currently hired for a couple of private practices, and they are giving me ""free reign"" to bring in clients and take the full fee for service.

I was hoping for some tips on how to market myself and get the word out there that I'm offering my services (My supervising clinicians are busy, so I want to get started right away).

Some things about myself:

**About me:** 31 year old male African American clinical counselor.  I lean more towards the behaviorist side of theory.   Connection and empathy is important to me (Satir), but I am very much into ""Here &amp; Now"" (Gestalt), solution-focused and motivational interviewing.

**Areas of expertise:** Early Childhood - school age children (particularly children with co-occurring mental health conditions), trauma, family therapy, group therapy, etc.

Aside from this, I want to market myself to athletes (I'm VERY interested in dipping into this pool, but don't know how), men, fathers, and African-American males.

Any tips are helpful.  Thanks in advance."

6nqz1e,18,2017-07-17,Best food creations from a former 4 year Taco Bell employee,AverageOpticStudent,tacobell,https://www.reddit.com/r/tacobell/comments/6nqz1e/best_food_creations_from_a_former_4_year_taco/,"I've been at TB for ~4 years. Currently doing an internship now. Across this short time, I'd like to share my personal favorites as well as tips into getting the most for your money.

1. Quesarito with Salsa: my personal favorite was the shredded chicken. Order--&gt;SC quesarito, easy nacho cheese, easy chipotle, easy sour cream, add salsa. Easy on those liquid-y items since it gets messy. This is really really good and is my top recommendation.

 -Alternative: get the shredded chicken burrito + salsa and easy or no avocado ranch (i like it but is iffy with the salsa

2. Cinnamon Twists with Sour Cream: didnt get this a whole lot, but dipping your twists in a side of sour cream sounds very weird but is incredibly satisfying. Good stuff.

3. Try the damn black beans: people get turned off by black beans because of the look or the fact that they are beans I guess. Trust me, they are the best tasting protein around. My suggestion is substituting the beef on a cheesy gordita crunch for black beans. It is free to do so and the black beans mix nicely with the spicy ranch sauce.

4. All of the $5 boxes come with nachos and cheese. Sub that out for nachos and salsa free of charge for a healthier alternative

5. Spicy potato taco with spicy ranch: the old potato taco had baja sauce. They changed this around for their new dollar cravings menu when they also changed the baja sauce to the spicy ranch sauce. Sub out the chipotle sauce for spicy ranch and enjoy.

Tips and Notes

1. The beefy nacho griller is overpriced. You can recreate the exact same thing and save 69 cents (pre tax, based on location, etc): beefy frito burrito($1), no rice, no fritos, add redstrips (free), and grill it (also free)

2. Take advantage of free toppings: sometimes you dont want to add ALL of these on EVERY food item, but these are the free toppings iirc: redstrips, onions, steam/grill, fritos, red sauce

Insert Edit: due to what was mentioned in the comments, the above free toppings are based on location apparently. My bad

3. Dont buy the taco 12 pack if you are getting them regular (not supreme): the grande meal (10 soft or crunchy tacos or bean burritos) is priced way lower per taco than the 12 pack.

4. Ask for relatively fresh chalupas or potatoes. Can really change your experience if the people in the back are lazy.

5. Breakfast eggs are nasty and so is the sausage. The smell after breakfast ends is attrocious. Please, for your own well being, do not order breakfast.

Edit: added red sauce to the list of free stuff"
6nr0ak,1,2017-07-17,Arcadian Military Parade Outline (Pics coming soon),CanberraGaming,KerbalPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalPowers/comments/6nr0ak/arcadian_military_parade_outline_pics_coming_soon/,"Day one Morning: The guests begin to arrive in their limos and private helicopters. Many of the guests look in awe at the hanging body of the dead tyrant Fuhrer of the old Konigreich. Stihl immediately takes a liking to President Kwartz as she leaves her limo. He begins small talk while Kimbaugh is looking for the liquor and Kiddenburg is disgusted at the sight of the dead body. Stihl and Kwartz share a toast while Kimbaugh is still looking for the strongest drink he can find. Githejø arrives shortly after Kwartz and is thinking to himself “How the hell did I end up here? I don't belong here, I'm too civilized for these barbaric brutes”. Wilhelm Cande was the next to arrive being rude to Stihl the second he left his Helicopter. He immediately begins screaming at Stihls advisors for a private room away from the party to contemplate his get away from the festivities. Stihl immediately pulls one of his interns aside and executes him on the spot to shut Cande up. He precedes to run to a closet crying and screaming about how he wants to go home. Bobdous was the last to arrive bringing the strongest, Soltem liquor he could find. He's already sloppy drunk by the time he leaves his truck. After the last guests arrival he immediately sits everybody down at the table for a toast to the new nation. “I'd like a toast to the formation of the Union of Arcadian Socialist Republics”. Everybody cheers and drinks.

Day one night: While festivities are kicking off and formalities out of the way the Military parade commences while most of the world leaders are already intoxicated. Stihl and Kwartz have been talking all day, Kimbaugh is so drunk he can't cover the parade, Kiddenburg is disgusted by everybody's behavior while taking shots at the bar, Cande is still refusing to leave the closet, Githejø is sloppy drunk dancing on a column in the Kreblim, and Bobdous is railing lines of Koke in the back room screaming about former glory. While the tanks roll down the streets Kimbaugh and Stihl strike up a drunken conversation. They begin to take two of the MVs off the street and preceded to joust with the barrels interrupting the parade, all the while Kwartz and the other world leaders are laughing. After this event one of Stihls advisors suggests it's time for bed ending in a .45 in his skull. Partying resumes while Cande is in the closet screaming “Did he just kill another one!?!”. Bobdous demands his truck be airdropped in so he can do “mad stunts to impress the ladies”. He eventually gets his wish at around midnight and not even ten minutes later rolls it into a pond while running from a police officer. Bobdous is pardoned by Stihl and continues to drink. Around midnight everybody heads to bed. Cande finally left the closet to find a private room when he comes across talking in Stihls room. He discovers Kwartz and Stihl are having a late night talk about political and personal affairs. He thinks nothing of it and goes to sleep. 

Day two morning:
Kennedy Kermam, Chaffee Kerman, and Jabe Kerman arrive via private jet before everybody wakes up. They are the first to witness the hungover mess of Georgy Stihlovich and Christen Kwartz rolling out of bed. Kwartz embarrassingly turns her uniform the right way and continues to walk to the door with Stihl for breakfast and they preceded to walk through the Green Square looking for a café. Kennedy remarked to Chaffee “What the he… Nevermind, we’re in the right place”. Bush and Mark are the next to wake up and take seats by Kennedy, Chaffey, and Jobe for breakfast in the Kreblim. They strike up a conversation about current world politics and what the hell happened last night. Bush remarked “Stay away from the Vodka, that shit’s potent” while Mark looked, judging the foreign politicians. Cande, Bobdous, and Githejø were woken to the wake up call as Stihl came back in the door with Kwartz. While sitting waiting for drinks they heard a honk. LaPierre, Hodem, and Crashy McSplodey had arrived with some potent Wasteland Cocktail. Everybody instantly jumped for the shipment and things went downhill from there…

Day two night:
Cande “EVERYBODY CALM THE FUCK DOWN!”. Stihl precedes to point his .45 at Cande while pushing him into a tank and locks the door. Kwartz is running around like a raped ape on cocaine singing, and dancing. Kimbaugh is screaming for more vodka. Kiddenburg is nowhere to be found, last seen looming around Kwartzs limo asking to be taken home. LaPierre and Hodem are sitting at the table enjoying a sober conversation when Stihl decides to light a car on fire outside the doors. They remark to each other “Why did we come here?”. McSplodey is running around after drinking enough Vodka to kill an elephant screaming about how he's late for his meeting and precedes to pass out from alcohol poisoning. Bobdous has had way to much to drink. He eventually steals the MV that Cande is locked in and flees Arcovy. While Bobdous had powered through the alcohol poisoning for the last hour he finally succumbed. After he got out of the tank he rolled, he had passed out on top. I think he has a few too many drinks and few to many lines of Koke. Cande is still locked in the upside down tank screaming for evac. After Bobdous rolled the tank Cande was jostled into the turret to be completely forgotten. Bobdous' evac arrives shortly to escort him back to Baskay. At this point Stihl and Kwartz decide to steal her presidential limo. While speeding through the square they accidentally hit a pole and the limo spirals into the fountain in the green square. The limo lands upside down with a booze and vomit covered Kiddenburg in the trunk. He hears the commotion going on in front. He remarks “Of course Stihl would want to nail her right now of all times”. He then sees the water dripping into the trunk and begins to panic. He hears Stihl and Kwartz leave the limo and begins to scream for help. Eventually some citizens hear the screams and open the trunk to an booze and vomit covered Kiddenburg. He immediately jumps up and runs while remarking about the condom stuck on the steering wheel and how sleazy his president is. Githejø after seeing the pandemonium decided to bail ship and head home. Stihl and Kwartz arrived back at the Kreblim to Jabe sloppy drunk trying to flirt with Stihl saying “Do you ge…. *Vomits* How's you… *Burps* I'd love to feel that musta…”. Kwartz precedes to punch Jabe and knock her out. Kwartz looks at Stihl and says “Don't worry, she won't bother you anymore”. Kennedy and Chaffey decide to drag Jabe back to the limo to head home. Stihl and Kwartz head to the bedroom to get some sleep, until Kimbaugh decides to walk past the door and hears screaming. He remarked “GET SOME!” And passed out on the wall next to the door. LaPierre and Hodem decide it's time to go to bed after the party had died down. They were the last to go to sleep.

Day three morning:
Everybody was jostled awake by the wake up call. Immediately Stihl and Kimbaugh head to the bar. Kwartz figures it's time to open her briefcase full of Celrepani Wine. Immediately Stihl and Kimbaugh hover around her for the wine. They end up sharing a glass and going for a walk around the slightly trashed square. Kimbaugh asks Stihl and Kwartz if they'd seen Cande or Kiddenburg. They both say no and continue on the walk. They arrive back at the Kreblim where Stihl disappears to make a phone call. Kwartz and Kimbaugh remark about how Arcadians know how to party and preceded to take a shot. A gunshot is heard in the back room and Stihl comes through the door saying “Tekkia left another intern”. Kwartz asks “What was that call about?” Stihl responds “A television broadcast and a possible yacht for the three of us tonight”. Ten minutes later and a television broadcast comes on the TV about public drinking and how all of Arcovy is invited to join the party.

Day three night:
Stihl, Kimbaugh, and Kwartz enter the Green Council private limo and proceed through the massive party happening in the square. Everybody is out drinking and having a good time. The limo arrives at a dock about an hour later. Sitting in the dock is the Project K class battleship. Stihl invites everybody for a tour and cracks open another bottle of vodka for everybody. While they're in the bridge Stihl whispers into the captain's ear and he shakes his head no. Stihl proceeds to grab his revolver and kill the man on the spot. He asks the first officer to take command. Stihl looks at Kimbaugh and Kwartz and says “This is our yacht tonight”. Kwartz and Kimbaugh both laugh and smile at Stihl while the ship begins to leave dock.

Day four early morning:
The battleship about 3km of the coast begins to fire shots. Stihl sees a village and asks Kimbaugh to take control of the targeting systems. Kimbaugh asks “How the hell do I use this?”. Stihl responds “Just press some buttons or something”. Kimbaugh proceeds to level the village in sight. About two minutes later they hear cannon shots from the village and they hear a scream. It was Kiddenburg! He was shot from an artillery piece by villagers. He attempts to climb on board. When Stihl and Kimbaugh see the burnt, gunpowder covered Kiddenburg they immediately begin laughing and help him on board. Kiddenburg starts screaming about how he wants to go home and it's ridiculous what's happened to him at this party. Kimbaugh gives him a shot while Kwartz and Stihl begin dancing in front of the burning village. About 10 minutes later Stihl instructs the battleship to head home while they get some sleep.

Day four morning:
Turns out the new captain didn't pay attention in class. The ship was ran aground right outside the docks. Everybody jumps off and walks to the limo to head back to Arcovy. When they arrive they see a trashed square, a lot of Kerbals passed out, a lot of empty booze bottles, and of course LaPierre and Hodem dancing together around a circle of passed out bodies. Crashey walks out the door to the Kreblim and demands to be put in charge of fireworks tonight. Stihl grudgingly agrees and gives him a transport for the day. LaPierre and Hodem figure it's high time to steal a tanker full of fuel. With how much they drank it didn't last long and they managed to roll it into an apartment complex. At the same time Stihl and Kande decide to borrow an SSTO and head to orbit but before they do some extremely low passes of Arcovy and ignite the tanker setting the entire city on fire. Kiddenburg, Kimbaugh, LaPierre, and Hodem decide it's time to drink while the city's burning around them and steal a car sitting, untouched by the flames. They proceed to do donuts through the square, going bottoms up on their bottles.

Day four night:
Stihl and Kwartz arrive back to the burnt down remains of Arcovy while Kiddenburg, Kimbaugh, LaPierre, and Hodem are all passed out in the car. He beats on the car to wake them up stating “You don't want to miss the firework comrades!”. Everybody immediately jumps out of the car and cheers while an angry mob begins to approach Stihl. They run to the Kreblim and lock the doors to sit on a balcony out back to watch the fireworks. Stihl makes a phone call and the fireworks start. He makes another call and asks “Where's Crashey?”. He gets a response and doesn't look very happy. About 5 minutes later Crashey was spotted in a weapons testing field, by a field Marshall, drunk off his ass. He rammed his transport truck into an armed nuclear warhead. Everybody on the balcony was jarred by the massive explosion across the island. What was left of the buildings in Arcovy were knocked down. All the windows to the Kreblim were broken. The tank Cande was locked in was thrown about half a kilometer and flipped upright. He immediately runs for the nearest airport. Stihl looks at everybody and says “Alright, party's over. We all need to sneak out after that one.”. Stihl called for private transport for everybody while he went on the front balcony to have bottles thrown at him. He said “Hey it's an Arcadian party!” And walked back inside. The next day he receives phone call that's everybody made it home safely and calls an order to rebuild Arcovy for the next party!

I am wondering if it is worth going for the Fall 2017 fair, because I feel like most companies are seeking those graduating December 2017? Also does anyone have tips and good experiences with getting full time positions from the fair and would like to share?

What are the alternative ways of looking for a full time position upon graduation besides the career fair? I have been researching online and every application literally requires years of experience in the industry... hard to find positions that are for entry-level engineering graduates. Also.. the online job posts are for immediate start dates, not wanting to wait for after graduation.

Note: I have one past internship experience.

6nr5os,2,2017-07-17,[Support] I think I've made a mistake,throw_me_away_too_10,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6nr5os/support_i_think_ive_made_a_mistake/,"I've only posted here once before and it got deleted... originally this was a throwaway but I'm thinking I may just keep it up for RBN purposes. 

So... I'm not sure what my mother's deal is I just know that we have had a lot of difficulties. Someone referred me here a while ago. I've lurked for a while and read some literature that reeaaaaaallly struck a chord.

Enough of the backstory. I've been having a lot of health problems. I was in the ER recently and got some tests done. There may be something serious going on and I have a meeting with a specialist Wednesday. I got really emotional about it today. 

Here is where I think I've made the mistake -- I asked my mom to come stay with me while I get this figured out. I don't want to be alone and I just don't have anybody else. My dad has to work and friends are busy and I just don't feel right asking any of them. I just really wanted a mom.

The problem is my mom hasn't ever really been much of a mom. When I told her about what was up she didn't really say anything comforting or soothing. She walked around the house trying to look busy and then my dad booked her flight. I think she may have dropped her laundry off and then bought groceries. She hasn't really said much to me and she was playing her computer game for hours.

When I came to her with tears in my eyes she said have you been thinking about this all day? I hugged her for comfort and she didn't really hug back. Is it possible she is getting worse in her older age? 

This whole trip has been weird. I only recently discovered that she may be part of the problem in our relationship instead of it being all my fault. 

When I first got here I was really upset about a breakup on top of everything else and she kept saying things like awww but it's been a long time... man you are bitter... why don't you go out and meet people when you get back home. Are these normal things to say to a person? I don't even know anymore. She did actually say I'm sorry you got your heartbroken once. That was huge. Mostly she just comes up with reasons why I shouldn't be feeling a certain way. She also loves to insist that I am depressed... that something else is going on and I couldn't possibly have normal reactions to things like getting dumped or feeling mistreated by her. 

She snaps at me guys, in the harshest tone. She's only slapped me like once or twice when I was younger but I worry sometimes she will hit me if I say anything against her. Whenever I try to discuss something she has done to hurt me she starts moving around and insisting that we can't talk about this because I'm making this into a big blowup. Mostly she just denies what I say. But then when I insist she'll make excuses... that's not really an N, is it?  

I told her that in my head I hear the phrases you're too sensitive and you're too intense over and over again. I told her she said both things to me all the time when I was growing up. She said she never said those things to me but I insisted. She finally gave in and said well did I say them in a mean way? I just wanted her to say it was OK I was feeling heartbroken and that I wasn't too sensitive or too intense.

She also insists she doesn't remember kicking me out of the house during a summer in college. I lived with a friend's family for like ten days or something. But she claims not to remember. I insisted that this happened and she said, ""Well were you being good and contributing?"" I said it was something to do with the dog. I remember vividly I had a duffel bag of stuff on the front porch and she looked at it and yelled at me to leave. It was scary in a way I can't really describe. I knew at that moment I was doing my best to escape. What I was really doing was just waiting for the worst of the storm to pass. It was such a bizarre feeling. 

In response to her, ""Well were you being good?"" question I told her I never understood what my expectations were around the house. It seemed like everything bothered her and she was upset all the time. I said that I was convinced it was because I was a bad daughter and a bad person. She didn't really respond to any of it. She later came up to me and said, can I just blanket apologize for anything I did in high school? I accepted but I didn't want to. It didn't feel like a real apology especially since she said high school and I had just been describing stuff to her that happened in college.

I'm not crazy, right? There's something wrong with her? But like also there's something wrong with me for wanting her to say I wasn't a bad daughter? Like I need to get over that?

I still don't know if I should change my mind and tell her not to come back with me. I just really want someone after everything that's been going on. I'm telling myself she's just a warm body to have around and I can just ignore everything she says. That's ridiculous isn't it? Like... what I really want is someone to cook meals for me and to say comforting things like, ""It'll be ok"" and ""I'm here for you."" But logically I know that will not happen. And wanting her around just because she's a warm body... isn't that what Ns do? 

I don't know guys I have so much in my head that involves her. I just want her out of my brain sometimes. I do have a lot of anger over the stuff she said and did to me over the years. And especially now the way she treats me. Not to mention her food issues she so lovingly passed along to me. I've done so much work on myself with therapy and other stuff that I just wish she could take responsibility for her part in the disaster that is our relationship.

I told her I wanted to apply for this internship at company X when I got back to the town I live in and she didn't really say anything. A couple hours later she said kind of out loud to herself.... ""working at company X company X, that'll be something I can brag about.""

I just keep hoping for the mom I want and I just have this feeling she keeps hoping for the daughter she wants.The daughter she can brag about to her friends.  

Hope is such a bastard.

6nrjio,2,2017-07-17,Question about testing for a possible leak.,injunjoel,Plumbing,https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/6nrjio/question_about_testing_for_a_possible_leak/,"Hello everyone,
First off thank you for reading my post. I've just completed some subfloor replacement in my townhome and now I am a little concerned about possibly having punctured what I believe to be a water line. This is a newer construction (2007) so I believe they builder used PEX piping, but the only time I've ever dealt with plumbing was for a PGE internship workshop in 1993. I just know that it's not copper, and it was run through my floor joists. The joists are TJI joists with about 1.5"" flange depth (same as a 2x4 laid flat). SO, I rippped up the floor I wanted to replace (major soft spots and evidence that Kilz was sprayed over a patch about 15'x4'), I cut some new OSB to go over it and started screwing things into place. I've used 2.5"" construction screws, so things don't squeak later on. We plan to have a floating hardwood floor installed soon, but here is my concern. Given that I've used 3/4"" OSB (acutally 23/32""), and have the 1.5"" from the top flange is there anyway I could have puncture the PEX? 
Is this stuff easy to puncture?
I can post some pictures if anyone is interested.

Now, one option is to unscrew everything and check, but is this stuff easy to identify leaks in?
A second, possibly less expensive, option is to run a pressure test and see if there is a sign of a leak. That way, if things are fine, I don't have to rip up everything that I've just put down.

So, now for the actual question I came in with, how can I test for a possible leak in PEX without ripping things up and looking. I've seen some stuff about using a pressure gauge on an outside spigot and letting it come to max pressure then turning off the main and wait for 15-20 minutes for signs that the needle is moving. If not, I'd be good to go. My concern is that I do not have a ball valve main, but rather a gate valve main. Does this sort of a test pass muster with a gate valve main? Is there some other way that is recommended?
If you've read this far, thank you.
Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated.

6nrp94,1,2017-07-17,"Sister (14) ""disowned"" by father, caught in the middle.",throwaway_family_860,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/6nrp94/sister_14_disowned_by_father_caught_in_the_middle/,"Hello!

For the past 2-3 months I have been struggling with an issue, that supposedly shouldn't be my issue, but I keep getting dragged into it,  and as much as I am trying to keep a neutral opinion, its getting extremely hard not to speak my piece. 


So before I go over what happended at first, I will go over some quick backstory, and after I will explain from there to the best of my knowledge.


My sister always stole a lot, from me (from my room, money, etc) and I always had an issue with it, but my mother would never do anything about it, even after she had acknowledged it. My mother and father are divorced, so now they are married to different people. Over the course of about a year, we always went to Dad's house every weekend together and slowly, Alana started to steal from Dad's house too, but not from Dad exactly, from our stepmom. Dad had a huge issue with this, and tried to get this worked out with Mom, and to me it seemed the only way to fix this was at home with Mom, since there is not much that can be done when you only see your child once a week. Mom refused to acknowledge she was actually stealing anything, until she actually managed to steal a dress from Kohls. 

Just to be clear, this is not the main reason what happened later on happened, just keeping it here for a bit of knowledge, and could relate in some way but I don't know.


My sister never liked going over to Dad's, complaining it was very hot, (which it is not, open the window or something), felt like there was too many rules (at our home its pretty carefree, so I respect my dad's rules.), one of the rules being that she had to ask if she wanted a snack or food, since Dad and my stepmom were a bit hesitant still, seeing as she has stolen in the past and were still a bit wary, which in my opinion is something I can agree with. 


As of 3 months ago, she really did not want to go Dad's house, one of the reasons was because she got into trouble at school at Dad wanted to talk to her about it. Dad really wanted to help her with her problems at school, but my sister was never very receptive to his advice, calling it lecturing, but I don't really know what other way you would get it across. So she locked herself inside her room at our home. 


I overheard the conversation, and basically she refused to come out, Dad got frustrated, (rightfully I believe) and he didn't handle this exactly how I would have liked him to, but I would say he was correct. He said that if she would lock herself inside her room, and was given no power to actually be a father, he was not her father. By the way, he wasn't saying he didn't WANT to be her father, he was saying was BASICALLY not a father if he wasn't given the power to.


So only I went over to Dad's that weekend, bit of an awkward car ride, but he explained why he did what he did, which is just what I explained. It all seemed very logical, but when he told Mom about this, she freaked. Saying how he can't just not let her come over. Mom and Dad used to agree, but they stopped agreeing on a lot of points awhile ago.

That call didn't go well, more or less just you are her father you need to let her come over.


Ever since this has happended, Dad seems to have gotten very depressed, and he has been taking it out on me. (No, he doesn't get mad, he just sits and talks with me about it, because it is on his mind a lot and he seems to get very upset about it). Keeps asking my opinion on it, and making sure its ok with me. Its makes me feel though that he always wants to know how I feel :).


My Dad has tried to fix this by going to family therapy with my Mom. One of the things I found out during this whole thing, was that there were a bunch of things that I can't remember at this moment (tired) that my Mom didn't tell me about (like this therapy) and when my Dad told me, he was shocked that my Mom wouldn't tell me, he thought it should have been known between the four of us. The actual therapy has gone quite well, but you can't really fix the root problem if my sister isn't actually willing to fix it. The therapist recommended they bring her to the therapy but when asked about she refused and never wanted to speak to him again.


Im really frustrated at this point, because whenever I get home from Dad's, Mom, my stepdad and my sister all make kind of passive agressive remarks about my trip to my Dad's, like how was your Dad's? (could be genuine, it could just be getting to me idk, but the tone doesn't suggest it). I actually went to my Dad's for three weeks, because I wanted to. When I got back, they asked me if ""I lost weight"". This REALLY threw me off, and almost set me off, because what they are implying that I eat very little at my Dad's and am not well fed. (I think thats what my sister told them?). One key detail I think anyways is that my Mom has a VERY heavy bias towards my sister, although she still loves me.


One of the things that frustrated me as well, was (right now) I am at my grandparents, and they somehow know!? I think my sister told them, but this isn't information they need to know, and they are basically insulting my stepmom and stepsister (They acted suprised that a 17 year old had a job, saying that they thought she wasn't going far in life, and thought it was weird Dad was giving his old car to her instead of my sister or me, which I don't think so? I could be wrong, but im 15 my sister is 14, and I won't be driving for awhile, she won't be driving for 3 since I doubt she can afford the insurance or gas, and I plan to intern at 16 where I don't get paid, so it just makes sense to give her the car, since she gets her license soon, and they all live in the same household.



Sorry for the vent, just really confused on what to do to make this better, I would really like to see my sister have a functioning relationship again with my dad, but shes making it really hard to,
and I am somehow caught in the middle, I think being used as a link of sorts.


Sorry I may have left out details, really hard to think right now, if you ask though I can fill them in.



Just want to know what you guys think about this whole thing, and if you could possible give me any advice?


Thanks!"
6nsrtp,3,2017-07-17,Learning Retention/Memory Retention concerns in WGU.,New2Adrafinil,WGU,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/6nsrtp/learning_retentionmemory_retention_concerns_in_wgu/,"How does everyone feel about the current model of test taking within WGU and their retention of the material over a long period of time? This in regards to the 1 pre-assessment/1 final way of passing the class?

My biggest gripe about school (in general WGU or brick/motar) has always been that I can do the work and pass the classes but the retention of the material quickly falls off after I move onto another class.... Just it seems like in WGU I can re-learn/refresh my memory at a quicker rate but I cant really have a conversation about the material I've learned in a public setting due to the sheer amount I've had to learn for one final until I go back to the material/re-read. I would assume this wont be much a problem when I am actually applying the information in the real world but I am massively worried about sounding un-knowledgeable when I go to apply for work/jobs and enter the interviews.

I noticed this when I did finance the semester prior to taking Intermediate Acct 1 and when I had to re-learn TVM fundamentals in Int Acct 1; I was able to easily refresh my memory and the chapters relating to TVM were a breeze; which also made taking Int Acct 1 much easier.

Maybe I am over-thinking this in the sense I feel that in the Accounting world may expect you to be well prepared after completing your BS when I feel like I will need a few months of on the job experience to get into the groove of everything... I am going to attempt to find an internship prior to graduating (I have 2 semesters left, including the one I am currently on) to ensure I dont fall too flat on my face my first real job in the accounting world but I dont know if Its possible yet in my current life situation.

Any advice is much welcome by people who have worked in Accounting to help me get a better perspective on entering the accounting world.

I've taken a look at the sidebar, wiki, and the top posts about buying a car, so I feel fairly confident in the actual purchasing aspect. The part I'm a little shaky on is the price range car I should look into. 

Here's my super quick story. I'm a senior in college, and have an internship making 14/hour. I'm engaged and my old van I has just kicked the bucket. It is not an option to continue to drive the van. I was planning on buying an old car for a year or two and then sell it, but also am considering a newer (2014ish) car so when my fiancé needs to get a new car we aren't getting 2 at around the same time. (is this even a good way to think at the moment?) 


My ""School"" breakdown as it stands now: (\^ means it's calculated to a full year because of the way rent is set up.)

- School loan +6,150
- Rent for the year\^ (4,800)
- Estimated electric\^ (320)
- Estimated water\^ (180)
- Food (900)
- Phone payment (234)
- Loan payment\* (225)
- Spotify (45)
- Ring payment\*\* (2,250)


**Total with current bills and not including income: ($2,804)**

\* 25/month knocks off like 3% interest.


\*\*0% interest and I have ~$600 saved specifically for payments if it were to get too tight I still wouldn't miss a payment. This is a sunk cost, not a potential cost. 

Including my current job, I can comfortably work 18.5 hours semester 1, and 24 hours semester 2.


Assuming 15% tax (effective rate ~12/hour) that brings me to $888/month for 4 months. Then $1,152 for 4 months.


Effective income in 9 month period: $8,160.


**This brings my total to +$5,356**

After taking a look at a $200/month car with a $150/month insurance payment for 9 months (again, only while I'm in school. I don't have as much worry when I'm out).

- School loan +6,150

- Ring payment\*\* (2,250)
- Car Payment (1,800)
- Insurance Payment (1,350)
- Gas (540)


**Total cash flow: +1,666**

I'm sure I'm missing stuff, and it's taken me about an hour to completly write this post since there's so many factors I want to include, but that ends up expanding the scope too far into the future. 

Biggest thing I want is to understand if there's something I'm not seeing that needs to be factored in, and that I need to recognize, and whether or not I can handle that expense while I'm in school.

Tl;dr: need help with car. Expenses listed, anything I'm missing, and ~350/month car+insurance manageable?

Thanks, 
Jeremiah1119


Edit: thanks for your responses guys. I guess I should mention that my savings is all right at $600, and I'm currently full time during the summer. (450/week = $1800/month. For both July and August.) I want to see if I can sustain a somewhat nicer car payment during the school year without dipping into my savings and overreaching the budget that I've set."

I am contemplating taking a year off too boost my LSAT (and my GPA will move up to a 3.89 if I get an A on all remaining coursework). Additionally, if I apply next fall instead, I'll have my undergraduate honors thesis to discuss.

Harvard's statistics say that 80% of their students took a year off anyway, but not all of the schools I'm looking at release these statistics. My advisors are concerned that taking a year off can look too much like ""I wasn't prepared, so I needed another year"" and ultimately hurt me. What about applying both this year, and next year (assuming I don't get in this year)?

Thanks for your input.

Edit: I feel the need to defend my advisors a little--the law advising at my university is awful, so I've actually been talking with the office of national scholarship advisement for help instead. In particular, someone who advised a Rhodes scholar who went to Harvard Law. I'm also applying for the Marshall, Rhodes, etc. so their mentorship is less catered toward law school than it is towards being a compelling candidate for all of these opportunities in general. That being said, real law school admissions advice is pretty much not available to me through my University, which is why I'm here. I'll be too old to be eligible for the Rhodes if I wait a year (I'll be 24)."

[vent/questions] [CW family violence, medical]",lecoeurmecanique,CPTSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/6nu4kt/do_i_need_to_access_repressed_memories_can_you/,"This is long so I guess bear with me pls.

I'm 22F and still learning about this stuff. 

So I guess there's no real official Dx, but my therapist said post-traumatic stress from childhood trauma is probably the root of my unhappiness, so I guess I'm rolling with CPTSD. I grew up with my mom and dad, and they fought so much. She cheated a lot, he worked a lot, he would yell and scream and throw things around (although he never hit us), would swear at us. 

One of the few memories I have is me crying while telling my mom I just wanted a hug, after he yelled at me to go away after I offered one. Another is hiding in the closet (I was like 4) after cutting my hair, he was yelling and threw a ball and tore down the curtains. That's about all I have from my childhood home. I can remember some bits of my school and friends from ages 0-8, but my household is so, so blank. My mother and little brother can both confirm abuse happened. (side note does anyone else feel like they gaslight themselves??)

My mom divorced him and married a man who is physically abusive. He once pushed her into the lake while he was drunk, and he punched her and slapped her. He broke a lot of stuff, and hurt my brother a lot. I mostly stayed out of sight, but I also was... pretty much an angry, vengeful teenager and I guess it was easiest to let me slink out of sight rather than guess what fucked-up revenge plan I'd turn to. Even my mom solemnly told me that neither father figure would target me for long. 

I think it really messed me up. I thought I was a sociopath or narcissist recently, due to the way I've treated others. I got inventoried and a lot of my thoughts and behaviors threw red flags. (Obv I don't have a PD, but that's how badly this affected me) I feel like my brother had a benign response, he became avoidant, reclusive, zoned-out, generally like my mother. I became like my father's anger: angry, narcissistic, spiteful, with insanely strong boundaries and walls to protect myself. I operated on ""the best defense is a strong offense"" so that nobody would have the chance again. 

This didn't help when I was retraumatized (I have an autoimmune disorder that cause a bunch of pulmonary embolisms and eventually part of my right lung infarcted at age 20, and I completely spiraled out) and diagnosed with acute PTSD. I lost my internship because an executive humiliated me about my hospital stay in front of our department and I just couldn't handle it. I was having flashbacks at commercials and songs and the smell of hospital.

I didn't start making progress on these deeper issues until the last 1-2 months. I had so much toxic shame and embarrassment about my existence - I'm some kind of monster with a broken personality who can't stop hurting others. Then I asked my mom and she told me about the abuse and I just... didn't remember it. Like only the 2 or 3 small instances, but apparently there's so much that my brother and mother know that I don't. 

It clicked things, though. It was like a giant weight lifted because my thoughts turned from ""I am inherently evil"" to ""Someone hurt me and I'm still figuring out how to cope"". I talked to my therapist and that's when she said that we should work on addressing my trauma and attachment issues and emotional issues. I learned about emotional flashbacks and why I go from logical and calm to OMFG GET THE FUCK AWAY in 2.2 seconds. 

One complicating factor is my dad. When he divorced my mom, he got therapy for his anger, and he remarried someone who is just objectively a better fit. She's powerful but not abusive with it, strong, and literally will not take a modicum of shit. I admire her a lot. Anyways... He doesn't abuse anymore. I lived with him before college because I had a mental break with OCD and my mom was neglectful and I didn't have a chance in hell without mental health care that we didn't live by/couldn't afford, and I had access at his. 

He's loving, caring, maybe a little emotionally stunted, but he rarely even snaps, he always takes responsibility and apologizes, leaves the house when he's angry to take a walk, and has been like this for close to a decade now. 

I haven't talked to him a lot after learning about my trauma. I talked to my stepmom about my caution and why, and she said he does feel a lot of guilt, but I don't want to talk to him about it. I don't really care about an apology (especially if he is guilty), since he HAS reformed himself. And I've reformed myself, because I was also an angry, toxic person. 

I also am starting to establish a sense of identity. I always felt like some conniving chameleon, creeping around and imitating people to get close and feel connected, but friends never stuck. I think they could sense something off about me. I felt so dead inside, incapable of empathy, aggressive, only cared about myself. But now I'm throwing myself into my art, because I feel like there's something to draw on. Emotions, grief, and I'm even making some friends. I started a social media page and like, 300 people are following me which baffles me, but I keep going ""wow, people like me and what I can make"". People want to hang out with me. 

I feel like I still filter everything through my dad's filter of ""get a high-paying job, move to suburbs, marry white Christian guy"" in order to avoid his anger. I recently told him about my change in plans - I'm going back to school for another degree (PTSD and illness ruined my initial school experience, although I DID finish my degree), this time in CS, I'm moving to Cincinatti to live with my mom, I'm focusing on art and music, and I'm never living in the suburbs lol. He reacted in a way that I logically knew he would (""Okay... that's different, do you have your finances worked out? This will be exciting, you're so good at art and I think the change will be nice"") but emotionally? I was immediately ready for judgment. 

Overall, I do feel good. I have therapy in a few hours and I see her regularly. My depression is ENTIRELY gone, which is amazing, and I'm learning to be myself (it takes some alone time and meditation to know what I want and be true to myself) and be more vulnerable, so I think it's positive. 

I guess I'm having some lingering doubts and feelings. Is how I feel about my dad normal? On one hand, he helped traumatize my family. On the other... I traumatized others, and it's not really fair to actively grudge him when I'm forgiving myself. I'm not ANGRY at him presently, but I'm retroactively mad, so I'm just distancing myself to process. 

Sometimes I even feel like it's not valid to have trauma when no one hit me (even if it's because I was too unpredictable and a little scary and my mom/brother made easier targets). 

I told my therapist I don't really want to access anything I don't remember. I feel like it'll just stress me out when I have the story of how things went down. She didn't push it and said if I changed my mind we can talk about it then. Would it be helpful if I did? I don't think it would, but then again I know little. 

Did anyone else turn into some kind of angry spite-monster? I seriously (and a few others) thought I legitimately had a Cluster B PD. I was (and still am) mistrustful and suspicious, but I do feel more for other people now and I'm learning how to be honest and open. 

Sorry this is so scattered. I just needed to vent and throw some things out into the void. "

6nugwe,27,2017-07-17,Switch+ripsaw giveaway help,xBloodxTitanx,razer,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/6nugwe/switchripsaw_giveaway_help/,"Hey everyone,
Im not sure where else to go on this, so this is my last ditch effort try and get something going.
I won the razer switch+ripsaw giveaway that started back in april of this year.
Once the giveaway was over I was emailed by an internet at Razer and the global community manager, Donovan Foo.
I provided all the information they asked for and waited for more info, or for the prizes to be delivered.
About 2 weeks went by so I emailed back asking if there is some kind of eta cause Im supposed to be moving soon.
A week after that the intern emailed me back saying that he was working on getting tracking info and would let me know where it is ASAP.
I waited another week and a half with no response from him.
I emailed back again asking if he had tracking info, and if it wasnt shipped yet if I could change the address.
Another week goes by and I get an email saying that it would be shipped in a week and that he would send me the tracking info shortly.
About a week and half later the ripsaw shows up at my door. Only problem is that its defective and keeps freezing.
Ive had to work with support to try and get it fixed but thats turned out to be a nightmare. Its now lost on the way to their rma department for repair. Just my luck.
So i emailed back a couple days after I got the ripsaw and let them know that I received it, but asked again about when the switch might be shipped out.
They emailed me back saying they hoped i enjoyed the ripsaw, and that was it.
I immediately emailed back asking for an ETA.
I waited 2 more weeks with no response, and then emailed again.
That was about a week ago and they still havnt responded.
I also tried reaching out to Donovan on twitter in hopes of getting a response there.
I understand that it takes time to get stuff out, and im trying to be reasonable, but its been over 2 months now since this all started.
I just want to know whats going on, and hopefully someone from razer can see this and get me answers.
If needed I can try and upload the emails to imgur or something.
Sorry for the wall, and thanks to anyone who might be able to help.
TLDR: Razer didnt ship giveaway prize and no longer responding after 2 months."

I recently got offered an internship in LA (Specifically in Sherman Oaks, though much of the work will be done remotely) and so I'm looking for a good spot to get an apartment that's both safe and as cheap as possible. However, it seems whenever I try to research the neighborhoods the apartments are in, I get some conflicting opinions on the safety of their neighborhoods, so I was hoping to get some insight from you all.

1. First place I found was near the Wilshire Center/Koreatown area

2. Second was near Lincoln Heights

3. 3rd in Aliso Village

For reference, I am a white male, and may be moving with two friends as roommates (assuming we find a cost effective apartment to fit us all), one also being a white male and the other being a Hispanic male.

Any insight you could give would be massively helpful, and if you have any suggestions on other cheap-but-safe neighborhoods I should look into, that'd be great."
6nuzg6,8,2017-07-17,Play For Late Game,Makiavelzx,LeagueOfMeta,https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMeta/comments/6nuzg6/play_for_late_game/,"**Permalink:** https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6nqlmh/play_for_late_game/

**Body:**

&gt;WARNING: Long.


&gt;I sit here writing this, to hopefully encourage people who are going through hard times. For the past 4-5 years I have been going through a rather difficult season of my life. I won't go into every detail because I don't want Reddit to throw a pity party nor do I want to reveal too much of my identity. My parents got divorced 4 years ago but it was nastier then the average divorce as my father became violent and abusive quite out of nowhere. Through the divorce he left my 'now' single mother, who was an elementary school teacher with 3 kids, a lot of debt. We went from middle class to very lower class. My family became very unstable as my siblings turned to drugs and self harm. It was hard to be the only stability my family had in a home at 17. I was in High School at the time but decided it wise to drop out and get a job so I could help my family while pursuing an internship at a very large company. College was not an option. I worked as an intern for 2 years and worked my ass off and was 100% fully dedicated. I was one of the best interns in a very large and competitive group. If I got the job, I could have gotten a job anywhere in the US and possibly out of country. I lost the job to people who were relatives and close relatives of employees. I really was devastated for a long time. During that time I was unable to find jobs even though I was very qualified. The only job I could find or get was cleaning tables at a large restaurant. I went from leading large groups of nonprofits, planting new locations for that company, and being a trained public speaker to cleaning tables. I struggle with depression and feel emotionally fatigued everyday. It felt like the whole world plotted against me and devalued everything I am. It felt like I was laning against Darius with ghost ignite or getting 4 man ganked at level 6 after the 3 man gank level 3.


&gt;Pause.


&gt;I really love League of Legends. Like really. I do. I played competitive sports in High School. After I dropped out of High School, League of Legends was the only competitive outlet I had. It was also one of the few emotional escapes I had while this whole shit storm of a situation was going on. I have been playing since Quinn was released so I know quite a lot about the game. I have stomped, I have been stomped. But when my team is being stomped, there is always this phrase that gets spoken by somebody.


&gt;""Play for late game.""


&gt;""just hold on"" or, ""don't give up yet"" or, ""just keep going."" 


&gt;So what does life have to do with League of Legends? Like many people, I am trying to follow my dreams while working a shitty job. Like many people, even though I hate to admit it, life has me on the ropes. Like many people, my current life situation is less than ideal and some days I just don't feel like going on anymore. Not to be to cheesy, but to a very lesser degree these are all emotions experienced in a solo-q game gone wrong.


&gt;You are struggling with depression? The enemy pantheon went ignite. 

&gt;Life has you on the ropes? Everyone has died once before you even hit level 3 as a jungler.

&gt;You are trying to follow your dreams but no one believes in you? All of your teammates are saying ff@20 in your promos.

&gt;Feel like killing yourself? Two of your teammates actually just did tell you to kys.

&gt;Every day I tell myself, ""Just one more day"" and, ""one day you will make it"" and, ""one day all your hard work will pay off."" One day I just kinda thought how life is sometimes like playing a late game champion. You have a really bad early game, everyone shits on you, and you constantly get bullied. But if the game goes late... its over for the enemy team. If you make it out and claw your way out of the hell hole that is your life, the world is gonna be terrified of what you are capable of. The other day I just really felt like laying in my bed all day and wallowing in my self pity but I found myself saying the phrase I recently just heard in my solo-q game. 


&gt;""Play for late game.""


&gt;Just keep going. Don't give up. Don't tilt. We win late. We scale better. Some of you guys and gals might be going through something similar in life. You feel like giving up or you feel cheated or forgotten. Maybe you feel like no one believes in you. Maybe at night you wish you would go to sleep and just not wake up. Let me encourage you. Just keep going. Don't tilt. Everyday you go to sleep at night and you have made it another day, is a victory. You scale better. You will make it. You have the late game. 


&gt;I say it for you guys, but right now I am really saying it for myself as lately it has been hard for me. But the next time life sucker punches you right in the throat and you feel like ff-ing@20...


&gt;Don't give up. Play for late game.

6nv02h,3,2017-07-17,I (20F) am afraid of ending an almost 2 year relationship with my bf (21M).,throwawayplup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6nv02h/i_20f_am_afraid_of_ending_an_almost_2_year/,"My bf and I met in college nearly 2 years ago. I was a freshman who had ended a 6 month relationship and he had never had a serious gf and was a sophomore. This summer, he got an internship at a tech company and is renting an apartment in the city. I'm working outside the city and living with my parents in the suburbs about 35 minutes from where his apartment is. We both work full time jobs. I work full time and only get Tuesday and Wednesday off each week. My hours are 9am-7pm during the week and 9-4pm on weekends. My bf has a typical job and works 7am-4pm during the week and is off during the weekends. Because of our schedules, we hardly see each other. On either of our days off, the other always works until 4pm/7pm leaving us not much time time to spend together. 

Recently, my bf has been more distant. Things were fine the weekend of the 4th of July. We went to a fair and concert the day before and then went to my family bbq on the 4th. He seemed like he had a great time and so did I. Recently, he's been distant. Usually he'll come to my town one day during the weekend and we'll do something together. Lately, he's been doing things on his own or driving to his parent's house and hour away and hanging with high school friends. I'll come over on my days off, but since he works the next day, he won't want to do anything. My days off with him usually consist of sitting around his apartment watching netflix. I want to do more in the city, but he always claims he's tired. He usually decides what we do. We have different tastes in things and I'm usually the one who compromises and does what he wants to do.

Recently, he's also been texting/snap chatting me less. He'll only respond to half of my texts or only reply if I'm asking a direct question. He won't tell me how he is or what's going on in his life. We used to text for hours. For example, last summer, we were on different coasts for our jobs and did long distance for the summer. Everything went well and it made us stronger as a couple. We have both told each other that we love each other and we have spent holidays with each others families. We've never actually had a fight either. The only major thing that has happened was that during a night at the bar, a drunk me left with a friend because my bf accidentally spilled a beer on me. I was upset, but also drunk and it was a total accident. We've discussed our futures together. Where we plan to live together, renting a house after college, how we don't want kids until we have stable careers. 

Tomorrow I'm planning to go to his apartment to hang out for my 2 days off, but I don't know how to bring up the things that have been going on. I would be heartbroken if we broke up and I wouldn't be able to handle it while home. All my friends and support are back at school (4 hours away). I would have nothing at home to help me through a break up and I would be stuck at work full time still. My last relationship did not end well and I don't want it to happen again. I wouldn't prevent him from breaking up with me, but if we were to, I'd rather we be back at school. We still have 4 weeks until school starts back up. I'm a very non-confrontational person. I have no idea how to bring up the problems in our relationship without it leading to fighting/possible break up. 

I would also like to mention that we have a dog together. Many of you may not support a dog in a relationship, but we love him to death. PLEASE DO NOT get angry and chastise me for the decision we made. Officially he's my bf's dog and lives with my bf, but we take care of him almost equally. He legally is owned by my bf since the papers are in his name and he paid for him. If we broke up, I would be most heartbroken about not being able to see my puppy baby.

Where should I go from here? Could a break up happen soon? Right now, I only contact him if there's something important I have to tell him or if I'm coming over instead of casually conversing. I'm thinking about just riding it out as it has been until we get back to school and I have my supportive friends with me in person in case a break up occurs. I would also like to mention that I've recently gained a little bit of weight. I worked 2 jobs during the school year and now working full time for the summer. I hardly have time to exercise properly. I maintained my previous weight by walking to class and hiking, but no time for that now. I hope my weight gain will not be a cause of the break up, but I don't really know how shallow my bf actually is.

TL;DR My relationship is starting to have problems and might be on the verge of a break up. I don't know how to go about it"
6nv6cx,5,2017-07-17,"24 y/o, current internship ending in August, $2,500 in savings, want to take a 2-week trip to Europe before I dive into a career. Worth it or should I just wait until I'm more financially secure?",kingjamesthethird4,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6nv6cx/24_yo_current_internship_ending_in_august_2500_in/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm a recent college grad in May of 2017 with a BA in Communications. I intern at an advertising agency making $10/hr. I don't mind the industry but I don't see myself here long-term so I have been on the job hunt. I have a few things in the hopper right now for a couple of great entry level positions that pay $50-$60k+ annually. First in-person interview at one of the companies next week actually.

My internship ends early August but I still don't have a full-time position yet. This question pretty much hinges on my ability to land a full-time position anywhere in the $45k-$60k range.

I'm assuming that if I can land a full-time gig with one of these companies, I will have a small buffer zone between the end of my internship and the day I start my full-time position.

So the question is: if I can make it work, is it worth taking a 2-week trip during this buffer zone before I dive into a career?

I feel like this is as good a time as ever for me but at the same time, I also don't have a ton of money to spend. 

I have $2,500 in savings right now and know that a trip to Europe would effectively wipe most of, if not all, of my savings out.

I have monthly expenses of around $800-$850.

Rent/Utilities: $615

Groceries: $100-150

Misc: $50-$100



I'm at a period in my life where I feel like I've missed out. All of my peers got to study abroad and have been on many trips overseas. I was fortunate enough to go to Spain/Morocco when I was 17 but I haven't taken a trip like that in a long time and I feel like this is as good a time as any in my life.

That said, I understand that this could be a huge risk. I also don't have a car right now and would like to purchase one in the near future. If I decide not to go to Europe right now, I could use part of the money I have in savings to put towards a car.

I guess I'm just very conflicted and would like some opinions. "
6nvm9k,7,2017-07-17,Third week: Harsh light of day.,___Ethan___,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6nvm9k/third_week_harsh_light_of_day/,"Sorry to spam the front page, I just wanted to make a small update.

The first week of sobriety was tough at first, but I felt euphoric at the  end of it. I'd solved a (small) problem at work and my usual headaches were subsiding. I talked about last week in a previous post, but the anxiety hit me like a sledgehammer on the weekend. I'm pretty stressed out generally, but this was something else. I managed to keep a lid on it by listening to music and exercising, but I was a bit short with my mother a few times. I've been trying to preempt cravings with Diet Pepsi, and largely it's been working. I've had anxiety about relapsing--this seems irrational but I've heard it's common, so I'm just putting it down to mild withdrawal symptoms. It's weird that I didn't get this as much in the first week.

I feel like my brain's more active than usual. Recycled memories (and thoughts I'm not even sure are memories) kept coming back, but the worst thing is the guilt I feel over my friend. I mentioned her too--I knew her for about three years from about thirteen to sixteen. I'm not even sure how we ended up as friends at this point, but she was always a sweet, genuine person. I didn't speak to her again until 2015 when we found each-other on FB. Looking back on those messages is difficult now as she's been through hell in the interim (she's had a tough time of it ever since I left to do my advanced classes and then university).

When I went to university, I basically forgot about her. She was a few grades younger, I thought people would stop picking on her and that she'd make friends at her new school and just have a normal adolescence. Maybe if I'd been less selfish, jumping between drinking alone and studying, maybe if I'd worked the summer before university and got a damn car, I'd have been able to keep in touch with her and be there for her. Instead, I lost her, and it's a miracle I didn't lose more friends. 

I'm numb to most things, I'm not overly emotional, but I'm finding it hard to contain the rage I feel at what's happened to this girl. She's still a great person, but she's been worn down by various things that have been inflicted on her. If I'd made the effort to be there, if I hadn't been hungover every weekend, if I'd just taken her for a pizza or something and asked how she was. I lived a hundred miles away at university, but I know I could have done something to help her, or at least know she wasn't alone. As I said before, I'll try and make up for this now.


I'm in my early twenties now, I graduated and am now working. If there are any college-/university- aged people here, you're making the right step by choosing to stop/cut back on drinking. I wasted two summers during my university years drinking my nights away, often alone, then stumbling out of bed, making coffee and playing video-games--I wish I could have that time back. Don't let this be you. Keep in touch with old friends, they might need you more than you know. Also, absolutely work on doing an internship or a summer placement with a company--it will absolutely pay off (I'm basically doing the same work as a summer intern now, only I have a degree, and I had to do a number of temp jobs earlier this year for experience). Hangovers absolutely harm your confidence to get out there and do things.

It's fun having a few drinks with friends, and there's nothing wrong with that. However, if you're finding yourself drinking alone after nights on the town, or if you suspect you're using drink to push your responsibilities to the side, please reevaluate your relationship with drink. 

I honestly don't think I'm an alcoholic--I'm fortunate enough not to be going through what some of the people here are going through--but it's clear that alcohol has been a severely negative influence since I was 18. I don't want to put all of the issues I've had on alcohol, but they either surfaced or intensified after I began drinking heavily.

Try to enjoy the rest of the week guys."
6nvqik,1,2017-07-17,35M4F - Pick your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6nvqik/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
6nw5f8,149,2017-07-17,[CM/cf][CM/s] Update: I walked in on my cousins and my sister masturbating together,walkincousin,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/6nw5f8/cmcfcms_update_i_walked_in_on_my_cousins_and_my/,"You can find my first post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/6nn7i6/cmcfcms_i_walked_in_on_my_cousins_and_my_sister/).

I texted Derek after work today to talk to him about walking in on he, Jen, and Meghan and it turned out he was really willing to be upfront about it so long as I guaranteed him that nobody would ever know.  I called him and we talked for about 20 minutes about everything.  Jen had told them **after** they were done that I had seen them (which I found really curious – I guess she just didn’t want anyone to freak out and end the fun?).  He clarified some things that made me feel both less left out and more left out at the same time.  A brief synopsis of what he told me:


* This was not the first time they had one of their “sessions.”  Hearing him say that sucked the wind right out of me as I felt like a total outsider to the most important people in my life.  Apparently it started off during an innocent game of truth or dare while I was out of town for an interview for an internship in February.  They were hanging out at Derek’s apartment after a party at one of our friend’s houses.  Meghan was having a glass of wine and noticed a fly in it and dared Jen to drink it and it all went down(up?)hill from there.  It must have been some epic game as both girls wound up flashing before eventually dancing around topless and in their panties and Derek flashed them his dick.  At some point as they continued to drink, Jen was dancing around the room sexily and slipped her hand down her panties and the other two decided to join in.  Saturday was their fourth time.
* They didn’t intentionally exclude me.  Derek said that it’s all just them having fun and always involves alcohol, but they have gone out of their way to hide it.  He said that the girls especially were nervous/embarrassed/shy and they just didn’t know how to broach the conversation with me.  I guess that makes sense as “hey bro, I jilled off with our cousins last weekend, want to have some fun with us next time” would be exceptionally hard for Meghan to say.  Regardless, I still wasn’t sure that I believed him and told him that any one of them could have engineered it to happen spontaneously while I was there.  There have been plenty of times that we’ve had a few drinks together since February, so I’m not sure how I feel about it.  He said he didn’t think either of the girls would mind me joining them, but I guess we’ll have to see how that plays out.
* They have never touched each other, it’s watching only.  He said that the girls would take turns doing little strip dances and would pretend to grind on each other (but not him), but that it’s all been strictly hands-off when it comes to the sexy times.  They haven’t really discussed this apparently, but that’s how it’s happened so far (which I think I’m relieved about because while Jen is really pretty and has an amazing body I can’t stop fantasizing about, I’m not sure how I’d feel about Derek getting it on with my sister…but I suppose that would make me a hypocrite).


I’ve thought about things for the last couple of hours and I guess I’m excited, relieved, nervous, and more after talking to him.  I’m also wondering, if something does happen, how I keep from ruining the moment by seeming over anxious or weird or something.  I’m normally a really confident guy, but I can’t help feeling like they’ve been doing this together and I need to be careful how I approach things next time we’re all together (and alone).  I don’t want to kill the mood by being too eager if this has all happened organically so far.

**Edit:** Derek just texted.  He just got done talking to Jen.  He said that she feels bad that I felt excluded, but didn't seem bothered by the fact that I'd found out.  She also said that she and Meghan had talked and that I should call her tonight and not feel awkward about it."
6nwcva,5,2017-07-17,"Just attended the ""Don't Give Up!"" Convention. Thought I'd share my thoughts on the drama ""Remember the Wife of Lot!""",marshroanoke,AskaJW,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskaJW/comments/6nwcva/just_attended_the_dont_give_up_convention_thought/,"TL:DR *Is this really how Bethelites perceive the world?* Without a doubt the most extreme JW video to date. The danger of materialism is a valuable message for all Christians, but the ways it connects materialism to mundane things like higher education and financial security is an absurd leap in logic. The movie has a threatening tone toward JWs that consider pursuing college or a career that could pose any conflict with meeting or service attendance. The movie gives JWs a very specific path to follow in order to preserve their relationship with Jehovah God: engage in the full-time service and live a very simple life. 

The positive take-aways were the high production value and music. There's a catchy instrumental theme song and ""comic book"" style opening credits that are highly creative. It's amazing how far our organization has come in its film department. I enjoyed the drama characters like Mary (the Hispanic mom) and the bossy Asian mother (more for her comedic delivery than any moral message). Gloria is the main character and a parallel to the Biblical wife of Lot. Like Lot's wife, Gloria must choose between her material possessions and serving Jehovah. The scare tactics in this film were strong. Last year we were scared by the bunker and SWAT teams. This year it's the image of Gloria turning into a salt pillar (yeah...that happens). 

Even by JW video standards, this movie has an unbalanced message. Gloria starts off with IMO a reasonable desire to have a more financially stable future and encourages her children to get an education to get a good job. This is met with strong backlash from her husband (he's the loyal JW here and he comes across as a walking-talking WT magazine through most of the film). Goaded on by her wordly mother, Gloria pursues real estate classes and lands a job with her uncle. This is where the film takes a pretty hard turn.

By the second part of the video, we take a huge leap. Gloria has gone from desires of financial security to full-on materialism. She's buying clothes and handbags and prepping to buy a huge apartment. She's living way beyond her means. Gloria's ""bad"" daughter is pursuing an internship that causes scheduling conflicts (she misses ONE DINNER with Brother Williams), and she is exposed to worldly, young coworkers (don't all jobs have this?). Notice the real *subtle* education/internship--&gt;materialism--&gt;moral degradation message the video is making? Yeah by subtle I mean hammer on the head. 

One scene represents how out of touch the WT is about gays. Gloria's daughter brings her coworkers over for dinner and the one has lesbian parents. The dad just straight up *scowls* at this girl and starts preaching about marriage being between a man and a woman. Dad?? *Ever hear of tact?*  The wayward Gloria says to her husband ""I think you're being too harsh. Aren't they just programmed to feel that way?"" This is a clear jab at the ""born this way"" phrase. So, the WT clearly thinks people who are attracted to the same sex can magically change their feelings through the power of faith. It calls to mind a similar moment in a Sophia/Caleb video about gay parents in which mom says ""Sophia, people can *change!*"" This damaging mindset is why the organization discriminates against brothers that display effeminate traits or sisters that displays masculine traits. *People can change!*

And what was wrong with the daughter's haircut/color? Are we anti-coloring hair now?

So to wrap the synopsis up...Gloria's uncle gives her an ultimatum: keep her real estate job or miss the memorial of Jesus Christ's death. Throughout the video, when Gloria makes a bad choice, we get creepy jumpscares of Gloria as a salt pillar. Now, as Gloria ponders her uncle's ultimatum we get the full vision of Gloria turning around and turn to salt. Is this true? Is Gloria going to spiritually bite the dust? Hurray! Gloria sacrifices her job and makes it to the memorial right on time...saving herself from a rocky fate! All is well for the family and it's a happy ending.

**My conclusion? The scare tactics of Gloria as a salt pillar...wow. Never seem such an overt threatening message to JWs pursuing higher education or a successful career. I felt like I was being called out personally for choosing to go to college and pursuing a career that is more than just a part-time job. There really was no balance...no option presented that college educated JW can still meet his obligations as a Christian. The propaganda is unbelievable. Stay in line! So many JWs will take this to mean that college or any successful career is wrong. Not sure what the goal is for the WT to do this other than to keep people sheltered.**

6nwjoa,1,2017-07-17,"m4f incest, multiple characters",MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6nwjoa/m4f_incest_multiple_characters/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire. 
2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 
3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature. 
4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 
5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! 
Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters."
6nwp16,5,2017-07-17,"Acquisitions Inc, West Marches type game idea (wall of text)",Noobity,TheCTeam,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCTeam/comments/6nwp16/acquisitions_inc_west_marches_type_game_idea_wall/,"Greetings! I've been knocking this around in my head for a while and I didn't know if anyone else had been doing the same. I wont finish this I'm sure but if the ideas help anyone else out I'd love to see a repository of rules that might make things a bit interesting if you were going to run your own Acq Inc type story.

Essentially, some friends and I wanted to play a game where we would have various sized parties at any time, and some of the players would end up DMing, all trying to come up with something that we could do where it could be serious or silly, and we have an overall goal that isn't necessarily ""saving the world"" but potentially ""maximize profits for shareholders"". 

Basically it boils down to everyone who is playing is part of a branch of this company who is hired to do the basic fantasy adventurer stuff; slay this beast, see what’s going wrong in forbidden keep #52, find this item for this mage because he’s too busy doing other stuff etc.

The key here is that multiple members of the branch would be getting leads and essentially creating quests for the rest of the team to go on. So say I start with a simple quest that takes 2 weeks, find and slay generic monster a, turns out it wasn’t as easy as anticipated and hijinx ensue, whatever. Session after someone else is leading it so maybe their dude is being sent to a meeting at hq so they have a legitimate reason to dm and not be part of the adventure.

Instead of characters leveling, the branch levels, and that would be done slowly. Replacing dead or “retired” members could theoretically be done by tryout, maybe if your character dies you make 2 new characters who go on trial adventures and the rest of the team votes, or the group can put on a battle royale or something and the winner is your character. Or of course just the regular dnd stuff. If anyone wants to do an adventure that’s a lower level than the branch is you have interns doing that work so everyone can play a new class or race or both periodically.

Something like this, I think, makes it easy to plug and play anything you really want to do anywhere you want to do it. Want to create your own quest and mini adventure? Go for it, we can make a map as we go. Want to use something that already exists? Pull out a book or another idea from the internet and edit it to work. It also helps to change styles around a bit to keep things fresh. Lets say I want to do a humorous quest full of 4th wall breaks and ridiculous monsters, then that’s what I create or find and run as a DM. Maybe someone wants to do something serious or horror themed, when he’s running that’s the tone being set. Maybe a couple weeks you move over to a competing company dealing with the same quests after they’ve been completed by the heroes and they decide they want to try and sabotage the main team’s supplies and stuff.

Some more ideas:
Ac Inc or start from scratch
Quest to get from level 1 to 2 is the one to get the money/building for the company
Decide roles: CEO (decision maker, decisionist?) – HR (upgrades, hiring, reviving etc) – Logistics (maps, travel, supplies) – Legal (documancer, paperwork, contracts) – Marketing (art stuff, advertising) – Security (traps, guards, etc) – espionage (sabotaging other companies, info gathering, etc) – hordesperson (keeping track of loot gained by the party and deciding who gets what, acts as a loot decisionist)
Branches level up at a slow rate (maybe xp x as many pcs as are hired). Characters as full employees are a level equal to the branch’s level.
New characters start as interns, gaining regular xp until they catch up to the branch, and then are no longer interns.
Questsperson – special temporary position for the dungeon master of the week. Potentially extra spending money for that character? Higher cut of the profits? An item? Bonus gold on the next adventure that character plays
Quests can be as simple as adventurer’s league content ported over (change towns, dungeons, etc) or expeditions into larger dungeons.
Dungeons after being cleared would be restocked for other branches, and eventually redoable by the first branch that cleared it.
BBEG would be a larger event. World ending maybe? Strahd in league with super lich dude from annihilation, with Tiamat as the larger “boss” or some evil god controlling a rival organization?
Players paid a salary, minus a cut for keeping the business running. Every quest will have x gold/items. 20% given to keeping the company up and the rest evenly distributed among all who attended. Additionally 5% of the total gold reward per session DMd since last time played for previous DMs.

I dunno, all just ideas I was throwing around. Not entirely a ruleset so much as basic idea. I think what Jerry/Chris put together as a base is extraordinary and completely open for interesting interpretation and I haven't really seen anything out there setting up potential ideas for just how to play it.

6nwrda,3,2017-07-17,A growing number of news stories are comparing Bill Clinton's Lewinsky scandal to Trump's current situation - any truth to this?,fasttimesatmemehigh,Ask_Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/6nwrda/a_growing_number_of_news_stories_are_comparing/,"I was too young to remember the Clinton administration, so I'm looking for a little insight to the accuracy of these claims. 

I have seen journalists reference the way in which members of the Democratic party came to the defense of Clinton, despite the slow release of information that incriminated him to the point in which they refused to impeach him because they sought to retain the reputation of their party/hated the opposition so much they would rather ignore their own president's misdeeds.


Is this an accurate representation of the events that transpired around his impeachment? Can this be characterized as the turn to intensely partisan politics that we are seeing today? 

The way in which these journalists are portraying this seems like they are trying to tell Democrats that the blind following of a leader embroiled in controversy was their original play and the current Republican lawmakers/leaders are just following the same path. Is that accurate? Is this a tactic to make Republican lawmakers seem less complicit in associating with Trump by saying the Democrats did it first?

For disclosure, I am a liberal minded person but read Fox News for a different perspective. Here are some examples I can find from a quick search, but I have seen similar messages echoed elsewhere. 


&gt; It is especially ironic that a guy who helped break the back of the Democratic Party in order to save himself would intone against self-centered politicians. He would know better than to have a campaign as grossly self-centered as his wife’s, but the end goal of Clintonism was only ever Clinton himself.

&gt;When we cast our eyes back over the past 30 years in politics, both sides can agree that the impeachment of Clinton was a shattering moment.

&gt;Democrats will tell you that it was when toxic Republican partisanship overtook the GOP. Whatever truth there is in that, it is also true that it was during that impeachment, Democrats just as fully embrace the concept of party over everything. And they did it all to save Bill Clinton. 

&gt;With his various lies and false denials, and those of his team, Clinton made fools out of many in his party. But he drained them of their dignity so slowly that many did not notice, and some still haven’t yet. 

&gt;History now recalls that sex-crazed, hypocritical, hyper-partisan, Gingrichian Republicans and their Torquemada, Ken Starr, tried to oust a sitting president for receiving the fellative ministrations of a woman who was not his wife. To say that this was well-executed spin by the president and his team understates the genius of the dishonesty. 

&gt;There’s no reason to rehash all the details, but if you would have told the Democratic members of the Senate at the outset that the president had engaged in a variety of innovative sexual acts with a 21-year-old intern, has engaged in these assignations in the Oval Office, lied about it and sought to cover it up, they would have demanded he resign at once. 

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/14/oh-really-bubba.html

&gt; [Ed. note: Once any politician decides survival is the only thing that matters, partisan warfare becomes imperative. It almost seems quaint now that Richard Nixon resigned the office of the presidency to save himself, his staff, his party and the country the humiliation of impeachment. Nixon, remembered as a twisted spike of resentments and ambition, demonstrated considerable grace at the end. Comparing that to what the Clintons did or what Republicans are doing now tells us how much has changed. The trap here is when one believes that it is not wrong to put party ahead of country because the other guys are just so awful. We should rightly understand partisanship as an impediment to patriotism, albeit one that might be necessary. When we see partisanship as patriotic duty, we are a lost cause.

6nws9r,6,2017-07-17,Blindsided by Breakup,BrainChimp,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6nws9r/blindsided_by_breakup/,"Greetings all -- I hate that I'm posting here but unfortunately I've had a breakup. 

**Backstory - First Relationship**

November 21st, 2012 I began dating a girl whom we'll call N. N was my first long-term girlfriend, before her the longest I had been with somebody was 3 months. Things with N were great; however, on January 11th, 2014, N broke up with me. 

Her reasoning for the breakup was that she hadn't had a chance to experience the single life-style. Before me she had just gotten out of a long term relationship (3 years IIRC) and felt that she needed time to go figure herself out. She claimed the following: 

* I didn't do anything wrong in the relationship/it's not you, it's me.
* That she felt like she needed to figure out who she was and to grow as a person, and she couldn't do that in a relationship. 
* That she still loved me, but didn't feel it was fair to me if she felt this way to stay in the relationship. 

Now this breakup hit me hard. I managed to go mostly NC despite being at the same college and did this for around 1.5 months before I found a great group of people who befriended me. I also became romantically involved with one of those people and was so for another 1.5 months before my ex-girlfriend, N, began contacting me telling me how badly she had messed up. 

I didn't know this at the time but N was very emotionally immature; however, it being my first ""big"" relationship and with me still having feelings I decided to take her back and that nothing could go wrong. This is around early April of 2014 and we stayed together until April 12th, 2016. Over the course of our relationship N had developed lots of anxiety in regards to her insecurity in regards to the fact that I was romantically involved with someone else during the breakup, something that I didn't feel sympathy for considering she broke up with me and apparently expected me to do nothing but be sad and miss her. 

Now -- because of N's anxiety she had become very possessive and emotionally abusive. This was brought to light when a girl whom we'll call B, began talking to me. She had been in the same Improv group as I had for around 3 years and we talked on/off during that time but never really were friends. I spent a good month befriending B and we found out that we really liked one another and that I was NOT willing to continue being in a relationship with N because of how unhappy I actually was. 

**Beginnings with B**

Thus, I broke things off with N and went to go be with B, I moved into her apartment (because there was no way I was going to stay in my apartment with N) and we lived together for the rest of that semester. B then moved to my mom's house w/me for the summer and worked at a Summer Camp while I worked at a movie theater. It was great, and once the summer ended we went back to B's apartment that was located closer to the college. This was because B was a year younger than I was and still had to finish her senior year. 

I lived with B until December 2016 and then moved 45 minutes away for my new job which provided housing. B would then get an internship in the same city I was working for her Spring Semester so she spent a lot of time at my place w/me. She basically lived there 6 out of the 7 days of the week. She finished school, I finished work, and we had plans to go back to school together to further our education. 

In the down time we decided to go back to my Mom's house, search for apartments, and save up some money. She worked at the summer camp again and I worked at a local theatre. Our schedules didn't align at ALL, we literally had none of the same days off and there was no way for either of us to request time off to actually try and get a day off together. It was because of this that we felt a little strained in the relationship, mostly on my side. I wished to spend more time with her but she also wanted to spend time with her camp friends &amp; spend some nights there, which, I understood and allowed her to do, realizing that it was selfish of me to try and prevent her from hanging out w/people and that if I was in her situation (like I was when in a relationship with N) I would've wanted my partner to let me hangout w/friends. 

She did make a new friend who we'll call L. L has a girlfriend and is in a band, he's a cool guy and was assigned to working the garden at camp, as was my girlfriend, so the two spent a lot of time together. I was a little anxious of this at first because I hadn't ever had a girlfriend w/male friends, but, decided that I should deal with my anxiety on my own and that I trusted her to make the right choices. 

**The Week of the Breakup**

Fast forward to July 10th, 2017. B and I had found an apartment we wanted and signed the application paperwork on July 11th, 2017. We then made plans to hang-out on July 15th, 2017 because we both had the night free. During this week however she stayed at camp and the place she usually stayed (the camp office) was locked and she was too tired to drive home. L offered her a place to stay in his cabin on the floor and she took it. B told me about this the next day and apologized but informed me that nothing happened -- I was happy for her honesty and believed that nothing happened (and still do believe this). Two nights later, July 14th, 2017, she went out to a bar w/L because his band was playing there. I was working so I couldn't go with (and that was fine) but she got a little tipsy and couldn't drive herself home. So, L took B in her car and brought her to her grandfather's place (he lived nearby and she was planning on staying there since it was so close). B texted me when she arrived home and let me know that she loved me and that she was excited for our plans the next night. 

Come July 15th, the day of our plans. I unfortunately had work until 4:00 but was going to pick up B to head out for the night on the town. At 3:00PM I get a text from her asking how I'm doing and how my day is going. I reply that it's all going alright, just usual work stuff, and ask about her day -- she replies that she's had a rough day. I ask her to describe what's wrong and she tells me that she'd rather call me. So at 4:00PM when I get out she calls me and is in tears and a panic, she says she doesn't know what she wants anymore. 

She doesn't know if she wants to be with me anymore, she doesn't know if she wants to live where we were going to live, and she doesn't know if what she's going to go back to school for is what she really wants to do. Basically, B pulled a HUGE 180 on our relationship and started questioning everything, and no, there were NO signs leading up to this happening, very minimal conflict, both of us really enjoying the other's company, etc. 

So I get home and we talk and she says she needs to be alone for the night to think. She goes to camp and stays there for the night and the next day tells me that she wants to break up with me. She then recited nearly verbatim the same speech that N had given me when she broke up with me years ago. All about how she is still in love with me and that I did nothing wrong in the relationship and that it's the best relationship she's ever been in, but she is confused and needs time to discover herself. When I asked if she had developed feelings for another person she claimed she hadn't and went off about how she felt like she hadn't grown as a person and that she felt that she had used relationships as a way to not be alone. 

I would understand this more but before I got in a relationship with B she had been single for around a year or so and she was the one who came into my life, not me trying to enter hers. 

So now, B is moving all of her stuff out of my house. She wants to remain friends but understands if I need time before that happens (damn right I do). She's also going to be living at camp for the rest of the summer, then living with her grandfather. She isn't going to go back to school just yet either, and might wait a semester or so before heading back. 

I'm caught totally off-guard by this behavior. Throughout our relationship B has been very emotionally mature and well grounded. She majored in Human Services and is very good at talking through her emotions and keeping up strong communication. This is a very new move from B and she's throwing away the stability and future we had because she was uncertain, despite her not being able to say what in our relationship was bad or why she wasn't happy, she just claimed she wasn't. 

So here I am. I've decided to establish no contact with her and moved all of her stuff that was in our bedroom to the garage. That way I don't have to communicate with her when she comes to pick stuff up. I'm honestly thinking that she is emotionally interested in L but didn't want to tell me, despite me asking. Maybe she still hasn't admitted to herself, but it's very strange, especially since B had been cheated on by her boyfriend before me, so for her to cheat it seems very out of character, especially since she knows the trauma it caused her. 

I'm taking each day as it comes, the breakup is still very fresh. I haven't heard from her since she had called me around 9:00 PM on 7/16/17 to ask about picking up her stuff. I'm going to continue the NC because if she truly wants to be alone then she doesn't need me meddling in her affairs or texting her constantly. There is a part of me that hopes she comes back, because I think all of her concerns are easily workable. If she is interested in L then she'll have to deal with his girlfriend and the fact that he lives nowhere near where she'll be living once camp ends. I believe that she might've gotten a bit of Grass is Greener syndrome and belived that she could be happier with someone else despite being in a great relationship. 

She told me that in our relationship she felt content but doesn't know why she was unhappy and needs to discover that. 

I don't know what I'm getting at here -- I think I'm just spewing words at this point. I do hope that B comes back but will maintain NC for several months. If B doesn't come back I wouldn't mind being friends w/her again. She did manage to be good friends with the ex that cheated on her, someone who I also befriended during the course of our relationship, so I know she's capable of maintaining friendships w/past partners. However, I'm not going to wait around for her to come back. I've been planning events w/friends for pretty much every day of the week, that way I don't focus on the relationship and don't have the urge to contact her as much. Perhaps she will realize that she misses me and wants to give things another shot, something she didn't deny was a possibility when we last talked, but perhaps she'll find whatever she needs. 

I do love her, and a part of me always will, just like she loves me and a part of her always will. 

So with that I end my post. Thanks to anyone who reads it and gives advice/thoughts/opinions on the situation. I know it's a long read but it's much appreciated.

6nxes1,37,2017-07-17,Can't believe how stupid this guy is,sarahsaturn,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/6nxes1/cant_believe_how_stupid_this_guy_is/,"I've had a lot of bad roommates but the guy I'm living with now is easily the worse.

I got roped into subleasing for someone I know. When I met her roommate he let it slip that she had only lived with him for like 2 months. That's a terrible sign, and I stupidly decided to ignore it.

He never cleans up after himself, and has stolen my food repeatedly even though I've repeatedly confronted him about it. Once when I confronted him about his hordes of dirty dishes he tried to convince me that I had made them. We have no other roommates. I could go on and on.

He got fired from an internship a few months ago (probably due to his jackass behavior).

Our lease is up on July 28th. The other day he asked me if I've found a new place to live yet, like he hasn't even started looking. He also announced to me that he will be out of town until the 26th. I plan on having everything out before that so I never have to deal with his ass again.

Just now I overheard him on the phone with someone, saying he's out of savings because he hasn't worked in months, but he's also going on vacation tomorrow and will probably need to pay even more for baggage.

In summary, he needs to find a job and a new place to live by the 28th, but instead of looking for either of those things he's decided to take a vacation. I almost want to stick around longer to see how the 28th ends up going."

  I am currently a college student studying computer science and eventually software engineering. I am an advocate for learning and improving myself while building better habits.

  Currently I am seeking two main mentors that could meet once or twice a month in the following areas: business (options trading, entrepreneurship, networking) and a software engineer that could could guide me with resources or internship ideas and opportunities.

  I am open minded, but mostly progressing to be the best I can be in those two areas. I do not have much money at all, so any help is much appreciated.

  Please do not contact me with multi level marketing or pyramid scheme ideas.

  Looking for a group of friends that are interested in board games, talking ideas, just socializing. I am in a relationship so time is kind of crunched.

  Thank you look forward to talking to you."

6nxjn3,1,2017-07-17,"Low salary, but great people",swillygal,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6nxjn3/low_salary_but_great_people/,"Wanted to make sure I posted this in the right place:

I'm a therapist currently employed in a private practice where I completed my internship. They hired me right after completion, and bumped me to full-time salaried after about 4 months.

When I saw the salary on my contract, I was initially shocked at how low it was. I'm talking UNDER 30,000 for a job in my field. Since I'd never been salaried before (or made a good sum of money since I was in school prior to the job) I signed the contract and told myself that ""everyone has to start somewhere."" 

A year later, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I know they give annual raises, but they can't be nearly enough to make a big dent. I have coworkers who have been in the field for 5-7 years and are only making 33,000. Basically everyone who is salaried at this company is unhappy with compensation. 

It's been brought up before as an issue, but there is never any change.

The biggest issue I have, is that the owners are therapists themselves. They told my coworker (who just quit) that they believe that the positive environment that they provide makes up for the low pay. They say that everything goes back into our salaries- which I just don't buy. The business is doing quite well from where I stand. If it's going back into salaried, it's not going into ours. 

What do I do? How can they expect anyone to be okay with that? We have bills to pay, and you can't pay bills with happy/fuzzy feelings. 

Now I love the owners and my other co-workers as friends and mentors. They have taught me a ton, and I don't want to sever any relationships. A big part of me doesn't want to lose my support system.

Thinking about looking for a new job but I would most likely have to move out of the state. 

Advice would be SO appreciated. "
6nxkz5,247,2017-07-17,(Spoilers Main) Examining the quality of writing on GOT now that S7 has begun.,ljcole90,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/6nxkz5/spoilers_main_examining_the_quality_of_writing_on/,"Honestly, I'm astounded that there aren't more damning reviews of the Season 7 premiere, noting the huge dip in the quality of writing that's occurred over the past three seasons and the fact that the show is only nosediving further by the looks of it.

I've been so immersed in this universe for such a long time and the prospect of this poorly written, plot-hole ridden, dumbed down final stretch of GOT being the only conclusion to this saga that we're likely to ever see is one I feel pretty upset about.

This is not meant to be a provocative post, but to launch points of discussion and have an honest conversation about several of what I perceive to be this show's greatest failings.

**1). Plot-holes and jumps in logic:**

Over the last few seasons, these have become almost countless. From one episode alone of Season 7, the following points have arisen:

- Where is the fallout of what happened to King's Landing last season? Are we supposed to buy the idea that there was no uprising or revolt after Cersei blew up the sept, the faith, and the Queen? It's utterly ridiculous. 

- When did Arya learn to change faces to this extent? And how did she manage to rule the Twins for two weeks as fake Walder Frey, with no-one noticing that Black Walder/Lothar are missing? More to the point - how the hell did she organise the ENTIRE family getting into one room - we're meant to believe that this is the entire extent of the notoriously massive Frey clan? Where are all the younger sons, the women and children? How did everyone make it there at short notice and surely some members are missing? How did she dispose of Walder Frey's body on her own? How did she carve up two men into a pie without being noticed? Why is she doing this mass-murder in the first place when her method of revenge up until this point has solely revolved around INDIVIDUALS who have perpetrated great crimes and her very specific kill-list? This seems over-the-top and simply put into the show to induce a dumbass 'HELL YEAH' moment for the audience. The Red Wedding is the most significant moment in perhaps the entire show and THIS is the payoff we've been waiting for? I felt nothing during this scene. 

- Why has Sam's baby suddenly turned into a toddler in what seems to be the timespan of about ten minutes since the last episode of Season 6? Why has Sam only now remembered that tons of obsidian is under Dragonstone when he was told this in Season 5?  Why is this forbidden information in the library when it seems to be relatively common knowledge?

- People have mentioned this elsewhere, but seriously why the hell is noone at Dragonstone? Stannis would have left someone there, or one of the neighbouring families would have claimed it, or the Lannisters would have stationed a garrison there seeing as it is one of the KEY defensive strongholds in Westeros. It is simply incomprehensible to me that the Lannisters have not done *anything* to reclaim Dragonstone after the battle of Blackwater. And even if we do go along with the idea that it is utterly abandoned, then why is the entire building in brilliant condition, clean to the extent that it looks freshly swept and prepared for Dany's arrival? This entire scene is a contradiction. 

- Why, after baking men into pies and staging a massacre, is Arya still able to enjoy the company of these Lannister soliders in the woods like a friendly, normal girl? It totally contradicts how she is unable to empathise with people anymore, how she is damaged and broken and trusts noone. It felt like she'd totally slipped out of character, laughing and quipping like they were mates down the pub. And why are these soliders referring to the 'drinking age' in Westeros? This is ridiculous - even children drank in the middle ages! And why are they inviting a random girl who could be an enemy to come and sit with them, no questions asked? Why are they all so nice, with no variation in character at all? Why is noone mistrustful or curious about Arya? And don't get me started on Ed Sheeran. So much about this scene is poorly written. 

- How did Jorah get to Oldtown? Why is he grabbing and scaring Sam and making weird remarks about his Queen - just for dramatic effect? Yet another instance of the showrunners preferring shock value over realism. Why isn't Sam asking any questions? 

- Why is Dany walking ahead of everyone else with all the most important people in her cohort when they haven't even scouted ahead to check Dragonstone is safe? And why is Dany and her entire cohort completely silent walking that endlessly long walk over the beach and up through Dragonstone?  They have quite a bit to take in and talk about, surely? Oh wait, here we go, it's so that she can end the episode on one of her banging melodramatic one-liners. Goodbye realism, hello popcorn television.  

- Why isn't anyone noting that the Dreadfort is now a free castle that can be given to the Northern Lords? Or have the Boltons now been written out of the show entirely, along with numerous other characters and families? 

I could go into so much more detail on this episode alone but I want to move on to what is actually the main problem here:

**2) Characterisation**

How did it go so wrong? Characters such as Jaime, Arya, Sansa and Dany were all nearly perfectly judged up until around the end of Season 3. Now they are a mess of contradictions, baffling arcs and terrible writing.

- **Arya** seems to have become nothing but a kick-ass deus-ex-machina device for the writers to send around on murder sprees that have long ceased to contain any substance or impact. All the internal conflict within her that used to be present has been reduced down to a single-minded killing machine story that is as predictable as it is lazy. One of my favourite characters has become superficial and melodramatic, and it's deeply sad to see so much wasted potential.

- **Dany** is possibly my least favourite character these days. She seems to have either forgotten how to change her facial expression, or Emilia Clarke seems to have forgotten how to act altogether. Her lines are all 'badass' quotes that seem to have been written purely as trailer-fodder. I can't remember the last time a scene of hers felt believable or nuanced, or the last time I felt invested in the character. The showrunners are treating Dany more like a superhero than a real character these days - what happened to the conflict inside of her between a desire for peace and a desire for fire and blood? Or the conflict between her role as 'mother of dragons' and her role as 'mhysa'? All that has been swept under the carpet, and now she somehow manages to express even less emotion in her scenes than her CGI dragons.

- Then there's **Sansa**. Since the 5-minute mood-swing when Sansa decided to become a 'player' in Season 4, her character has flailed between power and powerlessness in hugely awkward ways - Season 5's Bolton fiasco being the most obvious example of shoehorning her into a role which completely botched the arc her character was undergoing. They still don't seem to know what to do with her - she says she has 'learned so much' but most recently is calling out Jon in front of a room of all their supporters - even interns at their first job know that this is not acceptable behaviour - question people's decisions in private, not in public! In all of her scenes, I can't tell whether she is intentionally written as an idiot, or if the showrunners just want to shoehorn in conflict with her and Jon in the most obvious and stupid ways possible.

- But I think the most wasted potential has to be that of **Jaime**. Since early in Season 4, Jaime has become a redundant character, reduced to awkward comedy and a supporting cast member in Cersei's machinations. What happened to the redemption arc that was blooming throughout Season 3, which was transforming Jaime into one of the most compelling characters in the show, and which is still happening in the books? By making Jaime stay by Cersei's side instead of questioning and abandoning her, sending him to Dorne instead of straight to the Riverlands, and having his character since then mostly endure endless scenes of bickering with Cersei that amount to nothing except 'Cersei bad, Jaime uncomfortable', they have reduced one of the most three-dimensional and interesting characters that GOT had to offer down to one of the most one-dimensional. I can barely put into words how disappointed I am with this arc, it's such a missed opportunity. Even the actor seems tired of it, all his scenes feel practically phoned-in at this point.

- Lastly, I find **Brienne** to be rather horrible in the show. She is practically a bully to Pod, humourless and gruff. Her scenes are often filler since Season 4, and the same beats are played time and time again, as if the writers have no idea how to progress her character. Her internal conflict and self-doubt - evident in Season 3 with Jaime - her kindness and capacity for love - evident in Season 2 with Catelyn and Season 3 with Jaime - have been practically written out of the show since early Season 4 and now she is at best a meandering, pointless character. Her scenes feel like mere fan service these days - she has ceased to have any meaningful impact on the plot. It's such a shame that the showrunners seem to have entirely missed the point of this complex character created by GRRM, choosing instead to interpret his concept of a 'powerful woman' as a 'violent humourless brute'.

These are the most egregious examples that come to mind, but there are plenty more characterisation problems that have plagued the show in recent seasons that I won't go into for now. (Stannis, anyone?)

**3) Structure**

Finally, the latter run of this show has felt so, so rushed. The showrunners are killing off entire families (eg. Martells/Freys) in terrible, lazy scenes that actually make no practical sense. Are we meant to believe the entire House Frey is gone now after Arya's one act, or that Dorne accepted the bastard rule of a bunch of kinslayers and traitors? Are we meant to accept that Meereen is safe in the hands of Daario, with its entire leadership and army migrated across the sea? This is no way to resolve problematic storylines, and it's frankly insulting to the viewers' intelligence to tie up loose ends in this way. Add into this the numerous characters that seem to have been totally abandoned (eg Quaithe, Old Nan, Illyrio), the endless filler scenes (5 mins of a literal 'shit' montage in Oldtown), the convenient teleportation between various locations in order to rush through the story that defy consistency or credibility (eg Varys teleporting across the Narrow Sea several times a season, Littlefinger teleporting around Westeros from episode to episode etc), the out-of-character decisions that characters make so that various events are forced into action (eg. Sansa marrying Ramsay, Stannis marching his army blindly to death despite being one of the great military strategists of his time, Jaqen deciding that Arya abandoning her training is totally cool) - it's all a total mess.

And yet, despite rushing to the finish line and making terrible decisions for so many of the characters, the show still finds time to while episodes away with totally pointless plotlines such as a Missandei/Greyworm romance, a totally unnecessary and overlong soujourn by Jon to kill mutineers at Crasters Keep that amounts to exactly zilch in terms of character/plot development, endless scenes of Arya sweeping/being hitten with a stick, the Jaime/Bronn trip to Dorne/every scene with the Sand Snakes. All this time filling our screens with total rubbish could have been filled with such fantastic material that has been left out, such as the Lady Stoneheart plotline - which, by the way, would have given Jaime and Brienne's characters some actual *purpose* over the last few seasons - or the actual Dorne plot from the books which is so brilliantly complex and high stakes (surely anything would have been better than the Dorne plot we *did* get?), or keeping Barristan alive to have some of his great moments from the end of ADWD to make Meereen actually exciting? I could go on.

This used to be my favourite show. And I'm dreading the end of it, because I know it will just be more of the above. However, before you all say 'well just stop watching then', the reason I'm still compelled to watch this thing is because I feel that realistically it's the only ending I'll ever get to a series I've been fanatical about for so long. And because, hand on heart, I used to absolutely love this show, and part of me still harbours hope that it can return to form and make me once again invested in these characters that I have followed for so many years.

Sorry for the long post, and I know many of you will disagree, but I hope some of the above makes sense. Thanks for reading."

Anyway, for my internship, I'm tasked with classifying sentences related to medical providers (i.e. ""I need a heart doctor"" -&gt; ""Cardiologist,"" ""I'm expecting a baby"" -&gt; ""OBGYN"") and I'm not sure what would be the best way to accomplish this.

I've looked through pages of posts on this subreddit, but they mostly seem to be concerned with cutting-edge research methods, and since I don't come from an ML background they're difficult to understand.
I've tried using Doc2Vec TaggedDocument/LabeledSentences, but results seem to be all over the place. I trained a dataset with mappings as simple as ""Eye"" -&gt; ""Ophthalmologist,"" but when I tried to get the closest vector to ""Eye"" using my model I got Oncologist, Pulmonologist, etc. all with higher scores than ophthalmologist, which was near the bottom. I'm not sure why this is the case - could it be because my training data was too small (around 200 samples)?
I've also tried using:

http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/
but I'm running into errors with subtracting from negative matrices, or something like that.

Any tips or pointers on the best way to achieve this would be appreciated! I'm not looking for near-perfect accuracy - just something that doesn't recognize ""cancer"" as OBGYN etc, which is how my current model is returning :/

(Info in comments)",FoieGrasAndBeer,Breadit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/6ny1hs/hi_breadit_can_you_help_me_pick_out_a_universally/,"Hi Breadit,

I am the chef de cuisine of an ambitious casual restaurant. We are currently serving a few different breads on the menu, as sides with certain items: brioche, sourdough (tartine style) and parker house rolls. The issue is, we are letting our pastry team go at the end of August because we cannot afford to keep the labour. The restaurant is very busy but the pastry team does not bring in enough money for what they cost us. The executive chef wants me to come up with a bread that will cover all the basics, is delicious, but is very easy to execute (i.e. - one of our interns could do it, or at the very least mise it up for someone with more experience to finish it). We use sourdough for almost everything currently. Obviously, it's decently time consuming.

I've spent the last couple of days deep in my books, coming up with some good base ideas, but nothing that really takes me to where I want to go. I've looked at things like pan au lait, pain de campagne, etc. Nothing seems to jump out at me.

I come looking for ideas for something that is tried and true delicious for grilling, spreading things like burrata and liver mousse on, building braised rabbit rillettes on, etc. 

Does anybody have any good leads? I am very grateful for any input. Honestly, if somebody had a recipe for a fucking amazing foccacia that was light-as-air, that would probably be a good starting point.

Thank you all so much! :)"

I've been towards my BS for a few months but I already have an AAS, some certs, and a 4.0 (I know no one cares about GPA but I put it on my resume because it's high.) I had a 1 year IT related internship that gave me all the experience in the world. The interviewers are even impressed themselves with my internship, especially since it was with the government. 

I'm looking for entry level jobs. 

I've been to 4 interviews, I know that's not a lot but stay with me for a minute. I've gotten rejected from them all. 

I'm a very personable individual, I'm ""well spoken"", I did incredibly well on the technical portions of the interviews (the interviewers even expressed how impressed they were with my skills and knowledge for someone with 1 year of experience) and I'm still getting passed up. Job #1 low-balled the ever living shit out of me and refused to negotiate because ""the other candidate is willing to accept X amount."" Okay, that's understandable...BUT This annoyed me because THEY discussed pay during the first interview...for which I responded with ""that's reasonable for the area"" and we moved on. The other two, one of which I knew my competition, had a 1 month internship where he watched YouTube all day. He got the job over me. You know what they told me? ""We went with the candidate that had a background that better fit the requirements."" I'm feeling really down right now because I'm tired of working my ass off and getting no where. 


My husband says that he believes that they see that I'm a a good candidate and they think that once I get my experience I'm dipping the hell out of there. He's not lying, BUT I do not give off that vibe in the interviews. I'm passionate about technology, it's exciting, cutting edge, and innovative and I love it. My husband does interviews, even though he isn't in HR, and we made sure I didn't give off that vibe. 


Is it really even worth working twice as hard to get HALF of what they have? I don't want to give up but I'm feeling like it's not worth my time and I should jump ship early and change fields. 

Has anyone had these kind of issues before? I just needed to vent. I'm wondering if I'll ever be good enough. 

Apologies for any grammar errors. I haven't proofread this yet. "

My first day as an assistant to a prestigious senator. This was a dream come true. Walking into capital hill I couldn't help but remember all the hard work it took to get this position. The essays, the presentations, the interviews. I must have beat out at least a hundred other applicants but here I was. I beamed with pride as I knocked on your door. I could feel my heart thumping in my chest as you called me in. I opened the door and saw you hard at work at your desk.

""Hello Alexis, nice to finally meet you."" you said gesturing for me to sit. ""You're are here for the intern position correct?"" I nodded. ""Yes I'm here to be your personal assistant."" You nod your head not listening. I keep going. ""I think what you're doing is great and I can't wait to be a part of it. If you need anything just let me know. Also you can call me Lexi. And if you don't mind I'd like to suggest some things like.... and....""

My voice droned on as you pretended to care. You occasionally ""mhm'd"" at the right times but mostly you looked at your computer. Your eyes were glued to the monitor as you flipped through all the pictures on my instagram. Your pants grew tight as you saw a picture of me in my micro bikini. I had a fit petite body, with a nice tight ass and slender legs. My huge breasts were slung in the tiny bikini top and my crimson hair fell like a silken curtain around my shoulders. You looked back at me and stared at my thick, luscious lips. They looked so full and my red lipstick really made them pop. You started undressing me with your eyes; picturing me in my bikini or some sexy lingerie. To see my tight little body in person. Those great big tits of mine.

It wasn't an accident that I was chosen for the intern position. Of course all applicants were welcome but a careful screening process was put in place to ensure only candidates with certain attributes were chosen. You flipped open a folder and read my dossier.

 * Name: Alexis
 * Ethnicity: Caucasian
 * Hair: Red, Long
 * Age: 18
 * Piercings: Ears, Tongue, Belly Button
 * Tattoos: ""Tramp Stamp"" on lower back
 * Height: 5'2''
 * Weight: 124 lbs
 * Bra Size: 32 GG
 * Measurements: B40'', W24'', H37""
 * Interests: Ballet, Cheerleading, Fitness

It was close, a pretty little blonde girl almost beat me out. She had all the measurables I did but she was 19 and I was 18 so in the end it was an easy decision. 

Cutting me off mid-sentence you said, ""Alright, well here is what you'll be doing here."" I shut my mouth and listened, leaning in a bit closer. ""You're going to be my personal assistant which means if I need you to do anything you're going to do it."" I nodded and said, ""Yes of course! I'll do anything! If you need something, anything, don't hesitate to tell me!."" You smiled and said, ""Alright then first things first. I'm going to need those lips of yours to suck my cock."" You saw an inquisitive look on my face. ""I'm sorry...what?"" I must have heard wrong. What did he say? You leaned in closer and said, ""I need you to suck my cock.""
You saw the look on my face turn from joy to disgust. ""What?! No!?"" I said. ""Do I look like a whore to you? You're ridiculous, thinking I'd suck your cock."" I said as I started to collect my things. I stood up and almost stepped out the door when you said, ""Being an assistant to a senator can go a long way in your career. A lot of doors can open in the blink of an eye, endless opportunities await. But only if you stay here with me."" I stopped walking and paused. It was true. It was the reason I tried so hard to get this position. 10 years of my career could be bypassed in an instant. But at what cost?

I turned around and saw your sleazy look. You were an appalling asshole, but maybe this would be worth it. Later on I could enact real change, real reform. I could clean all the people like you out of DC and make way for others that actually want to help the nation. People that will use their power for good, not coerce girls to be their personal prostitutes. At this rate the sooner the better. I waited a little before I walked back and sat down in the chair. It took every once of effort I had to completely let go of my self respect. ""Alright... you have a deal."" I said."

Hello kind people! I am so thankful for all the knowledge you bestow on us here, and I am hoping that you could help with my current situation. 

I'm not in the best financial state, but it has been getting better lately- mostly thanks to this sub- so I'm excited for future potential! 

My credit plummeted during an unpaid internship after college. (I made a mistake with my degree and want to go back to get certified as an architect)

My goal:
Purchase and renovate an argosy travel trailer for full time living. 

My problem:
Basically no savings. 
Underwater car loan (18%/$27,000 owed/purchased two years ago when I was a lot more stupid than I am now). 
Maxed out income working 50hrs a week and 10+ hours commuting- I'm exhausted. 
Bad credit-600 score

The details:
Monthly bill expenditures of about $3000
Car payment/ins/gas ~$1000
Rent- $800
Utilities- $150
Paying credit cards down- $400 ($4200 left)
Student loans- $40/ month ($37000 total IBR plan)
Personal/grocery/dining/bars ~$500
Income as a server ~50,000 (new job 10mos in)

I'm asking for help because I'm new to truly adulting and I want to own this. I'm not exactly sure how to get out of this terrible car loan without killing my credit again (tried to refinance and got 10 ""inquiries"" dropped my score so I no longer qualified for the deal I wanted). 

I'd also like some advice on whether to get a personal loan to purchase the trailer ($5000 or under), or if it's more cost effective to continue saving and paying rent in Chicago. 

Basically, I'm new to the detailed financial experience most people write about here, but I'd love to hear anything you have to say. 

Edit: I am looking at buying an Argosy travel trailer and renovating it for winter/full time living. I'll be renovating with sustainability in mind, focusing on buying used supplies and outfitting with solar. This is also a project which is applicable to my degree and will be qualified as a thesis.

Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture. The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
6nzf4z,1,2017-07-18,"23[M4F] -Writing Hardcore Corruption Reality stories for those on ""lonely"" moments ;) [F] Tributes Welcome. 1) The New Intern (part 1 - Abigail &amp; Jason)",IncubusD94,dirtykikpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/6nzf4z/23m4f_writing_hardcore_corruption_reality_stories/,"*Her head is filled with reports,numbers and every self expectation that a 23 year old woman has, in a society that desires the best. At her work place she gives off an aura of every fresh recruit going the extra mile to stand out. She stays till late when there no one around but a janitor, has her meals delivered to work and starts and ends her day by her desk.At her age, she should be partying and fucking to her hearts content,while maintaining the bare minimum income to stay alive. While some were impressed by her commitment, others and even her own friends and coworkers considered it as waste of her youth. Abigail wasn't interested in the cliche, she believed in having a perfect relationship. All the way from long courting the guy, romantic letters, maybe a kiss on the 6th date and probably couple months into their relationship, move up the bases. She did loose her virginity in college only after being 3 years with her boyfriend, though she enjoyed the experience. She believed that, Pleasure could only be as good if the ""right"" path was followed. She was the Ideal Miss Goody Too Shoes of the company as well, even to the extent of snitching on some of the employees when they slacked, discreetly of course but few suspected her. She liked the line of work she was in and wanted to grow with the company as well and did her best to be the best in the eyes of her boss and her coworkers.
Her boss also seemed to think she was the 'Ideal' employee his company could want, but not the one it needed. His company was going through a downturn and performance was low.His employees were pushed to their limits to get numbers up but it just wasn't happening. He needed to get innovative with them.
To him, Abigail Steward had wonderful 'assets' that can be used to improve the productivity of the his employee's. He just had to start working her mind that way.
                                       
*Her boss was the opposite of her mentality. Being raised in a rich but tough environment, Jason Banks was used to getting what he demanded for or using everything at his disposal in order to get it. Having a firm body and being the head of the top retail company in the states, He could almost do and getaway with just about anything.There had been numerous cases of sexual harassment charged by his female employees in the past when he was first starting out, but they never followed through.
 Infact those same employees now had this dazed look on their faces everytime around Jason, the same kind a cockdrunk slut would have after being broken down. There were even rumors that a female employee was found naked in his office cabinet blindfolded with a gag in her mouth, her breasts covered in her own drool, wearing  a placard saying ""Master has punished me"". She was wearing remote controlled vibrator panties set at the highest setting and she said would not budge from her spot until her ""Master"" gave her permission to do so. Although no evidence was found the next day, The same rumored employee said to have got a promotion and was earning big money 'handling' foreign clients. It was clear that Jason Banks clearly dominated his world when he needed to, and his eyes were now set on Abigail Steward, The New Intern."
6o0ivn,3,2017-07-18,Server Side Matlab Script,Kariminalou,matlab,https://www.reddit.com/r/matlab/comments/6o0ivn/server_side_matlab_script/,"Hello everyone,
First of all, I want to mention that I'm not an expert in Matlab. 
I have to use it because it's part of my internship. 
When I started my internship, there was a Matlab project, doing some Image Calibration (reading an image, selecting a part of the image and then doing a lot of stuff in different functions). 

My objective is to use a smartphone to take a picture, not reading from a file.

I had different approaches : 
- Convert the Matlab Code into some Android Java (it may be difficult because there is a lot of mathematics functions that don't exist in JDK). 
- Host the current Matlab Code in a server (with some modifications of course) to be called from the smartphone, and read an image given in arguments, with also the area selected in the smartphone. 
- Compile the Matlab Code in C, and insert it into my Android project (seems very difficult) 

These are the two main approaches. 

So my question is : 
Is it possible to host a Matlab code in a server, and call it from command line with some arguments, and retrieve the output? Do I have to build an EXE? or just keep the main like this with the whole project? 

Or maybe, do you have any other solutions. 

Again, I may be a novice in Matlab, but it's like every other programming language : I can adapt and document as well, I just need some tracks or tips. 

Thank you very much for your help. "
6o0uca,14,2017-07-18,Coffee Stains,radgarlic,garlicky,https://www.reddit.com/r/garlicky/comments/6o0uca/coffee_stains/,"I looked at my mug, the words “World’s #1 Dad” emblazoned on the outside. My lovely daughter, Summer, had given it to me as a Father’s Day gift, and I had just started drinking from it after many days of using it as desktop decor. Smiling, I raised the cup to take a swig of coffee, but nothing entered my mouth. “Dammit.” Nothing inside but coffee stains.


I leaned back with my mug in hand, taking a break from the mound of work on my desk. My, oh my, oh my, what a freaking big lump of proposals to edit. As I absent-mindedly looked at my mug again, something caught my eye. Something seemed off about the coffee stains. They seemed to form a pattern...that resembled a printer. Ha, now this is something more interesting than work!! Kinda cool, you know. The stains even showed some details, such as the lines for the drawers where you put the paper and the toner cartridge in. I poked at the stains, watching in wonder at the various intricacies - 


A loud bang sounded from behind me, startling me and a few of my coworkers. I turned around to find that Sharon, that bumbling intern, had knocked into the printer while carrying a huge bundle of files, which were now scattered over the place. The machine had also fallen over, pinning Kevin underneath, another intern who by now was screaming bloody murder. With a sigh, the workers surrounding them, including me, stood up to help Kevin out of his little predicament.


As Kevin chastised Sharon about her extreme clumsiness - seriously though, no one else but Sharon can miss a machine twice the size of her waist, AND knock it over - I thought about the coffee stains. After ensuring that both of them had no serious injuries (other than their bruised pride), I made my way back to my desk, and stared into my coffee mug, trying to get another glimpse of the coffee stains. Most of it was still there. I could still see the outline of the printer, but some of it seemed to have blurred. I couldn’t see some of the lines that framed so nicely the intricate details of the printer. It was as if the stains in the mug magically faded a little after the incident happened. However, being the rational person I am, I dismissed it as just a mere coincidence. My drinking pattern simply coincided with the small contours on the side of the cup, to form a nice little pattern that looked just like the incident that was about to happen.


The next morning, I had a slightly thinner stack of paper on my desk. Slouching back on my cheap office chair, I raised my cup to take a sip of my favourite drug, annnnnd nothing entered my mouth. “Dammit.” Cursing, I looked inside again, to find nothing but coffee stains. 


This time, my coffee stains didn’t look anything like a printer. Today, there were relatively fewer lines, all converging on a single point - wait, that looks like the corner of a table. Huh, that’s funny. Well I guess I drank my coffee at a faster rate this time, so there isn’t much time for the coffee to settle on the sides of the cup - 


“Hey!” I yelped as my arm was suddenly kicked from behind, and my elbow jerked forward, hitting a box holding several files, which was unfortunately placed at the corner of my desk. I watched as my carefully-organised folders fell to the floor, in a deafening “FLOP FLOP FLOP”. I looked up in annoyance and found the sheepish face of my cubicle partner James, who was holding his empty water bottle.


“Sorry Lance, I didn’t see your arm.” James bent down to give me a hand with the documents, which were now scattered all over the floor. 


“James, watch where you step! I spent half of yesterday organising those stuff.” 


“Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry! I’ll help you with this shit after I finish my proposal.”


“Nah, it’s okay. Most of these stuff is mine anyways, I like it sorted out my way.”


I waved James away and gathered all my stuff. Gosh, that James undid all my hard work, now I have to redo everything all over again. If he was an intern, I would have unleashed hell on him, and sentenced him to the more cramped cubicles in the basement. I stared at my coffee cup. The coffee stains were now more blurred, where the bottom marks are almost too faded to be seen. Much like the printer image the day before. My curiosity was piqued. I thought it was just a show of affection from my lovely daughter. But could it be more than an ordinary mug? I glanced at the extra work that James just added to my already hectic schedule today, and hastily brushed those idle thoughts away.


On Wednesday, I paid much more attention to my coffee mug than usual, noticing how my coffee left marks on the side. As the minutes pass by slowly, the water line in my mug gradually went down, leaving stains as expected. What I did not expect, was that the stains did not form any discernible patterns like the previous two days. I was completely bewildered, but continue examining it every time I took a sip. 


By 10.10 am, I finished my coffee, and proceeded to spend about five minutes scrutinising each and every stain inside my coffee mug. I attracted a few curious glances from my coworkers as I spun my mug round and round and cocked my head to the side, trying to get a better angle. They probably thought I went a little looney after I put in some overtime the day before. But to no avail, I couldn’t see anything. 


“Lance, you need a coffee top-up? I can get some for you if you like.” James came over with his empty water bottle.


“No need, thank you.” I looked up for a moment. “You going to the pantry? Mind bringing over some chips? Sour cream and onion, thank you.”


“No problem, Lance.” James went on his way and I turned my attention back to the mug. There’s a rectangle inside a larger rectangle, then there’s a few short lines, then there’s this round blotch at the side. Yeah, a little weird, doesn’t it look like a...microwave?


Immediately, I jumped up from my seat and turned around, catching a glimpse of James as he rounded the corner and entered the pantry. I took off after him, pushing past the cabinets and coworkers in the corridor. James had just started refilling his water bottle when I reached the entrance of the pantry.


“Hey Lance! You decided to pick up the chips yourself?”


His smile disappeared into a surprised gasp as I tackled him to the floor.


“What the hell Lance?!” His irritated glance raked my face. 


“Er….” I was at a loss for words when faced with his expression of anger. But all questions were answered by thunderous bang behind us. We both rolled away for cover as sparks and small pieces of debris showered us.


With our ears still ringing, we picked ourselves up to find that the microwave had exploded - just a few inches away from where James’ head had been. The door had split up into charred, twisted pieces that pelted us along with the burnt remains of someone’s instant pasta. If I hadn’t pushed James out of the way, I wouldn’t want to know what his face would have looked like in the full blast of the explosion. 


“Er, thanks for saving me, Lance. How did you know - why did you tackle me to the ground - why…” James, while grateful, couldn’t really find his tongue in the immediate aftermath of the incident. 


“I saw sparks in the microwave.” I lied. No one would believe me anyway. After helping a shaken James back to his table, I returned to my own work desk and stared at my coffee mug. As expected, the coffee stains had already blurred. I looked at the ceramic receptacle, perched so innocently on a stack of unfinished reports. Slowly, I bent over and whispered softly, “Thank you.”


From that day onwards, I was pretty attentive to my fortune-telling coffee companion. It did help me, and many fortunate coworkers, a lot. From files placed precariously on shelves, plugs not plugged in securely, heavy objects placed on top of cabinets - I must have prevented many stubbed toes, swollen foreheads, short circuits, you name it, I’ve saved it. I became known as the guy who would spot accidents before they happened. It was some Final Destination shit - just less morbid, and also even though I prevented the incident from happening, the would-be victim wouldn’t suffer any worse consequences. None that I know of anyways. It was felt good to have such a power. I began treating the cup not as a receptacle, but as a friend, making sure to carefully set it down on the table far from the edges and away from any sharp objects that could scratch it.


Recently, due to poor sales, our firm had been struggling to break even. The situation has gotten so bad, that the higher-ups have considered laying off some staff, in a bid to reduce costs. As a result, the mood in the office has changed from the usual upbeat atmosphere to a more gloomy one, where everyone was tried to prove their worth by taking on more projects even though the said projects were becoming more scarce. The pressure was at an all-time high, with many people stressing over their future at the firm. I was not left out - I became more selfish too, trying to solo the simpler tasks so as to prove that I was efficient and indispensable to the firm. It’s human nature, after all - my rice bowl was threatened.


As I became more and more self-absorbed, I stopped saving people from mishaps. It wasn’t that I was too caught up with work to watch my coffee stains anymore - I actually paid more attention to it, to avoid meeting with accidents myself. But for other incidents that happened to my coworkers - I decided to turn a blind eye. Accidents started happening again, and sometimes, it helps relieve the pressure on me. Some worker injures himself from, say tripping over a box full of files, gets his leg strained, decides to take sick leave, which lowers his reputation among the higher-ups and gives his partners a chance to prove themselves, thus damning his own chances to stay in the company. I’ve seen it, and sad to say, I’ve *enjoyed* watching people lose their jobs like this.


But yesterday was different. Yesterday was so different.


When I finished my coffee yesterday morning, I saw something I’ve never seen before - an image of a malicious-looking person holding a knife. The person had an elongated face, with narrow eyes, narrow nose and thick lips curled in a snarl. I was petrified, and was at a total loss of words. What was going to happen? I looked around me, at all my fellow workers working feverishly on their own projects. I don’t recall anyone in here with such a long face that was able to make such an expression.


I got up and went to the pantry, intending to top up my coffee, in the hope of getting new coffee stains so that I could get a clearer picture of what would happen. As I refilled my mug, I idly looked out the window at the carpark, and I spotted a man wearing a black jacket walking towards the entrance of the building. Squinting, I could make out his trademark triangular face, his sharp nose and his small eyes. That was Jeremy, one of those who got laid off just a week ago. He shouldn’t be wearing a jacket under the blazing hot sun, and he shouldn’t be walking into an office where he doesn’t work at anymore. What was he up to?


It didn’t take long to make the connection. Shit was about to hit the fan. Now, the problem was what should I do?


On one hand, I could stir up the entire office, evacuate everyone and call the police. It wouldn’t take them much to believe me, considering my “fortune-telling” reputation. I would be lauded a hero. However, there was a chance that I’ll be branded a lunatic, since I only predicted small accidents, and if Jeremy only came to pick up the rest of his stuff, then the false alarm would kick me out of the boss’s good books. On the other hand….I could hide, and let Jeremy literally *kill* off all my competition. After all, my coffee stains were always right - something big was definitely gonna happen, and I didn’t want to be on the receiving end. Maybe...maybe I’ll be traumatised and claim insurance and go for free counselling.


Choices were hard, and being anxious at that point in time, I couldn’t think clearly. I went with the second choice.


I entered the toilet, and hid in one of the cubicles. Sitting down, praying, praying….it was silence outside for a good ten minutes. I began to wonder if I was just paranoid. Perhaps my mug had predicted wrongly, for the first time? I stared hard at my coffee cup. The image was still there, every detail in stark contrast to the original white colour of the cup, having not blurred one bit.


Then the screams started.


I jumped up and leaned against the cubicle door, listening intently to the commotion outside. The faint patter of rushed footsteps, the muffled shrieks of terror, stifled sounds of furniture breaking. I closed my eyes. All that - could have been prevented, or at least deescalated, if I had done something about it. Maybe I could have gotten a few close friends to hide with me, or ask them to discreetly pass down the message, to evacuate the office...millions of thoughts ran through my head, but none spoke louder than the nasal, squeaky voice: “It’s alright, you’ll surely be indispensable to the company when they’re all dead.” It’s amazing how cowardice sounded so meek, yet his words reverberated through my entire being. I exhaled, and let him take control of me. I found myself on the lavatory, opening up the ceiling access door, then squeezing myself into the tiny crawlspace together with dust-encrusted pipes and cables. After I put back the trapdoor in place, I watched as my boss Trevor run into the toilet with James and Matthew, followed closely behind by a bloodstained Jeremy wielding an equally bloodstained knife.


“Look, Jeremy, we can work this out, let’s not make any rash decisions…”


“I have five kids and a wife. They depend on me to put food on the table, to pay for the house, to finance their education...and you sacked ME!” The heat of Jeremy’s rage burnt through the false ceiling.


“Jeremy, we all have families to feed. Please, Jeremy, I have a wife and two kids too, you know they depend on me as well -”


“If you decided my family was the unlucky one, I don’t see why I can’t make your family unlucky too.” Jeremy didn’t hesitate. He stepped forth and started working his knife on the three men.


I don’t remember much. It was all over in a flash. Blood spattered all over the stalls, not dissimilar from the microwave explosion I saved James from. I recalled limbs flying about. Flashes as the knife reflected the fluorescent lights. Grunts as Jeremy landed blow after blow. Screams as the three workers shielded themselves. Gurgles as their throats opened up. My traumatic stupor wasn’t really helpful to the police when they interviewed me after they helped me down from my hiding place.


As I sat in the interview room, safe and sound in the police station, I fidgeted with the coffee mug, which I refused to let go of. The image had more or less blurred, but the ugly face remained clear as ever. The longer I looked at it, the more the snarl resembled a smile. That demonic coffee stain, sniggering at my self-imposed silence. I could hear it laughing, as I replayed the memories of me voluntarily suppressing my warnings to others. It giggled as I remembered that fateful moment I turned and made my way to the toilet. It guffawed at the image burnt into my retina - the image of James making eye contact with me through the slit in the ceiling, him reaching out above him, trying to shield himself - or was he reaching out for me? Asking me for help one last time? - and his final dying gurgle as blood spurted out from the gaping wound opened up by the knife.


But...what could I have done?"
6o1do7,2,2017-07-18,I can't be a grownup. Frustration is killing me. Am I cursed?,reddit_kermit,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6o1do7/i_cant_be_a_grownup_frustration_is_killing_me_am/,"So I don't know why I'm doing this, but I guess it must help somehow. I'll try to be concise. I'm 30 years old. I'm a guy. I'm an actor. And I don't know how to be an adult.

My parents over-protected me in a weird way. Like, I can tell I was very spoiled in my early years of life but then they tried to teach me about responsibility with money, about how we weren't exactly rich although we did OK, and stuff like that.

But they tried to protect me from the hardships of life.... and still do so, even though they've realized they've created an incompetent adult. They basically did everything for me and now that they demand of me behaving like a grown-up, it's hard.

I'm a very anxious and scared person. I was bullied during all my school years because they (my bullies) felt I was gonna become gay (Yes, I did. It still amazes me how they figured that out since I've never been effeminate. But I did always suck at sports. And I was always that well behaved boy who excelled at Literature and such). Even though I became kind of popular in my senior year, there was always that trash talk behind my back. The subtle one, the one you see on TV cocktail parties... those ones can be worse for some people cause they can fuck you up... like you don't really know who's friends with you or who hates your guts secretly because of your sexual orientation.

In a way, I always knew I wanted to be an actor. Yes, I went to college and majored in TV production and Media. I was too afraid to study Acting right after high school since it was frowned upon. Thank God I made that decision. I have a diploma that could easily allow me to blend into the normal working people. But the thing is... my passion is standing in front of a camera. Right before graduating college I got the chance to host a TV show on a local station. From there, I got more job opportunities. I met horrible people, who envied me and tried to put me down because of my suspected sexuality.

This is where things start to get really tricky. I come from a religious background.... where people tend to blame it on witchcraft and stuff like that when their lives suck. And I was always kind of superstitious. Right after encountering these horrible people in TV, I started getting bad luck. Like really bad luck. :(

I prayed. A lot. Sometimes I would get gigs, but you know it's a tough business. My parents insisted on me getting a normal job. Then I acted spoiled. I said I had talent and would persist. My parents love me very much and have supported me throughout. Then I got a good role in the main cast of a major TV series... which did not do well locally and got canceled after one season. The wait for its release itself made everything much worse for me since it aired only after 2 years of wrapping it. 2 years of major anxiety and depression.

I thought that after the release I would become a recognized actor and get steady work. Far from true. In the meantime, I developed some health issues... my bowel started acting up badly 5 years ago and my muscles hurt. Sometimes doctors think I've had an Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Others think it's only Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I've been to the ER several times and sometimes it just doesn't look good. But I'm not on medication. Next week I'm having yet a new colonoscopy. Fingers crossed it's nothing serious. :(

About my muscles, most doctors think it's ""stress"". Others say it's fibromyalgia, which is a bitch. I used to be very active and work out a lot. I even abused steroides at some point because of the whole fake Hollywood nonsense. Maybe my muscles are still resenting that poison injected them with? I dunno. All I can tell you it hurts to even walk long distances or go up the stairs.

My love life sucks. I'm not a promiscuous person. I would love to be in a monogamous relationship. But men are just so slutty. Most of them. And I hate this new tinder-fueled era of dating. And because of my ailments, I've become kind of a hypochondriac. Whenever I notice something different on my body I think I could probably die. I fear STD's like crazy. Oh, and cancer too, obviously.

Yes, I've gone to therapy. Several times over the years. But I don't think it helps. Because I've been hexed too with the curse of PROCRASTINATION. I procrastinate like crazy. I tend to waste my time on youtube and Netflix. I even procrastinate on my well being. It's crazy.

I'm amazed at the fact that I haven't lost my mind since I don't take any medication for my anxiety. I rather go the natural route but I'm not sure if homeopathy and such do help at all, although I am taking such natural remedies for my current ailments. Don't know if they really work.

Last year I got a ""normal"" job as an intern at an ad agency. I was VERY underpaid but I was promised a better post after my trial. But they were all lies. So I quit. I learned a lot about social media and digital marketing. But here's the thing.... I can't really concentrate.

I can't really concentrate since my late teens. Focusing, it's just so hard. For a person who'd like to make a steady living memorizing lines... this is kind of ironic. Sometimes I'm afraid there's something wrong with my brain. But I'm also afraid to find out.

My younger brother is a doctor and he works at a prominent hospital in the US. Lately my parents have been comparing me to him, subtly. Just last night they suggested me moving there and do ""something"". Just ""something"". 

Right now I'm employed with a major advertising company. They pay me to be creative. I can work from home most of the time. But even with this great opportunity... I just can't concentrate. I keep procrastinating. I'm anxious. I feel like my ideas suck. Like people expect so much from me and I'm gonna end up dissapointing everyone.

I wish I could go back to Europe. I was an Erasmus student (exchange student) in my early 20's and I loved it there. But I'm afraid I might get depressed and just hole up in a small appartment.

I wish I could be a normal adult. I wish I knew about taxes (my parents employees do that for me). I wish I could function normally. Have a normal schedule. Be responsible. But like I said, either I can't concentrate or my mysterious illnesses act up and everything gets messed up.

Look, I know some of you may don't get it. Some might think this is a spoiled 30 yr old who doesn't wanna grow up. But OH I DO. I just don't know how. Yes, I've thought of suicide. More in these later years. More than I wanted. But no, I don't think I could ever go through with it. I mean, I do think stuff like ""If I died, would it help? Would it solve anything""?"" But I'm way too stubborn and proud and to be honest, what's the point of all this weird suffering if I'm not getting a happy ending, am I right?

That's why I sometimes believe I've been cursed. I'm somewhat priviledged but I live in a cage. I can't run. I can't support myself entirely. I don't have health. I don't have love. I don't know how to be a grown-up. I'm tied to these weird life situations and I just can't get a break.

Think about it. It's the perfect curse. 
You can't make this stuff up.

6o1g8b,79,2017-07-18,CMV: Collegiate athletes should not be paid.,masterbrodie,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6o1g8b/cmv_collegiate_athletes_should_not_be_paid/,"I am tired of seeing this topic discussed on sports talk shows, twitter, and the news. As a college student and a major sports fan at a Big 12 school, I hear it on campus all of the time during class discussions. It always surprises me how many people believe that the athletes should be paid. I'm going to provide a few specific points that I feel are often ignored when this topic is brought up.


The education benefits:


Basically any athlete that has a chance at making it in to the next level is on full scholarship, and let's be honest, most of them still won't make it that far. At my school, we have an awesome academic facility reserved for student athletes that is open from 7am-11pm. At this facility, athletes can receive free tutoring, easily isolate themselves for studying, and take their tests verbally. They also have access to computers, printers, calculators, and other necessary tech needed for school. They do not have to fight the crowds at the library, and are chaperoned by non-athlete students that are on work study. I know for a fact that many student athletes at my school do not take their education seriously while they are here. They forget that not everyone has the same access to the facilities that they do, and many have the ""We're not here to play school, we're here to play football"" mindset. 


Here is a quote from someone that works in the facility: ""They get their own mini study hall equipped with all of their counsellors on hand every day, as well as all of their own tutors for every subject on hand every day. A lot of tutors stay until late in the evening helping them and come in early. Before I've asked [redacted] why he's still hanging around at 9:30 he has actually said ""because football players can't do anything for themselves"". They pretty much carry them through most homework that they have. They get free school supplies at will like notecards, pencils, scantrons (which we have to pay for). Private study rooms. A big one I learned is free textbooks. They rent from the athletic program so they don't even have to go buy or even find out what textbook they need. It just comes to them in a package and they turn it back in at the end of the year.""


Non-academic benefits:


At my school, football players are provided with a high protein/fiber/carb breakfast and dinner about 5 days a week, free of charge. Other athletes receive this meal throughout the week, but their schedule and frequency is typically tied to their respective seasons. For almost three years now, I have worked in the kitchen helping prep the daily meals for the athletes, so I have had first hand experience at the quality and quantity of food that they receive. I am not sure if a full scholarship also entitles them to a campus meal plan, but if so, then that means that they have the option to eat at the athletic facility and anywhere on campus for free. Athletes of all sports also receive tons of free nike clothes and shoes. Not to mention, if the football players make it to a bowl game, they receive a gift package of clothes and other items such as an Xbox, iPad, etc. At our football stadium, we have a display case of the gift packages for our school's recent bowl games.


Where do you draw the line?


One of the most popular points I've seen and heard is the fact that the NCAA, schools, and sponsors make tons of money off of these athletes on TV. Let's take football, for example. Are we tailoring the pay by money brought in each season? If so, Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State, etc. all have a clear advantage over competing teams that have smaller fanbases and play on national TV far less often. Okay, let's pay a flat rate across the board. Are we including all schools? Divisions? Or just the ones that play on major networks? If we include all schools, you're telling me that athletes at Missouri State deserve to get paid the same as Bama's athletes playing at prime time almost every weekend? If you pay by network coverage, the more prestigious programs would have a complete monopoly over recruiting. Students would sacrifice playing time for a paycheck. Why play for free at a smaller school when you can go to a bigger school and get paid? I just think that this entire point creates far more questions than solutions, and I didn't even talk about the fact that it's tough to draw the line across paying athletes from other collegiate sports as well.


An internship for the NFL:


Now this point might sound a little abstract, but I believe that athletes should view their college playing experience as something like an internship for the next level. They are tested to see how they do under high pressure situations in front of a big crowd. If they prove their ability, they get paid millions of dollars in their mid twenties, which is far more than any non-athlete would typically make at that age. If they don't make it, well, you were at a college for three to four years. What were you doing? I always hear the argument that not all athletes are on full scholarship. Well the way I see it, if you're not good enough for your school to pave the way for you to play there, you're not good enough to play at the next level. If you prove everyone wrong, great. If you didn't have a backup plan, I don't feel sorry for you.


Now, many of these points are derived from experiences at my school. I realize other schools may not have as many benefits to offer their students, but I also know that there are many schools that can offer much more.

6o1jc0,0,2017-07-18,[Hiring] Marketer at growing local startup,casamundo,mijobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/mijobs/comments/6o1jc0/hiring_marketer_at_growing_local_startup/,"Remote Marketing Intern at growing startup

I am the co-founder of a fast-paced, growing startup in the golf industry. I need to hire a sales intern to help me with it. Anyone can apply for the job–I don’t care about your resume or educational background, I only care about finding the most effective person for the job. If you are interested, read this entire post, then follow the instructions at the bottom to start the process.

NOTE: Anyone who fails to follow the directions at the bottom will NOT be considered.

Requirements for the job:
-You can live anywhere in the world
-English must be your native language
-You must have constant and reliable computer and internet access
-Must be very intelligent, hard working, organized, and industrious
-You must be able to start by Monday, July 24th, 2017.
-You must have a flexible enough schedule that you can adjust to varying time requirements. I estimate that the job will average 10 hours of work per week, with some weeks having no work, while a few others may require 20+ hours of work.
-This is not intended to be a full time job, and the work can be done around a conventional, 9-5 schedule.

What is our company and how does it work?:
We provide a digital booking service for caddies, which connects golfers, courses and caddies (like Uber for caddies). Golf courses out-source their caddy programs to us, or for courses with existing programs, we sell them on using our technology.

The primary tasks the job will entail:
-Emailing and calling golf course professionals, managers and directors to explain the service we provide and how it will benefit them. A successful call will end with you scheduling an in person meeting for me to sell our service.
-Researching, collecting and organizing information (mainly researching golf courses interested in doing business with my company). All research can be done from a computer using public, internet accessible sources.
-Other “assistant” type tasks, for example: scheduling travel, finding and vetting various freelancers (camera operators, designers, marketers, etc), or setting interview appointments.

Reasons to do the job:
-It IS a paid job. It does not pay a huge amount, and the pay will depend on several factors, mainly whether or not one person can handle the job tasks, or if I have to divide the work between multiple people. You can expect at least a few hundred, and at most a few thousand dollars.
-It is definitely something you will be able to put on your resume or CV and use to get other gigs/jobs.
-It will be pretty cool and interesting work, and if you have ambitions in entrepreneurship you will gain valuable business experience and knowledge that isn’t taught in school.  
-You will learn a lot of skills you can leverage into other areas, and make connections you can use to advance your life and career. This is a part-time job, but it could lead to a full-time assistant job with me, if that arrangement makes sense for both of us. My current assistant is moving up and co-founding a start-up, and I will need to replace him at some point this year.

Reasons NOT to do the job:
-If you think you can skate through this without actually doing much and then brag to your friends you’re working for a “cool new startup.”

HOW TO APPLY FOR THE JOB:
Because I am screening remotely and not meeting people in person for this job, only people who follow the directions will be considered for a phone interview. If you want to apply for the job, do EXACTLY the following things—nothing else:

1. Before 5pm EST on July 21st, 2017, send an email to this email address: colsen(at)caddiesnow.com

2. The subject line must read “Remote Marketing Intern”

3. In the email, put your answers to the following questions. Include both the questions and your answers in the email, and please bold the questions. For the application questions, no answer should be longer than 300 words. The shorter, the better. Your answers will be evaluated on both content and technique–what you say and how you say it. And yes, spelling and grammar matter for this job, so they matter here.
	A. What is your full name?
	B. How old are you?
	C. Where in the world do you live?
	D What is your phone number?
	E. What accomplishment are you most proud of? Why?
	F. Why do you want to do this job? I know the obvious reasons–the ones already listed in the job posting–but what are your specific, personal reasons? What goals do you hope to advance for yourself and what do you hope to get out of this job?
	G. What is your level of knowledge/experience with the game of golf, and what is your knowledge/experience with marketing and sales? If you have little or no experience with either, please explain how you will be able to execute on the tasks I assign you better than the people who have the relevant experience, and provide examples of when you’ve done so in the past. 

4.Link to your Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts. If you only use one or two of the three, just send the link to the one you use, and explain why you don’t use the others. If you don’t use Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, explain why not.

5.In addition to the above links (if any), what things online do you think best show your work ethic, intelligence, and ability? You can include blogs, tumblrs, a photo collection, an essay–basically anything that a potential employer would find valuable to see. There is one limit: Do NOT just link to a resume. Show, don’t tell.

6. Do ONLY those tasks. Nothing else should be in the email.

Applicants with the best emails will receive a phone call for a 10-15 minute interview, in which I’ll explain the specifics of job and answer any of your questions.

Good Luck!

6o1p71,1,2017-07-18,"I'm trapped, I can't be a grown-up. Am I cursed?",reddit_kermit,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6o1p71/im_trapped_i_cant_be_a_grownup_am_i_cursed/,"So I don't know why I'm doing this, but I guess it must help somehow. I'll try to be concise. I'm 30 years old. I'm a guy. I'm an actor. And I don't know how to be an adult.

My parents over-protected me in a weird way. Like, I can tell I was very spoiled in my early years of life but then they tried to teach me about responsibility with money, about how we weren't exactly rich although we did OK, and stuff like that.

But they tried to protect me from the hardships of life.... and still do so, even though they've realized they've created an incompetent adult. They basically did everything for me and now that they demand of me behaving like a grown-up, it's hard.
I'm a very anxious and scared person. 

I was bullied during all my school years because they (my bullies) felt I was gonna become gay (Yes, I did. It still amazes me how they figured that out since I've never been effeminate. But I did always suck at sports. And I was always that well behaved boy who excelled at Literature and such). Even though I became kind of popular in my senior year, there was always that trash talk behind my back. The subtle one, the one you see on TV cocktail parties... those ones can be worse for some people cause they can fuck you up... like you don't really know who's friends with you or who hates your guts secretly because of your sexual orientation.

In a way, I always knew I wanted to be an actor. Yes, I went to college and majored in TV production and Media. I was too afraid to study Acting right after high school since it was frowned upon. Thank God I made that decision. I have a diploma that could easily allow me to blend into the normal working people. But the thing is... my passion is standing in front of a camera. Right before graduating college I got the chance to host a TV show on a local station. From there, I got more job opportunities. I met horrible people, who envied me and tried to put me down because of my suspected sexuality.

This is where things start to get really tricky. I come from a religious background.... where people tend to blame it on witchcraft and stuff like that when their lives suck. And I was always kind of superstitious. Right after encountering these horrible people in TV, I started getting bad luck. Like really bad luck. :(

I prayed. A lot. Sometimes I would get gigs, but you know it's a tough business. My parents insisted on me getting a normal job. Then I acted spoiled. I said I had talent and would persist. My parents love me very much and have supported me throughout. Then I got a good role in the main cast of a major TV series... which did not do well locally and got canceled after one season. The wait for its release itself made everything much worse for me since it aired only after 2 years of wrapping it. 2 years of major anxiety and depression.

I thought that after the release I would become a recognized actor and get steady work. Far from true. In the meantime, I developed some health issues... my bowel started acting up badly 5 years ago and my muscles hurt. Sometimes doctors think I've had an Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Others think it's only Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I've been to the ER several times and sometimes it just doesn't look good. But I'm not on medication. Next week I'm having yet a new colonoscopy. Fingers crossed it's nothing serious. :(

About my muscles, most doctors think it's ""stress"". Others say it's fibromyalgia, which is a bitch. I used to be very active and work out a lot. I even abused steroides at some point because of the whole fake Hollywood nonsense. Maybe my muscles are still resenting that poison injected them with? I dunno. All I can tell you it hurts to even walk long distances or go up the stairs.
My love life sucks. I'm not a promiscuous person. I would love to be in a monogamous relationship. But men are just so slutty. Most of them. And I hate this new tinder-fueled era of dating. And because of my ailments, I've become kind of a hypochondriac. Whenever I notice something different on my body I think I could probably die. I fear STD's like crazy. Oh, and cancer too, obviously.

Yes, I've gone to therapy. Several times over the years. But I don't think it helps. Because I've been hexed too with the curse of PROCRASTINATION. I procrastinate like crazy. I tend to waste my time on youtube and Netflix. I even procrastinate on my well being. It's crazy.

I'm amazed at the fact that I haven't lost my mind since I don't take any medication for my anxiety. I rather go the natural route but I'm not sure if homeopathy and such do help at all, although I am taking such natural remedies for my current ailments. Don't know if they really work.

Last year I got a ""normal"" job as an intern at an ad agency. I was VERY underpaid but I was promised a better post after my trial. But they were all lies. So I quit. I learned a lot about social media and digital marketing. But here's the thing.... I can't really concentrate. I can't really concentrate since my late teens. Focusing, it's just so hard. For a person who'd like to make a steady living memorizing lines... this is kind of ironic. Sometimes I'm afraid there's something wrong with my brain. But I'm also afraid to find out.

My younger brother is a doctor and he works at a prominent hospital in the US. Lately my parents have been comparing me to him, subtly. Just last night they suggested me moving there and do ""something"". Just ""something"".

Right now I'm employed with a major advertising company. They pay me to be creative. I can work from home most of the time. But even with this great opportunity... I just can't concentrate. I keep procrastinating. I'm anxious. I feel like my ideas suck. Like people expect so much from me and I'm gonna end up dissapointing everyone.

I wish I could go back to Europe. I was an Erasmus student (exchange student) in my early 20's and I loved it there. But I'm afraid I might get depressed and just hole up in a small appartment.

I wish I could be a normal adult. I wish I knew about taxes (my parents employees do that for me). I wish I could function normally. Have a normal schedule. Be responsible. But like I said, either I can't concentrate or my mysterious illnesses act up and everything gets messed up.

Look, I know some of you may don't get it. Some might think this is a spoiled 30 yr old who doesn't wanna grow up. But OH I DO. I just don't know how. Yes, I've thought of suicide. More in these later years. More than I wanted. But no, I don't think I could ever go through with it. I mean, I do think stuff like ""If I died, would it help? Would it solve anything""?"" But I'm way too stubborn and proud and to be honest, what's the point of all this weird suffering if I'm not getting a happy ending, am I right?

That's why I sometimes believe I've been cursed. I'm somewhat priviledged but I live in a cage. I can't run. I can't support myself entirely. I don't have health. I don't have love. I don't know how to be a grown-up. I'm tied to these weird life situations and I just can't get a break.

Think about it. It's the perfect curse. You can't make this stuff up."

6o22yb,1,2017-07-18,Buying my first car $6k-$10k,kuyamilo,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/6o22yb/buying_my_first_car_6k10k/,"I live in Las Vegas and I currently drive my brother's '94 Acura Legend. It has 90k miles and it's in pretty good condition. Personally, I don't enjoy driving the car. The premium gas, low mpg, and 70 mile daily commute makes it very unattractive to me, but it's the only car I can use. Also, I want to sell this car before it hits 100k miles.

With my summer internship, I've saved $6000 so far. I want something sporty and gives more than 25 mpg. I was looking at this 2015 35k mile Mitsubishi Lancer for $11k, and was thinking that I could probably find something cheaper that'll take me to the end of my university life (graduating December 2018), but I'm stubborn and have always wanted a Lancer or an RX8. I'm also a mechanical engineering student and I want to learn the basics of car repair.   

Personally, I don't like Corollas. They're too weak for me to enjoy, even though the MPG and maintenance is amazing. I've driven 90s gas guzzlers my entire life (95 quest, 98 explorer, 95 Benz C280, and 94 Acura Legend). I really want a car from this century, with a remote lock, and has decent MPG."
6o23ik,197,2017-07-18,"My [22F] boss [50M] and coworkers [35-45M/F] treat me like garbage because I'm ""just a secretary.""",secretarystateofmind,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o23ik/my_22f_boss_50m_and_coworkers_3545mf_treat_me/,"Hi, good people of Reddit. I apologize for the long post. (crossposted from r/jobs, a few tweaks to identify relationship issues.)

My final semester senior year, I interned with a very large news company in a high-profile subdivision. The internship was pretty terrible, but being a reporter at that agency was my ""dream job,"" so I sucked it up and performed my heart out, hoping to get the elusive internship-turned-job-offer that everyone dreams of.

It worked. After the internship, I was offered an Assistant position to one of our C-suite executives, Bill. I wasn't thrilled at the prospect of doing admin work after working very hard for my journalism degree, but reasoned that being so close to a senior-level executive would undoubtedly set me on a path to success in the organization. I accepted the job.

Now, a year and a half later, I'm starting to think I made a very serious mistake. I have not been able to impress anyone with the writing, reporting, and PR skills I spent 4 years and 4 prestigious internships honing; honestly, I have not been able to impress anyone at all. Instead, I am constantly treated like a piece of furniture, if not outright denigrated by my older colleagues and the C-suite executive, Bill. 

Nearly every other admin assistant in the organization is a woman, usually in late fifties to mid sixties, who are very content with the work they do, and don't mind managing office workflow and dealing with guests. All of them are treated with a pretty clear level of neglect; it is clear to the (mostly male) agency that ""secretary"" roles are ""not important"" (despite the look of sheer terror that crosses their faces when one of us announces we are going on leave.)

I have a vast amount of respect for admin work after doing it for over a year. It's not just sitting at a desk, setting Outlook calendar meetings and politely greeting visitors - it is a grueling workload of managing personnel, logistics, and workflow; juggling priorities on tight and often-fluctuating deadlines; understanding the moods and preferences of high-level executives, their counterparts; and being an overall badass. It just seems like nobody else in the organization has respect for these roles, until one of us wants to take vacation, or (God forbid) eat lunch anywhere but our desks.

My coworkers treat me with a shocking level of disrespect and disregard. They will have loud conversations at my desk as if I'm not sitting there (sometimes including Wookie or sex noises), until I politely point out that this is my work area, and I am trying to make calls for Bill.

They use my desk as a shared area to dump their belongings, interrupt me when speaking (every time), claim my ideas in meetings, and have on numerous occasions referred to me as ""just a secretary"" when I speak up and contribute.

I want a more substantive role in my field. I have worked hard over the past year to make it clear that I want growth, while reinforcing how grateful I am for the work I have. But now I worry that I have been pidgeonholed as a ""secretary"" who isn't set for substantive success in the organization.

The amount of criticism I get for things wildly outside of my control boggles my mind. Today, I was physically shouted at by Bill (the C-suite exec) at 9:05am for ""forgetting"" to book his travel, when the orders for the travel came in at 9:00am this morning. Last month, I spent three weeks planning a last-minute and large-scale event that went off without a hitch, and watched as Bill praised another employee instead, who received every ounce of credit for it (despite the fact that I, and I alone, worked tirelessly to accomplish it, including personally buying the resources for it, and working 12 hours of unpaid overtime to see it through). 

In one instance, an editor shouted at me for asking him to sign a document that needed his signature, calling me ""incompetent"" and screaming that I would never make it as a reporter in the organization.

I am constantly juggling logistics for large-scale events the office is in charge of, Bill's entire calendar, several administrative duties to a few other executives, and whatever substantive side projects I can take on, in hopes of proving myself (these are usually disregarded entirely, or other writers and editors take credit for them.)

All in all, I am either treated like a piece of furniture, or actively disparaged. Most of the admin assistants here are largely ignored, but I feel that I am particularly denigrated. I'm not sure if that's because I'm young (22), in an admin role, a woman, or some combination of the three, but it is incredibly demoralizing. I am an intelligent, successful young woman. I have my own business on the side that I manage that makes me almost as much money as my job. I would be an excellent reporter, and feel that I have proven so time and time again, not only with the side projects I take on and articles I have written, but also with a fairly prestigious unpaid publication I write with on the side.

I have had several conversations with my immediate manager, as well as Bill, on my goals for moving through the organization. From the immediate manager, who has since left, I frequently heard ""we will move you to a reporter role as soon as we find new secretaries,"" but it never happened (my company is trying to downsize, so new hires are exceedingly infrequent). Bill could not give a damn what happens to me, so long as someone is there to answer his phone and color-code his calendar. I know it is time to take the next step, but I'm not sure to where. And in the meantime, I don't know how to deal with horrible bosses and coworkers who treat me like garbage.

Having this company on my resume is great. Having this job is not. I've sent out applications, but organizations seem to only want me to fulfill more admin roles.

I know that many here may say ""You've only been there 18 months, success doesn't happen overnight, everybody needs to pay their dues."" I'm aware of that, I truly am. But this isn't a matter of ""ugh I hate getting coffee for the boss, but love what I'm learning on the job!"" It's a matter of feeling miserable in my workplace everyday. I am tired of being disrespected. I'm tired of being treated like a nuisance, until someone needs something from me. I'm tired of being interrupted every time I speak and shouted at every time someone is stressed. Reddit, what should I do?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I feel trapped in an admin role that does not teach me new skills, actively harms my mental wellbeing, and has a boss that treats me like crap and shouts at me. My ultimate goal would be to get a substantive role in the organization - but in the meantime, how can I earn the respect of him and my colleagues?"
6o29jy,1,2017-07-18,I[22F] think my BF[22M] of four years isn’t taking our future together seriously.,throwawayphdaccount,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o29jy/i22f_think_my_bf22m_of_four_years_isnt_taking_our/,"Throwaway, since my main account is know by irl people.


I’ll start off by saying other than this and some problems in our sex life, we are fine and I love him so much.


Now, I am a very forward thinker in regards to my future. I’ll be finishing a bachelors this year and I am planning on entering a PhD program. I know what field I want to go into and I even have a backup career set up. I know that in the next year I will 99% be at least moving out of my hometown to get my PhD. I already have an idea of my income, what kind of housing I am getting, what I am going to do with my dogs, etc. The reason I am laying this all out is because I have a plan for the next ten years of my life. 


I have already let my boyfriend know when I start my PhD, that he is welcome to move with me. I also let him know that when I move on to the next stage of my life in terms of my education, I want him as a life partner with me. This includes being a responsible adult.


My bf, well as far as I understand it, his only real plan for the future is to finish out his degree and just move with me. I know that not everyone has to know exactly what they are going to do in the future and I do not think that BF is lacking because he doesn’t really know what he wants to do, but as someone who I want to be a life partner with me, his lack of motivation in getting a job is making me seriously consider if I want him in my life when I move to get my PhD.


About a two years ago, he got his first job doing retail. He was only at it for maybe less than a year and he quit. He told me he quit because he found the hours hard and the job stressing. At the time I completely understood and supported his decision. I assumed he would get another job. He hasn’t.


For the first year after, I didn’t really think about him not having a job as I was busy going to school full time and having a part time job. During this time he:
*Never applied for another job
*Started streaming on twitch then stopped that career after about two or three months
*Despite not having a job and only going to school, is pulling low B and Cs in his degree
*Has not had an internship
I bring this up because in his field, when you graduate with a bachelors without any experience, its very hard to get a job in that field. 


In the last six months or so, I have finally realized that he has made no progress to get a job. Basically, my position is that if he wants to move with me to get my PhD, how is he going to get a job in his field with no experience and only a retail job on his resume. About four months ago, I talked to him about this. He said he understands my position and he will look to getting a job. Three months pass and he hasn’t done anything but start streaming again. No job. The semester that he was supposedly looking for a job he started streaming and even attended a competitive gaming competition. One day I asked again, and after getting it out of him with him deflecting my questions and giving vague answers, he finally admitted he had done nothing into to getting a job or experience to his field.


I will be honest, I got really heated. I gave him an ultimatum. If by the time I move to get my PhD and he has not had a job, he will not be allowed to come with me and I will end the relationship. This seems harsh, but I don’t want to continue my life with someone who is not responsible as an adult and him not getting job is a sign to me he is not serious about our future together. 


Since then, he has only applied to two internships and has not used the resources available at his college to help him. So basically, even after two conversations, an ultimatum, and a year and a half, he has made tiny progress to get a job.


I feel my heart breaking because I love him so much and I want him to move with to the next stage of my life, but none of his actions in the last year or so show me that he doesn’t take our future seriously. I do not know what to do to get him to get a job. I am of the opinion you can’t force someone to do what they don’t want to do and I also think I can only help him so much. In the first conversation where I expressed my concern, I listed out all the resources he could go to, where they were, who he can talk to. I helped as much as I could but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make them drink.


I want help into what I can do to take our relationship seriously. I know that in the next year that time will come of whether or not he can come with me and it makes me incredibly sad to think he might not be apart of my life. Sorry if this is messy, I think this also became a word vomit of my frustration, so ask away if anything is confusing or unclear :)


TL;DR: BF has not had job in a year and a half, he needs experience to get a job in his field, and I feel that his lack of action is a sign he doesn’t take our future as a couple seriously, and I am considering ending the relationship if he doesn’t have a job by the time I move on to pursue my PhD. What to do to make him do something about getting a job.

Quick edit: I mention the gaming not because I don't approve (I myself play a lot of video games and I play with him online a lot), it's just within the context of not getting a job that he streams and plays video games competitively."
6o2urn,16,2017-07-18,[Parasite Post] Mad Max meets Dilbert: The New Nomads,DoomVoyager,accountt1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/accountt1234/comments/6o2urn/parasite_post_mad_max_meets_dilbert_the_new_nomads/,"Most peoples' attempts to predict the future are their *reasoning* based on their narrow theories of how the world operates, plus wishful thinking based on their personal ideals.

It seems much more realistic to look at the last decade and extrapolate, as history appears to operate by principle of inertia: unless its course is disturbed, it will continue its current path.

Therefore, I expect the following:

* People will start to eat a lot more rice &amp; beans. A thousand new lines of propaganda for vegetarianism will emerge as people try to convince themselves they chose to eat food only slightly more expensive than ramen rather than being simply forced to due to mass poverty.

* The world will continue to change via technology, both physical and social (i.e. memes). There will be those who adapt and those who do not. It seems unlikely anyone is in real control over the progression.

* Normal brick and mortar stores will effectively disappear for everything but in-person services. Everything else will be done over online shopping networks and likely delivered via drone. 

* There will be little to no employment left that your grandfather would recognize as a legitimate or ""normal"" job. All of your grandfather's jobs will be automated. You will never have a chance to get in on that gravy train in the form of gainful employment, while those rich enough to own the automated systems will trade entire industries like poker chips.

* We will all convert to an effectively nomadic life. Millennials will wander the country seeking their next internship. 

* As ""tiny houses"" and vandwelling become mainstream, I expect at some point that someone will begin mass producing fuel efficient livable vans with wifi connectivity engineered for this exact purpose, like a studio apartment they can drive from town to town. I wouldn't honestly be that surprised if Apple did it.

* I expect little ""cities"" of these to crop up, rendezvous points where people can park for extended periods, get their cars serviced and buy other services. I expect it to look like a mix between a truck stop and a tent city.

* As people increasingly live nomadic lifestyles, I expect Amazon to figure out more cost effective drone delivery tactics, as it may find it increasingly profitable to be able to deliver to people who do not have ""old fashioned"" addresses. As companies begin to cater to this lifestyle, they will thus facilitate it and it will get more common.

* Those who do not live in modern day hippie vans will probably ride Uber and rent from AirBNB type services; i.e. decentralized and social media integrated living services. This I expect to almost entirely supplant traditional renting and long term leases for everyone who is neither rich enough to just sit tight in one spot, or poor/brown enough to have the state simply subsidize and book their housing.

* Unlike the jobs of the past, these new internships and other ""opportunities"" will not only pay unreliably at best, but they will not provide any actual role in society at all. The ever changing surroundings, lack of long term valuation by their superiors and lack of a meaningful social role will increase alienation dramatically. With it, increase in social alienation and mental disorder is highly likely and will exacerbate all other problems. Today we are a society of strangers, but at least we still have neighbors and a geographic region we call home; what if even that were taken from us?

* As everyone becomes nomadic, I expect calisthenics to become the rage in fitness. Everyone will act like it's because they evolved past the need of barbells to pretend it isn't poverty and an unstable life that forced it on them.

* I expect that children's toys will all but disappear as the little tykes play with their tablets instead of with actual physical objects. However, I predict that fecundity will continue to decline for everyone but POCs in government housing, who are effectively paid to breed, and perhaps the ruling elite. I wouldn't be surprised if the ruling elite reinstated polygamy, while selling sexbots and psych meds to poor whites.

* Everyone will be effectively employed by their political peer group and nepotism will reign supreme. As the methods of the right wing have digitized and come to speed with those seen on the left, we are now seeing more crowdfunding and social media alternatives for the right wing, such as ""Hatreon."" Just as today many fields of employment are effectively dominated by leftist hives and even getting an interview becomes impossible unless you know the right people and cheerlead their party line, I expect similar parallel structures to develop on the right. Only those with pepe tattoos need apply. It makes perfect sense for two separate nations to coexist geographically but function almost entirely independently due to what they post on social media. America will effectively divide into Sunni and Shia.

* I foresee this trend to go international, and in the process further assist the breakdown of borders. Just as BlackLivesMatter has protests in Europe, and just as Antifa now has a presence in the united states, I foresee that the decentralized ""networked tribes"" mass political divide to spread to Europe also as altright flashmobs, alternative social media, and crowdfunded support for altright members increases. Whether or not the ""nomadic interns"" model breaks over to Europe I cannot say.

* Those in the ownership class will become ever richer and more removed. Automation will continue, take a significant fraction of jobs, and drive up the wealth and power of the ownership class significantly. Regardless of what street level conditions are for millennials in their rolling studio apartments, the stock market will skyrocket. Anyone with a significant amount invested (almost nobody currently starting their career) will rapidly climb in wealth while everyone else struggles to find even unpaid employment.

* Contrary to the predictions of most, people will actually seek even further education in an effort to finally earn their way into a stable social role. It might work for some, but we all know the ownership class is not accepting new applications. I expect in time post-doctoral fellowships will become the new high school diploma. As the government loves education (""See? They're not NEETs! Unemployment is lower than ever!""), I expect to see increasing subsidy for education to kick this can down the road. While yesteryear's working class would routinely ""work until they die,"" I expect the near future's ""intern class"" will begin to literally go to school until they die. In a sense this becomes analogous to mining towns, where the boss gives employees their wage and then also owns the only store in town, which happens by coincidence to charge prices for their goods that end up consuming 100.0% of those same wages. I expect out of mass desperation, unpaid internships will become the norm, and student debt figures will hold little actual meaning as education itself becomes more obviously a system of indentured servitude you were never designed to be able to buy your way out of. Characteristic of this system is that rather than being paid a reward for your labors in excess of your needs that you can then use to acquire capital, you will simply have your basic material needs provided and a portion of your debt forgiven in exchange for labor, with no actual gain imparted. I imagine that in the future, nearly all educational tracks will have a very large component of ""work study,"" maybe 50%, so that those in the ownership class can properly extract value from their unpaid laborers. It is likely that this is how the remaining non-automated jobs will operate, regardless of their urgency or complexity.

In closing, I basically expect the future to look like Mad Max combined with Dilbert."
6o2wxn,0,2017-07-18,"Me [27 M] with my [28 F] girlfriend, and I just inadvertently shut her out of our first trip together. Feeling guilty as hell. Lost sleep over it and IDK what to do.",cracksilog,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o2wxn/me_27_m_with_my_28_f_girlfriend_and_i_just/,"Don't know how much advice y'all can give me, since what's done is done, but maybe I can do some damage control.

So I won a scholarship for a business conference to Philly about two months ago. First person I tell is my gf because well that's who you tell. She gets super excited and starts making plans, and totally didn't ask me first if it was OK for her to go. I was totally not cool with her making plans because this is my business trip and she essentially invited herself to my trip. Yeah, it would be awesome for her to go, but it's common courtesy to ask someone first if it's OK to tag along with someone to their trip (that's just my view. Maybe y'all think it's different in relationships?). Basically, I wanted her there but I needed her to ask permission first. But I bit my tongue and told myself it would be a great trip for her to come along, even though I would be working most of the day.

That was in May. I leave for the trip next week. She took off work and everything to prep for it. To say she was excited to come along is an understatement. This was to be our first solo trip together (we've traveled long distances before but with my friends) and she was super excited about it. Thing is, last week, I finally told her through text while I'm at work that I wasn't OK with her just inviting herself. I told her it was OK if she went, but she just needed to ask permission and be considerate. She then apologizes and asks point blank whether or not I would like for her to go. Stupid me in my slight annoyance/indecisiveness said, ""I kinda do want you to go, but I kinda don't."" She goes, ""It's OK then, I won't go."" Long story short, she is beyond crushed that she can't go. Her exact words were ""when you told me you weren't sure if you wanted me there, my heart was crushed."" I tell her that I would be working the entire day and she goes ""well it doesn't matter. As long as I get to spend some time with you it's OK."" I reply, ""Well, I'll get back to you then."" 

To say I'm an indecisive person is an understatement lol.

She takes that as ""you don't want me to go otherwise you wouldn't have hesitated,"" and withdraws her PTO from work. When I finally come to my senses and realize how much of a dick I was, and invite her point blank to come with me, she tells me it's too late for her to take back her PTO from work. Basically we go back and forth about how crushed we both are that we're going to be away from each other for almost a week.

This was to be our first solo trip together and basically I feel like I ruined it for her. Now she's going to be at work at the other side of the country while I'm going to be lonely in my hotel room wishing she was here. I let my anger and indecisiveness get the best of me and now I realize that I've made a terrible mistake.

The loneliness in my hotel room is going to be crushing. We had plans to see the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall together and now that can't happen. I can already feel the loneliness and regret and I don't even leave till next week. I've lost a couple of nights of sleep over the guilt and calling myself stupid for doing that, replaying it over and over in my head.

So, is there anything I can do damage control-wise? She's absolutely crushed she can't go but she says she's OK and will help me pack, drive me to the airport, all that jazz. Was it right for me to be mad and hold it in for that long and then spring it all on her the way I did? Is it right to hold my girlfriend to the same ""ask permission and don't invite yourself"" standard that I hold everyone else in my life to? And how do I deal with the guilt of not having her here and doing all that damage to her?

EDIT: Thanks y'all. I knew I fucked up, but she's been super serene about this. Didn't realize how bad I messed this one up until y'all chimed in. We always have a ""speak your mind"" approach to things, and I was always taught to bite my tongue. It's a quality she's developed in me to always have the courage to speak your mind. Now that I have it, I guess I've learned that there are moments where you should bite your tongue and say nothing. Had I bit my tongue, we'd be on flights to Philly next week. Also, as you can see, I have NO idea how to communicate in a relationship. Pointers welcome.

SECOND EDIT: So basically it's been pretty normal between us since last week. Like super normal. Should I be worried or is this an OK thing haha

THIRD EDIT: I legitimately didn't think about how much wrong I've done. And not in the sense of ""oh I should've thought that through more."" I legitimately didn't know that this was a thing that you hold your SO to a different standard than others. If that makes me look dumb or immature or whatever then so be it. I'm really trying my hardest since this is my first-ever relationship. But I get it. I've apologized to her sincerely and she said we'd work on our communication skills and the things that are OK and not OK in a relationship. And yes, I do seek therapy (I have social anxiety), and my therapist and I are trying to work through my issues too. Thanks for your comments y'all. I appreciate all of them. I really do. I guess I need to seek more advice from people and not rely on myself too much.

FOURTH EDIT: So turns out that she really doesn't have a problem with it. I'm not just saying that. She really doesn't. Yes, she was hurt, but she's gotten over it and forgiven me. So the thing is she was super petty in her earlier 20s (still kind of is—she's the type to return food with her bare hands at a buffet if the cooks don't treat her respectfully (she almost did this at a buffet when we were in Vegas) and the kind of person who will take the time to write a note and attach it to your windshield if you parked on the lines), so she's used to arguments and blowing up on people. We had a discussion about this last night, and she told me to always, always say what's on my mind if you feel if it's important, regardless of how much after the fact it is, and we would work out the details and talk it through after. She's used to putting her foot in her mouth more times than not, and is used to both winning and losing battles. Which is why she's becoming more selective in them and becoming strategic when starting arguments with anyone. Basically, she told me that yes, asking permission was important for you since you like everything planned (I have social anxiety, so I NEED every little detail of anything planned out in advance), and how her inviting herself intruded on my anxiety. In turn, I promised to be more flexible in my thinking and she'd help me pick my battles better (since I have NO CONCEPT AT ALL of how to pick battles—like I said I've always bit my tongue on everything, so when I'm exposed to someone who doesn't at all, I've to overcompensate. Like this whole thing lol).

I thought about if the tables were turned. Like if she did this to me, would I react like some of you said she would react? And the answer is honestly no. I'm not just saying that to cover my tracks. I really wouldn't have reacted because I know 1) This isn't my trip, it was hers. So she can decide anything she wants. If she wanted to bring a chameleon instead of me and told me the week before, I would understand. These are her plans on her trip, I was just privileged enough to be invited, 2) I would never, ever, ever invite myself or assume I was invited to anything of hers because we're individuals, not one person. She has the right to invite or not invite me to anything she sees fit, which means I wouldn't even dream of inviting myself, and 3) Anything she says about the trip goes. Because it's not my trip. If my feelings got hurt I'd have to get over it because it's her decision, not mine. I'm not automatically invited to anything just because I'm her boyfriend. I can get dropped, from any plan, at any time. I applied this same knowledge to my trip, which she logically saw, but I realize that that isn't the case with everyone else (as demonstrated below lol). Bottom line: I treat everyone as equally as I can: my editor, my boss, my intern, my professors, my mom, my dad, my girlfriend, my cousins, my uncles—no one gets special treatment. Is this logic flawed? Apparently yes—things aren't as black and white in the real world, while in my head they're nothing but black and white. Now, I can agree that there is a possibility that my social anxiety may have colored my expectations of others a bit. That's not for me to decide, since I'm not a therapist. For now, I'll work on being more flexible on everything.

As for me, I still catch myself beating myself up over this. Just last night when we went out for drinks I was pounding my head with my fist, mulling over my stupidity (overthinking is a thing for me) when she goes—""don't worry about it (for like the bajillionth time), don't be so hard on yourself, and stop beating yourself up (literally). It was important to you, so you said it. You're not going to win every battle. And if you can say you said your piece during whatever disagreement we have, win or lose, and the underlying point was important to YOU, win or lose, that was a battle worth fighting. If you're wrong, just admit it, and if I'm wrong, then I'll admit it. We both learn something either way.""

Suffice to say, relationships are hard AF and take a ton of work lol. This is my first one (she's my first everything basically lol), and we're still learning about each other. I have NO basis on what to draw relationship advice from, since this is my first one, so I'm really trying to learn as best I can. Yeah it sucks that the reason she's working next week is because of me, but we both agreed—in fact we both said it—you live and you learn.

As for all of you—thank you so much for all of your pointers. My next step after learning to speak my mind is choosing my battles, and like all of you said, this was not the battle to choose. I'll be more judicious next time, and choose my battles with more thought. 

So the next time you'll probably see a thread from me is ""How to forgive myself for fucking our relationship after she says I forgive you and both of us are fine but you can't get over the guilt"" lol.

Thanks again, y'all! I hope the universe treats all of you well for the advice I needed and sends you a drink of your choice.

6o3rkg,1,2017-07-18,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/6o3rkg/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
6o3wda,14,2017-07-18,I'm a dude who thinks his life story is interesting and wants to talk about it. AMA!,FreakyCheeseMan,casualiama,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/6o3wda/im_a_dude_who_thinks_his_life_story_is/,"My parents divorced when I was about two years old; I was raised by my mother out in the hills of East Kentucky. She had a host of mental and physical problems, and I kinda just thought sleeping for ~20 hours out of the day was normal grown-up behavior.

Both sides of my family had some land and money floating around, but my mother had run out of the ""Money"" part, and despite owning both land in the country and a house in the city, we were generally surviving hand to mouth as far as groceries and utilities went (one time we went as far as dumpster diving for food.) My mom's health was steadily declining, and it got really clear to me that she was going to die (not necessarily right away, but soon enough that it wasn't an abstract ""everyone dies"" sort of thing.)

In school I was a frustrating asshole of a student. I was poorly adjusted socially and super arrogant, and as I got older I got worse and worse about bothering to do homework or even show up to class; by my senior year of high school I was taking math classes at the local college because I'd exhausted my high school's curiculum, while at the same time almost being held back a year because I refused to show up to English more than once a week.

Due to bad grades and an even worse attitude, I ended up not being accepted to any college I applied to, but I managed to find a backdoor that let me into the University of Oregon, near where my dad lived. I took it somewhat seriously for the first year, but after that I got lazier and more arrogant until I finally managed to flunk out entirely. I swung through a brief relationship with a very impressive but also very, very Christian girl I'd met on a bus, and then moved back to Kentucky.

I spent the next year or so in Kentucky working a couple of crap jobs (flipping burgers and then iPhone tech support), until eventually I got fired and kind of just stopped trying. I was living in my mother's house in Lexington (she was out in the country), and gradually accumulating as many roomates as it took for combined paychecks and disability to pay the utlities; by the end we had multiple schizophrenic people sleeping on the living room floor.

When my mom needed to come into town to be near the hospital I moved out to her place in the country; for a few months, there would be weeks at a time in which I literally did not see another human being. Eventually she moved back but I stayed there, living off her disability once more and sleeping on the floor of her laundry room.

Finally I decided to get my life together, which meant getting money, which meant getting a computer science degree. My dad was happy to take me back in in Oregon, and I convinced the university to overturn my expulsion and give me another chance.

It turned out I was still a shitty student, still procrastinated, and still had to fight myself to do any work at all. Something had changed, though, and after putting off assignments till 3AM the night before they were do, I'd actually stay up till 6AM and get them done. My first term back I got a 4.2 GPA (A+'s being considered a 4.3).

My dad had an annoying pain in his leg that year, and when he got on Obamacare he finally sent to get it checked out. We got the final diagnosis over the summer; he had a bone growth on his leg, a tumor from already-metastasized liver cancer. The doctor gave him 6-9 months to live.

I assumed I'd have to drop out of college to take care of him, but I put it off as long as I could; one of my friends and former roommates from Kentucky moved out to Oregon and helped me take care of him, alternating our class schedules so someone would always be at home. In the end, his condition degraded so quickly I barely missed a day of class; one day he was almost fine, the next day he spent screaming in pain in a hospital bed, and the morning after that he died. The day after that I returned to class, and even took a midterm.

My mom already had tickets to come visit my dad, but she didn't land until after he died. She'd forgotten to bring some medication with her, as a result amonia built up in her system leading to something called hepatic encapalopathy, which basically means temporary dementia as a result of liver failure. At one point we had a conversation where she forgot who I was. I should have kept her here with me in Oregon, but I didn't feel I could care for another dying parent so quickly, and we had a close friend in Kentucky acting as her caretaker, so she went back at the end of her visit.

I was an only child, and inherited my dad's property, wealth and investments. Before ever earning a single paycheck from my computer science education, I was effectively rich. I spent a couple of weeks of that summer in Istanbul to take a break from my life.

When I got back I started an internship that I had absolutely lucked into. I still don't know how I got that job; I'd picked the company at random off a list as a practice application, I'd half-assed the introductory letter and the company had forgotten they even had a job posting in my area, but somehow they hired me anyway, gave me my own office and $32/hour for as many hours I felt like working, with no rules whatsoever as to when I should work them.

The week I started work there, my mother moved out from Kentucky; her health was getting worse and the caretaker she'd had was leaving, so she needed to be with me. The night she landed we went straight from the airport to the ER, where the doctor refused to do anything for her because he believed she was only seeking pain medication. The next night she was back in a different ER with a different doctor who also believed she was a drug addict, but actually admitted her to look into it; the next day she had surgery on her spine, and she spent the next two months moving between home, hospitals and assited care facilities.

Eventually they diagnosed the growth on her spine that had had her in the ER in the first place: It was exactly the same diagnosis my dad had got, a bone growth from metastasized liver cancer. They gave her six months to live, and ten days later she died in my guest bedroom under hospice care. (I'd pretty much made the decision to kill her myself by then, as she'd always been clear that she'd want that if she reached that state... but I was waiting on more powerful morphine, which arrived later than expected so she passed away on her own before it did.)

I still had one term of school left to complete, which I did, finishing a double major in math &amp; computer science. I briefly visited Kentucky for my mother's memorial and to arrange the sale of the house in Lexington. I'd wanted to keep it as a rental property, but my former roommates had probably done a hundred thousand dollars worth of damage to it, and ultimately I decided to sell it to a real estate investor rather than try to take on the project myself.

I spent a few more months in my internship before that ended as well, and I decided, why not, I'd go spend three months in Peru. While there I did a five-day hike to Machu Picchu, applied to graduate schools, and finally spent a week in the Amazon rainforest doing powerful hallucinogens. (I really like psychadelics.)

I got back in early January, and have basically been on vacation since, as I didn't want to start a job I'd only hold for a few months before moving for grad school. (I got accepted to a master's program, and leave in the next couple weeks.)

The biggest worry I still have in life is that I'm single, and have been since that brief relationship when I first flunked out of college. I've gotten consistently nicer and better with people over the course of my life, but I still don't really understand how dating and attraction work, so... that's a thing.

I'm also trying to decide whether moving away for grad school means re-starting my life, or if it's a temporary detour before I come back here. I haven't loved Eugene, but I also don't love the idea of enterring into my 30s with only new friends. In particular, one of my best friends is recently pregnant (in a super unexpected and scary way), and a big part of me wants to be around to watch her raise the kid. 

I think that covers most of the big stuff... AMA?"
6o3x3v,3,2017-07-18,I'm tired.,DeviantGrayson,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6o3x3v/im_tired/,"I'm tired. 

I'm tired of working so hard in college, I'm tired of comparing myself to other people, I'm tired of not getting outside more often, I'm tired of always planning for the future, I'm tired of having a negative self image, I'm tired of being overweight, I'm tired of always surfing the internet, I'm tired of being too hard on myself, I'm tired of not doing anything productive.

I work a part time job and go to school full time, and this next semester I will be working a part time job, taking 12 college credit hours, and doing a compulsory unpaid internship for 24 hours. So I'll have around 57-61 hours a week of butt-in-seat time between work and school and my internship. This is not even considering the homework I have to do.

I'm a bit frightened of that, but I'm also a bit excited too because it will eat into my time that I will be wasting by doing useless stuff like mindlessly browsing Reddit. I want off Reddit. It's a toxic place. I also want to do things that other people do. I want to be normal.

I'm going to try to work on things though. I need to. I want to work on living in the present and not worry about the future as much. I really need to stop surfing the internet as much as I do. It wastes a lot of time. But I need something to fill that time with. 

I'm also scared that I will have no personality. I seem to just waste time when I have free time, I don't really enjoy many things. I do enjoy the company of other people, but that happens around once a week (where we get together). I feel like I am the type of person where if I have a lot of free time, I waste it. So I fill that time with work or school. Either way I act is pretty boring and adds no unique attributes to my character.

I recently discovered /r/paramotor and I would absolutely love to do that. But it costs around $10k to get into. I will be working for a shit wage due to my degree choice (I am going into social work). 

Yeah. Just feeling pretty down and wanted this off my chest.

sidenote: I was recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder as well, and I'm still grappling with the consequences of that diagnosis and what impact it has had throughout my life."

That'll bring us to 2019, during that time they can pretend to give interns busy work to make it look like repeal / replace is coming along - hey, they can **even add all the things Trump wants** they can even say **we now have all the votes**... **BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GO FOR A VOTE UNTIL 2019 AUG**

.... like clockwork, it comes around, clock runs out - they can schedule it for OCT 2019: of course, when OCT rolls around - all those things they added, and all those votes..... will suddenly disappear. ALL FAKE. ALL LIES. A CON.

6o4dmm,3,2017-07-18,SOP feedback,Lkpno1225,OMSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSA/comments/6o4dmm/sop_feedback/,"Hi everybody, I am applying for the Spring 2018 cohort. Below is my SOP and I would love to hear your feedback. Many thanks !!!

-------------------------------------------
In my first statistics class in college, I was fascinated with the story of Abraham Wald, the famous statistician who saved countless lives during wartime. Discovering the hidden survivorship bias in the dataset, Wald made an unconventional recommendation to optimize bomber survival rates during World War II. That remarkable story fueled my passion for statistics and prompted me to add a math minor. I took as many statistics-related courses as possible to fulfill my curiosity for applied statistics; including advanced calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics, and scientific data analysis with R.

After graduation, I worked at XXX as a business consulting associate in the performance improvement team. However, after a year and a half, I felt dissatisfied due to the lack of implementation and real outcomes in many projects, on which I worked days and nights. Because of this unfulfillment, I decided to make a transition towards business analytics, which has always been charming to me since college. Then, I moved to the Bay area to work as a business analytics intern at XXX, a mobile app teaching English speaking skills. As a rookie in the tech industry, I spent countless of hours on learning the new analytics platforms and techniques. After the first week, I completed a product performance and strategy report, identifying user drop-off points and recommending five new features. 21 days later, four new features were introduced to more than 90,000 users. User retention rate hiked up from 4% to 12%, that was equivalent to 7,200 more users, who practice more regularly and get better at speaking English. I was immensely enthusiastic to see the impact of my contribution. Thanks to this enlightenment, I was able to form a crystal-clear vision of my dream job, data scientist, where I can apply statistical analysis and build analytical solutions that have direct and measurable impact to make our world a better place.

Besides, this internship also taught me how much more I must learn to succeed in this path. During the last assignment at XXX, I failed to analyze the user behavior from a huge user click dataset of more than a million rows, a scale that I had never seen before. I clearly saw my lack of knowledge in advanced quantitative methodologies, analytical tools and programming skills to process and analyze big data. Therefore, I want to go to graduate school to bridge the gaps.

I choose Georgia Tech’s OMSA program for two reasons. Firstly, I am impressed by the compelling package that OMSA program offers. This program represents the collaboration of three top-ranked schools at Georgia Tech, which all have incredible strong reputations for success. Additionally, OMSA's affordable price tag is important for me, a first-generation immigrant in the States with financial hardship and the first in my family to pursue a master's degree, to decide if I am able to make this goal come true. Secondly, I strongly advocate the innovative and accessible model of online education. As an online learning enthusiast, over the last 9 months, I have taught myself object-oriented programming with Python, refreshed my knowledge in descriptive and inferential statistics, and learned the fundamentals of machine learning via Udacity’s “Intro to Programming” and “Data Analyst” Nanodegree. To assess my preparedness and familiarize myself with the online learning model at Georgia Tech, I completed CS1301, Introduction to Computing using Python, on edX platform by Dr. David Joyner. Now, with my preparation, I am confident to take myself to the challenging courses at Georgia Tech.

Finally, I believe Georgia Tech’s OMSA will provide me a solid foundation and skill sets in data science and analytics, so that I will be ready to tackle analytics problems at scale and support businesses in their data-driven decision making processes. Thank you for your consideration."

Is there anyone on the Cross Country and or track teams here? How's the team atmosphere there and does running at RPI make getting school work done extra difficult? If I went there I would definitely run! I filled out their prospective recruit form and the coach sent me an email saying that I was very close to the standards and he would like for me to continue to update him on times.

Is there anyone here that is in the ITWS major? What's the difficultly and content of that program like? What kind of internships or jobs did you/have you lined up. 

No offense guys, but the cost seems BATSHIT CRAZY! I mean 70k a year? Damn. What's the financial aid situation like there? 

Finally, Is there anyone attending RPI and taking Portuguese at UAlbany? If so how's that going for you?

Any other extraneous information would be greatly appreciated! Thanks guys!

I love business and am very interested in accounting but no matter how hard I try or the amount of time I spend studying I can only manage to get a pass average...

This is extremely disheartening because not only have I put countless time into my studies but also speant considerable time on forums learning how the industry works and what my career path should be. I feel like for something I'm so invested in I should actually be good at it..

I'm in a fortunate position where due to by network/family I have been able to obtain internships with a very poor GPA. I'm extremely greatful for this but I feel undeserving of it

I guess my question is, while I enjoy accounting should I continue with it even though I'm not good at it?

6o5b1c,46,2017-07-18,"Oh Wise Llamas, Help Me Decipher Stabby's Stabbing Emails. (Long)",justapoliscimajor,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6o5b1c/oh_wise_llamas_help_me_decipher_stabbys_stabbing/,"TLDR: Fucking emails. fucking Stabby. I broke NC because my Dad doesn't step up and I'm risking my health.

Wise llamas, my psychologist is in Thailand and I can't reach her, so I need your counsel. 

Hopefully Bitch bot fills you in. Basically Dad sent the email, she replied fuck you... and I went to the Office of the Bursar, obtained log in records (cant get a letter, they said they weren't allowed to?) and sent this email below, this is what I get back.. (Hopefully this is formatted a little bit better since I'm on my laptop!) Dad's email (summary) is included for context, I've tried to bold and replace specific info in all the emails but most of you can gather that I'm a college student in the CornfieldLands TM. 

Basically I'm not doing okay right now because I'm working my ass off ($$$ for abroad next summer so I can hopefully go to Assisi) and haven't slept (yay! PTSD) and really want a hug and some pie. Also a dog. really want Krispy Kreme Donuts

**LONG, SORRY, as all emails included are for context**

So Dad's email first in summary:

""Here is x amount of dollars I've spent so far, WE ONLY NEED TO PAY FOR HOUSING bc justapoliscimajor got lots of grants. I request you give info of college account for *me*. (Dad knows that the college account is depleted for legal fees on her end which is NOT what you're supposed to do with it.)

Stabbys response: *GO FUCK YOURSELF I OWE NOTHING* (Pretty much but 10 paragraphs.)

**Then, I get another automated email about accepting/declining awards for fin aid ( I haven't met with Dad and I's fin aid guy because BUSY AF), Stabby gets it too and forwards it to me ((I ALREADY GET THESE) with this lovely thing (FML)**

**Stabby:** I have an email from your dad I don't understand. I keep getting this email as well. 
I will try this weekend to create a new password to obtain bursar and registrar information. I hope like every other parent I have my access. I will also look at the published budget for next year online. 
I can offer once I gave the relevant information to discuss it with you and your priest from *Newman Center* or review it in person over lunch in Chicago maybe with *Client that she did divorce for that she's SUPER unprofessional with and MIGHT BE DATING???*. 
I just did Beach Boys at *town with cool outside auditorium music thing* and Chicago at northerly island last night with him and we discussed all you kids. 
*Second cousin who lives in the same apartment complex with her* would be happy to see you in town as well. 
I'm not interested in any pissing match over your summers which you are responsible for. ((**513 is unclear with this so, this would have to go in front of a judge which is GONNA HAPPEN*))
Your discounts from my fafsa are amazing and your opportunity to get a great degree from a first class college are not bad problems to have. 
I'm going daily to see (*idk some person who i met once?*) at the ability lab next door to me and she is not likely to recover from her injuries. You have every opportunity ahead of you and even I have a few things left to do with my life. 
I hope that you are having a great summer there and that Spanish is clicking for you. Summer downtown here is wonderful. 
*her childhood friend* sends her love. *childhood friends kid* is going to *college* to play football in college. 
I have been sorting through the photos as well. 

Call me when you want to get this straightened out without acrimony and spite. Life it too short. 

*So, OP here goes to the office of the bursar.*

They were mostly helpful, but kinda can't comprehend that I need a letter bc of crazy insane nmom, so I'm Shit Outa Luck. BUt, I did get the login records into my authorized payer/payee account thing and Stabby's not logged in **ONCE**

*So, I send this email below, which I bcc'ed to my dad which then he called me and complimented me on well-written logical awesomeness so that was nice*

Stabby,

I went to the office of the bursar sometime last week. Your login info was sent to you in September when I created the account for you. The office of the bursar gave me every single time someone has logged into the billing account through their logins and passwords. You have not once logged into your account. (The exception was once when I logged in using your info in front of the customer service rep to make sure the account and info were correct) I can reset the password for you.

To pay you can also send a check (to UIUC, not me)
 I understand that technology can be confusing! The office of financial aid had someone probably swamped with the amount of incoming freshmen and didn't check the authorized payees. It's also not in that office, it's with the office of the bursar. So that previous email from financial aid was incorrect. The automatic notifications on the award letter are from me not accepting/declining things yet as I need to talk to the financial aid guy. 

 Dad doesn't know your account login or my portal login. Many friends that I have talked to do provide grades if parents are contributing through the office of the registrars request a transcript option. None of them give the portal login. I can get fired for giving out my info portal login as my University Employee information is on there. 

Authorized payee login:

Username: xxxx
Password: xxxx

You have never been blocked, access has never been interrupted or tampered with in anyway. Section 513 has never been violated on my part, especially section f. 

 You do have access of grades by requesting through the office of the Registrar a transcript for roughly $8-$10. I specifically have waved my FERPA rights as a student at UofI for both you and Dad for access to my grades and paying info as per the court order and section 513 since I have provided the grades and bursar info through official channels so that college is covered. I am currently at a 3.3 GPA which is well above academic probation standards. I am not going to be taking a fifth year. I am in summer school currently. I am unsure if summer is covered under section 513 however I will be checking that. 

Dad attached in his email to you my screenshots from my login and password of the accounts for both payees. He also attached the screenshot of my grades for your records as you are unwilling to go through official channels. 

Dad also in his email wrote about the cost for housing at Newman Hall. Since my awards (grants, FWs) already cover tuition, we will not need to pay the university. (Unless if there's an issue with the Map grants back when IL didn't have a budget.) You can contact xxxx for how to set up direct deposit or can send a check to Newman hall. It's maybe an 1,000 dollar difference, between Lar and the south rooms at Newman, but the food is much better. Hopefully you will start contributing or I will have to reevaluate loans/what I'm taking out for the future.

**reasonable, right?**

**APPARENTLY NOT (FUCK)**

SO, this happens!

Trigger for absolute Bull shit. 

**key: whenever there's OP, its my (full first name, full last name)**

Actually , OP, you sent me emails I still  showing you blocked me from the account and I have many emails to you and your father confirming that. 
Actually , OP, I have emails from your dad saying I should order a transcript since I was blocked and then he finally sent me my grades. 
Actually , OP , I've sent emails confirming that with raic, mass and retreats , you couldn't be bothered to pass fifteen credits including a swim class. You took a w on political science and haven't submitted the essay to get that off your record . You haven't figured out how to do basic algebra trig . You went out of the way to tell me during our last phone call that it was the Spanish teachers fault that she put too much culture on her exams and that the poli sci class was taught like a third year law school class because nothing in life is ever your responsibility. 
Actually OP the deadline for the payment plan through u of I is wednesday but you have your head up your ass for what you need to borrow and you still seem confused that I don't owe you summers or make  up classes unless you are ill. You don't have cystic fibrosis and qualify for five years. 
Actually OP , I spent six hours Sunday at the oak street beach and had a very pleasant memory of our most recent trip there . I miss the kid I thought I was raising. Maybe she never existed. 
I don't care. You barely passed a few nothing classes last semester. You aren't working any real job or internship and kids take classes online during the summer. 
If you can pass fifteen hours next semester of real classes and show that you can obtain a degree , feel free to send me that info. I wish and hope that you get into the student groove and enjoy obtaining even what they now refer to as barista degrees from u of I. I trust that you are with a really nice group of catholic kids as as a parent , that you are safe and sound. Whatever and wherever you find happiness I will be happy for you. 
I am completing my 2016 tax extension and my return gives everyone a massive credit in state. I am again sorry that the rules didn't give you discounts at out of state schools as well. I intend to file that and will complete faasa when it is due. I may need correct tax info from you at the time. Given my income compared to your dads I would be required to contribute about a hundred bucks a month at most. 
Don't send me another email from either you or your father demanding I pay fir summer which I don't owe. I have addressed this many times. 
Don't lie when I have emails showing you blocked me and that I was told in writing that I gave to order your transcript instead of having access. 
I can assure you that my friends don't have to order their kids transcripts. 
I did offer to see you and meet with your priest but if I did that he might conclude that you haven't been battered and stabbed by either your father or *stepmonster* or me. You did however have a great dress for the ceremony and look awesome in the blue and white one. 
Since you crashed last semester and have dropped both math and poli sci the concern about you handling real classes unfortunately is real. My total share of next year is at most five and half for this semester is 2500. Since you didn't let me get on the plan in time I suggest you borrow it like you did the first years amount. You have access to the 5500 in loans. 
If you want me to pay extra for the nicer dorm I would consider that as a gift after meeting the nice priest . Since I grew up in south bend , went to Loyola for law school and am on the women's board at *res place where my brother lives* he may not think that I'm a hideous monster. He may also explain to you that texting that mother Mary is the only mother you will ever need isn't really the concept of turning to her. 

Sending me inaccurate emails and signing them with your full name isn't a positive step in the right direction. 
I've told your dad that I'm happy to sign off on an order continuing the fasa and I'm done and therefore we would all be done communicating with each other. I don't need you sending me texts that when he dies you will somehow block me from seeing *my bro*. 

However , if you can't focus enough to pass fifteen credits , with a few of them being higher level things then by December this is all a moot point. Given the math , poli sci and other grades , I have been advised that given the extremely difficult level of competition at school there , that this is a real possibility . Even xxxx transferred to a California school. 
I'm not sure what your grades are this summer in your Spanish classes . I'm not sure how much money you have made. *cousin* is working two jobs in South Dakota making money hand over fist and hiking and doing something unique. You probably could have  taken that many credits in a six week summer program for the same cost but done it while living in Spain instead of champaign. But nobody asked me what I thought. 

XXXX is coming to dinner tonight. 
The beach is always here and I have a rooftop deck . I have moved forward with my life and with *my bro* and *Second cousin*. 
The conversation should be about what should be done  not what is required . It would make life a lot more pleasant. 
Your fathers email was so off base *her lawyer* told me to just ignore it and see what you are doing. He misses you just like a dozen other people who always treated you well. 
Buenas suerte mi hija .  

Editting to add: Please help me decipher and not go crazy. I need help. I've been penting up anger from this bullshit and resentment at the guy that I like that I fell for because I'm stupid that said he's not interested in me as he's going to grad school in a year. So, yeah. 

Thank's everyone for what you do and sorry this is sooooo long.

6o5cfe,11,2017-07-18,REWATCH DISCUSSION - Season 3 Episode 25 - Didn't We Almost Have It All?,polkadottulip,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/6o5cfe/rewatch_discussion_season_3_episode_25_didnt_we/,"
Episode Title Inspired by [“Didn’t We Almost Have It All?” - Whitney Houston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_4PlM85NJo)

**Alternate Friends Title** - The One where Cristina Dodged a Bullet

**Random Thoughts**

- Bailey, you know Cristina would rather be at work than prepping for her wedding.
- Derek is so unbearable these past few episodes. Flirting with another woman was the highlight of his week? Mmmkay. Sorry your girlfriend’s going through something right now, but it’s not all about you.
- Callie wants to have a baby…with George
- That choker is beautiful but chokers are the worst to wear. They were popular when I was in middle school and I hated them so much.
- There was nothing wrong with Cristina’s eyebrows!
- Webber is all congrats on the wedding, Burke, BTdubs you ain’t never gonna be chief in this hospital.
- I loved Burke saying his vows in the OR. 
- Callie got Chief Res!
- Izzie you’ve got to stop going after a married man.
- Ava’s like wink, wink, medically, I’m fine to go, but wink, wink, you have any reason maybe I shouldn’t?
- Ava’s speech when Alex doesn’t get her meaning really reminds me of April’s speech to Jackson in season 9. And Izzie’s speech to George kind of reminds me of what Jackson said to April at her wedding.
- I really did not like Cristina’s wedding dress when this episode first aired (at that time in my life I was doing the bridesmaid circuit so I saw a lot of wedding dresses), but it’s not so bad of a dress 10 years later.
- George failed and I’ve forgotten why.
- Meredith kind of walks like a man.
- It’s funny how little I care about each crop of interns over the years.






**Tearjerker Moment**

- Adele and Richard losing their baby boy.
- That end scene with Meredith and Cristina

**Good Music**

[Hold You in My Arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJN7xKPE01w)

**Quotes**

- “There’s only one Preston Burke.” “There’s only one Cristina Yang.”
- “If you need a job to give you a life, you either need a new job or a new life.”
- “ I am not optimistic, I am not. I am sure. I am steady. And I know I am a heart man, take them apart, put them back together. I hold them in my hands. I am a heart man. So this, I am sure. You are my partner, my lover, my very best friend. My heart, my heart, beats for you. And on this day, the day of our wedding, I promise you this. I promise you to lay my heart in the palm of your hands. I promise you, me. Too trite? Because I can rewrite it…”
- “Mama took my eyebrows. She took my eyebrows and now I am a Burke.”



**Questions**

- Do you think Burke would have stayed with Cristina if he had gotten the chief of surgery position?
- Who do you think had the best wedding dress in the series?

6o5j9f,3,2017-07-18,My journey [updating],thezia,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6o5j9f/my_journey_updating/,"**Note: I am not sure if this is allowed, but I am using this post as a journal to document my progress. My goal is to make a post in this thread most days to keep myself accountable to my goals.**

Here's my story:

**The short of it**: I used to be fit, but now I am not. I suffered from a bout of depression about a year ago, during which time, I packed on serious weight, and certainly did not exercise. Now, I am ready to make a change, and to do it right. I am going to commit to this sub, its guidelines/procedures, and in being an active member of this community.
That being said, does anyone have any recommendations for how to become really active on this sub? I want to be supportive and to receive support. I do not want to lurk.

**The long of it**: My story might not be very compelling, but I'll share anyway. I was very active and fit growing up. I played soccer starting at age 4, up until I decided not to pursue it in college (sounds more impressive than it is). I used to be able to run for hours and hours. I served a two-year mission for my church, where I was stay relatively active, though my fitness dropped off a bit, and I put on some weight. After my mission, I began running again, playing soccer recreationally, and hitting the gym. Once again, I was very fit.

I took an internship in my home town, got on an indoor soccer team with my HS buddies and...blew out my ankle. This was a big derailment for me. I had a very, very difficult time bouncing back from this injury. In the meantime, I did not change my eating habits (at the time, I was also training for a marathon). Fast forward to the end of the summer, and I had packed on 20 pounds.

Concurrent with all of this, I was doing my best to get into graduate school, with the goal to become a business school professor. I finished undergrad, started a masters program, and the got into a doctoral program (where I currently am, with a little under 2 years from graduating). So, while this has been great, and I recognize that this is been a big accomplishment in my life, it has added a great amount of stress, and some other, more serious things.

During this time, life threw other obstacles at my wife and me. She went through therapy for depression and anxiety disorder. I was diagnosed with depression. My weight increased with the passing years, while my general fitness and happiness levels decreased. It was here that the serious weight began piling on. I definitely used food as a means to cope (a mentality I would like to re-wire).

So now, here I am. I weigh 222 pounds, and would like to fluctuate around 160. I would like to do this before I begin working as an assistant professor (so, by fall of 2019). And, more than anything, I want to be happy and healthy, for my wife and two kids. I want to be a dad my kids are proud of. I want to be a husband my wife wouldn't mind showing off. I am ready to put in the work, to be patient with myself, and to make a lasting change.

6o5sbo,7,2017-07-18,Should I open a high-yield savings account with an online bank?,joepasquale,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6o5sbo/should_i_open_a_highyield_savings_account_with_an/,"Hi, everyone,

I'm going into college very soon and have been looking at my options to save for the future. I recently started reading up on online banks such as Ally, Synchrony, American Express Online, etc. I currently pour half of my paycheck from my part time job into savings, and keep the other half in checking. I never touch my savings. 

Is opening an online bank account worth it for me? I also plan to work during college, probably a job of some sort on campus maybe first semester and probably second semester, and plan on getting an internship next summer. I have around 3000 dollars immediately ready to put in an account like this.

If so, then which bank should I go with? The only accessibility I need to my money is being able to transfer between my account online and my accounts at my brick and mortar bank.

Thank you!"
6o5ubn,559,2017-07-18,[F]ucking [M]y Best Friend’s Freshman Little Sister on Summer Break [M24/F18],[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6o5ubn/fucking_my_best_friends_freshman_little_sister_on/,"Quick refresher again, I was u/greatmerlinsbeard a few months ago, people liked my stories, so I’m back with a slight rebrand. I recently posted my first story from this account, please check [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6nw9xu/making_friends_at_a_new_school/) out, it has [links](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6nw9xu/making_friends_at_a_new_school/) to my previous stories as well. 


This story takes place in the summer between the two schools I attended for grad school, so between where I had my adventures with [Phoebe](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/61jafh/exploring_my_dominant_side_the_jealous_girl_from/) and with [Simone](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6nw9xu/making_friends_at_a_new_school/). After my first year of grad school, I came back to the area where I grew up for the summer to work at an internship. In August, once the internship was over and my sublease finished, I went to kick it at my parents’ house for a few weeks before I went back to school.


While I was there, my parents invited over some family friends, including James, who’d been my best friend since we were little. Our family was close with all of them, and my parents invited over his younger sister Claire as well. 


My mom told me she was coming, and just making conversation, I was like “yeah, I haven’t seen her in forever, is she still at the high school?” My mom shook her head, “No, she just finished her first year at Arizona State.” I just shook my head ruefully, “Fuck, I’m getting old…” My mom just rolled her eyes at me. 


Friday night came and our friends came over: James, who was in town for a few days on vacation from his job, his parents, and Claire. Holy shit, my mom wasn’t kidding, she certainly had grown up. I had to keep my jaw from hitting the floor, and seeing the small smirk she gave, I don’t think I was too successful. “Hey,” I said to her, awkwardly waving. She hugged me, “Hey! It’s been so long.”


At this point, I had no idea things would go the way they’re quite obviously going to go, I just knew I very much liked what I saw. But fuck me, she was hot. Short, only about 5-2, and very thin, with tan skin, long wavy brown hair, piercing blue eyes, and quite a lovely smile. She wore a white sleeveless blouse and light jeans with big holes in them, and, for some reason, wedges. 


A refresher on myself, I’m 6-2 and blond, with as much scruff as my face can handle and a broad, muscular frame. 


I told myself to compose myself as we all went inside, made small talk, and ate some appetizers my mom bought (not much of a cook, my mom). We all caught up, I talked about grad school, James talked about his job, which sounded pretty great, and Claire talked about her freshman year. She seemed like she’d had a lot of fun and didn’t do much studying, which in my opinion is what freshman year is for. I told everyone as much, and while my mom told me to stop being a bad influence, I saw what looked like a slight twinkle in Claire’s eye. 


Who knows, maybe I was seeing things. I really hadn’t seen this girl since she was like 14, and she looked totally different, unsurprisingly. I told myself I was being crazy, but then when we all sat down for dinner, Claire sat down right next to me. I asked her how freshman year was, and she told me it was the most fun she’s ever had. Apparently she joined “the best sorority at ASU” and went to a bunch of crazy parties and shit. 


“Sounds like more fun than I had freshman year,” I told her. She laughed at me. “Fuck you,” I laughed back. She reached out and touched my wrist, smiling at me, “Don’t feel bad cause you were lame in college.” Wait, maybe I wasn’t seeing things. I mean, I’d certainly grown up a lot since the last time she saw me as well. I just shook my head, “Shit talked by a freshman in college, what has my life become…?” Claire laughed. 


After dinner, James and I went to our game room to play pool, have a couple of drinks, and catch up. As we were setting up the table, Claire walked in, “Hey guys.” Now that I was starting to get the idea that she maybe was interested in me, now I was freaked out James would figure it all out. This dude had been my best friend for a long time, now his younger sister was definitely flirting with me. 


Claire asked what we had to drink, even though it was my house, I looked at James to see what his reaction would be. We’d each poured ourselves whiskey gingers already. James apparently was cool with his sister drinking, cause he said, “Ask Jake.” I turned to her, “What do you want?” 


“Got vodka?” she asked. “Shit, yeah, right here,” I pulled out the vodka and she poured herself a screwdriver. “Alright, I see you,” I told her. James and I went back to playing, and she sat next to the table and we all talked. It didn’t seem like James was too aware of anything, which was good. 


When they left, we all said goodbye, especially James and I, cause I wasn’t going to be seeing him for a while. Then it was time to say goodbye to Claire. She hugged me tightly, for just a second longer than was necessary. “It was so nice to see you Jake, it’d been way too long,” she told me. “Yeah, for sure,” I said back, “it was nice to catch up.” She smiled and waved goodbye. 


Although I have to admit that I jerked off that night at the thought of fucking Claire, I didn’t think anything would come of it. She was leaving in a few days to go back to ASU, and I thought that would be that. 


A couple of days later, after the weekend, I got a Facebook message from Claire, “hey :) when did you say you go back to school? I’d love to catch up some more before you go” I told her that I left in like 10 days, and she responded, “oh no, I leave on Monday!”


Jackpot. My parents were going out of town on a vacation they planned before they realized I’d be there for the summer (smh guys, thanks…), so I’d have the house to myself. I quickly wrote a message back, and I said fuck it, time to go for it, “My parents are out of town this weekend, you free at all?”


Claire was typing… “How about Saturday? Let’s go swimming in your pool!” Yeah, hell yeah, I was in. 


Saturday came, my parents had left as planned. In the afternoon, Claire texted me saying I should let her in. I came to the door, and there she was, looking even sexier than she did the other day. She was wearing a pullover that left her shoulders free and short jean shorts. Her legs were so tight, she’d clearly managed to fit the gym in amidst all the partying. 


“Can I use the bathroom to change into a swimsuit?” she asked. “Yeah, sure,” I directed her to the bathroom. I was already in my bathing suit, shirtless, with my muscular chest and stomach exposed. Claire came out of the bathroom in a black bikini, my god she was sexy. 


I raised my eyebrows at her in appreciation and led her out to the backyard. I put my stuff down and when I looked up, she’d already jumped in. It was a hot, sunny summer day, I didn’t blame her at all. I quickly followed. I swam over near her and when I came up, she splashed me right in the face.


“Real talk, you don’t have a problem being over at your brother’s best friend’s place by yourself?” I asked her. “Like, I’m not tryna start something with James.” Claire shook her head, “Don’t worry, I’m not gonna tell him about me being here. My parents think I’m at Leslie’s.” I didn’t know Leslie, but it sounded convincing enough to me. “Works for me,” I told her. 


After a few minutes in the water, Claire got out and lay down on one of the pool chairs, stomach down. She reached behind her and untied her top, letting the strings fall down by her sides. I went over to the bar and poured us each an Arnold Palmer with vodka. I took it over to her, and she looked up at me and smiled, “Thanks! I told you I love vodka.” 


I pulled a chair over next to her, and I lay on my back, looking over at her. I asked her, “So, I feel like I got the PG version of your freshman year, what was it really like?” She laughed, “Yeah, I’m not gonna tell my parents or my brother anything.” 


“Yeah, obviously. So what’s one thing you didn’t tell them?” I asked her. Claire looked at me with a very sexy look, “How much sex I had.” I chuckled and raised an eyebrow at her, “Anyone particularly memorable?” Now it was Claire’s turn to laugh, “I feel like the freshmen didn’t know shit about how to have sex.” 


“True,” I replied. She seemed to like laughing at me, “Yeah, I got the sense that you weren’t killing it your freshman year.” Again I told her to fuck off, “Hey now, I fucked an RA in my building freshman year. But… you’re right, it was shit sex.”


Claire took a drink then looked at me again, “Yeah, like freshmen don’t know shit. But I hooked up with this one senior and he definitely knew what he was doing.” I looked over at her, “So you figured you’d go even older this time,” I said sarcastically. “Was I that transparent?” she asked with mock concern.


“Alright,” I got up and moved over to her chair. I sat down next to her and lightly squeezed her shoulders in a massaging motion. I leaned down and kissed her neck. Claire shut her eyes and moaned with each kiss. I went to kiss down her back, and she said softly, “Don’t stop.” I kissed the other side, and she moaned, “Ahh Jake that feels so good.”


I kissed down her back and pulled her bathing suit down her legs and off her entirely, leaving her tiny, tan body naked on the chair. I kissed all over her butt before I told her to turn over. Claire rolled over and smiled up at me. I lay down on top of her and kissed her. She kissed me back eagerly.


I moved down and kissed her neck again, and as she moaned, I slid my hand down to her pussy, which was already wet to my touch. With my other hand, I grabbed her left boob and squeezed it. I moved down to her small boobs and kissed slowly all around her nipples without touching them. She writhed against my mouth, desperately trying to have my mouth connect with her nipples. I took my mouth off her boobs, looked up at her, and silently shook my finger no, Dikembe Mutombo style. 


I wanted her to know I was in control here. From our conversation a minute earlier, I got the sense that was what she wanted. I moved back to licking all around her nipples, before finally putting them in my mouth. Claire let out a yelp of pleasure. 


I kissed down her incredibly toned stomach before finally getting to her what was clearly freshly-shaved pussy. I licked it up and down, tasting her wetness, before settling my tongue down on her clit, letting it dance around. As Claire’s moans and grinding against my tongue increased in pace and intensity, I slid two fingers inside her and made a “come here” motion against the roof of her pussy. Claire was practically screaming until she finally yelled, “Fuck, Jake, I’m cumming!” and I felt her pussy tighten hard around my fingers. 


As she convulsed in pleasure, I moved up and kissed her, and she responded, surprising me with her vigor. Her tongue flitted into and explored my mouth, and I gladly returned the favor. I brought my fingers up and slid them in her mouth, and she licked them clean. 


I stood up, untying my shorts and letting them slide down. Claire sat up on the edge of the chair and looked down at my fully-hard, 7” cock, ready for her. “You’ve got a nice cock,” she told me, matter-of-factly. “Thanks,” I said, grabbing her hair and guiding her head down to my cock, “let’s see how good you got at this last year.” Claire took my cock out of her mouth, bragging, “I was good at this before I even left here.” 


I admired her arrogance, because she wasn’t kidding. She swirled her tongue around my head, before taking it in her mouth and sliding her mouth most of the way down the shaft. As she got to the lowest point, she looked up at me with her beautiful blue eyes. What a beautiful sight, my best friend’s sexy 18-year-old sister, with most of my cock in her mouth.  “Fuck,” I moaned out, throwing my head back. As I did, it only made her attack with gusto, sliding my cock in and out of her mouth. 


With chagrin, I pulled away from Claire’s mouth. I bent down and picked her up, putting my hands underneath her legs and standing up. It wasn’t hard because she was so small. Holding her in my arms, I kissed her, and put her down on the chair on her back, spreading her legs apart. 


I positioned myself above her and slowly slid myself into her, exhaling slowly as I did. Claire moaned loudly, “Fuck, you’re big” (PSA: don’t fuck girls without wearing a condom, especially when they’ve bragged about how much sex they’ve had with multiple people). 


Leaning back on my heels, I slid myself in and out of her, holding onto her legs to keep them spread out. “You feel so good,” she told me as I slowly picked up the pace. I pulled her towards me as I sat back, pulling her on top of me. I wrapped my arms around her tiny body, bouncing her up and down on my cock.


I scooted to the edge of the chair, still deep inside her, and I slowly stood up, again holding Claire up in the air in my arms. I slid her up and down on my cock, and her moans were so loud that I thought the neighbors might hear. All she could say was some combination of “oh my god,” “Jake,” and “fuck me.”


I lowered Claire back onto the chair and again lay over her. This time, I put her legs up on my shoulders and slid into her. “You’re so deep,” she grunted as I started to pound her with every muscle in my body, attempting to split her in half. 


I could feel myself getting close, “Fuck, Claire, I’m gonna cum.” With a few last, desperate strokes as deep as I could go, I pulled out of her, spread her legs out, and stroked myself, shooting my cum in ropes across her stomach and chest. 


I sat back on my heels again, basking in the feeling of having just cum hard. Claire breathed heavily, and absent-mindedly played with the cum that had reached her chest. “So…” I asked, “did I disappoint?” Claire smiled, “No, that was exactly what I was looking for.” 


She grabbed her phone, “Fuck, I gotta go, I’m supposed to be home in 10 minutes.” She ran and jumped in the pool to clean the cum off of her. She got out and came over to me, kissing me deeply before putting her bathing suit and her shorts back on. 


I led her to the front door, where she kissed me again and said goodbye with a smile and a wave. She sent me snapchats of herself in like lingerie and shit for like a year, but we didn’t see each other again for a long time. "
6o5ygs,72,2017-07-18,[f]ucking in [m]y parent's shower,red_head_bunny,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6o5ygs/fucking_in_my_parents_shower/,"This is something that I've wanted to happen for a very long time. This boy is a very dear friend of mine. We became friends on the first day of freshman year in college and always had a special kind of connection. We're about to be seniors now. He's very charming and handsome. Strong, tall, hilarious and talented. For a while, I thought I had feelings for him and I told him. He didn't feel the same way, so I moved on. 

Anyways... he's been living in my house with me all summer. We both have internships in the nearby city and my parents go away on vacation each summer for about a month. They didn't want me to be alone and he didn't have much of a place to stay, so it worked out. I've always been attracted to him and ever since we've been living together, I've had a lot of curiosity. I mean, come on. We're living alone in a house in the woods. ALONE. He told me a few weeks ago that he thought I was sexy, but he wasn't willing to risk our friendship. But once I knew he wanted me, I continuously tried to seduce him.

So today, we didn't plan very well and when we were taking out some trash, we got locked out of the house. I yelled at him and we called my dad. My dad laughed at us and wished us luck. I was headed to clean off the front steps, so I turned on the hose we have in our front yard and sprayed my roommate lightly on his sock. Honestly, the moment the hose was in the picture, I somehow knew we were going to fuck. We both got a little more aggressive with the hose until we were both soaking wet. He then remembered he hadn't locked the back door and we snuck back in the house. I was wearing a shirt with no bra, so my boobs very clearly showing through my shirt. His shirt was thin and I was immediately turned on by him being so wet. I followed him to his room and rested my hands against the side of the door.

""I think you should come shower with me.""

He shook his head and backed away from me, laughing slightly.

""No. No. We are not doing this. It's going to kill our friendship, everyone is going to find out. It's not worth it. No. I don't want to.""

I chuckled and tilted my head to the side. ""Oh, please. I know you want to.""

He shook his head, begging me to stop torturing him. But I wasn't going to give in this time. I knew that he wanted me. I bargained with him for a bit and then gave up, shrugging my shoulders. 

""Well. I'm going to go shower in my parent's bathroom. You're welcome to join.""

Then, I turned away and walked down the hall. I took off my shirt and pants and threw them to the side. I knew he was watching. He'd never seen me naked before. He sighed.

""God dammit...""

I smirked as he followed me to my parent's bathroom. I slipped off my underwear and watched him. He took off his clothes and revealed his 8 inch hard cock. No joke, biggest cock I've ever seen. My jaw just kind of dropped and I looked at him for a few moments. He came towards me and grabbed my face, pressing his lips strongly against mine. I ran my fingers through his hair, letting out a quiet moan as he pushed me against the wall. We were knocking things over and he was playing with my boobs. He's a great kisser. After some more making out, we hopped in the shower. I immediately sunk down on my knees, taking his huge cock in my mouth. I had wanted to suck his cock for so long. He let some noises escape and whispered quietly.

""Fuck, fuck. That feels so good. Fuck."" 

I smiled to myself and continued to push his cock towards my throat. After gagging a few times, I stood up again. He tangled his hands in my hair, pulling my head back so that he could kiss my neck while teasing my pussy with his index finger. He pushed me against the wall of the shower, practically lifting me up with his hand. I stood on my tip toes and moaned softly as he snuck another finger inside. I squeezed his shoulders and savored each second. The hot water dripped over us and we continued to switch off. I gave him head and he ate me out, and so on. He was very talented in this department. Finally, he looked at me.

""Ok. We need to fuck."" 

We turned off the shower and walked over to my room. I searched for condoms as he went to put on music. Once I found them, I laid over him and sucked his cock again until he couldn't take it anymore. He fingered me for a minute or so before going to put on the condom. The condom was literally too small for his huge fucking dick, so that took a moment. Finally, he pushed himself into me. It felt so so fucking good. He gripped my wrists in his hands and pinned them to the bed, speeding up to fuck me harder. I moaned loudly and so did he, filling the empty house with our sounds. He knows I'm a very kinky girl, so he choked me a little, but very lightly. He's so strong, but very gentle in bed. I'm going to teach him, don't worry. 

We switched off between doggy style, missionary and me riding him until he was dripping sweat and I could barely move my legs. He finished inside of me and we both collapsed on the bed, immediately falling back into the normal conversations of our friendship. And yeah, then everything pretty much went back to normal. We showered again and then watched some TV together before going to bed. I'm pretty sure we fist bumped as a goodnight. But I did really like fucking him. His dick was really great. Hopefully we'll do it again sometime. "
6o5yxb,1,2017-07-18,Should I[24f] give up on this LDR [29m]?,vanhoutens,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6o5yxb/should_i24f_give_up_on_this_ldr_29m/,"Im going to keep it short. I moved to a small town in Canada (from another country in asia) initially to do a university degree. I met a really nice guy and had been in a relationship with him since then. 

I had to move to a bigger city to continue my masters degree which meant the relationship became a long distance one. He has a stable job (tech support) at where he is, and has lived at the house he was born in his entire life (never rented a place on his own).  

 I then moved again from where I did my masters to a bigger city to do my intern placement. I am at the stage where I am just starting out and work very hard (both during work and after work) to learn things on my own (and possibly increase my own market value). 


His original intention was to move up to where I am when I am done and have found a job.  I am genuinely having difficulty in keeping up with the long distance relationship as well, I do not like the physical absence neither do i like the ""watching shows together on skype"" . 
As I learn/read more things on my own, I also find the topics with which I could converse/discuss with him becomes more limited (he usually plays video games after work). 

We have fought several times; sometimes i just shut myself out (moving away felt lonely but i got used to being by myself ). I told him to start making plans to move as I am about to graduate and will stay on in this province to find jobs. He insists the right way to do so is to only move when I have secured a job. I may sound alittle self-centred; however I also feel very conflicted. He has a stable job in the small town where is from, pretty much all his family are there and he has never moved away from home. I feel guilty if he has to move to be with me. In addition, I am not sure how fast/likely he will get hired in the province I am in. 

However, it is not possible for me to move to the small town he is at as there is close to zero job opportunities for what i am doing (analytics). I dont feel confident that he can adapt when he moves given the fact that he hasnt moved away from home before or shown any independence on his own (he thinks it is easy). 
I just feel alot of uncertainties and frustrations. 

Should I let him go? or should i try to mend things? 
Any advice would be appreciated. 
Thank you for reading.

6o6dlh,6,2017-07-19,"My whole Life, Basically",JamminDreamshade,sad,https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/6o6dlh/my_whole_life_basically/,"Well, I'm obviously sad and needed somewhere to vent. Maybe it'll at least help to organize my own self. God knows I need it. Be warned. This is going to be quite long, but I've just had a lot of stuff on my mind and most of it has been bothering me lately. So, here goes, I guess.

It starts with me, being born. My mom got pregnant with me when she was 19, and I was at my parent's wedding. After I was born, we moved into a nice little house in the suburbs outside of town. It was nice, I played with the other kids in the neighborhood who were my age, and I did well in school. Really well. Everyone always said I was so smart and loved how quickly I learned to speak and read and all that stuff. Mom worked a desk job and dad worked construction. We were a nice middle class family just making it. I'll speak more on it later, since I'm going chronologically, but I have a few strange memories from that first house we lived in. It's all scattered and I can't really recall what happened in what order, so I'll just kinda list some things.

Well, I remember my Dad had a lot of friends. I guess they worked with him. They would always come over to the house and sit out on the back porch and drink beer and laugh. Pretty normal stuff I guess. One time my Dad wanted to do soemthing funny so he made me tilt my head back and he poured a little of his beer into my mouth. I didn't know what it was, but all his friends thought it was funny, so I guess I just went with it. Another time I remember waking up in the middle of the night because I heard something down the hallway. My bedroom was at the end of the house, so I snuck out of my room, down the hallway, and peeked my head around the corner of the only room lit in the whole house: the kitchen. My mom and dad were in a fight, I mean they were really going at it. They were calling each other terrible things, yelling, getting in each others faces, and crying (mostly my mom). I've never told them I saw that.

And then there's the last memory I have. My mom wakes me up one night. I can walk and talk but I'm still sleeping in basically the next step up from a crib, but it's still got a gate and stuff. I remember her telling me that we were going to go over to her friends house across the street. I could play with her son, and we were going to spend the night there. My little self said heck yeah! Sleepover! I never really questioned why we had to go through my window, but before I could really think about it I was playing operation in somebody else's house, so I was satisfied.

Some arbitrary amount of time later, when I was six, I get home from daycare one day, and wait and wait and wait for my dad to come home in his big work truck like he always did. He got back late. I suppose he and my mom both hit their last straw, because all I remember is my dad trying to leave and me desperately clinging to his leg, crying, asking him not to leave, to just stay home and play video games and watch movies with me like we always did. He left anyway.

Not long after I guess, when I was six, my parents got divorced. I didn't really know what that meant, only that my dad didn't sleep in the bedroom down the hall anymore. Not long after that happened, I found out my dad went to prison. I still don't know what it was for, but evidently it was bad. Felony level stuff. 

We moved out of our old house, in with my grandma, mom's side. I kept going to school, kept making good grades, getting put into special programs for the smart kids and all that jazz. All that time, both my grandmas tried to keep me as much as they could. I usually traded weekends. My dad's mom always sent me home with food, clothes, and all kinds of other stuff just so I'd have enough of something until I saw her again. Only one time in the six years my dad was in prison did I see him. Me and my grandma drove for four hours up to the prison he was in. We went through security, got sniffed by dogs, and got sat down in a cafeteria where we got food from vending machines. I ate lunch with my dad that day. I had a plastic wrapped hamburger and a soda from a cool looking vending machine. He had chicken. His head was shaved, and he had poorly done tattoos. He was dressed in all white, and barely said a word to me the whole time I was there, except that he loved me and that he'd come home soon. 

Well, then my dad gets out of prison, and soonafter starts seeing his first wife again, who he had my older half sister with. I remember one time going over there and me ratting him out to that woman about how he got an alcoholic energy drink. He left the house after they argued about that. I stayed there and she made me dinner. 

Me and my mom move out of my grandmas house, into this other small house that seemed perfect for the two of us. We had to share a bathroom, which sucked especially when puberty hit, but we made it work. One day, my dad shows up with his girlfriend, and in his first time seeing our house he comes into my room, checks it out, tells me how cool it is, and then holds out his fist, showing me the ring on his finger. All he said was, ""What do you think about this, son?"" I didn't know what to say. It didn't make me happy. But it also just didn't really matter to me. I didn't give a damn what he did with his life or what woman he was screwing around with. So I told him I thought it was cool and that I was happy for him. I didn't go to the wedding. I was never asked.

When I was in 7th grade, my mom lost her job in the recession. I came home from school one day to find her crying on the front porch. She didn't know what to do, so I just comforted her and made sure she was okay. She decided that was the kick in the butt she needed to get her life together. She decided to go back to college. Luckily her dad and mom were gracious enough to help us out a little so we didn't lose our house right away. We got a few grocery store gift cards and an internet plan so mom could do school at home and take care of me. After a while bills just started piling up and we had to foreclose on the house. 

My mom started working a part time job at a dental office when she decided that's what she wanted to do, allthewhile staying in classes at a college an hour away. I dont' know how she did it, honestly. We had enough with a little support from the family to move into another house after a brief stay with my grandma, and things seemed to be going well. I was still doing fantastically in school, Mom was getting things together, and Dad was a bi-weekly presence I had to deal with. All I ever felt like was he was trying so hard to make up for all the years he wasn't my dad that he was being a terrible father. He took all my birthday money away from me when I turned 13 and made me start a savings account. Every time I needed something important like shower stuff, school trips, or other things parents usually get their kids, it would always come out of my savings account. A lot of times he said he would take it out of my savings and put some back later when he got paid or something. He almost never did. 

Then high school happened. The big leagues. All honors classes. High hopes. Big dreams. And they all seemed so within reach. I was the top student freshman and junior year. Sophomore I was second, and senior year I graduated third in my class, speech and everything. Most of the shit I had to deal with in high school was pretty basic teenage angst, so I'll gloss over that, save for a few key details.

I found out a lot in high school. I found out friends that I had stuck by for years since middle school were really just elitist, judgemental assholes who cared about nothing but themselves, even to the point of putting me, their supposed friend, down. It made me feel like complete shit, and they always acted like nothing was the matter. For the longest time I convinced myself that I was just being too sensitive and that's what guy friends do with their guy friends, right? Well no. guy friends don't talk shit about them behind their backs about things they're really upset or insecure about, like their weight, or the way they dress, or the fact that they've never had a girlfriend, or that they barely have any other friends.

I also found out in high school, junior year, that my dad had been addicted to pain medication for years, basically since he got out of prison. My stepmom was on so many different medications that she was having seizures. That was a fun thing to hear through the thin walls of my dad's trailer when I visited for the weekend. Just thrashing, seizing, my Dad screaming oh god, trying to slap my stepmom out of it. Every impact just resonated through the whole house, even through my headphones. One day with my mom, the topic of my dad came up. We were just talking along. I was talking about how upset I was. She was talking about how mad she was at him for a lot of the things he was doing to me (savings account, generally being a terrible father), when I mentioned to her the memory I had where we went out the window to her friends house.

As I found out that day, during most of my parent's marriage my dad was addicted to crack, and regularly beat my mom. To what degree I don't know. I've never seen any scars and was too young to look for bruises or any signs of abuse. I'm glad I didn't have to see it. Turns out on that night in particular, my dad was really coked out, and my mom came and got me because she was scared I wasn't safe as well as her, and we left because she didn't want either of us to get hurt. That's something that has haunted me ever since the day I found out. I've only ever told it to a very small group of people I trust without a doubt. 

Then comes senior year. I'm involved in the theater, have decided that I want to pursue a career in film, and much to my delight have finally realized that my long time friends were just plain assholes. We phased out as I selected a college as far away from my hometown as I could get. Luckily I was a good enough student to get great scholarships, enough to almost fund my entire private school education. I worked hard for those suckers. January of my senior year, I wrote and directed a short film based on my old asshole friends. Funnily enough one of them starred in it as basically himself and had no idea the whole film's purpose was to aleviate all of my negative feelings. The star of the film, who played basically me, became a really close friend. He was a nice guy. We knew each other from theater, but hadn't ever become that close. Well one day we're filming for the short film and he gets a call from his it's-complicated-girlfriend-person. She was barely speaking words. Turns out she tried to overdose on antidepressants.

That night, after a carefully laid out plan with another girl we both knew in theater, I smoked weed for the first time. I got so high I couldn't even speak without laughing. My new close friend came over later and got baked with us too. A bunch of rumors got started about me, that I fucked my life up, that I was dropping out of school, and all this other stuff. I still graduated third. The stoners in school thought it was badass.

And here's where the shit goes down.

Last day of senior year, I get out of an AP test, the last thing I will ever have to do at that god-forsaken place, and meet up with some friends back at campus. We planned to smoke that night. It was me, close guy friend, a girl I will refer to as A, girl now referred to as C, and guy referred to as B. Evidently B and C were going to hook up while close friend, A, and myself were going to smoke. Cool, I guess. Well B got in trouble and couldn't come, so the four of us headed out to the woods and proceed to light up later that night. Next thing I know C is taking off her shirt in front of me and we start making out and then we're completely naked, in front of the other two people who were there. After all the foreplay, all of everything, I guess anxiety kicked in or something but I completely lost IT, if you know what I mean. How disappointing. C's mom calls and says she's going to call the police if she's not home so A and C take off in my car, leaving me and close friend in the woods alone. We talked a lot about how disappointing that was for me. I was really upset, but whatever, I figured I'd get another chance.

Unfortunately I did. C and I started hanging out almost every day. We'd do everything together. Movies. Lazy days at her house. More movies. Dinner. Driving and smoking cigarettes like nothing mattered in the world except our intertwined hands. When I say I was in love with this girl, that doesn't even come close to describing how I felt about her. My days for the whole summer were wake up, go be with her all day, make sure she was home by 11, then go smoke with my close friend out by a graveyard with a bag of whataburger handy. It all made sense. I felt like I knew who I was for the first time in my life, like the whole year had gone perfectly because life was finally giving me a break. I had been through enough that I deserved to feel good for once.

Well, it didn't last long. I went 15 hours away to college, and me and C said we would make long distance work. I pledged a fraternity, which kept me really busy along with the hardest classes I had ever taken and a crazy rehearsal schedule for a stage production. As time went on, I felt her drifting further and further away, and I knew there was nothing I could do about it. My close friend said he could always tell when I was worried about her. She never left my mind. I always wanted to make sure she was okay, she was happy, that I was doing everything I could for her even though I could hold her in my arms. 

A big nudes snaffoo happened, and basically she wasn't allowed to talk to me, but we still did through a teacher's phone we both knew and snapchat. We said we would be able to make it through anything, that it wouldn't be like that forever. Then I came home for a class break. I was so happy to see her again. I surprised her with breakfast, and we spent the whole day together. But then, at a football game on our last night together, she told me after a 3 hour car ride that she wanted to take a break, that she just couldn't handle it. I didn't know what to do. This was the first serious relationship I had ever really been in, so all I knew how to do was cry. I cried and cried. I tried to keep it together in the bleachers, but barely could. I cried for the whole ride home in silence. I got us lost at one point without any gas and we were lucky to find a town in the middle of nowhere that had a gas station open in the middle of the night. I remember telling her ""this is not what I meant when I said I wanted to get lost with you."" At least that got a laugh out of her. 

After that everything pretty much went downhill. C broke up with me a few weeks after the whole ""break"" thing started, and I pretty much broke down. I slept most of the day, barely went to class. My grades were slipping, pledgeship was still as rough on me as ever without any sort of relief. I came home for thanksgiving and after a few days all my family kept asking me was if I wanted to stop going to college and I could come home and I could take a gap year and then go back or transfer or what the fuck ever else. I told them I was fine, but they all knew I wasn't. I started smoking way more cigarettes. By the end of the semester I was at a pack a day, sometimes more.

Christmas gave me some time to get over everything, which worked to some degree. I smoked some weed every now and then, which helped with my mood. Then school started again. And what at first seemd like it was going to be a stunning recovery became a giant, tumbling snowball. some of the same things started happening again: sleep issues, lack of motivation, classes being too hard, feeling further away from people in the same room. I couldn't handle pretty mcuh anything. I got in trouble one night and went to jail after getting way too drunk with some friends.

And now its summer. I'm back up at school for this awesome opportunity internship, but I can't care less about it. All summer all i could do was sleep and worry about jail, my sentence, my ex, everything. And nothing. I would go between days where I was really on edge to days where I felt absolutely nothing. A few months ago I started cutting myself. The first time was in a park. I was sitting at a bench, taking pulls from a whiskey bottle while I waited on a friend to come pick me up, when I found a knife in my bag that I had taken over to a friends to cut oranges for tea. I sawed away at my wrist, barely breaking skin. And then I finally got some razor blades. Oh god did they make it so much easier, so much more satisfying. Now I'm scared of people seeing my scars, but I still do it anyway. My mom finding out the day I left town is a much longer story.

So here I am, alone, arm covered in blood, with no reason to care about just about anything. At this point in my life I'm convinced that nobody really cares, everyone is selfish, and I'm better off staying in my own head and fighting my own troubles than getting wrapped up in other people who will inevitably fail on me after I've decided to completely trust them. Maybe I left out a lot, but that's basically everything that's running through my head on a daily basis, just to give a general idea. I'll just have to keep doing this one day at a time until I get tired of it or things get better. Whichever comes first.

So there's basically my whole life, all in one post. Enjoy, because I haven't.

""A"" and I were former co workers for a year, and then classmates in college for 2 years. He met my friend ""J"" during my time in college. J and I were best friends, but the friendship would grow sour at points. She'd borrow money, supplies, and fail to pay me back or return things. She'd steal ideas from me for projects at school and wouldn't admit to it or give me recognition. When I'd apply to jobs, she'd get competitive and apply to the same jobs after I told her about them and she'd get pissed when I'd get the job and she wouldn't. I was always very supportive of her and I'd help her in ways, and she'd never acknowledge it. (Example, I was applying to an internship and it had multiple openings so I told her about it. She started an application but didn't finish it because of so many excuses, So I completed the damn application for her, turned it in for her and everything. She ended up getting the internship and I didn't and I didn't even complain)

I'd known her for 3 years, cared about her, loved her like family, but she would just be mean to me randomly, or just treat me like shit towards to the end of our friendship. I finally called it quits when I found out she was sending my boyfriend messages, asking him out to drinks, movies, shows, etc and lied to my face about it. 

She never admitted to any wrongdoing nor did she apologize. She told me I was insecure and that she is a strong independent woman who can do as she pleases. I felt like she was leaching off my life so I cut her lose.

My friend ""A"" knows about this whole situation. He'd tell me to cut her out of my life because she was just using me. 

It's been a year since I cut her off. My friend ""A"" has been a bit absent lately, and he said he's been busy with his job, his girlfriend and whatnot. He keeps making plans with me and they always fall through. He'll say ""hey, let's hang out tommorow! Art show! I'll meet you at 7"". The next day, it's 7, I'm ready, won't hear from him for hours, the next day he'll say ""shit, sorry, I forgot"" or ""shit, I was with my friend and so. Sorry. Let's hang out another time"". 

I shot him a text saying I feel like we are growing apart. He calls me, says he's been super busy, hasn't had time for friends. 

He invited me to a show Thursday, only to say maybe I shouldn't go because he already invited ""J"", though he wouldn't say her name. Said maybe we could all hang out together, but then maybe not, as it could be super awkward. Apparently, them two are now buddy buddy. I keep seeing photos of her on his Instagram feed/story. 

I'm not sure what other steps to take or what else to say. 

TLDR: my current best friend is getting really close to my ex best friend, knowing full well how she mistreated me for three years. My best friend and I are now growing apart. What do I do?

In the fall I'll be starting my final projects, one a mini thesis and a collaboration project with industry. Because of miscommunication issues, The internship I had planned in the summer fell through. 

Just wanted to hear some feedback on whether,

A. The hard work would be worth it, and I should do a Internship while finishing my projects or 

B. I should just stick to submitting to different Awards shows / finishing projects

Please keep in mind, my particular focus is in Art Direction. But I'd love to hear peoples thoughts and experiences going this route.

Also, is it just me, or is the process of emailing agencies frustrating? I either get no reply, or a robo-email. The only success I've had with getting in contact has been through the contacts I do have. Any tips in the future, when I won't be able to just rely on contacts, but directly contact myself, or is the only option to rely on the people I do know?

Thanks for everyone's feedback in advance."

6o724e,2,2017-07-19,This entire thing just bothers me,NaggingThought,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/6o724e/this_entire_thing_just_bothers_me/,"I made a post about it before hoping to get someone elses opinion on how badly I screwed up, and I just want to talk about it and get it off my chest, so here it does.

In my first few semesters at college, I made a couple of friends. A cute girl who eventually ended up rejecting me, my friend from my hometown who I hadn't talked to since like 3rd grade, and a couple of other kids. The only ""important"" one is my hometown friend, I'll call him Peter, and the girl is somewhat relevant, so she's called Rel I guess? Whatever, I had a major crush on Rel during my first and second semesters, Peter knew about it and he also liked her a bit too. Well, there was another girl in my class I had noticed but never really bothered to talk to, she was cute and she had her own group of friends, but she was in a lot of my classes in both the first and second semesters. Before an exam one day outside the exam room, me and my friend were talking about Rel and that other girl walked in and was waiting by herself. I kind of just say, ""You think that girl over there is cute?"" and he says she is but she's not his type and repeatedly tells me to talk to her, but I say no because I was thinking about Rel. Well it turns out Rel rejected me a couple months later, and I'm stuck thinking about that girl.

Well, the first semester of sophomore year starts, and whaddya know, that cute girl is in my classes again, and Rel isn't, so I figure I might as well talk to her.

It took me a little past halfway through the semester to muster up enough courage to talk to her. For the life of me, I could not do it. And even then, I was so nervous I think I was a bit awkward. I forced myself like one or two more times to talk to her, and she was either shy or just not interested enough to carry a conversation and her friend carried them with me instead, turning to her just for that girl to add in something small. It sucked, quite frankly. So I just stopped talking to her, and I felt terrible because those conversations did tell me enough about her to realize we're actually really similar. Same major, same ethnicity, same type of family environment growing up, it was pretty cool to find someone else like me.

Next semester, I keep telling myself I'll talk to her if she's in my classes. And again, since we're the same major, she is in my classes. What a huge surprise, right? And even more of a surprise, I'm nervous so I don't talk to her! Have a great time this time too, she's a commuter like me and we both show up slightly early to class so we end up waiting outside the door by ourselves before the classroom doors open.

Well one day this awkward kid comes walking down the hallway, and he walks over and starts talking to her. And I thought I was awkward? Boy, this kid took the cake. He said some seriously weird shit and she just had this look of pure, ""Oh no..."" on her face. Eventually the kid walks away after a weird goodbye, and I couldn't help but laugh at it. I said to myself, if that kid had the courage to talk to her and it went that badly, I know I couldn't do any worse. So I talked to her, she remembered me from last semester and was all smiles. Super sweet, talked about our shared major, she gave me some tips for classes that she was taking at that time, and we exchanged numbers. I felt great, texted her quickly for a room number I couldn't remember a couple hours later, and that was it for that day. After that, I got sick by the next class, didn't talk to her for another 2 weeks, and the next conversations were awkward as fuck. I couldn't bring myself to talk to her about anything other than an exam that we had coming up, and after that I eventually tried to talk to her one morning and I just stumbled over my words. Like, eventually got over my nerves, walked up to her, kind of surprising her since she was reading something on her phone, and I got out a, ""How are you?"" and that was it. Just couldn't go past that, I blanked, straight up. Pure embarrassment for me, felt like shit and just told her I was tired and walked down the hall to get as far away from that dumb shit I just pulled. I hated myself, I wanted to talk to her but I couldn't.

After that I decided I'd just say fuck it and ask her to get coffee with me after class one day, and I never did. I just couldn't bring myself to talk to her again, so my last idea was to text her asking for help on the last homework assignment, and try to get a conversation going through text. She never fucking responded to my text. I don't know if she ignored it, said I was weird/creepy, or something technical happened and she never got the message/I never received it (my house has spotty service, it's a possibility, texts don't go through sometimes, even if it says ""sent"".) I hadn't texted her since the day I got her number because I'm a complete idiot. I fucking hate myself for this shit - why didn't I text her? She gave me her goddamn number, what the fuck man. 

So I just gave up hope I guess. No real way to know the answer, and next semester I know I won't see her since she told me she got an internship and has to take online classes. Maybe in the spring semester I'll see her, but I don't know. Chances are pretty good since we're the same major, but would it make a difference if I even did see her again? I'd probably pussy out of talking to her like all the other times, and even if I don't, she fucking ignored my text. What makes me think she'd say yes instead of saying no or calling me a creep?

So that's basically it. I feel a bit shitty about it at night, it pops up in my head all the time just tormenting me. If I see her in class or something again, do you think I should just say fuck it and ask her out? Or is it just not worth it with the dumb shit that fell out of my mouth at the end of the last semester?

I doubt she actually thinks I'm creepy, probably just thinks I'm awkward as fuck. Wonder if she realizes it was cause I had a crush on her and couldn't bring myself to get over it when talking to her, or if she thinks I'm autistic or some shit. She was always nice and pretty shy/quiet, only ever talked to her one or two other friends in all the classes I've seen her in."

6o8t59,5,2017-07-19,I [20M] am close to breaking up with my three-year long girlfriend [20F] because of drug abuse and trust issues.,FedEquity,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6o8t59/i_20m_am_close_to_breaking_up_with_my_threeyear/,"So after three great years together, having maintained a semi-long distance relationship (3 hours by train), we are now considering a breakup because she is doing her postgrad in England and I am staying back home. 

Having gone to college abroad, we were both drawn to each other as we came from the same place back home. We were both novel lovers and virgin at the time. All in all, during our whole period together, we had a lot of chemistry and incredible amounts of things in common. In college, she starting using weed recreationally. I had tried it before but it was not until college when my usage levels became worrying. I was smoking almost daily and had trouble meeting the requirements to pass onto my second year. We had a major lapse in the relationship, when I confessed to her I had kissed a girl on a night out on our second month together and thus cheated on her. She forgave me, but held a (n obvious) grudge on me. While we remained together, we had our ups and downs, and we broke up for the first time at the end of our first year in college. It was mainly due to trust issues from her as she thought I was constantly hiding stuff from her or not paying enough attention to her. 

After three months, we reconciled and got back together, and while everything seemed it was going fine, in April, after four or so months together, one friend of mine who had a strong weed habit attempted suicide. During the next month, I kept closer to my friends, tried to spend as much time with them and consequently payed less attention to my girlfriend. She decided to cut it, arguing I was not there for her and not putting the effort she thought I should. Weed definitely played a part, as even though my friend's attempt was linked to weed, I kept using on an almost daily basis. All of my close friendships back at home were supported or based on weed at this point. It was a harsh breakup, over text, and close to our exam periods. We lost contact from then on and I did not attempt to re-establish a friendship or bring her back to me. During this time, I reduced incredibly my habit and even confessed it to my mum, who was fully supportive. I knew I had to put a great effort to achieve an OK GPA, so, this together with my desire to show my (then) ex that I could live without weed made me take the decision to quit momentarily to focus on my studies.

Six months later, we met up as friends, and I finally confessed that I had cheated on her a second time during our first time as a couple. She confessed that she had also almost done it but that nothing had happened. We kept talking and met up again a few months later, when we decided to start talking regularly. A few more months later, now back at college, she invited me to her College. We reconciled, spoke about how we had changed, but not long after this, we started using again, and with it came all the trust issues she had had. 

I knew I had to give my 110% to try to refloat the relationship and that is what i did: I was attentive, caring, texted her very frequently, skyped her almost as much, stood beside her during her final year exams the same way she did with mine. While we were still not together, we were exclusive and were giving each other a period of time to see how things went. The anticipated outcome was that she would take a decision by the end of our academic year (May this year). She came to my college after our exams, and as everything had gone very well during the past four-month trial, she felt very excited about the idea of getting back together, even telling me she was ready to tell her mum about us (her mum had always been her confidante and knew about my occasional weed use, as well as the other episodes of our relationship- it was a huge step for her as her mom was not only that, but also her best friend). While she did not, arguing that telling her mom would sound like a definite taken decision, she told me she was still thinking about what she wanted. Before leaving my College, she asked for some time during her grad trip to think about stuff, so we agreed we wouldn't text regularly during this period, and would talk things out after these two weeks. 


She left for her grad trip, and I went back home for an internship. When she got back, she broke up with me. She told me she could not live with thinking about all the wrong things I could be doing while we were apart, and how she wanted to date someone in the same city as her. Two days later, she reconsidered and while remarking that all the things she had told me were true, she said she did not want to take that decision in such abrupt manner. She argued that seeing me in her house after so long had been a shock to her mind and that she had spent every night during her grad trip crying her eyes out because she saw no alternative to breaking up with me. 

After almost three years on and off, here we are. And while we were making progress until a few days ago, something took place which changed the way she saw me. Until now, we felt it was easier to be with one another, we argued much less and we started to discover things about each other we had ignored for so long, blurred by the issues we had had to handle during our relationship. 

Note that during this summer, one friend [20M] from college came to my city to do an internship. He is probably the heaviest weed user I know to date. For the first weeks, I used with him during weekends, but up to now, the next weeks we started meeting up after work, chilling on his couch and using with no attention to consequences whatsoever. By now, you can probably identify that I have a very weak power of will and a very addictive personality. She was okay with me using from time to time but hated seeing me drowsy, blurred out and hazy constantly. She always says I could have done much better at College than what I did (3.4 GPA in the UK). 

She left for formal graduation a week ago. The day before, we spoke about what we thought should happen for us to come back together. While it had been a relationship full of problems, we still deeply loved each other and did not want to let go of such beautiful feeling. She said she was going to open up to her mother. I said I was going to keep my habit to the minimum, and that I was going to try to involve her more with my life-long friends. 

What took place a few days ago: I was at my heavy user friend's house, one day after she left from graduation. She called me, and we started chatting normally. She sounded very excited to talk to me, so I did not tell her what I was up to. My friend coughed (up to now, I think on purpose) and she heard it. She asked me what was that and I confessed to her I was having a chilling session with my college friend. She was outraged, as she rightfully thought I was the same guys from two years ago. I tried to tell her that I was afraid of her reaction if she knew I had promised to minimise my usage but had failed to do so after only one day. This means that now, she has again lost that bit of trust she had on me, which I had so carefully built during this time. The issue with this is that at the time she thought it was a girl who was coughing and I was cheating on her once again. I am aware how ridiculous it sounds to be lying and hiding stuff on weed, but she is also very aware of how much I can change if I use too often. 

To offer a summary on this last event, her perspective is that I will keep lying to her about everything. My point of view is that I am not the cheater I was back in first college year. I have outgrown that part of me and I continuously refrain myself from cheating. My actual problem is with this drug. It has caused me so many downfalls in my life. My closest friendships are bound with it. While her point is completely valid, she does not understand the reach of my issue with weed. She does not understand how much it can actually control me. 

Today, I decided to stop using for a while. I decided I was going to ignore my heavy user college friend, as this was a toxic relationship totally based on weed. But I still need advice. I do not know if I still have to grow on my own or if I can grow with her by my side. I am afraid of ditching my life-long friends [20M] who still use regularly (but not as much as my college friend). I know that by what I have written today, most of your advice will be directed at my relationship with my girlfriend, but I am certain that, even though she is going back to the UK in September for her postgrad and I am staying home, I am more than able to keep a long distance relationship, with the only thing impairment being my weed dependence. My objective today is to stop using completely.

Should I also ditch my life-long friends? Should I focus more on other less toxic friendships? This would be the third time we break up, and I foresee that it would be the last one, at least in the near future.

tl;dr I have a weed dependence which has slowed down my three year relationship, what should I do with the people that encourage this dependence?

6o8uty,2,2017-07-19,Starting to dislike my best friend....,Me_398,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6o8uty/starting_to_dislike_my_best_friend/,"My best friend and I have been friends since we were both 13 years old (17 now). During the first year of our friendship - we had so much in common and we used to enjoy each other's company a lot.

In the second year of our friendship - I really started to notice that my best friend wasn't whom she portrayed herself as. She was jealous of me. Both of us come from wealthy families but my parents showered me with gifts all the time whereas her parents would barely buy her anything (they were frugal). Keep in mind that I never tried to show off but when she would visit my house - she would scan myself and my house completely and then for some reason feel inferior.

She tries to become exactly like me - she copies the way I speak dress, look and purchases everything I own and then rubs it in my face. She never realized that I was aware of her behavior and I never confronted her either. This started to soon bother me as I didn't want her to become me - she should be herself. Moreover, she even took the same subjects as me in A levels after I told her what I was taking despite complaining for 2 years that science was very difficult and that she would choose business. She changed her mind just as I told her what I was choosing. In addition, my mother and sister have both noticed that she is focused on everything I do whenever we meet so that she can imitate me.

So basically I thought that this was as far as she was willing to go and I tolerated her behavior. However, I just recently did an internship at this NGO, where I made lots of new friends. My friend got jealous of my new friends and would tell me that my new friends were ""fake"" and were ""using me"" even though she has never met them. She keeps telling me to just stop talking to them. 

Amongst my friends is a boy that I like and we talk quite frequently. After I told my friend that I liked him - she became extremely judgmental and started to tell me that this guy was very ugly and that she has found out that he is just not a good person and will treat me like shit. I know this is bullshit because my friend doesn't know anyone outside her school and certainly no boys as she is extremely zealous in her religious beliefs and would never speak to or become friends with the opposite gender.

After I told her that she was spitting bullshit - she told me that I was ""an idiot with no brain"" and that ""I'll understand what she meant soon"". She keeps advising me to not talk to him anymore and only speak to her. She is even making up stories about her past experiences with boys in order to deter me from speaking with him. (All horseshit - she has never had a boyfriend in her entire life). 

She is also extremely paranoid. Her parents never had a good marriage and she is always coercing me into remaining single for the rest of my life. Of course I don't really care what she says but then again I don't like to keep secrets from a best friend. 

Furthermore, we have a few things in common anymore. Both of us have evolved and our interests have diverged. She is an ultra conservative person whereas I am quite liberal. She tries to force her religious beliefs on me and tells me what I should be doing or should do with my life. If I don't comply, she always tries to force me to do otherwise instead of respecting the decisions I make. 

She is very critical and judgmental. I keep a lot of secrets from her because I'm sure if I told her - she'd tear me apart for them. She once made fun of me for having depression and generalized anxiety disorder back in grade 10. I'm sure if I told her that I was someone who frequently experiments with drugs e.g. weed (not like super dangerous ones) - she'd either tell my parents or the police. Of course after she was done attacking me. 

After making new friends - I realized how much fun I can have being with others and talking with them. My friend and I just don't click anymore. It is difficult for me to even speak to her and I dread meeting her.

Advice on what I should do? Stop talking to her? Speak to her about this? 

Tl;dr: My best friend is jealous of me, tries to copy me in every aspect, urges me to not talk to others and is very judgmental."

I would very much like to be wrong on this opinion, or at least find more nuance than I currently hold. Anyway, here it goes:

It is generally known^(citation ^needed) that wealth allows you great access to opportunity. If you are wealthy, you can send your child to the ""best"" primary and secondary schools, in preparation for them to attend the ""best"" colleges. Those colleges have a reputation for their networking, allowing the ""best"" companies/firms/etc to give very competitive opportunities to the ""best""- i.e. graduates of these universities.

Let us see how this works for two case examples: a child from a rich family, and a child from a poor family. (assume that all else is held the same, besides their socioeconomic status.)

The rich can afford to send their children to pre-K, and the poor, on average, cannot. This means that the rich child is already at least a full standard deviation ahead of their poorer counterpart by the time they are both in kindergarten.^[[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318654/)[[2]](http://shiftfiles.com/files/190667E_source_2.pdf)

The rich can also afford to invest in music lessons, which has been shown to result in overall positive effects on child self-esteem and self efficacy, as well as better relationships with teachers and parents, which- I would argue- leads to better educational outcomes.^[[3]](http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/2199/1/Creech2011Learning102.pdf) The poor students, however, cannot afford to have music lessons, and so will- on average- not participate in any kind of non-mandatory music program. Poverty is also known to have detrimental effects on school outcomes, both behavioral outcomes and outcomes on standardized tests.^[[4]](http://www.academicjournals.org/journal/ERR/article-full-text-pdf/31F3BFB6129)

We can infer from logic that rich families tend to send their children to schools that are not necessarily their ""neighborhood"" public school. We might even generalize that these families send their children to the ""top, elite"" private schools, or even independent schools which charge outrageous tuition in order to function separately from both state and federal regulations. But, even if we refuse to accept this premise, wealthy families tend to seek each other out and form communities, which concentrates resources for those public (or, in some cases, ""public charter"") schools.^[[5]](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/irpweb/publications/dps/pdfs/dp105695.pdf)

These resources have benefits beyond being able to hire some of the best teachers that are not immediately obvious. They can offer expensive extracurricular activities that other schools cannot, such as fencing, ice hockey, equestrian sports, golf, etc. The rich student may take advantage of these opportunities, while the poor student is denied the opportunity to participate by virtue of their public school even being able to afford such activities. The same goes for offering AP courses.

In addition, the rich student's parents can afford to hire tutors and access extra learning resources for difficult subjects or SAT/ACT/AP test preparation. Many of these tests can also be taken multiple times by wealthy students, because they have the resources to spend on additional retakes. Poorer students may be able to afford such a test only once or twice, and probably will not be able to access prep classes or materials.

All of this is important for what I call the ""resume arms race."" The perception has become that a student must maintain excellent grades (all A's), and also participate in at least three (sometimes a great deal more!) extracurricular activities, often involving sports (to chase ""student athlete"" scholarships, for example), in addition to their regimen of test preparation, all in an attempt to ""stand out"" on college admissions. (This is leaving aside the issue nepotism with particularly wealthy parents who can make hefty donations that skew admissions.)

The poor student, by contrast, has very little ability to pad their resume, which severely limits their college education options.

Once the rich student is in one of these selective, elite colleges, they are extremely likely to stay. The Open Education Database shows that the top colleges (Ivies, etc) have graduation rates *in excess of 90%*, and some as high as 95%.^[[6]](http://oedb.org/rankings/graduation-rate/) So, essentially, once the rich kid gets in, they're going to leave with a degree.

This is where those connections I mentioned at the beginning come in. By attending the most selective universities, they have access to elite social networks, which allow for selective internship opportunities, which builds networks, which allows this rich students to move directly into the wealthy end of the workforce as lawyers at famous firms, politicians, business executives, etc. This is especially true for students who only intend on getting the qualifications needed to get eyeballs to look the other way when they join their parents' business and take the reins when it's time to pass the torch.

The poor student, meanwhile, may not have gone to college at all. Less than half of all students who enter college will earn their bachelor's degree.^[[7]](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4740480/Pathways_to_Prosperity_Feb2011-1.pdf) This poor student will likely take on debt that pursuing a degree that they will likely not be able to complete, and therefore have to take a job that will not earn enough to finish paying off this debt in a reasonable time. And this is assuming that the poor student pursues college at all.

It doesn't help that tuition continues to skyrocket as public funding for higher education continues to be cut by state governments across this country, leaving education out of reach for anyone but those who can afford it or ""deserve"" it based on their ""merit.""

Looking at these data, it is near-impossible to me to think that the deck isn't stacked in favor of the wealthy. The entire system seems skewed to prevent those lower on the socioeconomic scale from moving up, which means that social mobility is very low. This means that power passes from rich hands to other rich hands, as there is no incentive for the rich to give up their power over education (by voting for governors/legislators who would increase taxes to help make college more affordable).

Is there a perspective on this issue that I am missing, that might help me see some more nuance to this issue? Am I right to be as cynical and jaded as I am? As an educator, I believe that education should be the great equalizer- that everyone should have to truly learn, and learn how to learn in order to be a fully-independent adult. But everything I've seen suggests that despite my best efforts, the game is already so far stacked against the poor that holding them to a rigorous standard seems unfair.

If you actually read all that, thanks for the effort- I look forward to any responses you would like to offer!

I also got a dream internship which I've been doing for the past six weeks and the 9-5 life has left me exhausted and down (even though I'm really interested in what I'm doing). I've only just got to the point where I can think about the task ahead of me and I've got 4 weeks to do 6 essays. Needless to say I'm a little overwhelmed with it all, trying to balance mental health with work and get it all done in time is going to be a mean feat and I was basically just posting here for some advice? I've never had tasks like this back to back so intensely for so long and I'm worried I won't manage it. 

I've recently started using the app Cold Turkey to block out distractions from 9-5pm. Are there any other tools that could help motivate me/enhance my productivity? 

Do you have any advice to prevent burnout? etc. 

Thanks so much for reading and any comments would be great. I know I've left myself with an almost impossible task!! "

I'm studying computer science and talked to my boss about becoming a co-op (long-term intern) and he put in a good word for me. Long story short, they created a position for me that will let me keep my full-time position and may even include a pay raise, as well as getting involved with the software side of things. When talking to my husband last night I realized that even though this isn't the first time people have gone out of their way to offer me a great opportunity, it still feels a bit strange to have people laud my accomplishments, to see that I'm smart and capable and worthy of recognition, and to want to reward my efforts. It feels wonderful, but also sad, because it should have been my mother cheering me on. Instead my accomplishments were just an opportunity for her to look good, my failures an obvious ploy to make her look bad. I'm grateful for a husband who encourages me to the best me I can be and who stands beside me whether I fail or succeed, and I'm grateful for coworkers and bosses who do the same. I've been NC with my family for over two years and I've honestly never felt more sure or more proud of myself and what I've done, and I'm looking forward to a long and happy life not worrying about what they think."

6obes1,1,2017-07-19,"Interning at an engineering firm, they offered me a full time position, not sure whether or not to accept.",maxtheobese,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6obes1/interning_at_an_engineering_firm_they_offered_me/,"So I had the oppurtunity to intern at an engineering/contracting company in my home town this summer while I didn't have any classes. I didn't expect anything to come of it except for experience but I apparently have performed well enough for them to want to bring me on full time starting immediately. 

This comes as a surprise as I was expecting to return to school in the fall to continue my education. I'm currently attending a junior college in Orange County with the plan to transfer to a state university next fall for civil engineering, providing I get all of the classes I need. However, if I accepted this offer it would certainly delay this plan, for at least a year, and maybe permanently pending my future performance. 

My boss offered me a starting salary of $17.00 an hour initially, with evaluations every six months that would provide opportunity to get significant raises (pending things such as obtaining certifications, degree, industry knowledge, and overall performance). While a bit lower than what I had expected, considering I have no prior experience, no credentials, and that this was my first legitimate job, 17 an hour to start doesn't seem that bad. 

I'm currently using computer aided design programs such as Revit to design different systems, which is what I was hoping to do after I got my degree anyway. That and the fact that I particularly like all of my coworkers and enjoy my workplace, make me want to accept this offer. 

However, in staying out in my home town and taking this job, in addition to delaying getting my bachelor's degree (I would get an associates even if I took the job, as well as try to get additional certifications), I more than likely would lose all of the financial aid I currently receive towards school.

I don't know if continuing my education and getting a degree years down the road, while obviously beneficial, would be better than getting my foot in the door in a decent company where I have potential for promotion and experience, years ahead of when I would otherwise be joining the workforce. 

Thanks for any help/suggestions!

Since then I've been in weekly therapy from someone that has been in the field over 50 years. I have made strides in controlling my anger and have been able to kick a LOT of my own codependency issues - but still learning every day! After she saw much progress in me, we agreed to ""date"" again, and then decided to stay mutually exclusive for eachother, but keep our distance a bit - akin to starting a new relationship where you just go on a date like once a week and let it slowly mature from there. 

Its been easy to keep our distance, as this summer I have been living 3 hours away at an internship for a very good job, but she's been not having much luck finding work. She's been having trouble just staying cooped up in her apartment all day, and is going crazy just being by herself all the time. She is always the one to make sure we stay with some pretty surface level interactions in order to avoid slipping into our old codependant habits (and ive been doing well now with this as well), but we can still call eachother with our problems and obviously stay with eachother on the weekends. 

Today we had a phone call discussing a 3 day trip we are taking to go to a wolf park in indiana (something shes always wanted to do) to do wildlife photography of wolves. In the call, she told me she ""needed to stop depending on me for everything"" and that she needed to live on her own. When i asked her about what she feels she still depends on me for (and I have been thinking long and hard using my therapy to find something but i mean.. i really dont do anything for her anymore) she just became upset and told me it wasnt a good time. She couldn't give me an answer, but I do not want to assume what for. I am worried that her judgment on her situation may be clouded, and obviously any sort of advice or perspective from me is going to be heavily discounted, so I am at a little bit of a loss as to what to do to help her see that she really has been on her own. Additionally, she said she would come up with a list for me at a later date after I asked.


 Any thoughts, hopefully from an older crowd? Anyone with a background in codependency id appreciate perspective from as well. 

thanks all!

My apartment has transportation to my school so getting to class won't be a problem. I work on campus with campus recreation for about $8.50 an hour and am only able to work about 20 hours or less a week. Not having a car has kept me from finding a better job or internship opportunities because I'm not able to just go anywhere when I want to. I use Uber frequently but they start to add up, especially when any opportunities are usually 30 plus minutes away from my location which would cost 40 dollars round trip!

My problem is getting a cheap car usually comes with other miscellaneous costs, such as up keep and repairs for a car, and also having to budget for gas, but also I would not have to keep this car for very long because I am graduating very soon and I would only need this car to get to a and b until I begin my postgraduate job search and hopefully find a job in my degree field. So I'm wondering if I should stick it out car less or just bite the bullet. Any help advice about purchasing used cars or on what I should do in my situation would be greatly appreciated."
6obz5i,8,2017-07-19,Physics degree regrets and career advice,phythrowaway123,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/6obz5i/physics_degree_regrets_and_career_advice/,"I graduated about two months ago from a decent school with bachelors in both physics and math. Throughout my undergraduate, I did everything that I thought was right to put me on the path towards a physics PhD and a career in academia. I exhausted the majority of my school's undergraduate physics courses as well as some graduate courses. I involved myself in research early, which resulted in two summers of funded work that culminated in a few conference presentations as well as a paper in review with myself as first author. 

However, at the start of my senior year, I started to realize that the future life of academia was not what I wanted, and I opted out of applying to graduate programs. I applied for a few jobs in the Boston area (where I attended school), but ultimately decided that I wanted to be closer to friends and family. So, after I graduated I moved back home to the Mid-Atlantic where I've been trying to start my career. I figured that the skills I had picked up from my degree such as programming in a few languages, general data analysis, mathematical ability, and strong problem solving and research skills would make me a good candidate, but I haven't found this to be true in reality.

Thus far, I've barely been able to get interviews for positions. I was recently rejected from what I felt to be a promising software engineering job on the (very reasonable) basis that they were looking for someone who had more coding experience such as a traditional CS degree. As a result of my struggles, I can't help but think that most of the decisions that I've made over the past four years have been a mistake. 

Searching through job listings it has been hard to find positions that desire bachelors in physics or math--if any positions do want those types of degrees, it's typically at the graduate level or higher. Software engineering, data analysis, and other technical positions that are more common seem to be elusive due to my lack of practical experience that one would get from a more traditional degree or a summer internship. Although I feel like I possess the capacity to quickly learn on the job and be productive in such positions, on paper it's not easy to convince potential employers that that is the case. Since I moved away from where I went to school, I have very few connections to help get my foot in the door, which has resulted in the feeling that most of my applications are simply falling towards an event horizon.

Have any of your been in a position similar to mine and would like to offer me some advice? I don't want to conclude that physics, which I passionately loved throughout undergrad, was a waste of time and a detriment to my future."

6od5cp,5,2017-07-19,"Day 1, I want to cum for my girlfriend",Goal2Cum,pornfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/pornfree/comments/6od5cp/day_1_i_want_to_cum_for_my_girlfriend/,"This post is mainly for me to get some stuff out in the open that I've never been able to get out into the open before. I just found this subreddit today, and I'm really hoping it can help me. I am currently 22 years old, and have been dating my girlfriend for a while. I plan on marrying her. We've had sex a few times now, but I've never been able to cum from it, moreover I've had sex with 4 different girls (including my girlfriend) and have never been able to cum from any of them. I've never cum from sex. 

I found porn pretty early in life (probably like 9 years old), but didn't actually start masturbating until I was probably 14. I was a very socially awkward child, and a lot of things seemed weird to me, but when I finally found masturbation (with porn), I was hooked. I've realistically masturbated once a day to porn since I was 14, so 8 years. The first time I masturbated I did it through my sweatpants, it was sort of just like something I stumbled upon while watching porn, I rubbed myself through my pants, and I came. It was at that point I realized what I was capable of, and how great it felt. I couldn't stop. For the next years I always felt weird touching my penis directly while masturbating, so I continued to do it through loose sweat pants or other random coverings. I don't know what this stems from, it's just something I did and then never stopped. It always felt weird and was almost a turn off to grab my own penis with my bare hand, so I just avoided it. 

This continued for years, never a problem, I'm horny, I masturbate. I was a ""late bloomer"" we'll call it (super socially awkward and couldn't talk to women) and I didn't have my first kiss until I was 21. Luckily this was kind of a break through of sorts for me. I was able to actually talk to women, and be a regular person. Unfortunately, I found my problem with the 3rd girl I kissed, but the first I managed to get to bed with. We were messing around and had discussed beforehand that there would be no sex because she wasn't comfortable doing it having just met me. But things escalated, and I eventually made her orgasm, she then wanted to ""return the favor"" and give me a blowjob, but I couldn't even get hard. I assumed it was just my nerves.

Although, through more times of ""hanging out"" with this girl I realized it wasn't nerves, and I had a problem. This problem eventually led to us ending things. I was able to eventually get hard enough to have sex, but it quickly faded. I wasn't able to cum. The next girl, same thing. Finally the 3rd girl I was able to stay hard enough to have sex for a while, but I couldn't cum. After a while I got frustrated with it, and we just stopped.

Trying to keep this story short-ish, I then met my now girlfriend, and fell in love. The other girls were honestly just hookups and I really never felt much for them. So, logically, this girl had to be different, right? I surely would be able to cum with her, I loved her. Nope. **ALTHOUGH**, before ever having sex, she was able to make me cum from a blowjob, the first time I've ever came from someone other than myself using my own hand. I assumed this would be no problem when we got to sex. But, when we finally attempted sex, no finish for me. I was able to easily stay hard the entire time, this was no problem. To me this was a big improvement, but I just couldn't cum. We tried a few more times that week, but I failed to finish every time. 

I have since realized this has to stem from my porn addiction, as well as my weird way of masturbating. I've tried to make sure I only masturbate with my bare hand, and to go a few days in between every time (failed at the last part) but it was not enough. I need to cut out porn totally, and only masturbate when I'm really horny, and furthermore do it only to the thought of my girlfriend. I think I can finally do this with the help and support of this subreddit. I've bookmarked it, and every time I open my internet I will see the bookmark. I know I can do this, and I know it will be for the best for my relationship. 

My girlfriend and I are currently long distance as she has a summer internship across the country. I will see her 28 days from now, and I really really want to have sex with her again, and finish. She suffers from some self-esteem issues (they stem from way before she met me) and I really want to help her overcome those. But, obviously, this situation has not helped her self-esteem at all. She believes it's her fault. I've explained it isn't her fault, and she says out loud that she knows it isn't. But I know deep down she also thinks it has to do with her. 

I have to fix myself, and I know I can. 28 days from now I see her, and I won't be watching any porn before then. And if I can't cum then, the journey doesn't end. I will keep this up and I will be able to cum for my girlfriend. I want the only person I cum to for the rest of my life to be my girlfriend (future wife), so there will be no more porn in my life forever.

I could say a ton more about this, and probably write ten pages of text with more details, and feelings, and conversations I've had with my girlfriend about this. But that isn't what this is about. I just need to make this post to get it out there, and to be accountable and not relapse. I love my girlfriend, I want to start a family with her one day. I need this help. 

Thank all of you who read this and will help support me, I will support you as well. I've now realized how much damage porn can do and what it can do to your mind. I just hope I'm mentally strong enough to get the work done and make this happen. 

**TL;DR** Can't cum for girlfriend because of porn addiction. I need help and support so I can solve this problem

Back story:

About 6 months ago, I was approached by our big boss and my department head about how they wanted to bring in the brother of the department head who was interested in Android Development as my intern. I was told he knew the basics and that he would be taught more before he would start. I was in a pretty bad place and was struggling to do my job so I agreed an intern would be a good idea, especially one who knows their stuff. Well. When I first met him, he admitted he only half completed the first tutorial assignment he was given by his big brother. So much for being taught stuff. Everything he did was a disaster and he didn't seem to understand any advice or direction I tried to give him. I was checking the messages I sent him and re-read them so many times trying to understand what I was doing wrong. I tried to go for firm but fair but everything I said seemed to go beyond him so I got frustrated. A 5 minute task takes him 3 days and so on and so forth.

After he had worked for us for 4 months, I finally snapped and asked for him to step aside and let me have a quiz for him. Well, I found out he doesn't understand even the basics. It was like hiring a person who knew how to count up to 5 as an accountant. I bottled my rage about the deception and I said I would make it my quest to educate this person about the basics that he does not know. I got in contact with my old teacher and got us a spot in a class that cost around 100 euros to attend for free. Well, on the first day of class, he decides that he doesn't feel like it. I asked if I could at least send him the material and then he could complete the exercises and I could review them and so on and so forth. His answer was ""I'll get back to you on that."" If you don't know something, that's ok, anyone can learn but what really boils my blood is someone who just doesn't want to learn. I cannot work with that. Well, I didn't do the mature thing and talk about it. I kept silently stewing in my unhealthy rage. And then my bosses hire the guy. Fulltime, full developer salary and all. I had to open my mouth. I started by raging at my department head and the guy's big brother that his brother knew less than nothing. Of course he defended his brother, who wouldn't. I was blatantly and 100% wrong to start a fight over a flippant newbie. And then I talked to our boss, who arranged a talk with me, all the bosses and the department head. I very much came off as a stuck up cunt and the guys defended the dude from my vicious bile. Good news is after the mediation he is no longer my responsibility but our department head's. I was also asked by our department head to not talk to his little brother anymore and I agreed. I also apologized for my outburst. Now, I see our department head working more with his little brother. I asked to be included in teaching the kid the basics cause I would like to know how things are going with his education. I was told no. Great. So I'm excommunicated with the intern.



On this episode:
I found a bug that the intern (who is the department head's little brother) made. Easy fix. Max 30 minutes. As I was told not to communicate to the intern anymore I go to his big brother, my department head. Hey, found bug, this is how I found it, this is how to fix it, this needs to be fixed asap so our customers don't have to deal with it. He says that his little brother needs to finish the task he has at hand first. So we argued for 30 minutes wether it would be ok for the intern to stop what he is doing to fix a bug. And apparently it's best to let the customers suffer while the intern is finishing his latest feat - a two day job that's been stretched to 3 weeks already. So it might take a week to fix a bug that we have a solution to, to get done.



So this communication flow isn't working for me.

I need advice. What do I do? I feel like going to the intern and walking him through the steps of fixing this bug but I've been asked to not do that anymore. And he isn't my responsibility. Another thought is to get off of my high horse and clean up after him. But I don't wanna set that precedent that I will clean up after him and pick up his feces and keep my mouth shut. What should I do? 




Tl;dr I'm responsible for the product that only me and the intern are working on but I cannot get through to the intern or his big brother, that's my department head, when I need something done asap. Their Shield of Nepotism blocks my Logical Arguments everytime. What do?"

I thought I've been able to manage my depression pretty well up until now but its recently started to affect me more. I'm a summer intern at a really great company that many other people would love to have the opportunity to work at, but one day I just couldn't get myself to get out of bed. Like I just didn't have the motivation, no matter what I told myself or how much I knew I needed to. It was one of those days when you know the steps you’re supposed to take but you just don’t care. I’m not sure why I even do things like this. Everything in my life looks great on paper but half my time is spent just feeling numb and going through the motions. Anyways  I eventually got it together and showed up to work a few hours late but I told my manager I was in another building working on something for a couple hours.  Of course they found out and probably think I was out late but really I struggle to do anything after work since all of my energy is spent faking appearing normal. I guess I am lucky I can “power through” during the day and actually function but I’m not sure how much longer that will last. I don’t feel this way every day but I skip breakfast and showering many mornings because by the time I’ve mentally prepared myself to get out of bed I have to be to work in 10 minutes, no matter how early I set an alarm. Plus my reputation is tarnished and I don’t want to tell them the truth, if the truth would even change anything. I know I shouldn’t feel embarrassed about it but its just really hard especially when people have such high expectations of you. I guess I just wanted to tell someone about how I’m feeling, I’m really tired of lying every day. I really do appreciate this subreddit and hope everyone is doing okay. If it helps any of you I always try to remember my mom’s mantra (she has depression and has helped me a lot) that “this too shall pass” when I’m feeling like this. "

Since I can't talk about this to anyone, better tell people on the internet, right? 

I'm engaged, my fiancee and I have been in a long distance relationship for a while due to our jobs. Everything has been great, yeah a fight or two, but no couple is perfect. She's not the reason I am typing this, kinda, I guess. 

Every season we get summer interns at my job, usually there is a cute one, but so people can be attractive, what else is new. This season I discovered something new, I have a type, personality and physically, looking back it seems pretty obvious, but I never realized it. My fiancee is not this type, doesn't mean I don't find her attractive, hell would I ask her to marry me if I didn't find her right for me? 

This other girl was shy at first but then we had to work together with some projects and became friends. She's only two years younger than me. After a while I started to feel attracted to her, not just physically but also emotionally. Every time she smiles at me, or laughs at my jokes, or fake yell at each other, or become extremely sarcastic with one another I feel the way I first felt with my fiancee.

I hate that I feel this way, every time it happens I get angry at myself but that doesn't stop it. I know we only have interns for another couple of weeks but I hate feeling this way. I find myself looking forward to seeing her next. 

I feel defective, a horrible finace and person. I know it's affected my relationship, which has only made worse that we recently had a big fight about the wedding venue, that made me seem belittled and mentally violated, I swear my finacee is amazing, we just had a big fight, and I feel like a failure because of it. 

I love my finacee, but I'm falling for someone else. I hate it and myself. I just really needed to talk about this out loud to a bunch of strangers on the internet."
6oe59i,0,2017-07-20,(TL; but please read) PLEASE READ: Sophomore looking for advice,WubbaLubbaDubDub17,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/6oe59i/tl_but_please_read_please_read_sophomore_looking/,"Hi, there! I am a sophomore from Canada (BC).  Last March, some unforeseen events happened on my life and unfortunately I dismiss from my college. Because I am a recipient of a scholarship, I am required to continue my studies ASAP. I really need to continue my studies (NO MATTER WHAT). Recently, I have been trying to get back on track and register again for courses (which fyi is such a pain in the ass, stay at school kids :( ). 

Here comes my issue….Even before all this thing happened, I really don’t know if ChemE is the right choice for me (1st person from my family to study Engineering or related). I really don’t hate my courses, but all of them are quite demanding (you guys know what I am talking about). All my courses consume most of my time and my energy, plus I am investing a lot of money on this degree (you really don’t want to know how much).  I am most certainly not interested in any more formal training from a university (grad school). I know that depending my career choice, I will require for sure more training. I really want to start building my career ASAP. But, as I mentioned, all the courses consume all my life. I barely have time to literally eat and rest for like an hour per day (in fact, I stopped doing a lot of things :( ). I know that the way that ChemE is taught is similar at most colleges, but my school has a very “theoretical” and traditional way to teach that. I think this is because my college is kind of a “prestigious” institution. To be honest, by the end of the degree, I just gonna have the vanilla process engineer degree. 

Moreover, I really require to have my diploma by 2020. I really want to do CO-OP or internships, but right now I don’t think I can manage to do that on the rest of my time here at Canada. So, in few words, I am investing a fucking ton of money (time and my youth?) on a program that I really  don’t know it’s the right call for me and I need to complete my degree by 2020, because not doing so could be really disastrous for me. Sorry for being another complaining bitch, but you know my generation is supposed to be worse than the millennials :)

I really don’t want to make this longer…but if you want to read more: Before starting Engineering, I had the stupid idea that it’s going to be more oriented to the industry and design side. But, honestly, most engineering programs (specially, ChemE) require from you to complete at least 2 years of general “engineering science” training (for ChemE, is even one more year). You only have your last year to really specialize and, let’s be honest, during your last year you most likely are going to take whatever course you can so you can graduate  (and of course, trying to do your capstone project, which for sure it’s going to be so easy…). So, if you don’t manage to enhance your degree by yourself or you, in first place, pick the correction option for you (like a technical program for less money or a more specialized degree at e.g. a polytechnic college); you really are jeopardizing your chances of getting a well-paid? job (as this reddit illustrates). On top of all this, the process itself of passing courses is very demanding (if you get a degree from a serious college, you know what I am talking about; and if it’s easy-peasy for you, go fuck yourself and I sincerely hope you married a fucking gold-digger Kappa). I am not exaggerating by saying what I said: most of the days I end classes by evening (and most classes are useless if you don’t study already the content beforehand), then I have to spend until 1 or 2 am trying to finish assignments and every 2 weeks an exam or a lab. 

In case of any further questions: Changing programs and/or schools is virtually impossible for me. I think that ChemE, even with all the things that I mentioned, is probably the best engineering sector right now (in my dumb opinion, oversaturarion in Computer/Systems and all the other programs are not as versatile as ChemE).  I know that there other programs around Canada that could be more aligned to my situation (like McGill or maybe a 2-year diploma).

- I love that nurse bargaining for the waffle maker. Where is he now I wonder?

- Bailey asking instead of ordering is weird. Also, she said *please*.
- Oh my gosh, George talked a guy into a coma.
- Meth lab baby makes me sad. I could tell you some teacher tales about meth, but I don’t want to bum you guys out.
- Alex talks (and looks like) a tough guy, but man he’s a lightweight. He gets knocked down A LOT.

6oewk5,2,2017-07-20,money in relationships,modch,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6oewk5/money_in_relationships/,"hey reddit,
so I'm dating a 28 year old girl from the US, I myself am 24 from Switzerland (she's studying in Switzerland at my uni). We've had MASSIVE clashes over various things in the past, but the probably biggest and most often recurring issue was money. She told me that she's used to her boyfriends paying for her stuff (she's moved in with all of them in the past, didn't have to pay rent or anything, basically had her life paid for), especially when going out. I, on the other hand, have always gone splits, both when dating and with friends. Of course, it wouldn't be calculated down to the last penny - usually, I/my friends just divide the check by the number of people in the group and everyone chips in, or you alternate in buying rounds of drinks; but the ultimate goal was always to be roughly at equal contributions.

As I said, we've discussed this often (I've known her for about 8 months now, been dating for about 4). To me, it's completely unreasonable why the guy should always pay (given that there's no difference in salary), while for her it's extremely off-putting to have to pay for a guy as a girl. We've had long discussions, and at some point she proposed to share expenses in a 60-40 ratio - again, ridiculous to me; but this kept being in the back of my head. We've tried an app to keep track of expenses (mostly because I was lending her money as she had some issues with her bank account at that time), but she hated itwith all her heart, because to her it made it seem that I wouldn't even spend a single penny on her.

I really don't want to seem tightfisted, because I don't have a problem paying for something small every now and then, like ice cream or coffee or whatever. But she has mentioned a few things that kind of make me feel like I'm sitting on a financial time bomb. In the future, she expects me to get her things, and she's repeatedly given me shit because ""other girls' boyfriends have given them this, haven taken them there, and they all paid for it"". She's proposed to just alternate with the expenses, which would be more or less okay for me - but the 60-40 thing is still ringing in my ears, and the fact that she dropped my phone but announced she's not paying for the repair because it's my phone make me feel like I'm going to get fucked over in this.

Maybe some additional info for the US redditors here: in Switzerland, especially among students, it's absolutely normal and perfectly acceptable to go splits when going out.
Financially, I think both our families would be considered middle class, mine maybe a bit lower - the difference mostly being that she seemed to have gotten many things in the past from her parents (high standard of living), while I mostly had to work for it myself. Personally, I'm doing an internship for the summer that does not pay well (it would just about cover rent and food), she'll be starting an internship in a bit for half a year that apparently pays quite a bit more, but her salary's confidential (but according to her significantly higher than mine).

The whole alternating with expenses thing is now on some sort of a trial period for a month, but I already have a bad feeling about it, and I'm scared this will make the relationship impossible in the future - not so much while we're students (she's slowly understanding that), but especially once we'll graduate (probably me first). Please give me your thoughts reddit, I'm anxious to hear them :)

6ofs2r,2,2017-07-20,The art of Overwatch,TheHackerTheory,Overwatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/6ofs2r/the_art_of_overwatch/,"*Considering back in the forums, people are talking about the usual problems, I wanted to talk about a particular aspect of Overwatch I thought was pretty dang interesting: the art. This was posted on the forum but was quickly buried with other threads*


The art of Overwatch is something I absolutely adore. From the vibrant environments to the characters themselves, Overwatch really stands out in an FPS in regards to the artstyle, especially when you compare Overwatch to games that tend to lend itself to a more realistic artstyle like COD, Battlefield, Destiny, and Rainbow Six Siege. The maps in Overwatch are really interesting and are of places I'd never would have thought of having an actual map of combat in. Route 66, for example, is a map I'd never even consider being a place that would be great to have in an FPS. Normally, developers would lend themselves towards more safer areas, like the moon (Horizon Lunar Colony) or in a city (King's Row). That's not bad, but it's interesting to see that with the proper creative knowledge and team, you can make anything happen. Overwatch has its own, interesting style that is somewhat similar to Team Fortress 2, and I think that's pretty awesome not just for aesthetics, but also for gameplay purposes too.

For example, in Team Fortress 2, the developers specifically designed their characters in such a way that, even in the midst of darkness, you would be able to distinguish what class you're looking at by looking at their silhouette. The same can be said for Overwatch too. It's very easy to do the same in Overwatch as well. For example, it would be easy to distinguish Reaper from Soldier, or Roadhog from D.Va. These things are especially important in a fast paced game like Overwatch, where information is constantly being fed to you, althought you don't have to worry too much about this because the game makes it easier for the player to see enemy players easier by wrapping them with a red outline. The character designs as well, tell a lot about the character's personality or backstory. For example: You can see Soldier: 76's eye and understand that he's been through some tough times, same with Ana with her eyepatch. You could see Lucio, and how he constantly bobs his head to the rhythm of the music he's listening to, which tells you that Lucio has a carefree attitude.

Sound also plays a very important role in the game as well; footsteps being one of - if not the most - important aspects about a character, from a gameplay standpoint. You could listen to the chains and heavy footsteps from an incoming roadhog, or the energy-esque grinding coming from Lucio's skating. Sound is also underappreciated in Overwatch, I think, because you're so focused in the gameplay that you don't really take the time to listen to all the beeps and boops coming from computers in rooms you rarely, or may never actually take advantage of in a realtime situation. During the Sombra ARG, I took the time to walk around Dorado as Bastion, and while I was walking around I was able to hear not only Bastion's footsteps, you could also hear the environment around you, from the Escort truck running, to the sounds of people conversing upon entering the Market square. You can hear bells and the sound of crickets, and as you approach the Lumerico building, you begin to hear electrical lines and running servers. Upon entering you can hear... nothing. Just the sound of the faint wind, crickets and buzzes and hums, as if the building was long abandoned. Finally, when you approach the end of the point, you can hear the sounds of monitors, health packs (yes, health packs make noise, or rather the device they rest on does) and then finally reaching the end of the point, you hear the generators upon you with slight electrical sounds. You still hear the cold, faint wind.

All in all, I just really love gushing about the art in Overwatch, I think it's rad, the way things look in this game. If I wasn't especially lazy today I'd make a video going into more detail, but I thought making a post was a bit easier, and would shake up the forums a little bit, seeing as everyone's frustrated about the meta currently and the balance changes we had recently. I'm currently in school, going for my BA in Game Design Development with a focus on 3D Modeling and Animation, so naturally I was super interested in the way Overwatch dealt with their characters, environments and sounds. I'd like to intern for Blizzard one day or even work for them, that'd be a dream.

**TL;DR The art in Overwatch is pretty rad and we should give love to the art team for making such a beautiful and living world.**"

I'm feeling really frisky this morning, so I thought I'd give you a choice of some things that have really been turning me on lately. 

1.) This one has an interracial flavor. I've been really into this guy on the website Blacked, named Julio Gomez. He plays a rapper or something called ""Brake"", and his cock is absolutely beautiful. It got me thinking it would be super hot to be a new employee or even an intern at a record label, and I was told by my boss to escort this new rapper we just signed from his hotel to the recording studio, and I'm told to make sure he's ""very comfortable"". You can fill in the rest ;)

2.) Kind of similar to the above, but this one feeds my fetish of being with an overdeveloped, oversexed, much younger guy. In this, I'd play a bit older than I really am, so I'd be about 30 or so. I'm the wife of the high school football coach, and my husband asks me to pay some ""special attention"" to you, the star quarterback, to make sure you're focused and not distracted. It ends up going too far, with me unable to control myself around you. The other end for this, would be you always would check me out at games, and then eventually in the locker room, you seduce me.

3.) The co-ed sauna. In this fantasy, my boyfriend and I try out a co-ed spa. We get undressed, wrap our towels around each other, and go into the sauna. After sitting in there for a while with not many other people, a huge muscular guy walks in. He sits down, and his towel starts to come unwrapped. We both notice his huge, thick, floppy cock is just sitting out for all to see, and I can't take my eyes off it. What happens after that we can work out, but I'd like it to end with my boyfriend being cuckolded in public by this complete stranger.


I hope some of those interest you!! My name is Jess. I'm 20, and I have brown hair and white skin. I have 34D breasts, a slim waist, and a big butt ;). If you're cool, I can send you pics as a visual. 
My kinks are cheating, big cocks, dominant men, public nudity, hypersexuality, and I can even be into some incest stuff. Hard limits are death, gore, and bathroom stuff.

Hope to hear from you!

6oh0ar,7,2017-07-20,"Is this what the typical ""9-5"" job is actually like?",blackperformance,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/6oh0ar/is_this_what_the_typical_95_job_is_actually_like/,"So I'm a University student studying Computer Science and Mathematics. And I was extremely lucky to get a 3 month summer internship as a software developer in a Health Consultant and Research Company. Taking into account I'm only 17 and just rounded up my first year of college at the end of May. I have worked in a garage before as well as a cleaner. But those were just for short stints of time, around 3 months. And the work in the garage was only during weekends.

So I was pretty psyched for this internship as it was also in my field of study. So I started about 6 weeks ago and initially things were a bit slow as I was being caught up as to what I would be doing and working on. The team that I work with is a small team of about 10 people within the company. After I sat in on a few meetings and was shown what I had to do, I began to get the hang of things and I was learning a lot. But as time went on, I feel like something is missing but I'm not sure what exactly. But here's a few things that I thought might have caused it:

1.No Friends- The company within which I'm working is situated in my Country of Birth and not my country of residence.I haven't lived here in 8 years, so I don't have any friends here except my cousin. Although there are other interns in my department but not my team, they are all 4 or more years older than me. And although we crack jokes and make small talk in the office, our friendship ends outside the office. Only person whom I really hang out with is my cousin(He's 21) and his friends.

2.Boredom-I'm not really bored at work, most days I find that time goes too quickly and I haven't done as much as I would like. The actual work itself wouldn't be my first pick in terms of a job but it's pretty interesting at times. My Boss is pretty chill same with most of my team. Sometimes I just feel myself straying from work though, like right now. 

My average day involves me leaving home at around 7:15am, Getting to work by 8am, working until around 1pm or 2pm where I go to a local diner for lunch. I'm usually at lunch for about half an hour. I come back and round up around 5. Usually go to my Aunt's office, wait for her to round up. We go pick up my cousin and then we are usually home by 7pm. I eat, watch netflix or something, attempt to continue with my hobbies, go to bed around midnight.
Weekends usually consist of myself and my cousin going out or hanging out with his friends which I quite like.

I thought maybe its the repetitiveness that I didn't like, but I've been doing repetitive days in college for the past year.
I also find that the weekend isn't long enough anymore, the weekdays go by pretty fast but the weekends seem a lot faster. 
When I started college and was researching careers, I was more drawn towards work in research, being a professor or working in a small startup. This experience seems to push me further in those directions. Maybe I'm young and just don't fully know what I want yet.

Anyway have any of you had similar experiences? 
What were your first jobs/internships like?
Do you think there's anything I can do about my situation, I'm pretty limited?"
6oh53q,3,2017-07-20,"18-year-old intern crushing on a +30-year-old employee, what do I do? I'm lost",Thr8wingThisAway,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/6oh53q/18yearold_intern_crushing_on_a_30yearold_employee/,"Good morning/afternoon/evening.

I don't really know where to post this, I've been more of a ghost on Reddit than anything else, and I feel like this post is too unimportant to go into a more advice-focused subreddit, so here it goes.

A bit of background (true story starts at “here's where shit's up there…”, skip if you wish). I turned 18 a few months ago, study in an engineering school, and am currently doing an internship (it's a manual work experience, which is a part of the school curriculum). I'll add some things about my personality and physical appearance as it may influence some things. I appear androgynous (I'm actually a trans dude who should start hormones in a few months…), have a rocker/metalhead/punkish/goth/emo/visual-kei while still casual clothing style. I'm reserved, introverted, very calm, poker-faced, serious and polite, but I'm also that terrible provocative dirty-minded bastard who gets his rock off when he makes you react. Regarding my appearance, I suppose I'm quite attractive to some people simply because of I don't have too much of an ugly face and my clothing style appeals to them, otherwise I don't think people find me too nice-looking (or at least, my look) as I know I don't look very approachable or friendly.

Relationship-wise, I've been fucked-up from the get-go and I doubt it'll ever get all conventional. Just to say a very few things, I generally loath romance and need a kind of power dynamic (as in, “I provoke you, you provoke me back, etc, until shit hits the fan”), but cannot stand controlling someone's life or vice-versa. I'm gay, and a switch (as in, mostly a 'submissive' without a submissive attitude, given I'll never shut my mouth and will continue shit-talking you, provoking you, and wouldn't mind from time to time if you didn't manage to tame me, thus making me in control). I'm very sensual/sensuous, literally: while I generally hate human contact, I sometimes (depending on the person?) *love* being touched, caressed in a purely sensual – or erotic – manner and vice-versa, without it necessarily leading to sexual thoughts (it can though). I can't see myself doing one-night stands with strangers, or having sex friends. It didn't prevent me from screwing a guy only once, though I had hopes of more (in the end, the fact that I'm a dude and act like it despite my current body made him recoil after seeing me once). Three partners in total: said guy and another one with whom it was non-sexual a few months ago, and my *cousin* a few *years* ago (shit happens). I don't “date”. Either it's a mutual 'serious' relationship, or maybe I could actually do a purely physical thing (I don't have much experience, heh). Regarding my attraction, I'm very rarely attracted to someone, and they don't have to have a pretty face for me to be attracted to them. I know for a fact that certain physical traits immediately have me fawning, without caring about that person's personality, but I'm starting to think that maybe there's also a personality trait I'm attracted to…

I've started my internship last week, and still have two weeks left (not counting the current one). Everything's all good, I have to say I got it thanks to my father who's a close friend to the manager, and my parents know a few people working there (but I haven't told them, so I'm just a regular intern for them). I should add that most people see me as a girl there, the manager put me in the women's locker room when I arrived, and while I don't suddenly go into the women's toilets, speak in a feminine manner, or changed my first name to a female one, I didn't correct them (as it's work and I don't want to be a bother…). Also, I'm not wearing my usual clothing style you either love or hate: no accessories, old jeans and t-shirts that I don't care about (there's just my long and gray hair which is very much the same as always…).

Here's where shit's up there all over the fan and walls: I'm eff-ing crushing on a employee (who seems like he has a bit of responsibility in his job – it's a supermarket by the way), who's more than thirty years old, who's not that good-looking, who I haven't spoken much at all (I don't know, maybe three minutes in total?). Thinking about it, that's probably his kind-of provocative demeanor, or smirk I've sometimes (okay… maybe twice, haha) seen him address me. Once (only once!), there was a small box with some very random things in there, I remember there was dog's food (IIRC) for instance and other things you'll find in a supermarket, and he just casually told me “what's that, 's that yours?”. This morning, he asked me about some packs on the floor, if they should be put back in the storehouse, and answered me “all right, no problem, it was just to check :)” when I replied. *Anyway*, forgive the boredom, enough about my cheesy memories.

I know I shouldn't do anything, as he's probably not interested at all, maybe he's even married and has kids (I'll have to admit I don't get that impression at all from him), his age's the double of mine, I don't want anything serious (I mean, I don't see myself living my life with a guy who's like 14-16 years older than me. And as I said, I don't date or do one-time things, so being with someone should mean to me that I *could* imagine them ending up being my lifetime partner. It should…). He's never addressed me as either a girl or a boy, so I don't even know how he sees me, and he knows nothing about me, there's not my usual pretty flamboyant appearance clothing-wise to give people a quick look of my overall persona (and which can apparently be a seduction tool, haha). The first time I saw him when my manager told him to give me some work, he was very nice, ask me about my presence here, told me a bit about him (well, just that he passed a degree in 2001 (that's how I guessed his age)). At the beginning of this week, he asked me if I was fine working here, if that wasn't too boring or anything. He *is* nice.

Maybe I'll just forget about him when my internship ends. That's very likely, I reckon. I mean, that's how crushes usually end, and while it has happen very rarely to me, I'm no different from anyone on that regard. So why bother making a move, when there's so few chances anything could happen, and I don't even know what I'd want out of it. Just a one-time fuck? Yeah, fine (for other reasons, too. Having my first 'real' full intercourse with someone in an unconventional manner is what I want). A… physically intimate, sensual and sexual, relationship? Maybe. I only know that I want some physical contact.

I'm at a loss, for a change. Reason tells me to just wait until the internship ends, and this feeling will end with it too. Now, passion tells me to *do something*. If, by any miserable chance, he is at least a little bit interested, I doubt he'd do anything considering his much older than me, we're at work, I'm a young uni student who's got all his life in front of him, who doesn't look too bad and thus shouldn't be desperate. Consequently, if anything happens one day, I guess it'd be *my* doing. But what, how, when? After I'm done with the internship? I wouldn't want to jeopardize anything for me or him job-wise while I'm still working in the same place (though we're both over the age of majority). And what do I even tell him? “I want you/your touch” is what would work best, as cringy as it sounds, but it's not like I can actually explain what I exactly want as I don't even know, and as I could enjoy completely different things.

I hope it's understandable, it's difficult explaining stuff which is totally unclear in my own head. Feel free to tell me if something's not well-explained. *sweats* I don't have anyone to talk to about this apart from my best friend. I'll be very thankful for any advice, thought, reaction, whether it be a one-liner “let go” or a full paragraph of how I could make things advance in any direction. Also, if you know any subreddit in which I could eventually crosspost this, it could be nice as I don't wish to post that stupid idiocy in a subreddit where it would bother people.

Oh, I'm French by the way. Apologies for any mistakes English-wise.

**TL;DR:** I'm 18, crushing on a +30-year-old guy, he's an employee in the supermarket who took me on for a 4-week internship. We don't talk much. Do I make a move, during or after my internship, or do I just let go?

**Edit:** I forgot to say that guessing his actual age really surprised as I thought he'd be younger, and I'm not at all into older people (it's fine up to ~25 years old). That's a first."
6oh6go,126,2017-07-20,I recovered from an Eating Disorder.,livingforbutterflies,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6oh6go/i_recovered_from_an_eating_disorder/,"When I was 16, I developed the mental illness anorexia. When I was 18, my illness progressed into severe bulimia, impacting my life to such an extent that I dropped out of school to enter into an in-patient psychiatric program. I left against medical advice six months into my treatment. I remember the look on my doctor’s face as I signed the paperwork, as he told me if I continued down the path that I was on, I wouldn’t make it to see my 30th birthday. 

I struggled with the eating disorder for another two years after that, with that conversation tucked in the back of my mind. I remember waking up everyday, looking at myself in the mirror, and deciding that my life was meaningless, and that if I wound up killing myself, the world would be a better place. 

At 21, after years of feeling lost, I started thinking differently. I reconnected with my friends and family, and started letting in feelings of hope again. I worked with them to rebuild their trust in me, and create new bonds. I slowly began constructing a life worth living, with the end goal in mind that I might be able to use the experience that I had to make something beautiful instead of wasting away into nothing.

It hasn’t been easy. It’s been the exact opposite. It’s been hard, messy, confusing, filled with curve balls that knocked me flat out, wondering if there was ever going to be another side. There’s been a few moments where I look in the mirror and see that scared, lost teenager looking back, wondering if anything matters or means anything.

But for every one of those moments, there’s a butterfly on a flower. There’s making a friend laugh until they cry. There’s soft cats, goofy dogs, great movies, books that grab at my heartstrings, the feel of my mother’s hand on my back while we cook together and my sister poking me in the ribs and telling me I’m the most annoying older sister on the planet with so much love in her voice it makes me tear up. There’s warm tea and great new music. There’s runs that make me feel like I’ve set my soul on fire. There’s so much life, and so much love.

And in the past two months- I’ve done it. 

I graduated Summa Cum Laude with my Bachelor’s Degree in Social Work. I went to Europe for the first time, ate a croissant on my way to see the Mona Lisa, cried at the Sistine Chapel; had pizza outside of the Colosseum. I started my Advanced Standing Master’s Degree in Social Work, at an internship that will act as a springboard into eating disorder policy. I spend every day making life a tiny bit better for the people who need it the most.

I just turned 28, and have every intention of hitting 30 and beyond. I’m loved, by myself and the people around me. I’m lucky. And I’m damned proud.

6oi2gf,12,2017-07-20,[Plan]Road to my prime,stillprime,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/6oi2gf/planroad_to_my_prime/,"Hello all,

I am a 22 yr old male who like most of people on this subreddit, wants to better myself through the dull vague habit of discipline.  Something im proud of about myself is my reputable internship that is directly related to the field I want to work in for a career. However, there are other areas of life I would like to improve on as I enter my prime.  This is my 5 year plan of habits and techniques to help me be where I want to be at age 27.

1)Eating Clean.  Currently eat a lot of fast food, chips, lots of energy drinks, etc.  New plan will be a keteogenic diet for the reasons of constant sustained energy, vegetables, and improved focus.  Water only during the weekdays.(for now)

2. Meditate.  Reason because i find it alarming how many days ill just skip this excercise because i find it to boring and anxy to just lay down and do nothing for 20 min.  Even though I waste a lot of time distracting/stimulating myself with stupid shit on the internet.  Since I cannot comfortably relax and be calm this is of high priority on list.  

3)Cold Showers.  I've messed around with cold showers before and have felt the benefits of increased alertness throughout the day.  Only drawback is ill be cold for 5-10 minutes of the day.

4)Workout.  Dont have to go to the gym but need to for sure do some type of exercise to keep my body as healthy as it can be.

5)Brush my teeth.  This should be second nature, but is not.  Many days i have skipped on brushing my teeth and Ill be the first to say my teeth aren't white.  Same reason as meditation I'll get to lazy to get out of bed when i forget to brush them before going to sleep.  

6)7-8 hours of sleep every night.  I frequently pull all nighters with the justification of my schedule is to busy and i need to.  In reality thats just what I tell myself to feel better.  They are really a result of poor time management and procrastination.  With a full nights rest I will be able to work more efficiently.

7)4 hours of school work minimum everyday.  1 hour = 50 min work &amp; 10 min break.  I know myself and will not be able to commit to 4 hours non stop.  Baby steps

8)Seek help when help or advice is needed.  If i need advice I will post it on here.  If I change plans, I will post it on here for second opinions.  This will be the same for whatever im doing.  Need help in school, go to office hours(never been).  Need help at work, ask coworkers.  Fear of asking for help has for sure kept me from being at my top.

Thats all I want to focus on now.  There are many more things I want to add to the list but kept them off in order to not overwhelm myself.  Need to think long term and looking at this list there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to install these habits.  This afterall is a 5 year plan not a 30 day plan.

“Of course, my love,” he smiled turning to her as she rested in the hospice bed, the brain beneath her graying hairs being eaten away by Alzheimer’s.

&amp;nbsp;

  
   *I had just transferred to Cedar Grove High School our junior year. You were happily dating Michael Graham, the school quarterback. We had homeroom together and you sat down next to me. You seemed disinterested, but I decided to talk to you anyways. I said “hey,” and you turned to me and smiled. We started talking for a while; it was going well, so well in fact, that we missed the bell and talked through a whole class period without realizing it. I saw you every day from then on out. We would study together, get lunch together, and go to parties together. I realized after not too long that I liked you, but I was still the side project; you loved Michael.*  

&amp;nbsp;
  
“I don’t remember Michael,” she said.

“That’s okay, there’s a lot you don’t remember,” he replied.

“What happened with you?”  she asked.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
  
 *Our senior year, I was seeing less and less of you. Michael, you said, was hurt that you were spending so much time with me. We still hung out though, and one evening during finals, you and I were sitting together in the library. We were studying for our Chemistry exam, trying to find out the difference between sigma and pi bonds. You started telling me about Michael, about how you were falling out of love with him. You told me that you’d rather spend time with me, even if it hurt Michael.* 
  
*You were inching towards me as I started to say something, but I stopped when your lips met mine. After a second, I reeled back, stammering about Michael. You told me that he didn’t matter; he was going across the country to play football at USC, and you were going to stay in-state. I sighed and told you that I was going to school in Maine, that you wouldn’t see me either. You smiled and told me that you knew, but that we had all summer to figure things out.*
  
 *We dated over the summer, but it didn’t last. We ended up going our separate ways through college, but you never left my mind.*  

&amp;nbsp;


“Then how did you find me?” she asked.

The man sighed and continued the story.  

&amp;nbsp;


   *It was three years after graduating college. I was at law school in Atlanta. I was in a coffee shop when I saw you. I had to do a double-take, because I wasn’t sure if it was you, but it was. I came up to you as you waited for your coffee. When you saw me, your eyes grew wide. I came up to you and asked if you wanted to take a seat. You told me that you would love to. We spent the whole afternoon talking. You were an intern at the Emory University Hospital, the same university I was studying law at. We lived only a few blocks away from each other. Eventually, you had to leave for your shift, but we made plans to see each other that weekend.* 
 
  *We went out that night, the next, and the next – we dated for two years. One summer, I took you to Hawaii, you had always wanted to go.*  

&amp;nbsp;


“I remember talking about that in High School,” she said, managing a smile.

“Yes, you talked a lot about it with Michael,” he said.  

&amp;nbsp;


   *On our fourth night there, we got to the top of Mauna Kea and I proposed under the starlight. We got married five months after that and bought a house together.* 
 
  *A year into our marriage, you told me that you were pregnant. You were worried at first, but we eased into it. He was born in August and we named him Calvin. Calvin was a hassle to deal with, so we decided that a second child would not be on the table. You got your tubes tied, and I got a vasectomy; one kid, we were sure, was good enough, and we would never want another.*   

&amp;nbsp;


“Where is Calvin?” she asked.

“He’s been spending a lot of time with me,” he said.  

&amp;nbsp;


   *One night after Calvin’s fifth birthday, I was working at the kitchen table when I thought I heard something upstairs, but I decided to ignore it. Another muffled noise came from upstairs and I got worried. I took a knife from the kitchen and went upstairs. I checked our room, but you were asleep in bed. I ran into Calvin’s room and saw the figure. He was shrouded by night, the moonlight in the window only lighting enough so I could see Calvin writhing in the man’s arms. The man growled at me and began to walk forward. I pointed my knife at him and ordered him to drop the boy.*
 
  *You came running in when you heard me. I told you to call the police. I turned to the man again as you ran to the phone. He was staring past me, mesmerized; he murmured about his “love.” I growled at him again to drop Calvin. The man snapped out of his trance and looked at me. I knew who it was. Every chiseled detail of his face sent shivers down my spine. It was Michael – your ex.* 
 
 *I told him to drop Calvin again, calling Michael out by name this time. I started coming closer with my knife. He pulled a gun on me, but I kept coming closer; I thought that Michael didn’t have the guts to pull the trigger. I was wrong. He shot me point blank in the chest and bolted out the window as I fell to the ground, the world fading around me. Your shriek echoed in my head as if in a dream. I heard muffled sirens and footsteps running up the steps. I barely heard you call my name as you ran towards me, my vision fading. Then, I was hit by blackness.*
  
 *I don’t remember waking up; I don’t know how long I was gone for – it seemed like forever.*  

&amp;nbsp;


“But did you wake up?” she asked.

“I never fell asleep,” he replied.  

&amp;nbsp;


  
 *You cried as you spoke about what had happened. Michael, as it turned out, was too hurt to get over you. He followed you around for years after the breakup and couldn’t handle the fact that you had kid with someone else. When the police searched his home, they found stacks of pictures and journals of and about you. The breakup had been too much for him.*  

&amp;nbsp;
  
“He sounds troubled,” she said.

“He was troubled – and hurt,” he agreed.  

&amp;nbsp;


   *You spent the next few years trying to find Michael and Calvin. The police never found Michael; he was hiding, probably in plain sight. But when they did find Calvin, your greatest fears were realized – he was dead; your family was dead.*
 
  *That trauma might have been the trigger; I’m not sure, but that’s when the symptoms started. Your memory seemed to be fading. It started with simple things, like keys, but then you forgot my name. That’s when you went to the doctor. They said that you had early onset Alzheimer’s and that your memory would be gone by age fifty.* 
 
  *You made due for a while; your memory loss lessened the grief of losing them. You seemed not to notice me as much, forgetting who I was. I tried to tell you about our times together in high school, but you couldn’t understand. You moved here after a few years, once your memory was too far gone.* 
 
  *I come to visit once in a while when the place is less crowded. And, so, here I am.*  

&amp;nbsp;


   As he finished the story, he kissed her on her forehead, the hairs on his chiseled chin brushing against her face. 
   
He began to leave the room, putting on his coat and pocketing his wallet. 
  
 As he was leaving, she called back to him, “Tell me the story again, Mark; I’ve forgotten.”
  
 “Of course, my love,” he sighed. 
   
As he turned back to her, his wallet fell face up on the floor, his ID glaring up at him, his name written in big bold letters, screaming across the top of it: MICHAEL FRANKLIN GRAHAM."

I am a twenty year old college student who is trying to apply for my first credit card. I am already an authorized user on two of parents cards. This has been very helpful up until this point because it has boosted my credit score by a lot. However, I believe it is going to be impossible to apply for my own credit card at this point because I already have too much credit(and have been declined twice already). My yearly income(from an internship) is less than $10k, but according to my credit reports ""I"" have access to seventy something thousand in credit and am spending like $30k+ a year. In reality, this is just my family's normal spending habits.

I've read that I can declare their income on applications once I turn 21(since they pay those bills), but is there anything I can do before then?

Thank you!"

I know you weren't the only parent concerned over a coed sleepover at 14 years old. But I assured you all I would chaperone it all, and that it would mean so much for my daughter if all her friends could be here! 

As soon as the last kid is dropped off, I lock the door and look at them all in the living room. ""Back in a sec!"" I say before running upstairs. I change from jeans and a tshirt into black stockings and a garter belt with a fishnet top, revealing my big freckled tits. I grab my laptop, HD Webcam and big duffle bag full of toys and run back downstairs. The looks on on their faces is enough to get my pussy literal dripping wet, I can feel my juices running down my stockings. ""Ok guys, who wants to be intern famous??"" 

Obviously my biggest kinks are lingerie, and sex tapes. Not so obvious are my kinks of cum play, group sex, messy sex, face sitting, bi boys, anal, and maybe even blackmail. Ideally it'd be us two just describing the scene of a bunch of 14 year olds going fucking nuts on each other, and especially me! What do you think?"

I work at a company as IT,24 years old as of tomorrow, and have my bachelors in MIS and a decent background with an IT internship. I came back from lunch today and my boss asked me if I was going to be at work tomorrow for lunch and implied that I was going to be available. I have a strong feeling I will be randomly drug tested, what can I do? I am already looking at my resume and have enough money to last about 2 months in my apartment with rent/utilities. I'm also going to be running a lot after work this evening on the ecliptical and drinking water, will take a multi-vitamin (lots of b12 in it) and preparing for tomorrow as best I can. I'm also searching jobs in the area but for some clarification, I live in Oklahoma which is super strong in religious aspects. My theory is that I can work out and run enough to burn the amount of THC out of my body with proper exercise for a strong 2-3 weeks (180 lb 6'5 guy).  

What else am I missing and what else can I do to bounce back/recover?

Though I haven't posted before this, I spent a lot of time on this board finding information that helped me decide to go back to school for Accounting. Short background: Bachelor's in Biochemistry, worked for a few years, realized it wasn't for me. My school has MS-Accounting program for students like this, and there are just a handful of pre-req classes I need to take before starting the master's program. I just finished the Intro to Accounting class and will finish the other pre-reqs (Intermediate, Income Tax I, Bus Law) this fall.

Now my dilemma. I had originally planned on working (non-accounting job unless I can find one)/taking the GMAT in the Spring of '18 and then doing the grad program Summer/Fall/Fall '19 with a Spring '19 internship in between. Today the program advisor suggested starting the master's Spring '18 and finishing in Fall of '18. This would leave no time for an internship however.

My end goal is to work for a Top 10 public company and be a CPA. Would I be better off with my original plan of finding an internship and completing the program December 2019 or not looking for an internship but finishing school a year earlier? I'm worried with no accounting experience I would have a tough time landing a job even if I am CPA eligible. "
6ojhv5,1,2017-07-20,How to get over trust issues after being cheated on and being in a new relationship?,SandmanTF131,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ojhv5/how_to_get_over_trust_issues_after_being_cheated/,"So i've always been a pretty trusting guy when it comes to relationships. I didn't mind my girlfriends having guy friends they hung out with a lot or anything like that, because I never thought I needed to. That was, up until spring semester of this year, when a girl who I thought I was in love with and who said she was in love with me ended up cheating on me behind my back for 2 weeks before I found out, coincidentally with one of those guy friends.

I never saw it coming, and it sucked major ass. I broke up with her on the spot, did all the things you're supposed to, ignored her pleads for chances to explain, all that jazz. Then I moved on. Or at least, thought I did.

I met a fine gal on Tinder in June, without really expecting to. Super intelligent, funny, and just easy to talk to. She's super into fishing, hunting and outdoors, which as a guy i've always wanted to get into, but growing up in the city with parents that had office jobs I never really did. That will be relevant later.

Anywho, so we hit it off big time. After only talking for about a month we ended up deciding we wanted to make it a legitimate relationship... right before she moved to Alaska for 2 and a half months for an internship at a salmon hatchery. She got the internship when we were talking and was so super excited I couldn't help but be excited for her. But, spending literally the first 2 and a half months 3,000 miles away from each other is harder than I naively expected it to be; especially given she can only text/call part of the day, and service is spotty at best.

So we've been talking when we can, but I notice sometimes I feel way clingier than I ever have in the past, like I constantly need her to affirm she still wants to be in a relationship with me. I fight these urges best I can, but sometimes I get into a funk and have to put on a fake positive attitude, cause I feel like if I express that to her she'll think i'm clingy and attention-seeking. I also am constantly worried she's cheating.

Hear me out, this girl is super sweet and has never given me any inclination not to trust her. But she is in Alaska for 2 and a half months with 4 other 20 something guys that have the same passion she does, while i'm the only 20 year old white guy in the state of Texas that has never been fishing or hunting. I didnt think being cheated on screwed me up too bad, but I'm starting to realize that it may have. For instance, the other day she didnt text all day, presumably because she was busy working. Then the next day she just says ""sorry! I was crab fishing with Adam"". 

Which shouldn't bother me, I know. She's just having fun doing what she loves. But it just does bother me. Consciously, I want her to be out enjoying her time there and doing what she loves, but at the same time I get bitter and think things like ""she's out fishing with that handsome dude cause she'd rather be out with him instead of talking to you, he has more in common with her and she'll see that. And its a constant battle. I want to be positive and supporting of her time there, but i'm fighting not to feel doubtful of her commitment to our relationship, and the relationship is so new I feel awkward bringing it up.

So I guess my question is, where do I go from here? Does anyone have any advice on how I can improve my self confidence and trust her more? I've never really had self confidence/trust issues before now, so this is all new and i'm trying to find the best way to handle this without pushing her away, because obviously I want the relationship to work and be healthy.

Thanks in advance for the help, and if anyone wants any more details i'm happy to share, within reason! Just ask.

TL;DR, was cheated on previously, has led to distrust and attention-seeking issues. Any advice on how to move past this in my new relationship?"
6ok4md,6,2017-07-20,I realized two days ago I am an abuser in my relationship. I almost killed myself. Now I don't know what to do.,IYellAtEveryone,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6ok4md/i_realized_two_days_ago_i_am_an_abuser_in_my/,"Hello,

I apologize if this is a long read, or if it's a bit all over the place. I'll preface this by saying I don't think I will commit suicide in the near future. I have talked with some friends when it was really bad two days ago, but for now I've taken the decision to keep on living.

I don't really know where to start. I've talked to some close friends the last days - basically alternated between talking to people and crying, sometimes doing both of those activities -. Tuesday night, my girlfriend and I were both drunk at a party, and at some point, we started fighting on something basically pointless. I left a bit to try and cool down, she came to try to talk to me. We kept on fighting until eventually we hit each other. (This is a ""long story short"", but I don't really want to get into details that won't be really precise, but I can give more info in comments if you like; the short story is that I'm pretty much the one that got angrier and angrier, and my gf was basically just answering to that). The end result is that she had an open lip, that got patched up the next day but will probably leave a scar, and I have a couple bruises but nothing serious.

However, this made me realize that I have huge anger issues that I can't control. In my relationship, this is not the first time we got physical with each other, and in almost every case it was basically entirely my own fault (and I'm not saying this to discharge her; most of the time, it'd be a case of me getting angry over a stupid detail, then her starting to also get angry because I'm angry over nothing, then me having some violent movements - not really ""hitting her"", more like being annoyed and waving my arms in frustration, or throwing some objects to take my anger on them -, then sometimes it'd keep on escalating until we were physically affronting each other).

If I take more specific examples than I remember vividly and basically make me cry everytime I have to remind them: I remember her shutting down and starting just ignoring me while lying down because she was tired of yelling and getting yelled at for 30 mins, then me shaking her by the arm because I was begging her to answer and to talk to me. The next day she had bruises over her arm. I remember begging her not to leave the argument one time when she wanted to go for a walk - I was extremely stupid - and getting in front of the front door so she wouldn't leave; she tried to push me away and we both ended up bruised. I remember her being extremely mean with me during an argument so instead of walking out I ended up trying to cover her mouth by force so she would stop saying all these things; again, I ended up bruising her.

I also accidentally broke her nose once (you almost can't see it, however there was a lot of blood afterwards and we both felt like shit for days) when I tried to push her away when trying to leave an argument and the appartment to take a walk. She was a bit constraining me and didn't want to let go and I was really mad and really wanted to go so we wouldn't hurt each other so I tried to push her away; combining my natural clumsiness - I'm extremely clumsy, actually diagnosed with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_coordination_disorder - with my anger lead to me actually missing her shoulder and hitting her in the face, in the nose actually, which lead to the broken nose in question.

At the time I felt like shit but, I don't know why, didn't manage to put in words that the issue was my anger and that I was abusing her.

Another thing I have to mention is that it's not a problem that only appears with my gf. I had a long time to take a good look at myself these last days, and realized I have always been very violent and agressive, which I tend to put in the same word of 'violence' in this conversation. I always got into fights when I was a child, I always spoke quite agressively to my family, and to a lesser extent my friends and gf, and I still often get into fights now that I'm in college - usually with my gf, this year a lot with some random dudes during parties instead. I'd guess since the beginning of the relationship, we've had physical altercations maybe 3-4 times per year, ranging from 'I had a violent movement when I was angry and accidentally hit her in the arm when trying to do a hug' to 'we hit the other one' as what happened two days ago. It's gotten worse overall lately, as we hadn't fought in a while however I got into 3 fights during parties these last 5 months.

Overall I realize I get very angry very easily, but every time something bad happened in my relationship I'd think ""wow this is bad; I need to find out how to avoid getting this angry"", profusely apologise, insist it is not a 'small' matter, and think of a way to avoid getting angry over loved ones for nothing.

I started realizing that if I left the place and cooled down, I usually avoided to blow up. But it was hard to apply during arguments with my gf, for example when they happened late at night and we were both tired and wanted to sleep. So I started to put in place more words, so I'd try to say, for example ""I'm getting angry, I need to take a walk/calm down/something"" and apply it. It worked a bit, but then these last months I've noticed that when I'm drunk I can't apply these methods I've found to try and avoid getting angry. I don't really understand why, I just stop thinking ""hey you know you've thought about these situations, take a deep breath and go take a walk"" and I just start getting angry and yelling and sometimes hitting people when they react badly - which people often do when a dude starts yelling at you over nothing. I also don't understand why my instincts would be to start hitting people, because I'm very non-violent in my convictions are never actually want to harm anyone; I never feel satisfied or happy during the outburst and feel extremely badly afterwards.

This leads us to Tuesday; after going home with my gf and taking care of her lip, I started having some huge suicidal thoughts creeping back. I was feeling really badly and wasn't sure I wouldn't do anything so I called some friends to talk to. I'm blessed with great friends, one of them was awaken by my call but took the time to listen to me and calm me down, and another one who lived nearby actually came by and took maybe one hour to stay with me, talk to me, and listen to me.

A couple hours later, when my gf woke up, we noticed the wound on her lip was actually pretty large - we didn't see that well during the night because it was dark, and she didn't want me or her examining it in the bathroom when we got home, she went straight to sleep - so I took her to the hospital where, 6 hours later, they stitched it. However the doctors also said she'd probably keep a scar on her lip - she only got 1 stitch, so not that big, but a visible one though.

We basically spent the time since then to talk and cry, alternatively. She feels really bad about her lip and having a scar. This fight acted a huge wake-up call for me and I spent a lot of time discussing of the fights we had, of my tendency to be quick to anger and not calming down, and the abusing part of our relationship. She said it was something that she was conscious of, and tried to talk to me about but that I didn't understand it. She felt a bit relieved that I was taking conscience of how badly I happened to treat her sometimes, and we discussed it in more details; she went back over some of our fights, explaining how she sometimes felt useless in front of my anger, she explained to be what happened, for her, tuesday night.

This is not something I was totally unaware of, but I guess in my head it was more of a ""I've fucked up, but I know I can find ways not to fuck up anymore and all will be great"" way, and I've finally understood that I keep fucking up, with my gf and everyone, and that I have a real and huge problem.

My current issue is that I feel like shit. I feel like a monster, I realize I've hurt, more than once, and severely, a young woman I loved and love more than anything in the world, and I feel completly hopeless because in my head I never wanted to hurt her - or anyone. I'm just constantly in fear of hurting her again someday, or other people; I feel like I'm just constantly angry over something stupid, and can never calm down and act reasonably.

I've booked a meeting with a therapist - I had huge depression issued 4 years ago, that kinda creeped up again on me this year; I completly fucked my internship up, and was planning to talk to one anyway, even if I had a recommendantion but didn't book a meeting yet. I called yesterday, and I'll meet her for the first time soon -. I talked to a couple of close friends about the reality of the situation. They've been great, not judging me, trying to explain to me that doesn't necessarily make me a monster and that I'm taking steps into the right direction. I'm having a hard time believing them, and I feel everyone I talk to sees that I'm a monster, but don't want to tell it directly to me by fear I'd kill myself.

My gf has been great too. We've talked a lot, I've mentionned that I wanted to leave her because I can't be trusted and that I wouldn't be able to live if I'm being violent with her again, whatever the reason. She asked me if I wanted to change, and if I would hit her again. I answered yes to the first question, but that I didn't know how, and no to the second question, but that I never wanted to hit her in the first place and that I couldn't bear the thought of hitting her again, and just was afraid of doing it - and I actually think I will kill myself if I ever hit her again. She said that she never felt me as sincere, and that I was actually, for once, saying the right things and trying to recognize and attack the problem instead of trying to ignore it in a clever way. She said the harm was done, and she'd rather stay with me because she loved who I am without these outbursts; she said I was taking the right steps by going to a therapist, and it was great that I was talking to her, and she said that it was great that I recognized that I was an abuser. She said she realized the relationship was abusive but didn't know if she really wanted to leave, because she knew I had some great other sides of myself, but that if I was able to realize the harm I was doing, then I could change and she wanted to try and be a part of this.

I don't know how to react. I've never cried more than hearing of all the kindness coming out of her, towards her abuser, and realizing the harm I had done to someone as kind as that. Right now I feel completely lost, and don't know what to do but spend my days crying. I think of myself as a monster, and can't bear the idea of getting mad again, at her or anyone else. I don't want to ever hurt another human, except I'm so afraid of actually getting angry and not controlling myself again that I don't know what to 'safely' do. My meeting with the therapist is still in a few weeks, and it's the earliest I could have - everyone is in holidays. I'm also having a hard time to be there for my gf, who is feeling really badly about her lip, because I'm focused on egoistical thoughts and me being a monster; if I had taken a real look at her lip during the night, I'd have taken her straight to the hospital and she might not have a scar in the future. This is haunting me among the other things.

Do you guys know someone that had anger issues, but managed to put them behind him/her ? Do you know an abusive relationship that got better once one of the partner had help ? Do you think it's possible to stop being a monster ?"

She said she realized the relationship was abusive but didn't know if she really wanted to leave, because she knew I had some great other sides of myself, but that if I was able to realize the harm I was doing, then I could change and she wanted to try and be a part of this.

I don't know how to react. I've never cried more than hearing of all the kindness coming out of her, towards her abuser, and realizing the harm I had done to someone as kind as that. Right now I feel completely lost, and don't know what to do but spend my days crying. I think of myself as a monster, and can't bear the idea of getting mad again, at her or anyone else. I don't want to ever hurt another human, except I'm so afraid of actually getting angry and not controlling myself again that I don't know what to 'safely' do. My meeting with the therapist is still in a few weeks, and it's the earliest I could have - everyone is in holidays. I'm also having a hard time to be there for my gf, who is feeling really badly about her lip, because I'm focused on egoistical thoughts and me being a monster; if I had taken a real look at her lip during the night, I'd have taken her straight to the hospital and she might not have a scar in the future. This is haunting me among the other things.

Do you guys know someone that had anger issues, but managed to put them behind him/her ? Do you know an abusive relationship that got better once one of the partner had help ? Do you think it's possible to stop being a monster ?

6okdoe,1,2017-07-20,"I'm not okay, and tonight I can't help getting myself in a worst place",notthatgreat3,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6okdoe/im_not_okay_and_tonight_i_cant_help_getting/,"No idea if my title makes sense. English isn't my first language.

I have high and downs. I had been feeling good recently. Or at least not bad. I was okay. Life went on. I should be happy, you know ? I have loving parents, a boyfriend, friends I see relatively regularly. I work freelance and I'm in my first years so I don't always work, but when I do it's generally okay. I start to make money, it's okay. I live alone and almost support myself. I could, but my dad is amazing and helps me still because he wants me to put money away and build a life for myself. The people in my life, they're all great. I love them.

But tonight I don't feel good at all. Last time was a few months ago, and at that time I had people to call if needed. But my parents go on a vacation tomorrow and need their sleep, and my sister has an internship and has to get up early, and my boyfriend is asleep, and I don't want to bother him anyway. My other friends are probably asleep also, and for all but one, I don't want to call them anyway. They don't know. Nobody knows, really, how bad it is. My sister gets it, maybe. But even with her, it's hard. I don't want to bother her, or worry her, you know ? I already called her earlier to talk about her internship, it's exciting, and it helped a bit. But we hung up and I'm alone again.

This is where it gets even more messed up, I'm not okay and I keep feeding the beast, listening to music I know makes me cry. Does anybody here know what I'm talking about ? When you feel so bad that you sort of want to keep feeling like this, like maybe you deserve it ? I have always been very, very emotional so it doesn't take much, but crying is also a good thing, I think ? I know tomorrow I'll feel better. It doesn't mean I'll get out of bed until I absolutely have to, but it's something. But right now, I sort of want to feel bad ? I want to keep crying ? I don't know. But I keep doing it. I could totally do what I usually do, watch a movie or a show I like, take my mind off of it, but tonight I can't. It took a while to make this post, so maybe in an hour or two I'll just watch a show and fall asleep to take my mind off of it, but right now it's hard. I don't even know if I'll submit this post. Probably. I don't even know what I expect. But I think for tonight, I don't really want to be better, I think ? Crying helps, and I know tomorrow I'll have to get up and do better, so maybe it's okay if tonight I'm at an all times low (for me) ? IDK, maybe I'm looking for validation. It'll be better tomorrow. And I'm not diagnosed, and as much as I hate self-diagnosis, I guess I'm depressed ? Maybe. I'll get help when I feel better, I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow anyway, I'll ask him probably.

Yeah here's something else : tonight I feel so bad that I know I have to get help, but tomorrow I'll be better, I know the cycles by now, and tomorrow I'll maybe stall. But I need help. How do I get over it ? How do I still look for help when the ""worst"" is past me ? Because it isn't really past me, it'll come back, but I fear that just like last time I'll procrastinate and then the next low will happen and I won't be in a better place. I don't know. Thanks for reading. I'll press send in a few minutes at best.

EDIT : Also, I don't know what to do, but I'm so afraid about ending up like my grand-father. He had a major depression when my mom, the oldest of three, was 15. He was out of it for a decade. My grandmother is amazing and supported the family, and they're still together and I admire them, but my grandfather isn't himself. I never knew the ""real"" him. My mom is still deeply affected, I know it, and I don't want to tell her how bad I feel because I know how deeply her dad's illness affected her, and I'm afraid that knowing that her daughter is on the same path will break her. I love her, I don't wan't that for her. I want to be normal. I don't want this. I hate it."
6okkkv,7,2017-07-20,How rigorous is the CS program?,synkronize,USF,https://www.reddit.com/r/USF/comments/6okkkv/how_rigorous_is_the_cs_program/,"So when I was taking CS in UCF I was not as disciplined. I screwed up there and wasted 3 semesters worth of time.

Now I am at USF and survived two semesters and will finally enter the CS program this fall assuming this summer ends fine which it should hopefully.

Between using flowcharts and degree works it seems like I'll be graduating around Fall'19, I graduated High school 2014 and have been a Junior since 2015 since I finished my AA pretty quick.

I feel like I'm behind and I want to speed it up but maybe with 15 credit hours per semester but I don't want to make mistakes.

Also want to fit in an good internship maybe around sum'18 one that's paid hopefully thats my goal for 2018
 
So should I continue slow and steady or once you get the flow of things should 15/16 hours be doable?"

- We have a file server cluster of 5 servers
- When they reboot for updates, one goes down, when it's responsive next goes down, rinse and repeat several times
- This is what we call the ""F cluster,"" the place where all the users have their files which is always mapped to the F: drive
- I'm a tier -0.5 intern

Node 1 goes down for updates as planned, everything is dandy. Node 1 comes back up, update broke AD integration. It responds to ping, so node 2 goes down. 

Rinse, repeat. File server is getting painfully slow so I call helpdesk. 

Tier 1 is confused, they transfer me to Tier 2. Tier 2 is the highest tier because we're pretty small. Tier 2 guy says ""shit goddamn motherfuck"" and slams down the receiver.

A flicker of lights came herald to the ghost behind the door.  But that door was closed, so it wound up and through, with a chill that froze the knob in its passing.  Owen waited for it on a massive leather chair that threatened to consume him lest he fall asleep entirely.  He was already halfway there; his back bent into the cushions, his legs hidden in the folds of its fat.

“Good morning,” said Genard, the ghost.  “I trust that you’re well rested?  We have a long day waiting.”

“No, I am *not* well rested,” Owen said.  He clutched a blue pen to his chest, where it bled against his oxford.  “It’s three in the morning, damn you.”

“Ghosts cannot keep records on the passage of time.  I waited in the room, as you bid of me,” said Genard.  And so he had, though there was no way to tell.  Cameras show nothing when it comes to ghosts, Owen knew, so an intern was sent down each day, every trip more terrible than the last.  “The serving boy seems a bit … wet, for want of a better word.  Water beads across his brow.  Perhaps you should get that looked at.”

Owen nodded.  *Perhaps I should,* he thought languidly.  The boy would tell, as his predecessors had  done.  *But what to do…*  A pit of lions?  The standard CIA garrote?  Or Genard, who would be pleased to have him, but that would mean more loose strings untied.  Then, “I’m sure it’s nothing.  *Please,* don’t worry.  You shouldn’t strain yourself when you’re old.”

“If I might suggest burnt wormwood?  Wave it beneath the nostrils and have the patient breathe deeply.  I think it’s bad dreams, though I wouldn’t bet on it.”

Gerard might’ve been a healer once, but proved unfamiliar with the concepts of modern medicine.  “A needle that draws blood?  But the leeches,” he had said not so long ago.  Owen had learned to take the words of ghosts with a grain of salt.  They were wise in the mystic arts -- magic and the like -- though the older they got, the more stubborn they became.  *Can’t teach a dog new tricks?  More like you can’t teach a ghost, even if the evidence is right in front of it,* thought Owen waspishly.  “Why leeches, when needles have less pain?”  He’d posed the question, then learned the hard way that ghosts could not be reasoned with.

Lyra appeared at the office door, gripping a pile of papers in one hand and a burlap sack in the other.  “Sir, the paperwork…”

“No, no,” said Owen.  “The bag here…”

“If you please,” Lyra finished.  She knew the way of it now, and it was always the same.  Morning coffee at six, a footlong come noon, then paperwork if Owen stayed at his desk past midnight.  Which was most nights, in truth, so Lyra stayed with him until the work was done.

Owen settled back into his chair, then waved his hand to open the bag.  A stained sword fell to the table, a crystal - topped staff after, then a thong of human flesh with a nielloed pendant at its end.  “A pretty piece,” said Gerard.

“Shut up,” said Owen as he donned the necklace.  “What do you have for me?”

Lyra read off a paper.  “A lesser warlock from the Gulf of Mexico.  He gains power with every passing day, in the realm of fae where the sun fails to shine.  He must be stopped.  Code X.”

“The realm of fae, then?” Asked Gerard.

“Yeah.”  The ghost vanished through a rippling portal.  Owen gripped the sword and threw Lyra the staff.  “Get in.”

He found himself on the far end of a river, watching hopper fish leap across its surface.  Trees bent over the fast - flowing water like subjects to a king, their lofty heads crowned with ravens and owls,  graced by a brisk easterly breeze.  Owen closed his eyes and felt the wind push his cheeks…

… then felt a chill brush against his spine.  He drew his blade in panic, but it was only Gerard.  The ghost held a listless look to his face, one of peace and of more peace to come.  Owen was loathe to disturb him, though Lyra seemed not to share his concerns as she fell against a tree.  “We should find a log,” she said, and Owen agreed. 

When they found one, they set it adrift and climbed on -- not Gerard, for ghosts do not swim -- their feet dangling in the water.  The subject trees soon fled behind them, replaced by peasant rocks, grown dirty with soiled skin and rags of moss.  A bird hooted overhead, chasing after a rising moon, spurred along by a whipping wind that had been so kind before.  *Foolish bird,* thought Owen, *though I must be just as dumb to chase a rumor.*  He might’ve sent Uther in his stead, or Paula come the rising sun, but he lacked both trust and patience.  Best take care of things yourselves, he had always said.  Not to make sure it’s done right, but to take all the glory.

Then the current sprinted and even the peasant rocks fell behind, scents of rotted fish left with them.  They gave way to an open meadow, where small things and larger ones crept through tall grass.  Once, a mouse - fae dared poke its head from a mottled green sea, to be plucked in the claws of an owl and carried back to the forests so far away.

“Look,” said Gerard, pointing to the skies.  “There’s the Little Dipper, the big one, and the North Star.  You never let me see them before,” he said with reproach.  “But I saw the pictures.”

“The stars are different here,” said Owen, when Lyra shook him and nearly shoved him from the log.  A great splash went up somewhere behind them, then another closer still.  But it was only the hopper fish, jumping in unison to drown the log in a spray of water.

Lyra smiled and Gerard did to, and they watched the fish flee together.  *And why not,* thought Owen.  *I think we’ve earned it.*

6ol193,1,2017-07-20,Said something political during drinks with coworkers--did I put myself in a bad position?,Disposefollowinguse,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6ol193/said_something_political_during_drinks_with/,"I'm a summer intern at a corporate job.

I was grabbing drinks with some coworkers after work, joking around and talking about random stuff. There were four of us talking, and we were joking around about Christie sitting on the beach, voting red/blue, and I got the sense that my coworkers largely leaned blue. One coworker mentioned her parents would be shocked if they knew she voted Democrat.

I made an off-handed comment about a recent conversation with my dad, and said something like, ""Recently I was talking with my dad, who said, 'So I've been hearing a lot about vaccines not working and I'm thinking they may be right.' And then I said, 'oh, come on Dad...'""

Turns out one of the senior directors (who I don't work closely with) I was talking with is an anti-vaxer, and has a son with autism which she thinks is tied to vaccines.

Oops.

She seemed kind of offended, and we talked about it for 2-3 minutes. I apologized, and she was really cordial about it, told me what she thought and asked what I thought about the issue. I apologized again and told her I didn't mean to be offensive at all and admitted I didn't know enough about it to have a strong conviction behind my view.

Maybe I see it around Reddit too much and I'm desensitized, but I'm kicking myself for bringing up a quasi-political comment like that, even after we were talking about views. Obviously as an intern I shouldn't have said something like that, but hindsight is 20/20. After talking for a few minutes, I stuck around very briefly then said 'goodbye' and headed out. 

Did I fuck up? I don't think bringing it up again or further apologizing would at all help, but I'm not too familiar with office culture and what I should do when something like that 'slips.'

Any suggestions about what I should do moving forward? Ignore it? Speak to it again? Thanks, guys.

**tl;dr** Joking around with coworkers at a bar. Everyone's talking politics, I make a joke about anti-vaxers. Coworker (director) is an anti-vaxer with a son with autism. I apologized and things seemed cordial. Should I do anything else?"
6ol1jr,5,2017-07-20,Day 1 report,theoxygencat,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6ol1jr/day_1_report/,"Made it through the first day. Wish I could say I was proud of myself, but now that the self medicating has stopped, all I can feel is sadness. After having made the decision to quit, I feel like merely being alive is triggering me. I know from previous streaks that this does get better with time, but for now all I can do is focus on the day at hand.

Today at my internship (I am 1 of 3 guys in a group of 18 girls) I found myself wildly attracted to each of the girls. Each one of them I just wanted to hold and kiss. This is making me realize one of underlying aspect of my addiction. I'm trying to drown my feelings of loneliness. I think this is an important thing to externalize. 

Tomorrow is my last day at this internship and I'm beginning to feel sad because I feel like I was just starting to build strong friendships. When I get back to my home country, it's vital that I reconnect with friend groups. Loneliness is a pretty straight forward trigger to combat, so I have to give it all I've got and resist the temptation to isolate. I mean, you guys are great and all, but nothing beats having close friends in the real world.

Thanks for reading and stay tuned for day 2."

""The Will wasn't the first bounty hunter to come after my parents, and he wasn't the last. Like every freelancer I had the misfortune to meet, he was a fucking MONSTER. But as my family was about to learn, some monsters are worse than others.""

This last bit ends on the panel of Sophie hugging The Will after he saved her from the pedophile slaver.  We are meant to assume that while The Will is a murdering Freelancer, he also has a good side and enough compassion to rescue a little girl who is being used as a sex slave. It's a fake out: the whole point of that piece of narration was to start laying out the canvas of just how utterly ruthless Sophie will grow up to be.

Flash forward a few years to issue 37.  Sophie is serving as a page to Gwendolyn, and tells her she wants to intern to a Freelancer.  Her reasons?

1) *""I want to pay you back for everything.""* She's been a ward of Gwendolyn, who still has a serious hate-boner for Marco. Sophie was originally sold into child sexual slavery by her uncle and then raped regularly by some creepy guy and peddled out as a child prostitute, so she's lacking in safe male figures in her life. The only assuring male she's had in her life (The Will) angrily rejected her, after she almost killed him (even if it wasn't her fault).  Basically, the kid is all kinds of screwed up, especially when it comes to men. And Gwendolyn just feeds that by going on about how terrible Marco is.  However, Gwendolyn is also genuinely kind to and protective of Sophie, so it is natural for Sophie, as a child, to look up to Gwendolyn and adopt some of Gwendolyn's world views as her own. This is important because it lays some of the groundwork for what will make Sophie so single-minded and relentless in pursuit of Hazel's family; Sophie has been brainwashed to believe that Marco is a villain, and not just *any* villain, but the worst kind.  This is reflected in the way Sophie speaks about him.  Some of her notable dialog from that issue:  ""If you let me learn from a professional, I know I can take care of your **evil** ex-boyfriend"", ""...I know the way **abusive creeps** like Marco think..."".

2)  *""I want to finish what The Will never could.""* Even though Sophie was hurt by The Will's rejection, she still cared for him.  The Will saved her from sex slavery and was the only adult to show her kindness until The Brand and Gwendolyn came along. Before The Will, she didn't even have a proper name that she could remember; she was just called ""Slave Girl"". The Will was not just her savior, but perhaps even a surrogate father for her.  She wants to continue his legacy, especially since it was the job of hunting down Hazel and her family that led him to landing on that planet, whose ecosystem started the chain of events that led to his life-threatening injuries.

There are other clues of Sophie's eventual rise to ultimate villain in the narration as well.  In issue 40, after Sophie spies on Gwendolyn's meeting with the wings and learns about Wreath's and Landfall's join plans to allow Phang (her home comet) to be decimated, we get the following narration: ""Most of us think we can hide our weaknesses from the world, and sometimes, we're right. But only if we're very, very strong.""  Come on, that is like some TV Tropes standard ""how I became a badass/bad guy"" character background building there.  Sophie's been through so much in her life and is barely ten years old.  Now she's gotta deal with her home world getting destroyed.  This will have a deep emotional impact on her, but it will also be a pivotal moment in her life where she chooses to put up an emotional wall--a perfect character trait for a heartless Freelancer.

6omap5,82,2017-07-21,[Unexplained Death] Joe Scarborough and the strange death of Lori Klausutis,SniffleBot,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/6omap5/unexplained_death_joe_scarborough_and_the_strange/,"Since not only has Scarborough been in the news lately, what with getting engaged to his co-host and leaving the Republican Party, it's also the 16th anniversary of this one, I think it's a good time to bring it up here, especially since it seems no one else has ever done so (at least not on this sub ... [it has been discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ywwwk/my_name_is_lori_klausutis_i_was_an_intern_for_joe/) at r/conspiracy, however).

Summer 2001 was, we all now remember, an in-between time. We seemed to finally be putting the previous year's divisive election, in which the Democratic candidate close to Bill Clinton had won the popular vote but lost the electoral college vote to a seemingly rough-edged, plainspoken Republican who appealed to a lot of the common people despite coming from a very rich background himself and having a rich father (Sound familiar?) Carrot Top was still a celebrity. Cell phones were still not ubiquitous, especially outside large metropolitan areas, and all they did really was carry voice and text, the latter at sometimes considerable extra expense.

It wasn't a perfect time, and it certainly wasn't innocent. But it still seems blissful compared to what came afterwards, still the great before-and-after moment of our national culture.

Perhaps that's why the case of Lori Klausutis gets lost in the cracks even today.

At the beginning of the summer, Rep. Joe Scarborough, a Republican from Florida's 1st district, in the western Panhandle, [announced he was resigning from Congress effective Sept. 6](http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/apnews/stories/052501/D7C7AGI81.html), just a few months into his fourth term. It was the first vacancy created in the new Congress, but it didn't make much national news—while Scarborough had been elected in 1994, one of the Republicans who took their party's first House majority in 40 years (his predecessor had been a Democrat, whose retirement left it all but certain that FL-1 would be flipped that year), he had largely been a backbencher, not known for headline grabbing. He had been re-elected overwhelming after that; in fact the fall before he had had no Democratic opponent. No one in Washington or Florida was too worried about the seat changing hands (and indeed it did not, it has been a Republican district ever since), so his resignation didn't make too much national news.

Locally, though, there were some rumors behind it. Scarborough's stated reason, ""I would rather be judged at the end of my life as a father than as a congressman,"" comes across as too much a variant on the classic ""I'm leaving to devote more time to my family"" ... you know, what everybody *says* when they leave office earlier than they'd like for some unpleasant reason, because nobody can really argue with it—who *wouldn't* want to spend more time with their family?—but never gets believed for that exact reason.

On the surface, Scarborough may have meant it—he and his first wife had gotten divorced the previous year, and one of his sons had gotten diagnosed with diabetes. So he certainly had real reasons. But there had also been rumors back home that the divorce had been triggered by rampant marital infidelity, rumors that Scarborough's more recent behavior leads one to assign greater credibility to, and interestingly in the story linked above, Scarborough, apropos of nothing in particular, brings up ""wild rumors going around in Washington these days that both of my boys have cancer and there are wild rumors going around my district that both of my boys are juvenile delinquents and nothing could be further from the truth."" (Keep this behavior on Scarborough's part in mind). Apparently he was so upset by those rumors that he felt compelled to give up an elected office to put them to rest, instead of just dispelling them in print. He also said that ""If I had a crystal ball and could have foreseen the future, I probably wouldn't have run last year"" Had something changed that he didn't expect to?

Anyway, enough background material about Joe Scarborough.

On July 20, 2001, a couple seeking help with an immigration problem showed up for an 8 a.m. appointment at Scarborough's district office in Fort Walton Beach. The door was open but no one was there. Looking cautiously around the office, they found a woman's body lying on the floor under a desk and called police.

The woman was pronounced dead at the scene. She was identified quickly as [Lori Klausutis](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1774&amp;dat=20010721&amp;id=JoEfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n38EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5780,371180&amp;hl=en), 28, a resident of nearby Niceville married to a civilian researcher at nearby Eglin Air Force Base, who had worked for Scarborough in constituent services since 1999 (It should be pointed out right here and right now that, contrary to some later retellings of this story, she was ***NOT*** an intern, but a paid staffer).

A month later [the autopsy report came back that](http://web.archive.org/web/20081016001411/http://www.sptimes.com/News/082801/State/Aide_found_dead_had_s.shtml), while suffering from a previously undiagnosed heart arrhythmia, she collapsed and hit her head on the desk. The combination of the two led to her death as she could not get help. The police reported that she'd told a coworker and a letter carrier the day before that she wasn't feeling well; the latter had also said she seemed nervous. Case closed, everybody moves on.

But that autopsy report left a lot to be desired. Liberal bloggers of the era, perturbed that it seemed Gary Condit was being put through the wringer by the national media over Chandra Levy while Scarborough was getting a free pass (easy to explain, really ... Condit was not leaving Congress at the time, and Levy's fate was unknown, neither of which was true in Scarborough's case) started [asking questions](http://web.archive.org/web/20170701050151/https://americanpolitics.com/20010808Klausutis.html):

* Within a few hours of Klausutis's death being reported, as in literally before noon that day, and well before the autopsy report, Scarborough and his press secretary were aggressively putting it out to the media that she had unspecified longterm health issues. This was almost immediately challenged by her family, who pointed out that she was a regular runner who competed in 8Ks, and while she had suffered some short-term memory loss after going into a coma after a car accident in her teens, she had no longterm health issues *they* were aware of. They went to the trouble of writing a letter to the editor of the local paper pointing this out.

* [Her obituary](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302103917/http://web.archive.org:80/web/20010805210626/http://www.nwfdailynews.com/archive/obituaries/010723briefs5.html) for some reason completely avoids any mention that she had worked for Scarborough for the last two years of her life.

The autopsy report was not released for another month, after the [*Northwest Florida Daily News* called on police to release other records relevant to the case and hinting it might file suit](http://web.archive.org/web/20150303074120/http://web.archive.org:80/web/20010828222349/http://www.nwfdailynews.com/archive/opinion/010823edit1.html).

* Part of the reason for this was that Michael Berkman, the coroner doing the autopsy, who had originally said he could not establish a cause of death without extra toxicology tests, suddenly announced that there was ""a visible head injury"", somewhat contradicting earlier reports that said there were no signs of foul play.

* When [it was finally released](http://www.allhatnocattle.net/9-1-01_klausutis_autopsy_released.htm), it was indeed true that Klausutis had a head injury: a hairline fracture to her skull that Berkman said resulted from the fall after she was overcome by arrhythmia brought on by [mitral valve prolapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitral_valve_prolapse), which he refers to as ""floppy mitral valve disease"". He said that bruising on the left side of her brain, opposite the visible head injury, proves that this occurred and that it came from the fall after she lost consciousness due to the arrhythmia.

* But MVP-induced arrhythmia does not commonly lead to fainting (I can attest to this personally), and if Lori *had* fainted for some reason, there is no sign of the common syncope reflex of putting a hand in front of the face as she lost consciousness.

* If, indeed, the fainting had been caused by a loss of blood flow to the brain, why did blood continue to flow from the cranial arteries inside the skull opposite the head wound? And it has also been noted that when there is an intracranial artery rupture, causing bleeding inside the skull, there is usually evidence of that injury on the outside (The only closed head injury to cause bleeding inside the skull is a fractured temporal bone, with a rupture of the artery beneath it, which Berkman did not say happened in this case).

And then a *lot* of questions were asked about Berkman's professional record:

* He'd been suspended in Missouri by Jackson County after it was found that many of the tests he'd done on bodies there were not, in fact, done. In some cases this went further than reports to his superiors; at the time of Klausutis's death at least two convictions had been overturned because of his falsifications. Eventually his license was revoked.

* So, naturally, he skipped town and took the job in Florida, getting a license without bothering to let that state know that he was under suspension pending revocation in Missouri. He'd also lied about his teaching career in Missouri. When Florida found out, it put him under suspension as well, but apparently no final disposition was ever made. His career as a medical examiner ended in 2003 when he was fired in Florida for not completing autopsies, something that had also bothered his superiors in Missouri. His career has since had a creepy postscript: in 2012 he was arrested when [a storage locker that had once been rented by him was found to be full of stored body parts](http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article307750/Organs-found-in-storage-linked-to-former-Jackson-County-coroner.html).

* Berkman's boss, Stephen Nelson, was also found to have, along with his wife, been a generous donor to Scarborough's campaign, apparently exceeding the legal limit during the previous cycle.

Nothing more has ever come of Klausutis's death investigatively, despite all these revelations about Berkman's issues. But it has continued to be [a thorn in Scarborough's side](http://gawker.com/remember-when-a-dead-intern-was-found-in-joe-scarboroug-1711985081). [He and his press secretary have threatened to sue the liberal website that first wrote about all these issues with the case](http://web.archive.org/web/20150301203318/http://web.archive.org:80/web/20020209153607/http://www.prospect.org/cgi-bin/webx?14@71.LhGAaHhra3i%5E12@.ee6b913/502). He wrote [a nasty letter to *Vanity Fair*](http://gawker.com/remember-when-a-dead-intern-was-found-in-joe-scarboroug-1711985081) in 2005 after James Wolcott (who apologized) mentioned it in a column (In that letter he again indulges in a classic [Suspiciously Specific Denial](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial), stating he only met Klausutis three times (credible, I think ... most district-office employees are not at the congressperson's right arm) ""and I was never alone"" ... OK, he may have been addressing rumors that he had been having an affair with her but still ... nobody had asked whether he'd ever met her alone. In 2006 Katherine Harris seriously damaged her own reputation, to the point that she has not run for anything since, when word got out that she was torpedoing any chance Scarborough would run for Senate by telling big-money donors he'd ""have to answer questions"" about the Klausutis case if he did run. And Scarborough has fought hard to keep that the only context in which the case is mentioned on his Wikipedia page (without even Klausutis's name being used). In 2010 he got Markos Moulitsas, founder of the liberal *Daily Kos* website, banned from MSNBC until he apologized for mentioning it in a Twitter fight with Scarborough.

Personally, I don't think that if Klausutis met with foul play, it was at Scarborough's hands (I think he was demonstrably in Washington at the time) or even someone doing it at his behest. His rather frontal way of dealing with it, without hiring a lawyer to run interference, does not come across like the way someone guilty, at least not someone as smart and media-savvy as Scarborough in this day and age, would do, especially not someone himself a lawyer. And his tone feels authentically pissed off to me.

But ... there is still the matter of him and his press secretary putting out that story about Klausutis's nonexistent health problems within *hours* of her body being discovered. Why? Perhaps her death was truly a bizarre accident, but I think Scarborough has *something* he's keeping to himself here.

Edit: fixed last sentence."

6omsxj,3,2017-07-21,Haven't been able to find work for More than a year after a manic episode and feeling down because of it. (rantish i guess),theendofthisroad123,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/6omsxj/havent_been_able_to_find_work_for_more_than_a/,"Hi r/bipolar

I haven't been able to find work for more than a year now since I had my manic episode which made me lose my job and it's been bringing me down for a while now. I was doing an internship in my field up until a few months ago for a six month period till I completed the internship. I enjoyed it, but I want more. 

While I have mostly been very stable for about a year now, I've been depressed over being unemployed for such a long time. Even before I had that job I was already unemployed for more than a year, when I first got that job I thought that I finally had my big break but instead I got swallowed whole in a whirlwind of mania. Worse of all I only the job for two weeks till I admitted myself to the hospital.   

Today I have been feeling a bit more morose than usual, maybe it's the wet and dreary weather but I have been thinking a lot more about my current situation. I hate the fact that I am so far behind where I expected myself to be in life by the time I'm 28, it's starting to eat me inside and taking with it all joy in life. I see friends and family being successful with meaningful careers and in a happy relationship while I have neither. I know that it is foolhardy to define yourself by your career but it's difficult not to define yourself by it.

I have been spending the last few weeks to try to get a job. We are currently in the process of starting a company, but given the current economic situation in the oil and gas industry I am I don't expect a lot of growth in the short term. I've just started applying for work again since the end of my internship but I am not overly optimistic about my prospects given the current economic climate. I'm trying to get my name out and to know employer through networking events. I am much more optimistic about meeting people in industry and get a foot in that way. 

Sincerely

6omv7u,4,2017-07-21,I hate my fucking life.,theredpill22,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/6omv7u/i_hate_my_fucking_life/,"I can't remember the last time I felt enthusiastic about anything. I'm in an electronic engineering degree, which I have no passion for. I have no passion for anything. I never really have. I force myself to work and force myself to study. I did mediocre in my exams, but managed to sell my way into an excellent internship, which I absolutely hate. That's what my life consists of. Selling. 

I lie to everyone I meet on a daily basis. I'm not ok. I never really have been. My smile is fake. My confidence is fake. I am not a happy person. I feel like I'm already dead. I'm a walking caricature of a person. I followed the status quo into what many would consider an enviable position and I don't feel a fucking thing. My rewards, my achievements, they mean nothing to me. There are people who shovel shit for a living who are happier than me. 

I'm always worried, always. Am I working hard enough? Efficient enough? Am I managing my LTR correctly? Am I going to make enough money? Will this work ever actually pay off? Will my life ever actually get better? Will I ever be happy? 

I have no real friends. I can disappear off the grid for months and no one gives a shit. No message to see how I am, nothing. Never get invited anywhere. I don't know why everyone seems to hate me so much. I've come to terms with it somewhat. I was never liked. Ever. Even though I'm a genuinely nice, decent person. That's only ever been used to manipulate me and make me feel like shit. 

It's so hard to get up in the morning. I can't remember the last time I was happy to get out of bed. I've been to counseling, I started at 15. I've tried medication. I've tried exercise. I eat a healthy diet. I don't drink, smoke or do drugs. My bloods are all healthy. 

I have to pretend on a daily basis that there is nothing wrong with me. Every fucking day, I have to lie and pretend that I'm ok. I'm an honest person, I don't like lies, and this just makes me hate myself even more. How will these people ever understand what it's like to have a mother who is so drugged out on antidepressants that she may aswell be dead? A father who scared you so much you wanted to kill yourself rather than face him? How will they understand the sleepless nights? The times where you would punch yourself unconscious because you couldn't take the hell anymore? The times where you could feel yourself slipping into insanity, purely from the years of loneliness and misery. Talking to yourself, not feeling real anymore, living in a fantasy world. These people will never fucking understand me. No. They had normal parents, normal social lives. They didn't need medication just to leave the house. They didn't need to practice their facial expression in the mirror so they didn't look like a serial killer. They didn't need to spend hours on end reading TRP just to attract a girlfriend. The collossal fucking effort I've put in just to come across as a normal guy and it means fucking nothing. Telling people how I really feel is impossible. The overwhelming negativity that has plagued me all my life just won't go away. I can never see the positives in anything. As far as people go, a hundred good deeds will be overthrown by one bad deed. I don't know how to forgive and I never forget anything. My anger and jealousy of others must come through subconsciously, no matter how much I try to hide it. It all comes so easily to them. Friends, girlfriends, happiness. Its like socialising is a game and I'm the only one who hasn't read the manual. My friends and my girlfriend were just gotten by pure manipulation. None of it is genuine, none of it is real. If I told my girlfriend how fucked up I really am she would probably never speak to me again. The fetishes I have, the overwhelming need for power. I wonder how she would feel if I told her about how I used to fantasize about caving my dad's head in with a hammer. 

I don't where to go from here. I've created this life and it's all absolute rubbish. It's actually comical how someone like me can get this far. I should be locked up in a mental hospital. Or I should have followed through on the suicidal urges I've had since I was 14. I certainly shouldn't be a normal member of society, because I'm completely different from these people and I've never felt so alone."

6on7dv,7,2017-07-21,Why didn't I just do it? (Long and miserable),INKANDGUNS,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6on7dv/why_didnt_i_just_do_it_long_and_miserable/,"In 2013, I finished my Army contract.  I thought I'd have a wonderful life with my girlfriend now that constant travel wouldn't drag me away.  I felt a huge relief, as I had spent my teenage years watching my mother die of cancer, and my young adulthood barely surviving as it was nearly impossible for a high school graduate to find a livable wage.  I had been homeless for a 6 month stretch over a harsh winter.  After I left the army I started looking for a job.  A month or so later, the guy she was cheating on me with messaged me on Facebook to tell me.  

The breakup was nasty and I ended up losing friends and lots of money over it.  I'm not sure why many women feel the money stealing is ok - I have seen this dozens of times, as it's very prevalent in the military.  She was able to turn many people against me, claiming I had been abusing her.  Left with all the bills we used to share, I was close to being evicted and back on the street.  

A friend moved in with me and I was able to begin to recover (in many ways).  I enrolled in school, met a pretty girl, and things seemed ok.  She graduated and got a high paying job an hour and a half away.  We moved, although it was more expensive her salary would more than cover it.  She was fired within a week, and spent the next 3 months drinking in bed.  

Having no other options, I had to take my first internship job back where we moved from (3hrs commuting per day).  I was constantly miserable, and now supporting her and her child.  She had no pity for me and my misery.  Maybe things could have worked if she was more supportive.  When my PTSD would kick up from driving so much, she'd tell me, ""why can't you just be normal"".  I gained a little weight and she was quick to tell me how fat and unnattractive to her.  We moved back to our original town after pretty much going broke.  

It wasn't long after we moved that I broke up with her.  I was fed up with being treated like shit all the time.  It was messy.  She begged for me to stay with her, and I agreed.  Maybe it would have been different if I hadn't bonded with her son so much.  It lasted about another week before she cheated on me, came home, and told me it was over.  

I told her she could stay with her son at my house until she found a new place to live, but would need to pay some bills around the place.  She returned my kindness by fucking her new boyfriend upstairs whenever she could.  The sounds were so loud, I had to sleep in my car inside my garage on many nights.  I still couldn't bring myself to throw her son out when they had nowhere to go.  

When she moved out, she had trashed my house.  Animal waste was in her room, the living room, everywhere.  She took things we had bought together.  There were used condoms stuck to the floor upstairs.  It took a week to clean everything.  She hadn't been paying her bills, so I was now theousands of dollars in debt with the threats of all my services being shut off.  

I kept working my job I hated, I had almost no other choice.  After a couple months of barely scraping by on one meal a day, my car broke down.  I now was making the 5.5 mile trek between office and house 5 times a week.  That's not any fun when you're malnourished.  

One day, I had enough quarters and change to get a little drunk in fireball shooters on the way home.  It was raining, and I sat down on the grassy parkway in a nice neighborhood.  I had my pistol with me, and I'm not even sure why really.  At that point I'd have been lucky to be killed on my walk, so why even have protection?

I sat there for a while crying.  I hadn't cried in a long time, and it was needed.  When I got my shit together, I began thinking about killing myself.  I don't really have anyone close to me.  I don't speak to my family anymore.  I began being pulled by a strong desire to shoot myself right there.  

After crying again I decided I had to get up and keep walking.  I called the veterans crisis line, but they just kind of listen and tell you not to kill yourself.  Not helpful.  I gave my gun to a friend of mine and told him I needed help.  There's no way I could have paid for inpatient help.  He told me all this Jesus stuff and told me I wasn't really fulfilling my potential.  Also not helpful.  

I took it day by day, and I've made it another year.  But for what?  Things have become even worse.  I had been spending time with a girl I really like, but a few months ago she stopped talking to me and I don't know why.  I found out my ex had skipped inspection steps while we closed on my house.  I'm left with foundation, plumbing, and electrical problems.  I got fired at work, but that may have been an improvement.

I also tried to help some friends by letting them stay at my place when they were having hard times - they all ended up stealing from me and not paying what we agreed on.  

On the 19th, the utility man came to the house to shut off my power.  My car also started having problems - I use it for work and can't work without it.  

So if you've made it this far..  

1.  I should have manned up and shot myself a year ago and saved myself the misery.  I think when people die there's nothing - no afterlife or anything.  That sounds nice.

2.  People put in effort to try and keep me around, I have a few great friends.  But why?  If your friend was burning alive in horrible pain, would you not shoot him to spare some suffering?

3.  Suicide happens.  It happens when coping skills are overwhelmed by stresses.  


I'm hanging in there for the moment, but to me this all just seems like endless suffering for no reason.  I know that if I ever am feeling so down that I'm considering suicide I'm not talking to anyone about it ever.  It will either pass, and I'll continue this miserable life, or I'll actually just kill myself.  I don't need to hear people's reasons why they'd be sad if I was gone, or any of their Jesus crap.  

I'm ashamed I was too cowardly to save myself a year of misery.  Yes, I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I just don't see how someone can recover from this and lead a normal life.  I guess lots of money would go a bit to help, but I'd inevitably drink it all up.  

I miss my Mom.  I miss actual real human affection and intimacy.  I miss the War and living with my brothers.  I'm 31, and maybe this is just it.  I'm not sure if I can keep plugging away at this hoping there's some happiness around the corner.

I'm starting to become very concerned about my future. I'm a 20 year old Computer Science student at an average/unprestigious university (Lincoln), about to enter my third year of study and I think I'll graduate with a First.

With all the talk of a hard brexit and economic woes filling the news every day, I am really starting to dread finishing university as it seems I'm almost doomed not to find a fulfilling career once I've finished my degree. Everywhere I look jobs seem to offer almost minimum wage yet require experience and knowledge of languages and frameworks that would take years to learn.

I'd say I'm a talented programmer, I've been at it since I was around fourteen or so. I've done a few freelance jobs and right now I'm at a summer internship doing web development for a small local company.

I'm sociable, clean shaven and in a lasting relationship etc so I'm not a stereotypical ""Geek"". I'm typically good in interviews as I'm well spoken and reasonably good at relaxing in those situations. 

I know C++, C#, Php/SQL/JavaScript/Jquery/HTML/CSS.

I can speak French quite well, too - enough to converse informally.

Being realistic - what are my job prospects in the UK? Should I start thinking about work elsewhere in Europe? I'd love to hear from other software developers/recent graduates about their experiences.

Thanks!

It's a ""what if?"" kind of concept, a sexier Twilight Zone, if you will.  Feel free to comment.]

----

**It's a Man's World?**

Bethany Ambrose, Beth to her friends, was nervous about her interview.  It was her first major opportunity outside of college, a real job possibility rather than an internship or a training program that *might* lead to a job.  Brannon Industries was one of those indeterminate mega-corporations, they did a little bit of everything, and did very well on the stock market.  As she entered the corporate center, one of half-a-dozen such buildings across the US, she adjusted her jacket and skirt and stepped up to the security desk.

“I’m here for a ten AM interview,” she said, trying to sound confident.  The security guard looked her up and down from behind his desk.

“Name?”  She told him.  He clacked away at his keyboard for a few moments and then slid a visitor’s ID across his counter.  “Wear that so it’s visible at all times.  It will allow you to use the main elevators,” he pointed behind him, “access to the lobby, the cafeteria, and the seventeenth floor—where your interview will be.  If you accidentally get off on the wrong floor, someone will have to let you back into the elevators.”  He looked at her sternly.  “I suggest you *do not* get off on the wrong floor.”

“Yes, sir.”  She said.  She clipped the badge to her lapel and he opened the security gate for her.  Her heels clicked on the polished granite floor as she walked over to the elevators, other people milling about, but it was late enough in the morning that most people were probably at their desks.  Elevators opened and a few people got in a head of her.  As she stepped into the elevator, her hell caught in the gap between the floor and elevator car, and she stumbled, trying to the catch herself, but instead smacking her head against the frame of the elevator doors.  Her vision flared white for a moment, and she fell to the floor inside the elevator.  A moment later, a woman was helping her sit up.

“Are you okay, miss?”  The woman asked.  Beth shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts, when she realized it made her look like she was saying no, she wasn’t okay.
“I’m okay, I think.  Just dazed for a second.  My heel caught, and—.”

“We saw.”  Another woman said.  “Do you want me to get security with first aid or something?”  Beth felt the side of her head.  It was a little sore, but not really painful to the extent that she felt she needed medical attention.

“Really, I’m okay.”  She started to stand up, and the first woman who’d spoken helped her up.  “I wasn’t paying attention…probably nervous because I’m here for an interview.”

“Oh, you’re going to HR on seventeen, then.”  The second woman swiped her badge at the elevator panel and hit 17, followed by 28, which was likely her floor.  “Good luck.”  The elevator started moving.  A few seconds later, the doors opened on seventeen, she got out, carefully, and was surprised when the first woman followed her out.

“I’m not following you, don’t worry.”  She smiled.  “Well, technically I *am* following you, but it’s because I’m your equity observer for your interview.”  Beth blinked at her.  “I’m from the office where you might come work.  I sit in on the interview with HR and one of our group’s hiring managers, and I make sure they ask the right questions and treat your fairly.”  She patted Beth’s shoulder.  “I can see by that look on your face, you’re worried about your little trip.  Don’t worry.  I don’t actually have a say in your hiring, so even if I thought you were a complete dork, it wouldn’t matter.” Beth blushed.  “I’m Katherine, by the way.”  She shook he hand.  “Come on, I’ll show you the way to the interview suite.”  Beth followed the tall brunette.  Beth was still young enough that even at 22, someone in their late twenties, maybe early thirties, seemed old, experienced.  Katherine was wearing a sleek pants suit with heels, the loose curls of her hair tied behind her.  Beth’s straight blonde hair didn’t quite reach her shoulders, but she knew she looked professional with her side part and glasses.  They walked through a maze of hallways and rooms before coming to large office with a conference table and a series of chairs on one side.  There was another chair in the middle of the room a few feet back from the table, with a side table next to it.

“This is, um, where I’ll interview?”

“Yes.”  Katherine said, going to the side table and making herself a cup of coffee.  “I’d suggest a few things.  First, get yourself a cup of coffee or water.  Put it at the side table.”  She pointed to the single chair.  “Dry mouth is bad during an interview, right?  Second, the way things are set up in here is totally meant to freak you out.  They want you nervous so you’ll make mistakes.  Seeing you under pressure is a good way to get a sense of a person, or so they think.  You have nothing to worry about, hiring-wise.  You’re qualified.  I reviewed your application myself.  Do okay in the interview, and you have a good shot at the job.”  Beth took a breath and walked over to where Katherine stood.  She filled a cup with water and took a sip.

“This is my first big interview.  I mean, I’ve interviewed at a few other places, even have some current offers, but this is a…well…big job, big company.”

“Big pay, is more like it.”  She laughed.  “If you have something better than what we offer entry-level data specialists, go for it, but I doubt it.”

“Ah, good, we’re all here.”  A petite version of Beth walked in, well, Beth plus thirty years, followed by a salt-and-pepper haired guy in a close-fitting suit.  “I’m Ms. Forman, your HR rep for the interview, and this is—.”

“Collin Graham.”  The man offered his hand, and Beth shook it.  “I’ll be asking most of the questions.

“Indeed.”  Ms. Forman said.  “So, if you’ll take a seat,” she pointed to the single chair, “we’ll get started.”  They reviewed her credentials, talked to her a little bit about her studies, asked her some loose programming questions, and then the man flipped over a piece of paper and started scribbling.  He slid the paper across the table.

“Take that and review the problem set.  I’d like you to tell me what you would do with that data structure.”

“Collin, that isn’t in our interview packet.”  The HR woman said.

“I’d like to see what she’d do with something we’re *actually* working on.”

“It’s okay,” Beth said, standing up and taking the paper before sitting back down.  “These data systems are two decades apart, right?  This is legacy equipment you’re trying to integrate with these newer systems.”

“Exactly.”  Collin said.

“Okay…”  She took out a pen and started drawing a few lines on the page, wrote out a little bit of a workflow diagram.  “I can’t really solve this, of course, without seeing the actual infrastructure, but oh, here we go…”  It was almost like a logic puzzle, one step into the next, but there were some ‘steps’ that would need to be written in code and physically connected, probably.  She marked those in her workflow with variables she keyed in the margin.  She blushed briefly, realizing she had taken off her glasses and was chewing on the stem, something she did when she was thinking.  She put her glasses back on and put the paper back on the conference table, sitting back down in her seat and crossing her legs.  “I’m pretty sure that would get you moving in the right direction.  That’s probably about three to six months of work, at least, depending on how many people you put on the project.”  She was feeling fairly confident with her answer, but Collin was just staring at her.  She shifted in her seat, and crossed her legs again.  “Mr. Graham, um, is there a problem.”

“Bend you right over the table, lift up that skirt…”  He muttered.

“Excuse me?”  Beth said, not believing what she was hearing.

“Come in your face, splatter those glasses…”

“Oh, god, not again.”  Katherine rolled her eyes.

“I’m sorry, Ms. Ambrose.  This won’t affect your interview.”  She leaned over to Katherine, whispering, though, Beth could still hear them.  “Didn’t anyone send her the email about interview dress code?”

“You’re asking me?”  Katherine said.  “The skirt’s pretty long.  I honestly didn’t think it was going to be a problem.”

“Sweet little tits, I bet, pink nipples…”  Collin was still muttering to himself.

“Go get me some napkins from the table.”  Ms. Forman said, and then louder, “we’ll just a be a minute or two, and then we’ll get back to the interview.  Katherine got up, frowning a little, and grabbed a few napkins from the side table with the coffee, meanwhile, Beth watched as Ms. Forman started doing something to Collin.  A moment later, based on the movement, Beth went slightly white as it looked like the HR woman was jerking off the guy.  From her angle, farther away from the table, she tilted her head and was able to see under the table.  Beth jolted, seeing Collin’s pants undone, and an erection pointing up from the front of his boxers as Ms. Forman pumped away at it.  “Napkin, Katherine?”

“Here…here they are.”  Just as she handed them off, Collin started coming, and Ms. Forman caught it in the napkins.

“Oh, fuck me, mother fucker…oh, fuck, yes!”  Collin cried out, arching his neck, and apparently fully enjoying his impromptu orgasm.  He eased back in his seat and glanced over at Ms. Forman.  “Thanks.”  He said.  “Sorry about the interruption.

“You can clean yourself the rest of the way up.”  She replied, looking down at his still exposed member.  He ignored her, grabbing the paper from the table and looking it over.

“This is good work, Ms. Ambrose, a little more expensive procedure than we could probably get approved, but it shows some real creativity.  I’m satisfied.”

“I bet.”  Katherine muttered, but Collin appeared to ignore it.  Collin stood up, his suit pants undone and being held up by one hand.  He put his cock away and tucked in his shirt before zipping up.

“Expect to hear from us soon, Ms. Ambrose.”  He stepped around the table, offering his hand, the one that had just put his penis away.  Not knowing what to do, Beth simply stood and shook his hand.

“Um, thank you for the opportunity to interview, sir.”  He smiled at her and walked out.

“Again, my apologies, Ms. Ambrose.”  Ms. Forman said, balling up the come filled napkins and walking over to a waste bin.  “This sort of thing doesn’t normally happen, but, well, it was better to take care of it than reschedule your interview.

“Um, okay.”  Beth said.

“I think things went very well, otherwise,” she continued, and while I can’t say at this moment that you have the job, I would recommend you keep close to your phone.”  She smiled politely.  “Katherine, could you see Ms. Ambrose out?”  Ms. Forman shook her hand before leaving, and Beth tried to ignore that it was also the hand that she’d used to jerk off Collin.

“Come on, Bethany, I’ll walk you down to the lobby.”

“Um, you can call me Beth.”


“Sure,” she said as they got in the elevator.  “Look,” she said as the doors slid closed, “don’t let the disruption of the interview bother you.  They liked you, you did well.  You almost certainly have the job, so they’ll take Friday to process the paperwork, and you’ll hear by Monday or Tuesday next week.  My suggestion is, take the job, and if you do, *then* I’ll call you Beth, okay?”  Beth nodded blankly, and Katherine led her back to the security desk.  There was a woman there, then, and she took back her visitor’s badge without comment.  She walked back to her apartment, which wasn’t that far from the corporate center of the city, but not a great neighborhood after dark—not because it wasn’t safe, but everything basically closed after business hours.  She tried not to dwell on the strange interview, that filthy comments the guy had made about her…but she kept seeing the HR woman giving him a hand job…casually, as if it was nothing out of the ordinary.  She kept herself busy with take out, stupid internet games, and reading.  She barely left her apartment the whole weekend other than to go run and buy some basic groceries.

Beth was woken at eight in the morning on Monday by a phone call.  She rolled over in bed and grabbed her phone.

“Ms, Ambrose, it’s Ms. Forman from Brannon HR.”

“Yes, um, yes, of course, how are you?”  She sat up in bed, trying to sound more awake.

“Well, I won’t beat around the bush.  We’d like to offer you a position with Brannon Industries, in fact, if you can make it into the office by nine, we can in-process you today, and you can have orientation as well.  I don’t, of course, mean to put pressure on you if you want to take time to think about it.  The offer still stands if you need a few days.”  Beth glanced at the clock.  It was 8:07.  She’d have to take a cab, spend money she really didn’t have, but she could just make it by nine.

“Um, yes, I’ll take job.  I can be there by nine.”  She was already getting out of bed, fumbling with unbuttoning her pajama top one-handed.

“Lovely.  You likely won’t see me today, but I’m sure we’ll cross paths.  Same as for the interview, go to security, and they’ll provide a badge and tell you where.  And may I be the first to say, congratulations.”  Beth thanked her and hung up.  She gave up trying to unbutton her pajama top and just yanked it over her head, followed by pulling down her shorts.  She padded naked into the bathroom and took the quickest shower in her life, just getting her hair wet enough to comb out, and using the hairdryer on her hair and body.  She normally laid her clothes out the night before, so she was scrambling around her room, still naked, when she glanced over at the window and saw that the curtains were open, not only that, a guy was outright watching her, and…

“Ugh, not again.”  The guy was jerking off.  She couldn’t see his face due to sun reflecting in the window glass, but she wasn’t going to give him more of a show.  She flipped him off as she covered her breasts with one hand, pulling the curtains closed.  She grabbed the first clean bra and panties she could find, and then put on one of her three suits.  Black, this time, heels to match.  She called a taxi on her phone as she as heading out the door, and a few minutes later it pulled up.  “The Brannon building.”  The driver nodded, but he didn’t look back.  She had fifteen minutes, and she got there with five to spare.  She pre-authorized payment through the taxi app before they even arrived, and got out, dashing into building.  The same woman from last Thursday was behind the security desk.

“Welcome, Ms. Ambrose.  You’ll want floor nine.  Your badge gives you access to most of the building.  The floors you can’t reach are with escort only, but your badge will allow you to re-enter the elevator should you get off on the wrong floor.  Floor nine, remember?”  She slid the badge across the desk.  “Have a good day.”  Bath nodded and moved toward the elevators, careful as she stepped on this time.  At floor nine, she saw a large placard indicating ‘Welcome New Hires’.  She followed the arrows, and a woman directed her into a room with a handful of other women sitting inside.

“I think you’re our last one.”  The woman at the front of the room said.  She counted the people sitting, Beth included, and then started calling names.  After she was done, she launched into a series of presentations on benefits, retirement, stock options, non-compete clauses, and numerous other elements.  Beth filled out sheet after sheet of paperwork, felt a little overwhelmed.  “That was the hard part, ladies.”  The woman said.  “A representative from your office will be waiting outside to take you to lunch, and after that, you’ll meet your teammates and find you desk, that sort of thing, but we are done here, so, welcome to Brannon Industries.”  Beth stood, stretching a moment, before following the other people into the hallway.  She was pleasantly surprised to see Katherine waving to her out in the hallway.  At least she knew someone, sort of.

“Hey, Beth, welcome aboard.  I’m starving.  Let’s go get lunch.  There was a bit of a wait for the elevators, but the cafeteria was the entirety of the second floor of the building.  Food was covered up to fifteen dollars if you worked in certain departments, and data analytics was apparently one of those departments.  That would save Beth money, if nothing else.  They got sandwiches and drinks and found a small table near a window overlooking the front entrance.  “So, any big questions?”  Katherine asked.

“Um, I guess not.  It’s a little hard to think about retirement and such at 22, but I understood it all.”

“Trust me, it seems just as far off at 28, though I’d still recommend you take advantage of our 401k matching, at least.”

“I did think it was weird that there were only women in my benefits briefing.  Is Brannon trying hire more women?”

“Well, um, yes, aren’t all companies?  We keep the men and women separate during new hire briefings.  We don’t want anyone signing paperwork under the influence.”

“I don’t understand…”  Beth said.

“Like, what happened in your interview.”  Katherine offered.

“Um, now that you mention it, what was, um, that about?  Does Mr. Graham have some sort of condition?”  Katherine laughed, but then saw the expression on Beth’s face.

“Oh, you’re serious?  You went to good tech schools, but did you, like, grow up in Alabama or something?”

“No, I still don’t really—.”

“You came into the interview wearing a skirt, started sucking on your glasses,” Beth blushed, “and Collin got excited.”

“But, um, Ms. Forman, she, um…”  Beth lowered her voice.  “She, um, *manually*, um…”

“She jerked him off, yeah, so what?”  She looked up at Beth.  “If we interrupted the interview, we would have had to reschedule.  There’s just not a lot of room in schedule for that sort of thing, so it was faster to just take care of him, get him back to his old self, and kepp going.  Trust me, I’m glad Reggie—Ms. Forman—took care of it.  I certainly wasn’t going to do it, and we don’t ask people being interviewed to help.”

“You’re—you’re serious.”

“Okay, I can’t believe I’m having this conversation with you, but, have you had sex before?”  She nodded.  “With men?”

“Um, yes…”

“So, when they get hard, their brains just sort…you know, go all dumb animal.  There isn’t enough blood in a man’s body to maintain an erection *and* full critical thinking skills.”

“That’s insane!”  Beth blurted.

“Oh my god, are you really this naïve?  Your college classes had to be segregated by sex, at least.”

“They weren’t…”

“Beth, come on, really…this isn’t funny anymore.  Look, company policy is that if a man phases out—we use the HR-approved term for popping a boner—it is up to those present to either phase him back in—the hand job or whatever—or leave the room until he loses the boner or takes care of it himself.  That usually takes longer, so a lot of women just help out in meetings or whatever.”

“They…they give the guy…a, um, handjob?”

“There’s nothing that says you *can’t* get down on your knees—I’ve seen it happen a few times—and it’s faster, that’s for sure.  I mean, hell, before our last shareholder conference call, one of our senior VPs let three different presenters fuck her just so they would be on their game during the call.  I mean, she’s very attractive, so I get it, but part of me just thinks she likes letting her underlings fuck her.”  Beth said nothing.  These people were crazy, but then, they were also paying her crazy money for a 22-year-old.  “I don’t get invited to speak at shareholder meetings, of course, but I heard Ms. Prentice wasn’t even wearing panties that day, she just undid her pants, stepped out of them, and let them bend her over the conference table.  It kind of makes me wonder, though, did she have jizz dripping out of her the whole call, or—.”

“Please, just, um, stop…we’re, um, eating, right?”

“Sorry, no, you’re right.  Look, you’re new, so a lot of the guys will try to take advantage of that, phase out around you—there are tricks to make it happen, as I’m sure you remember from high school (but, of course, Beth didn’t)—and they’ll try to get you to help them out.  It’s always your choice of course, but it’s kind of a hazing.  Regardless of the stories you might hear, none of us has ever been double-teamed in the office, none of us has ever gone around the world.”

“What?”

“Around the world…phased in *all* guys in the office…maybe that’s a Brannon phrase…I don’t know.  I hate to say it, but if someone actually did do that, they’d be a slut…I know that’s sexist, but come on…there are at least a dozen men in most departments, even if we do outnumber them two to one.”  Beth blinked at that, but looking around the cafeteria, she realized it *was* mostly women.  She casually picked up her phone and made a note to do some research when she got home…something was…off.  “Look, my suggestion is, get some pants suits.  Guys are less likely to react to that.  I know, I know,” she held up her hand fending off an expected attack, “women can wear whatever they want, but other women will look down on you if you dress too sexy.  People think you’re just trying to take advantage of the men.  I mean, in some respects, I figure if biology made them like that, who are we *not* to take advantage, but that’s politically incorrect to broadcast.  Still, that doesn’t mean I don’t have my suits custom tailored to accentuate my ass, that I don’t always have a little bit of cleavage, that I don’t wear sexy underwear.  I mean, I won’t *always* look this good.”  Beth said nothing, but realized that Katherine meant and believed everything she said.  Either Beth was crazy, or the whole world was, and neither was a great answer.  “Let’s take you up to meet the team.”

They left the cafeteria, and Beth was struck by how little she’d been paying attention.  Women were running most things, even the cafeteria, and as they went up to the 14th floor, Data Strategies &amp; Analysis, she saw mostly women in the office in what was otherwise a male-dominated major at her school.  She was introduced to a few people, shown her desk, away from the windows, sadly, and then led to her boss’s office.  Inside, striking redhead sat behind the desk.  She was wearing a beautiful suit, and looked immaculate.  There was room for six people to sit in front of her work station—it would have been rude to call it just a desk—and two of the seat were occupied.

“Oh, Katherine, and you must be Bethany Ambrose.”  The redhead got up from her desk.  She had to be just over six feet tall.  She shook Beth’s hand and nodded to the other’s.  “That’s Alison Schmidt, data resource specialist, and James Garden, one of our best male coders.”  James gave a slight frown but stood up to shake Beth’s hand.  He was lean guy, but very attractive, and Beth always liked guys with close-cropped hair.  James sat back down, and the redhead, her boss, stood with her back to him.  “Lastly, I’m Meredith Masters.  Most people just call me Em.  Do *not* call me ma’am or sir or boss, okay?  We don’t work like that here, and—.”  Alison laughed, interrupting.  “Yes, Alison.”

“I think James likes what you’re wearing today, Em.”  Alison said, pointing to the relatively still figure of James, very focused on Em’s ass.

“Lovely.”  Em rolled her eyes at Beth as is to say, what can you do?  Sha glanced over her shoulder.  “James, will you come over here, please.”  He lurched up and walked the few steps to stand next to them.  Even to Beth it was clear he had an erection.  “These boys, they see something they like, and,” she snapped her fingers, “out like a light.  James is brilliant, aren’t you James?”

“Grab that ass, rip your panties off with my teeth…”

“But he’s not much of a coder like this, is he?  However delightful some of his thoughts might be.”  Em reached out and stroked the front of James’s pants, and the man almost purred.  “The work here is challenging.  The hours are sometimes long, but we’re not nearly as bad as some teams in that respect.  For example, I’ll likely never have you in here on a weekend, and we like to have fun, too.  Drink in the office, coding challenges, Nerf fights…all that nerdy CS bullshit.  I came to it late.  I got my MBA first, before doing crash courses in coding, so I don’t get the nerd stuff as much.  James, why don’t you take out your cock?”

“I was going to introduce Beth to the server integration folks, and—.”

“Oh, don’t be a spoilsport, Kat.  I know you and James used to be an item, but how can you not want to share that cock with world.  It’s just us girls here.”  Beth stood silently as James wrestled his cock out of his fly.  Alison laughed as Beth took a step back.  “My god, look at it!  Ten inches.  I measured.  I mean, really, most men are barely functional with an average of five inches, and he has double that.  Go ahead, Beth you can touch it.  He wants you to.”  Before she could stop her, Em, had taken her hand and placed it around James’s shaft.  His skin was hot and smooth, and she felt him stiffen in her grip.  Em started stroking him having Beth do it with her.  “It honestly takes two hands to get him done quickly.  Are you sure you don’t want ot get in on this, Kat?”

“No, ma’am.”  Katherine answered with more than a little frost in her voice.

“Oh, she’s upset.”  Em made a mocking face.  “Go outside, then, and close the door behind you.”  She started to move, and Beth went to follow, though Em grabbed her by the wrist.  “Not you.”  She glanced at Katherine, but she was already closing the door behind her.  “I’m sure Katherine gave you a rundown about how things work here at Brannon, but it’s the same at most of the big companies.  What I’ll ask of you,” she said, still stroking James’s large cock, is what I ask of all my female employees: You are to do your job to the best of your abilities *and* keep this office running smoothly.  James is part of us running smoothly.”

“I’m not sure I—.”  Beth started, but Em talked right over her.

“He really is a brilliant programmer, and I need him working as much as possible with limited,” she looked down at his erection, “interruptions.  While I admit, this one may be *my* fault, I need all of my teammates to step up when called upon.”

“Um, of course, Em.”  Beth said.

“Excellent!”  Em beamed.  “Then if you don’t mind,” she let go of James’s erection, my arm is getting tired, and I need to make a phone call.”  Beth turned to leave.  “No, Bethany, finish him off.  We need him phased back in.”  Beth blinked, realizing what he boss was asking of her.  “I’d prefer you take him in your mouth.  I know you may not have experience with ones that big, but the technique is the same, and using a free hand speeds it along.  I don’t want him coming on my carpet.  Alison, I’ll see you at four for our meeting, okay?”  Alison nodded, and moved past Beth, but not before whispering in her ear: I’m kind of jealous.  Beth was still frozen in place when Em sat at her desk and picked up her phone.  “Well, come on, it’s big, but it won’t bite.”  Beth knew she had a decision to make, and it was her first day.  She looked at her boss, who was busy dialing a number, and then back to James.  He was looking at her and lightly teasing his own erection.  She closed her eyes and took breath, but she found herself getting on her knees and taking his cock in her hand before guiding it to her lips.  It wasn’t as if she hadn’t gone down on guys before.  It wasn’t even the first time she’d dome it with a relative stranger, but at work?  With her boss watching…well, not watching, disinterestedly glancing.

“Oh, fuck your blonde pussy…”  James muttered as she started blowing him.

“Gail?  It’s Em, how are you, you old cunt?”  She laughed.  “No, I’m fine, too?  The kids?  Good, good.  Honestly, I’m ready for mine to go off to college, but that’s a few years from now.  Still, I’m glad I had all girls.”  Beth didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but she also didn’t necessarily want to concentrate on the fact that she was giving a colleague a blow job.  “What do you say we go to the club around six, tonight?  Oh, come on, your reports can wait until the morning.  I’m feeling like a steak, and to be honest, I’ve been soaking my panties for days.  Yeah, the husband’s been out of town visiting family.  Don’t get me wrong, I like a good vibrator session as much as the next gal, but a little hot co—.”  She laughed.  “It’s funny you should ask, he’s here right now.  Our latest hire is going down on him right now.  Oh, she’s blushing.  Say hi, Beth.”  Em held up the phone, and Beth pulled back and said hello.  “She’s shy, I think.  No, I’m not inviting her.  No one needs to see their boss get drunk and handsy on the first day, and I plan to do more than get handsy…Oh, please, what your husband or my husband doesn’t know, can’t hurt them, besides my husband *likes* to watch.”  James started coming.  Beth had been paying more attention to the phone call than her task at hand.  She had no choice but to swallow, and he filled her mouth twice over.  Em held out a tissue to her, and she took it, dabbing her mouth.  “For his tip, girl…my carpets, remember?”  Beth hastily wiped James’s tip and put him back in his pants, even zipping him up.  It took a moment, but he blinked into awareness.

“Oh, hey, um, sorry…I know it’s your first day.  That was, um, a good blow job?”  He said it like question, but Beth figured it was hard to turn that into a really effective compliment.  He helped her up.

“You two can go.”  Em said to them.  “James, I need your scripts by five-thirty.  Beth, good work.  I look forward to seeing what else you can do.”  She turned back to her phone call as they left the office.

Katherine was still waiting outside.  James muttered a half-hearted greeting to her, and turned a corner.  Katherine frowned for a moment, but then shook her head.

“I’m not mad at you.  She does it to all of us…the blowjob thing.  I should have warned you.  I just didn’t expect James to be there.  You did blow him, right?”  Beth nodded.

“Seriously, we are not together anymore, haven’t been in over a year.  Dating a guy with a big dick is…well, it’s a lot of maintenance.  He phased out a lot, too.  The guy gets horny a lot.  I was happy to meet his needs, even at work, but then the other women—and not just in this office—found out about his size, and it got complicated very quickly.  When most of the women you know have had some sort of sex with your boyfriend, things get awkward really quickly.  You’re one us now, at least, so the next blow job is entirely up to you.  Let’s go meet some of the other folks.”

6ooypv,1,2017-07-21,Humanities degree and no good options: What can I do career-wise?,AnxiousMillennial,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ooypv/humanities_degree_and_no_good_options_what_can_i/,"Hello, /r/personalfinance. I need your help. I'm in my late 20s, make 37k a year before taxes (in a city that requires at least 60k to live independently), have little savings, and only a BA in History.

I've looked at law (and have family who work as lawyers), but it looks like I'd need to take on a massive 200k+ debt in order to enter a highly competitive market which already has way too many attorneys, all to do a job that doesn't really interest me and which (if I did corporate law) would oblige me to represent business interests I disagree with ethically. If it was just a golden ticket to a sure retirement, sure. But if I take on that kind of debt I would need to take on high pay, high stress legal jobs which would leave me with no time to finance anything I'm interested in. On top of this, I just don't think I have the temperament for that kind of law job. I don't deal well with high, high stress and am not a type-A personality. I can keep up high stress periods for a time, but after a few weeks I'm already exhausted. If this is compounded by not getting any meaning out of my job, and a deathball of debt chasing me, it all sounds like a recipe for severe depression and maybe a mental breakdown.

The job market in academia seems bleak, and looks like it'll get worse by the time I finish any post-grad program. It also has the added risk that if I fail to make tenure, I'd be in my late 30s or early 40s with little to no savings or job prospects. I would also have to postpone starting a family until really late and if I met someone in the meantime it seems likely that money troubles, the need to relocate to any university which will have me, etc., would add on tons of stress and possibly destroy that relationship.

Think-tanks are an option, but they seem to work more on the basis of them reaching out to you than you just applying. They also don't seem to be hiring. The few jobs I see open up are focused on issues I know nothing about. Most jobs look like internships. Maybe the idea is turning an internship into a job? I don't know enough about think-tanks to know if taking a huge dock in pay to work at a think-tank (and presumably live off my savings in the meantime) is actually a wise investment.

I know a good deal about immigration and can work as a paralegal in that field, but it is a dead-end job which, if you're doing immigration para-legal work, seems to cap off around 50k a year, maybe 60k and change if I have tons of experience.

I just feel trapped, stuck, and anxious that I have no 'good' options. It isn't just that there is risk of not making it to the top of my field; it's that if I fail in academia or some pie-in-the-sky think-tank job, I will be left with nothing by the time I'm middle aged.

This is also taking a huge toll on my mental health. I'm still living with family right now. I can't get independent because I have no job prospects, I have difficulty finding a partner because my 'stuck' situation makes me a tough sell as a long term relationship, and being stuck and alone makes me more anxious and more unable to function in my current job. I have friends who are worse off than I am. I have no debts, no major health issues, and no kids, so I can relocate to wherever, but I feel like I need to have something concrete. I need to be able to pay my own way by 30 at the absolute latest so I can actually accrue some damned savings before I'm too old to work. And for my mental health I need some kind of plan that offers a degree of security as long as I work hard.

I just don't know what to do."

NEED HELP,WannabeEngr,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/6op09q/modeling_a_small_river_system_in_hec_ras_need_help/,"I'm an intern using HEC RAS for the first time.  The assignment I'm working on is to make a settling basin to catch large rocks in order to stop them from falling down a gabion chute and eroding it.  

The small ~160 acres watershed above it channelized into 3 different streams.  I used a program that basically uses the Rational Method to find flow rates for 100 year events in each of the streams.  The flow rates are something like 110 cfs, 20 cfs, and 9 cfs.  The 3 streams meet at roughly the same point.  

So I used LiDAR data in AutoCAD, created the alignments and cross sections, and imported the 3 reaches into HEC RAS.  I'm assuming steady flow (via instruction from my boss).  I inputted the aforementioned flowrates, using a sum of them for the downstream channel (after the junction). 

So then I run the simulation and look at profiles for each of the tributaries.  The depths start off realistic, matching the shapes of the naturally formed channel beds.  But then, progressing down the streams, the depths linearly increase until they're like 40 feet deep (obviously incorrect).  There lies my problem.

I have a feeling my problem could lie in the boundary conditions that I used when setting up the steady flow data.  Or could it be that I didn't make the cross sections wide enough in autocad?  Any suggestions?  Ask for additional data and I will give it.  Thanks everyone.

6oprtz,0,2017-07-21,My case study for treating CFS (How I improved my symptoms quite a bit),sparkythedawg176,cfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/6oprtz/my_case_study_for_treating_cfs_how_i_improved_my/,"**Summary: Scroll down to the bold at the bottom for a summary. This post is most likely only relevant to those whose CFS is based in emotional trauma, not viruses. Sadly, this is a case study, and may or may not help you**

So it seems that most people who have CFS fall into two categories; emotional trauma, or recovery from some sort of virus

I fall in the first category. I was sexually abused a few years ago. Later my (the only girl I had loved) girlfriend at the time cheated on me, probably a few weeks later. I sort of just suppressed the pain from both of these scenarios. Especially because getting sexually abused as a male humiliated me. A few ""friends"" actually made fun of me and told me I was lying about the sexual abuse. Getting cheated on hurt too. But salted the first wound of sexual trauma. I was young and didn't know how to process both events, so I shoved it out of my conscious mind.

Anyways, I felt heartbroken. Didn't trust anyone. I managed to get by for a few years. I got into a great university program. Functioned fine. I was happy as I put both scenarios behind me. And then the story that is so familiar to many on this sub happened. 2 years later I woke up one day feeling flusih and weak. Slight. but not much. My vision was blurry. I felt like I had no energy after a full night of sleep. I felt sort of out of it. Things got worse. At the end of the week I felt like a different person. I was wheezing, coughing. Tons of migraines. I was dizzy all the time. Congested and a weak immune system. It hit me like a train. I felt off. I didn't know what to do about it or what happened. I tried every treatment available and thought I had cancer or something serious. Doctors told me ""it's all in your head"". Nothing had changed. I was doing the same exact things daily. Why would it be in my head? What the fuck was going on with my body? I found this subreddit and other CFS communities and realized that I most likely had CFS. After 6 months of healthy diet, sleep, and constant blood tests, one doctor concluded this as well. I believe 6 months is the ""cutoff"" point where on can say that they most likely have CFS
https://www.google.com/search?q=chronic+fatigue+syndrome&amp;oq=chronic+fatigue+syndrome&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3919j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8

Everything in the list of symptoms that popped up when I googled CFS fit me to a ""T"". 100 percent. Every single one of them. to a pretty extreme degree

An acupuncturist tried and after 5-10 sessions she declared she unable to help me. The first few sessions helped. but I was far from cured or treated. ""You feel nervous deep down. I really don't know how you go to school being this sick, I can tell you are miserable"". Anyone who knows me knows that I rarely give a fuck about anything. But looking back, I was aching deep down. I just failed to realize it. I think I had/have a mild form of PTSD. She pointed to my hands/palms and I had this sort of twitch. She said this was one way that my nervousness was manifesting.

After 4 years of university, I managed to get through with a comp sci degree, but I pretty much had suicidal thoughts daily. Luckily, I had a friend of mine help me heavily and was kind enough to take a lot of the same classes. I also did an internship later over summer and basically worked 9-5 and slept the rest of the day. I felt like I was in a dark cartoon and I think if barbiturates were legal, I would have committed suicide (barbiturates are a heavy sedative that can painlessly off someone)

I told noone because people don't really understand CFS. they think it is made up. It is real. VERY real. It feels like every organ in your body is slowly shutting off. My mom literally got angry at me for being sick, and my dad called me a weak bitch to my face. People just don't understand. Even your loved ones

I had gotten numerous blood tests and they came out generally fine. I felt ill. my brother asked me what I felt like. I remember saying ""I feel like I am about to die all the time"". CFS in and off itself was traumatizing. I decided I would learn to live with the physical illness. But I would go to therapy to deal with the depression. I ended up disliking therapy and realizing it wasn't for me. After the 10 free sessions that were covered, I felt only marginally better. How many more times could I talk to my therapist and say ""I have this irreversible disease and have begun to question the most basic beliefs I have about the world. That there is a God. I see little point in living anymore"". It got pointless after the 3rd session. I was depressed and felt fucked over by the world. I read about hypnotherapy. I was REALLY skeptical about hypnotherapy. I decided I would set aside the $300 and consider it down the line

I ended up bumping into my ex girlfriend one day. I already felt tired as hell. But the second I bumped into her, I felt ALL of my symptoms begin to flare up. I couldn't talk and or process anything around me. I felt like just collapsing and fainting on the spot. I guess my ex was a sort of ""trigger"" for that particular phase of life. We had a few sentences of conversation before I left. That was that

A different day, the person who sexually assaulted me (a family member) was in a group text chat with me. Same thing. A flare up of symptoms as I read his text that was addressed to me.

I still hadn't made the connection here. But I was getting more and more depressed by the day. Being suicidal everyday for years gets pretty horrid

Anyways, I went to a hypnotherapist. I explained to him everything. He was the top rated hypnotherapist in the area on yelp. Nothing but positive reviews. I wasn't hoping to work with my physical symptoms as I had falsely assumed that they would stay the same for life. I wanted to work with my mental health. He crafted a track to forgive those that had hurt me, and stop a lot of my harmful mental patterns. Basically focus on accepting my reality the way it was, stop playing ""victim"" and start focusing on the few things that I could control. I wanted to basically accept that I could work as a software programmer as long as I slept 24/7 besides the 9-5 shift I was given. I guess that meant that I couldn't have a family or kids. But I could be a functional member of society. And the goal was to get to the point where I was ""okay""

Hypnotherapy basically means that a therapist constructs a track to try and adjust the negative mental patterns and blocks in your mind. Supposedly a 93% success rate within 6 sessions. most hypnotherapists get to the bottom of it in 1-3

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh4KbidJyN0

This is different than standard therapy. where the patient has a success rate of 38% in 600 sessions. or cbt with a 72% success rate in 36 sessions

I listened to the tracks for a few months now and the more ""harsh"" symptoms of my CFS seem to have decreased. It seems that much more of my CFS was connected to my deep emotional trauma than I realized. I am not ""cured"" but my symptoms are the best that they have been in the past 4-5 years. I don't think it is possible to ""cure"" CFS. At least not yet. But I do think that I have been able to treat or keep my CFS in remission. I no longer am suicidal and constantly dizzy/out of it. I am however feeling much better. I feel dizzy in the mornings and still sleep a lot. But the depression associated with my CFS is gone. And I feel wayyyy better. I don't feel ""unhappy"" or ""miserable"". I also don't have those huge bags under my eyelids and my eyes aren't low and red. I don't have that frown that I used to have. I am ""okay"" for the first time in a longggggg time. The congestion is most gone. No more migraines. That being said, I still feel shitty here and there

My dad told me that CFS was ""in my head"". I think that this statement is a slap in the face to anyone with CFS. I dont want to say that. It was never ""in my head"". It was deep emotional trauma in my mind that caused it. DEEP emotional trauma that only after 1-2 months of daily hypnosis began to decrease, that I had held on to for 5-6 years (I think?). I think now that the original stressor is out of the picture, hopefully keeping my healthy diet, and tons of rest constant, I can go to a 100% remission. Lets cross our fingers!

The hypnotherapist does little ""check ins"" every two weeks. After I told him that my symptoms had decreased he remarked that as we trap tons of ""baggage"" in our subconscious mind, it builds up. Sometimes, this can cause damages many years later. This happened to be my case. It came out in CFS. He also said that he had another patient with similar CFS type symptoms that had been largely cleared after hypnotherapy. He said that another patient had epilepsy and depression. Hypnotherapy greatly improved both of those. Unfortunately, neither me or the other 2 patients in question were cured. But their quality of life GREATLY improved and their symptoms decreased and became much more manageable after this. And had continued to improve overtime


**tl:dr; take this as a case study. CFS seems to be so complex and individual to each person, so what worked for me may not work for you. But for me, anger and hatred towards my ex girlfriend who cheated on me in addition to a family member who sexually abused me in the course of a month caused a pretty deep sense of emotional trauma. Looking back, it was a lot of anger for a 17 year old to have and a really fucked up set of scenarios/situations to deal with. Whatever negative emotions I had, I shoved to the back of my head. I guess many years later, it manifested in whole bunch of weird and unexpected ways, namely CFS, a sort of twitch and possibly some PTSD. If you feel that you feel you have CFS and that it is connected to your emotions, try CBT and hypnotherapy. They work much better than therapy in my experience, and are scientifically more efficient.

Advice?,Acebelladona,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6opwgh/trying_to_decide_between_two_resume_formats_advice/,"Hello. I'm currently a College Junior and I am beginning to apply for internships, with the goal of obtaining one for Summer 2018. As such, I have been trying to optimize and improve my resume. 

A couple of days ago, a good friend of mine offered to look at my resume and tweak it, since they have more experience. They sent their revised copy back to me today, but I'm not sure if it's up to the proper standards. It looks fairly cluttered to my eyes. I'm also doubtful that my high school needs to be included.

I have attached both resumes (personal information redacted). The original is Resume1 and the edit is Resume2. Resume2 has not been changed from the copy I received from my friend. There are areas in Resume 2 that I still need to fill in, but I would like to know if it actually usable first. 

My question is this: Which format looks more professional and is more likely to attract positive attention when I am applying? Should I use neither format and go with something else entirely?

I would also greatly appreciate any further advice on improving my resume, regardless of which format I choose. Thank you so much to all of you.

26yo male. I started school when I was 23 and have 16 classes(4 semesters) remaining in my Bachelors of Science in Information Systems at the University of Utah. I am currently interning with a great CA based software company at their Utah offices. I make $22/h until the internship ends in late August. I've been trying to save this summer while also enjoy my personal life and at the end of summer I'll have roughly $14,000 in savings.

Current plan for the last few months has been to go back to school in August and continue taking 4 classes a semester. This fall I have a few time consuming classes and was planning to be frugal and not work in order to make sure I'm doing well in school and not wasting any time or money by failing. I've gotten to this point and only taken out one $6000 subsidized loan in order to keep money in my pocket for living, and I've also gotten $7000 of next year's $8000 tuition paid for with a couple grants I was fortunate to get.

A few other things that influence this. I'm pretty happy to be getting a valuable technical/business degree in an area with a massive influx of tech companies. I've also proven myself to be pretty valuable in the job market by trying to straddle the line between business and tech knowledge while also being incredibly personal and a good communicator(which is 100% of the reason I've been able to get good internships). I know I want to work for tech/software companies, but not as a developer. My current internship is for Implementation/Professional Services and it definitely interests me, but it's not a long term dream that's for sure. Ultimately I'd like to do some sort of management or decision making, but that's down the road so most of all I just want real world experience and to get my foot in the door with good companies and make good connections. 

The company I'm interning with right now is awesome. Well established and managed, they've got an industry leading position and money to research and grow. Good culture and work/life balance, stock options(currently $91), no 401k match yet but its been a conversation. I don't have details on the salary of the position yet. I'm assuming $60-70k, which is huge for me as up to this summer in my life I've never made more than $13/h. The position will ultimately be something I could work remotely with, which would be great for working with school, but I genuinely dont think I can handle that work load. I know both will suffer under the stress. I could take fewer classes each semester, but I have to get my degree. Its huge for me personally as well as career wise, but I'm 26 and have barely made any money in my life and feel so behind as far as earnings and retirement go. It will be so long before I can afford a home let alone put a huge percent of money down for retirement.

I come from a pretty poor family. I dont think either parent made much more than $15/h. My dad died a few years ago and my mother has financial troubles of her own. I have a small family and nobody can offer me much more than a couch to sleep on if things go south financially. So for all intents and purposes, I'm pretty alone in my life and school, and dont have any kind of support. I'm noting this because it comes into play when making decisions about my future, and this one is a pretty big one. I've done a good job being frugal and saving while still trying to enjoy life and make good decisions. I had saved almost $40,000 at one point but I ended up not working for a while and studying on my own to place higher in math and focus on school. Not really relevant but I studied math all last summer and was able to place 2 courses higher and save $2200 and 2 semesters. Stoked about that. Like I said, now I'm down to about $14,000 and have to try to be smart about spending and jobs while still being efficient with school and time. Thats be biggest struggle. I'm pretty stressed about money and scared about hardships. I'm on a good path education and career wise, but with 4 semesters left it still feels so far away. I want to make money and sense that comfort, but I also really want to finish school. 

I appreciate any input and ideas. Thanks"

6os8k3,0,2017-07-21,Question about short-term capital losses offsetting income/future capital gains,iroha2,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6os8k3/question_about_shortterm_capital_losses/,"Preface: Short term capital losses are treated as income

So let's say this year I lose $5k in the stock market, and I have income of $4k. Let's say my tax bracket is in the 10% bracket. I am subject to pay $400 for taxes, so I assume I can use $400 from the losses I have and not pay any taxes, making it so I still have $4600 in short term capital losses to use for future years.

This is scenario 1, is my assessment correct? Or is it the case where I have to use $4000 from my capital losses on the entire $4000 of my income, which also wipes out my taxes, but only leaves me with $1k to use for future tax offsetting instead of $4600. Please tell me this is not actually the case, otherwise I'd feel pretty screwed.

Now let's say the second option isn't the case. Let's say I now get a good internship paying $10k a month for 3 months, netting me $30k in income and I have to pay 15%, or $4500 in taxes. Could I use up to $3k from my capital losses in prior years to make it so my tax bill is only $1500? Or does it only work where you can take off $3000 from the $30K you made, making it so you pay 15% of 27k in income, or $4050.

As you can see, the difference is quite substantial. If capital losses can be subtracted from the actual tax bill you are due, then in theory you can get all your money back, granted you have sufficient income. If capital losses are taken from your income, and then the tax bill is calculated, you can only get a small percentage of your losses back.

Like many people, my passion is film. I love reading about the history of movies, reading about the actors and directors, and of course watching lots of movies. I've had conversations with my dad who is a wise man and I respect his opinions about the idea of film school, and he has said that movies should be more of a hobby than what my life is based around. You don't (always) see someone who grew up love reading books become an author. Just because you've read alot a books dosen't mean you will be a great author. I believe in a way that's the same for film. You can watch all 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die and have no idea how to use a DSLR or any video editing software. Sure you might have great ideas and ambitions, but thinking realisticly, do dreams really come true? There's a quote somewhere that says ""Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."" As wise as Confucius was when he said that, I'm not so sure it has aged very well. Both my parents believe that I should become a computer programmer, but I find that boring and quite honestly I don't want to have to spend the next 40 years or so of my life, 8 hours a day, in front of a monitor typing out strings of gibberish for whatever company I'm working for. But if I can use the very minimal computer knowledge I do have to help out in the business industry, I believe the idea of knowing that I am technically working with movies will make me feel alot better. I'm sorry for this rant and if I've contradicted myself anywhere. To be honest, I'm quite tired and just wanted to get these ideas out before I go to bed. I guess what I'm trying to say is, when I get out of highschool should I stick with the route of being an engineer or programmer which I don't enjoy, just because I will make more money and probably be better off, or should I live my life doing what I love, which is studying film school and probably finding whatever job I can to help pay for the school bills, probably be more stressful, but will be doing what I love. And, when I get out of film school, where would I go from their? An internship? That might get me somewhere, but then what's next? I hope I'm speaking for all highschoolers who are conflicted with the thought between passion and reality. I know that getting anywhere in life isn't easy, and especially in the film world. I'm still young and my knowledge of the world and in movies is still very immature, but I would love to learn more and I hope somebody with more experience than me can share their thoughts or maybe some links to websites that explain stuff a little more."

I always hated that term, and saw it as a fuckboy's excuse for being delusional.  But lo and behold it happened to me, textbook definition friend zoned.  To make a long story short it was partially my (21/male) fault for not being assertive quick enough, partially hers (20/f) for intentionally leading me on.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, shortly before a night when I tried to kiss her and everything went to shit, she had sent me a super nice letter saying how much she appreciated me in her life.  In one sentence she wrote, ""I owe you a lifetime and more.""  And the day after the failed kiss night, she sent me a sobbing voicemail apologizing for leading me on so long, that she just didn't want to hurt the feelings of someone she cared about so much.  At one point in the sobbing voicemail she referred to me as her ""soulmate best friend.""  Since that night, the dynamic between us has been a huge shit show to say the very least.  She kept dodging opportunities to ""talk it all out,"" but kept insisting we brush the whole thing under the rug and act like it was all normal (sending happy go lucky snapchats, etc).

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward a couple months, and things are even more fucked up.  She failed to reciprocate any enthusiasm to meet and just talk it out in the amount of time before she needed to head out of town for her summer internship.  When she immediately acted like she cared again as soon as she left town, I saw this as phony and went into silent treatment mode.  I felt bad a few weeks in, after not replying to a couple of her snapchats (she gave up after just a couple--she's a rather shy vulnerable person).  I sent her a text saying I really wanted to hear about her adventures out of town, to which she enthusiastically responded, ""Yes let's talk!"".  When I (quite unfortunately) happened to become unavailable when I said I'd be free for phone call the next day, she got super passive aggressive.  My every subsequent attempt to get her on the phone has been futile (usually her bailing).  I even mailed her a letter apologizing for both our ambiguous relationship beforehand, and my behavior after ""the incident.""  She texted me a thank you, and that she wanted to talk.  Earlier this week I texted her saying, ""You free to talk tonight?""  She said yes, failed to answer the phone call, and gave a lame excuse.  Later this week she contacted me while she knew from my snapchat story that I was in the middle of a concert.  She was asking to talk that night, but I needed to be up early the next day so I politely told her some other time.  I have not heard a word from her since.  I'm guessing she knew I'd be unavailable to talk during/after that concert, so the request to talk was more of an empty gesture?  Or am I just being too skeptical of motives?

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think this chick is creeped out by me and wants nothing to do with me, even friend-wise at this point?  Is the ball in her court, or should I keep trying to get a degree of closure (remember, she's kind of timid and vulnerable)?  I'm at the point where I would be THRILLED to be simply friends with her, assuming she doesn't just feel sorry for me and call me a friend out of pity.  Aside from being attractive, she's a really great girl with a good heart, and has had a hugely beneficial impact on my life.  It'll be hard to forgive myself if it all goes to shit over such an embarrassing misunderstanding."

I will be making enough money to build a decent gaming rig. I will also be working during the school year to make more money. I've wanted a gaming pc ever since I was about 11 years old when I got into MMOs. I want to know if having a gaming pc in a dorm room will be a nuisance for me or any possible room mates. When I apply for colleges and choose which college I will go to next year, I will try to obtain a single, but that's very unlikely to happen. What worries me the most is the possibility of having my stuff stolen: gaming gear(mouse, headset, keyboard), chair, the monitor, or even the pc itself. I have pondered the thought of buying a gaming laptop, but I would very much like to experience building my very own pc for the first time and also saving money. So, is having a gaming pc in college practical, or is it not worth the hassle?
Side note: I know I could be saving this money to buy books or save it for just-in-case situations(and I'm still wondering if that's the right thing to do), but having a gaming pc has been a dream of mine throughout my entire adolescence and I feel like the happiness it will give me will far exceed the financial burden(s) I will take on."

6otn11,6,2017-07-22,Another night alone.,chopchopmuffintop,drunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/drunk/comments/6otn11/another_night_alone/,"You guys always seem like a cheerful and accepting group. I figured I would say my piece here while drink some good ole vodka tonics. I have a story. The story of how the world destroyed the girl I love.

Where do I start? I fell in love with this girl about 6 months ago after moving to a new city. i was working two jobs, roughly 12 hours a day. I had accepted that this was going to be my life from now on. In walks, this girl. She's beautiful, funny, appreciates my stupid bird puns. Toucan play at this game!!

Anyways, all is well. She's got a fucked up past, I got a fucked up past, we all laugh and tell each other that's its so what. So it goes, as they say. There's one part of her past that keeps following her though. Her ex boyfriend. I didn't think it was so bad. 

Fast forward about two weeks. First he shows up at her work, they fight out side and I here all about it (I should mention that we worked together at that point, I wasn't there but at my other job). She's distraught about the whole thing but still communicates to me her feelings and all. Fast forward about a month, we're in her apartment, hanging out and talking shit. Little do we know, he's in her living room listening to our conversation. Eventually I leave for a minute and during the 15 minutes I was gone (leaving the door unlocked, cuz fuck me) he abandons a dog the two had. He literally throws the dog into her apartment and runs away. Cue me trying to be understanding and as helpful as possible but she's mentally in another place and doesn't communicate. Later, we go to the court house and these two amazing interns help her fill out all the paper work and file everything. I fucked off because she was in much better hands. Screen shots of the texts he sent her admitting that he was listening to our conversation are turned in and the restraining order gets accepted. Something, something, I'm a fuck boy and can never love her like he did.

She keeps the dog for a few days, but working and being a full-time student make it hard to have a hyper active puppy. So she has to give him up. Strike one. She spent over a year training and taking care of this dog. Her only escape from this guy's abuse was to hang out with her dog while they were together. She raised him from the time he was months old. Getting rid of him was a devastating blow to him. 

Mean time, she talks about wanting to stay in our city and be with me. We talk about moving in together and all that innocent love shit. I was just starting university and she had three more sessions to go until graduating. 

About two months after all this, I fucked up. There's a bun baking in the oven cuz we're retarded. Turns out this was the second time this happened. Again, I try to be as understanding as possible, I take time off to do the deed. I wanted to be with her and talk with her. But she wanted to be alone. Every step I made to her, she took one back. I got mad. I couldn't fathom why someone would want to be alone going through this. This was as much of my mistake as it was hers, so we should share in the guilt. She broke up with me, but didn't tell me. On a whim, I checked facebook and found out I singled. After a week of crawling back, she finally takes me, but the damage is done. She doesn't talk to me as much, she's not the same girl I fell in love with. Refuses to come to my apartment now because I told my roommates what happened. (major fuck up but they wanted to know why I was drinking vodka out of a watermelon.

All future plans are off. She doesn't talk to me about anything, just casually says that she's got a job lined up back home and she's moving back in with her parents. Doesn't want to talk about it, just says that's what is up. We barely talk. Nothing's the same. I want the girl I fell in love with back. Graduation comes, and all along I thought I would get to go, meet her family and have a good ole graduation shit fest. But turns out there's not enough tickets, so i settle for getting dinner with her family after. The minutes tick by and nothing. More nothing. I wonder wtf is going on. Turns out her parents left her, so I go to visit her. She's distant not really talkitive and I try to get her to get some drinks and just celebrate someway. She has laundry to do and I leave. 

We had plans to go on a weekender in the mountains. Cancelled, she goes by herself. Tells me we can go next weekend. Next weekend comes by. Nothing, no communication, she went off to hang out with her parents. The list of times shes bailed on me is endless. 

Three weeks ago, her ex comes back into the picture. Calls her names, says some real fucked up shit. ""You can't put a restraining order on love."" She doesn't tell me anything. Weeks of harassment that she thought she could deal with herself. Anyways, a few days ago, he shows up at her new apartment. He followed her home from work one night, he pushed her to the ground, took her phone and tried to go through it. She finally told me all this, and I want to be there for her. I'll be the first to admit, I'm a needy fuck, I probably didn't get hugged enough as a kid. But I just want to be there for her, but she pushes me away. He went through her friends list on facebook and messaged many of her guy friend's girlfriends, saying that she cheated on them. Most didn't believe her, but she still lost many of her friends. I've stood by her side throughout everything, but she just doesn't give me anything. She barely talks to me about anything substantial. I almost don't even know who she is anymore. 

We were supposed to hang out tonight. We had talked about it for the last three days. I had a big midterm that thoroughly fucked me in the ass. I wanted to get some drinks so that at least I could be wined and dined after I got fucked. We planned to get together after work but nothing. I called and sent a text that she didn't respond to for an hour. Tonight was off, she wasn't feeling up to it tonight.

So here I am, I mostly had to get this out because I've been bottling everything up for awhile. You don't have to read it. I just want that girl I fell in love with back. The one who played yugioh with me and would walk around town playing pokemon go"

6oupg7,121,2017-07-22,"Well, I'm halfway through my first year on a small farm",enlitenme,homestead,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/6oupg7/well_im_halfway_through_my_first_year_on_a_small/,"Just looking to reflect a little. My boyfriend and I moved back to his farm after a 3-year hiatus during which it was farmed by tenants - who are still there.  Sharing a farm has been especially challenging, and they take advantage of his infrastructure and maintenance. Can't wait until they're gone!  Advice on land-sharing: plan, plan, plan, inventory your stuff, and set agreements beforehand. 

We've got probably an acre cultivated, a small CSA, and for a terribly rainy spring, are finally heading to market this week. Again, better planning - we lost a lot, and didn't think up solutions fast enough (microgreens are quick fillers, and we wound up seeding beans and peas and beets in the greenhouse that should have been direct seeded) We also have 5 turkeys, 25 meat birds, 13 tamworth pigs, and are looking forward to layers but the darned tenants are using up all the outbuildings. 2 goat-lawnmowers pending. There's a 120 year-old farmhouse needing infinite renovations, a partial-barn, mechanic-shop, huge woodshed full of tenants' shit, irrigation pond, greenhouse, and I currently live in a camper van in the field and have built a screened-in pole-barn field kitchen with propane stove and sink for cooking meals and pig feed and washing veggies up. I needed a retreat!

Work is endless. I'm not sure if we're biting off too much or being inefficient. We're both away at construction jobs for 11 hours a day, but watch the tenants with jealousy because they collect disability and have all the time in the world. Constant plans for improvements, constructions and projects float around, but it's really hard to make time to do them. I've never worked so hard, with so much joy and ambition, in my life.

Weeding is also endless. I don't think we used a buckwheat cover crop to the best advantage, and I'm so tired of pulling it out and digging it under!  It's also the first year this field has been tilled up again, so the quack-grass is monstrous. My fingers have callouses. I don't have enough friends up here for a work-bee, but I would love to feed hungry weeders.

Time off the farm (and away from each other) is horribly important. Though we feel guilty leaving when there's work to be done, socializing, camping, seeing family, and just getting away solo in the camper van for a night (even a weeknight) is vital to not killing each other. Balance the obsession...

Farming is quite zen. I am learning a lot about myself and doing a lot of big-picture thinking. The growth is awesome.

Everything costs a thousand dollars. Cow? Thousand bucks. Tractor implement? Thousand bucks. Roto-tiller? Thousand bucks. Snowblower? Thousand bucks. It's hard to earmark money to go back to certain things (i.e. buy cow, slaughter cow, sell meat, profits go to buying more than one cow next year) but we've started an actual piggy-bank and some lists of goals. I sure don't feel quite broke for farming reasons, and have been able to invest a little, but work is often seasonal, part-time and in short supply here and I've had a rocky employment journey in my new home. Winter, when we have time to work off-farm, will bring new challenges.

I am constantly filthy. I'm covered in spray-lacquer, grease, and sawdust during the day and soil at night. I work in food-service once a week, and really struggle to even get the palms of my hands clean! I am wearing out clothes as fast as I can buy them, and they're all quickly getting too big, though I eat and drink a lot. I do enjoy dressing up a little when we go to town or the city!!

Finding friends (where are the GIRLS!?!?) has been tough, and they don't feel relatable. Nobody wants to come over and work, and it's tough to leave work to drive into town and socialize. What is this free-time thing? I vaguely remember a time when I could spend a day marathoning TV shows, playing video games, and sunbathing by a pool that didn't have blackflies.

Value-added processing, supplementary income, and diversified products really is essential. I can't wait to get going on the bees, rabbits, sprouts, edible flowers, preserving, and making spaces for WWOOFers or an intern to stay. I would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE a wedding barn/venue one day, but we're kind of in the middle of nowhere where nobody has any money to rent it anyway.

Planning, planning, planning. A case study in my favourite [Crop Planning](https://www.amazon.ca/Crop-Planning-Organic-Vegetable-Growers/dp/0980898714) book talks about a farm who spends the winter making a calendar of chores. Every day, those darned chores MUST get done. I think this would help with timing, not pushing things behind (the weeds will ALWAYS be there!) and assessment. I have been logging daily achievements in a document on my phone and plan to put them into a google calendar, set to repeat annually, on those dates next year. Instead of just knowing ""seed peas the X week of X month"" we could probably up our success with a more specific date and measured results. Logging, accounting, and administrative chores suck, but daily and weekly goals are kind of a lot of fun!

Just some thoughts. Having fun, learning lots!"

For now.,ashbash528,breastfeeding,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/6ouyau/our_breastfeeding_journey_is_safe_for_now/,"So my baby girl is 7 months old and while we had some bumps with a tongue and lip tie, we are still going strong! I never thought I would get to do this as her brother was a preemie and never learned to latch. After 10 weeks pumping, I couldn't do it, full time grad school, and a 3 day a week internship and have any energy left for snuggles.

Anyway, I'm bipolar and knew our time was limited because of medication. These past few weeks, I've been struggling and knew it was time. I contacted my doula for an IBLC referral to talk about how to safely switch to formula and she gave me that, plus info to call the infant risk center ""just in case new reasearch is there."" I called, with hope in my heart but also not expecting much, telling myself we had a good run. After 45 minutes on the phone, question after question, I found that lamictal isn't a no-go med for nursing. 

Talking with my psychiatrist, her pediatrician, and going over new research with them, we are gonna continue nursing while I slowly go back on my medication.  We have created a plan for of she starts having adverse effects and what dosage we all feel comfortable being my ""cut off"" for nursing.

Sorry for wall of text! No one but my husband understands my relief (for now...fingers crossed she doesn't have adverse reactions or a lower dosage hits the threshold for now.)

Any other moms on lamictal while nursing, I would LOVE to hear your stories and experiences!"

She immediately responded with ""50""!.
So kind of shocked I ask her why was her guess this high and so fast.

She admitted that some girls (friend of hers-same age) are similar, banging around 30 guys every other summer.

There's no animosity between the two of you. But you've both come to the realization that while you love each other, you feel more like best friends who live together than lovers.

You want romance in your life again. That's where I come in.

Who am I? Your daughter's friend, the new office intern, the babysitter, your son's study buddy, or even your barista? The choice is yours.

No matter which I am here's what you know about me: I'm bookish, shy and awkward. I'm insecure wanting to hide myself in a book or underneath baggy sweaters. The weather's too warm now for those sweaters and you've gotten a glance at my figure. I'm short with curves. A small chest, but the roundness of my butt makes up for it. There's a softness to me. And that smile always tinged with a blush on my pale freckly face. When I do speak; you find I'm sweet, smart and just a little funny.

You can tell no guy's ever given me the attention I deserve. You're going to change that. You're going to show me how special I am. You're going to make me your princess.

Others might sneer at our relationship. Think I'm a golddigger or that you're taking advantage of a naive twenty something. But that's not it all. What we develop is genuine. I don't care about the presents, though they are nice, I adore you because of how protective you are of me. The confidence you give me. The way you're the first person to make me feel beautiful. And you? You love my innocence. How it keeps me from playing games and makes me so affectionate. How I make you feel so masculine. It's beneficial for both of us.

So basically this rp is going to be you developing an affair with the shy virgin 20 something year old. You're gonna make me feel like a princess. Absolutely spoil me. And I'll shower you with affectionate and love. It's gonna be cute and romantic.

My kinks: first times, romance, buildup, character dynamics, height difference, legal age differences, affection, being a tease, being called baby girl/good girl, being taught/guided, playful banter, feeling like a beautiful princess, oral, sloppy makeouts and blowjobs, nerdiness

limits: rape, gore, anal, any bathroom play, vomit, violence, aggression, dickpics, being called a slut/whore etc, underage, being forced into anything

looks: short, curvy red head (wide hips, round ass but a smaller chest like 34b). very pale skin with freckles and rosy cheeks. green eyes and glasses"

I thought we were good friends, but as the years pass by, I just keep on noticing they're questionable behaviour and I'm really done with it. I don't know how I keep attracting these subtle assholes. This isn't *the* reason why I'm done with them, but I'm angry, and I don't want to go over the other stupid relationship-related stuff. This is just the last straw for me.

My friend is a professional photographer, and I'm a student. A few months ago I was visiting home, and he asked me to shoot at a fashion show for him. His company was covering media and he was busy supervising everything, and his intern wasn't experienced enough to give him the shots he wanted. No mention of pay was discussed, although I'm sure they were paid for the job, but I didn't care - it was an opportunity to work with a much nicer camera than I owned, in a professional environment, and to get some nice pieces for my portfolio. I got great shots, on the runway, and backstage.

A few days later, as he was going through the pictures, he messaged me, gushing about how great the pictures were. I was flattered of course. He sent me a screenshot of one that he had edited. That's all that I've seen of my finished photos.

It's been two fucking months. I want my photos, and everytime I ask, he gives me some bullshit excuse about how busy he is. Seriously, how long would it take him to just upload the pictures to some online file sharing program and just give them to me?

Now, an opportunity has come up for me to start exhibiting my work, and I have to meet someone later, and I don't have those pictures to add to the portfolio that I want to show. They're the only professional type pictures that I would have had, and I would really have liked to be able to show them. Now, when I messaged my friend, pleading once again for my photos, he says that he's been ""super busy"" . . . and guess what else? His computer is dead.  I went on the facebook page for the company that we did the shoot for, and I don't see my pictures. So I guess I'll never see them again at this rate.

I don't even care if he wanted to steal my pictures. We both live in different countries. Chances are, we aren't competing for the same work opportunities. So even if he wanted to keep my pics and send copies to me, I would not give a fuck. I just want my pictures. He's literally standing in my way as a professional at this point.

I am so done with him. First it was him leading me on romantically and fucking around with my feelings. Now he's effectively stolen my work and won't let me have it. I'm never shooting for him again (at least, not without pay and direct access to my work), and I'm done trying to be friends with him. I'm just angry with myself for letting this go on for so long."

I had been planning to lose my virginity for a few months now and tried to do it with a good friend previously, but it didn't happen. Not because I felt like it was a burden or because all my friends are doing it (in fact I am now the first in my close friend group to have done it), but because I just felt ready and excited to try something new.

When my first plan didn't go through I turned to my plan b, my coworker ""Mark"". We work in a grey collar field with around 50 other people, though he has a higher paying job than me. He had always been a flirt; cause he could be. He's charming, handsome, and very social. Of course that doesn't come without a reputation. When I started there as a 16 year old intern, he introduced himself. Right when he left, his college-aged niece laughed and told me how much of a pig he is. Shame. Fun fact: that niece is now my supervisor.

It wasn't until a couple months ago when we started having actual conversations about stuff other than work that I found myself attracted to him. That's when I decided I would try to get in his bed. Despite being subtly shot down once or twice, a couple weeks ago, I succeded. His lips tasted like bitter mango and banana.

That night, he called me with panic saying that somehow, someone had found out. Cue an argument on who had a loose tongue.

I go to work and feel everyone giving me stares, even though I know word probably hasn't gone around just yet. His niece comes up to me.

Deny deny deny. 

""What do mean?""

*""You know what I mean.""*

""No I don't, that's why I'm asking.""

*""I know about you and Mark.""*

I break down and beg her for forgiveness for sleeping with her own uncle, until she starts talking. She explains how she doesn't care and is only worried about me and wants to make sure I'm okay. She says she's only dissappointed in her uncle, since he has two kids and should be more responsible. She won't tell anyone and will pretend like this never happened. I hug her. Her undeserved kindness makes me cry even more.

Wanna hear the fun part? Word got around to the manager anyway! Yay. Mark and I were seperately talked to but denied being in a relationship when asked, which is the truth, we aren't. 

The manager only heard a couple days ago, when the ""rumor"" got out. So I guess now it's spreading. Guess I just gotta deny everything and ride it out. At least I had some sort of relief yesterday when I took a look at the negative pregnancy test. 


Okay so I know this post is kind of all over the place so I'll just wrap it up. I don't regret the sex itself. I'm really happy I got to experience that with him, it's just the result of it that I'm not so happy about; but I did an adult thing and now I have to deal with the adult consequences. If you're going to comment about how he's a creep or he took advantage of me or whatever, please refrain. I appreciate your concern, but I was a willing and happy participant. I might delete this later since I just wanted to get it all out, so thanks for reading. 

EDIT:
I guess my replies arent showing up because of my negative comment karma, but to answer some questions.
Yes. He was aware of my age.
We were buzzed and I'm the one who asked him to take off the condom. 
My state's age of consent is 18.
The niece found out because Mark told her; he thought word had already gotten out to her

6ox1ux,11,2017-07-22,Lando Calrissian and why startups are only for the living,plebpat,thelastpsychiatrist,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastpsychiatrist/comments/6ox1ux/lando_calrissian_and_why_startups_are_only_for/,"Michael Seibel, president of the Y Combinator (YC), recently published an essay on the type of person startups make sense for. The original article is here: https://blog.ycombinator.com/why-should-i-start-a-startup/

For context: YC is a prolific investment firm for very young startups. Reddit was accepted into the first batch of YC companies. Seibel is a successful entrepreneur now turned investor. From his experience and job role, he has many data points on aspirational entrepreneurs who make it, those who don’t, and most importantly, *who those people were before we knew how they’d turn out*.

Language and ideas were the original “scaling platform”/software/meme, so it makes sense that YC would be interested in facilitating these platforms. Consequently, they also run a popular discussion forum (“Hacker News”) for people interested in startups and technology, colloquially referred to as “hackers”. Seibel’s essay was submitted to the forum for discussion and discussed heavily here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14806393. With ~280 comments and 500 upvotes in two days, it’s reasonable to say the post has struck a nerve.

I’ll save you the effort of trawling through the comments (that’s my job), but the most frequent reactions fall along these lines:


1. Loved it: Super motivating, I relate, let’s talk shop, tactics, mentors, tools, etc.


2. Hated it: This article encourages hubris about one’s ability, most startups fail and need luck. Also, privilege, lots of money, lack of wife, kids, family, mortgage, yada yada.


3. The ontologists: people who concerned with being. **This is where the gold is.**

To clarify, most people genuinely shouldn’t try to start a startup. Preaching that kind of tactic based panacea is just as helpful as telling everyone to be “happy”. 

What’s useful about startups, however, is that they’re rigorously executed petri dishes of life experiments. Startups are defined by growth, whether its users, time spent on the platform, revenue, profit, etc. For our personal case study, if we substitute growth for the more neutral term “change”, startups become fantastic case studies to a certain type of existence, specifically, a dynamic one. 

Back to ontology. There is a key moment that got pushed to the bottom where Michael tries to respond to Q&amp;A’s, and he has this insightful interaction:

A: What's the origin of your desire to be better than all of your peers?


MW: Because I realized that I could be better


B: In what ways? Sorry Michael, but I reject the idea that you can be 'better' than another person.


MW: I should have said I realized I could be better at the game of high school student looking to get into a good college.

Commenter B was looking for evidence that people in startups think they’re better than us plebeians. But give yourself a gut check of Seibel’s life and you can probably conclude this is unlikely. How’s that joke go again? Oh right. 

“Would you rather be a white woman or black male?” 

Though tech has gotten better and will continue to do so (proof: https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/16/stop-blaming-the-tech-industry-for-the-worlds-problems/), the reality is positions of power for men of color remain statistically abnormalities. On a good day, Seibel may have looked at his life and job and felt like the Obama of Silicon Valley. And for all the others, Chris Washington. Heck, that scene from Get Out might have been inspired by a hypothetical party I just made up where Billy Dee Williams/Lando Calrissian and Seibel bump into each other, and the two men give each other a wink and nod of camaraderie. “I see you brother, keep making cash.” 

Which is to say, it is unlikely for Seibel to have grown up internalizing that he was better than others. Read his original piece and this alternate hypothesis checks out. Now that we’ve set aside that interpretation, it begs the question: *what did he mean to really mean?*

“I realized I could be better” reads very different if we read it as “I realized I could **become Better.**”

Later on, when another commenter asks why the 3 constraints (1. underdog preference, 2. loves the thrill of poor odds, 3. Amor fati ) that Seibel said were the preferred constraints of startup founders, he claimed no answer. After all, even Seibel won’t purport to have God-given Moses style tablets on the commandments of constraints that founders must have. 

With help from Nicholas Nassim Taleb’s “Antifragile”, we can conclude that all three constraints are great *heuristics* of the **type of shock** that biological systems benefit from. Cue the tape: 

“The bold conjecture made here is that everything that has life in it is to some extent antifragile (but not the reverse). It looks like the secret of life is antifragility. Typically, the natural—the biological—is both antifragile and fragile, depending on the source (and the range) of variation. A human body can benefit from the name Wolff’s Law after an 1892 article by a German surgeon. But a dish, a car, an inanimate object will not—these may be robust but cannot be intrinsically antifragile. Inanimate—that is, nonliving—material, typically, when subjected to stress, either undergoes material fatigue or breaks. 

We can use the distinction as a marker between living and nonliving. The fact that the artificial needs to be antifragile for us to be able to use it as tissue is quite a telling difference between the biological and the synthetic. Your house, your food processor, and your computer desk eventually wear down and don’t self-repair. They may look better with age (when artisanal), just as your jeans will look more fashionable with use, but eventually time will catch up with them and the hardest material will end up looking like Roman ruins. Your jeans may look improved and more fashionable when worn out, but their material did not get stronger, nor do they self-repair.”

Seibel can’t write too philosophically, or he comes off as a mystical Internet cult writer. Once again, that’s my job. So let’s put it together.

There is good evidence (Seibel’s data points as President of YC) to believe that, for a certain group of people, subjecting themselves to stress (in the form of unfavorable odds) is a desirable end goal. Further, we know that the indicator of living, organic systems is their system’s ability to grow from the right type of stressors: sprints in working out, not marathons; keeping a low personal cost of living so you can risk taking an unpaid internship at your dream company; etc. So what do this all mean?

For people who are more Life than Death, starting a startup is a fantastic way of becoming who you deeply want to be. Be it warrior, saint or thinker, many of the commenters never realized that Seibel was writing an article about character formation. In fact, he explicitly refutes financial success as the basis of why he recommends starting a startup. But because of his need for propriety due to his status, he can’t outright and say “adversity will give you the opportunity become exactly the type of person you respect, leading you to respect yourself more and be more satisfied. This is guaranteed regardless of the financial outcome.”

Why can’t he say this? Because there’s a non-trivial percentage of the population that is OK with “death”, living instead of Life. Fear sells much better than hope. And in their defense, even Taleb writes about this. Remember, most startup founders will financially fail, but the backroom secret is that most news fail to report the astonishingly high satisfaction rate (https://unsupervisedmethods.com/the-startup-failure-myth-b80fc4b6af45), even among “failed” entreprneurs, as opposed to the normal population’s job satisfaction (http://www.gallup.com/poll/188144/employee-engagement-stagnant-2015.aspx) The antifragility of the system requires individuals to be fragile. Barbells leverage means you need to have people manning libraries, fire stations and police departments vs. jetting off to Hawaii and crowdfunding video game playthroughs. If you’re willing to live like a pauper to do what you love, your self-satisfaction will be its own reward. 

The key is to choose with eyes wide open. Well, maybe a wink is fine ;)"

Since Oct/Nov, I have lost 89 lbs. I was 274lbs and now I am 185lbs. I am 6 feet tall.
I am currently on my summer internship and have no time to work out. I am on a cut at the moment (300-500 calorie cut) and I think I will start bulking at 180 lbs, but I am not sure since my waist is still 35-36 inches. This means that my body fat % is still around 20%?
I do feel like I do not need to lose any more weight because my friends and my parents have been telling me to start eating a lot more and I look skinnier than my actual weight (mainly because my arms are smaller for my frame)...but I am not sure since there's still this layer of skin/fat around my stomach.
If I do start bulking, how much and how should I do so? I will be doing PHUL.

Mother/Daughter


Its late I come home from work and you can tell its been a bad day. Just from the look on my face as I walk in the door. Its been very stressful since your father had left us.

Sister/sister


Its been almost a year since I left for college. Its almost summer break and time for me to come visit again. As I get to your door with my suitcase in hand to knock on your door. You open it with a smile. I drop my suitcase an lean into a hug with you. I step inside and look around.

6oxrcl,3,2017-07-22,Me [22/M] with a friend [22/F]. We went out with friends for the last time after graduating and she kissed me. I was completely shocked. What do I do now?,shocking_kiss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6oxrcl/me_22m_with_a_friend_22f_we_went_out_with_friends/,"Hey, so I need some perspective.


I posted this earlier but forgot to add a TL;DR so it got instantly removed.


Throwaway because I do not want anyone involved to see this, but I don’t know whether they browse this sub. Hopefully they don’t, but it’s out of my control.


Anyway, here is the situation. I will refer to them by pseudonyms.


• Me, 22/M


• V, 22/F (I think)


• M, 21/F


I graduated this week and I ended up joining a few close friends in a group (roughly 12) I knew to head into town. We met up with V and her housemates to go to some clubs.


I have known V for about six months now through our mutual friend M. M was housemates with V and three other girls for two years so they are pretty close. Perhaps best friends, the four of them.


We got to know each other through the year because we met at events hosted by M and got close because shared similar ambitions, desires and likes. We both liked travelling, some similar TV programmes and interests.


We just generally liked talking to each other and, given how naturally sarcastic our personalities were, often joked around. 


Although I would not describe it as flirtatious - at least, it wasn't obvious to me at those times.

Anyway, I was pretty tired but up for it nonetheless. It was the last time we would likely be in the same proximity before heading off in separate directions.


When I was there, it was pretty clear that (a) V was enjoying herself and (b) she was pretty drunk. There was also a friend of M’s boyfriend (she's also a girl) who was there who she seemed to be getting on really well with. So much so that I thought they were going to hook up at some point (why not, right?).


I didn’t pay much mind to it, although I did look over my shoulder every now and again when I was dancing to see where V was because of the state she was in and curiosity. Not to try anything though.


As the night wore on, M randomly came up to me and said “V likes you!”


This was both news and a shock to me. I didn’t think she was romantically interested me and previous interactions, to me anyway, didn’t come off that way.


Sure, we played and joked around quite a lot but neither one of us took it much further than that.


For instance, it has taken other people to tell me that another girl I knew was flirting with me at one of my other friend’s birthday parties. Apparently it was blatantly obvious but I did not read the signals and kind of brushed it off. I think this is largely due to having very low self-confidence and self-esteem.


Later on, after we went next door to another club, I saw V standing outside with her housemate and that housemate’s boyfriend. Still drunk and heading home since she did not want to pay a fee to get into the club and was tired as well.


Anyway, I went up to her and asked her about it.


**NOTE: Please keep in mind that I do not remember how the conversation went and I am paraphrasing. I was both very tired and a little drunk**


She said something along the lines of, “Well M and [other housemates] keep telling me that you keep coming up to me and talking to me. They think that you are interested in me.”


She referred to the festival we were at earlier in the year, how we were talking before and after, which her housemates hinted at me supposedly showing clear interest.


I pulled her aside and was honest, and pretty much said that I am pretty bad at giving and receiving signals when I like someone.
She basically admitted that she likes me without saying it outright and said “Is this something that you are interested in pursuing?” I said yes, but I don’t think that I registered what that entailed at the time.


Some short time later, I continued to explain myself before I see her tilt her head, part her lips and started kissing me!


I was in shock. It felt like slow-motion but it happened so fast. I didn’t want to pull away because I feared what would happen and I did and, before I knew it, her housemates were already in a taxi telling her to come with them and go home. They were also walking past us when getting into the taxi so you can imagine the surprise.


I very rarely kiss girls so it all adds to the shock of it all. Not because I am repulsive, but because of several psychological factors...


I don't know whether I am a good or bad kisser, but at one point I opened my eyes a little bit (which you're not supposed to do). Again, all in the moment of the situation.


I pulled away, absorbing the shock, before she kept kissing my cheek.


They asked her what she wanted to do and it was pretty clear that she wanted to come home with me, but my phone was dead and I live with my parent(s). Clearly they would not be too enamored with bringing a drunk girl home at 2am.


She went home and I was left in a dazed, semi-drunken state to absorb what the hell just happened.


We have not spoken since.


**THE SITUATION**


I don’t know what to do and I have been thinking about it ever since.


On the one hand, I was attracted. It was unexpected but it obviously wasn’t a horrifying experience. Maybe quite embarrassing because I was caught so off-guard and everyone could see (again, low self-confidence).


On the other hand, I don’t see myself being in a relationship right now. I just graduated and want to experience being single for quite some time. Maybe a year or so. More to it, she lives more than 200 miles up north and I am not in any mind to begin a long-distance relationship.


I am working on an internship with it becoming a full-time job come September. It’s 40 hours per week and I don’t have the time to be in a relationship partly because of that too.


I am generally an honest person but I am also a people-pleaser to an extent. My thinking is to text her tomorrow – if she doesn’t already – to state what my stance is and for her to go from there.


If she blocks me off everything to move on, so be it. I would probably do the same thing because it would hurt too much, so no hard feelings.


What should I do?

**TL;DR:** Me with a girl that I have gotten to know relatively well over the last 6 months. We have similar ambitions, goals, desires and likes. We both graduated this week and we went out with a group of friends to clubs in town. A mutual friend told me that she liked me. When I asked her, she admitted to me that she did in a roundabout way before surprise kissing me. I was in shock and we haven't spoken since. What do I do now?

**EDIT:** Not sure if this is the correct flair"

I finished W4D2 last June 13, and I was really pumped to finish the week, and go to W5. However, my internship (which was a requirement for my class) started the following week. I figured I could make time for the c25k program and the RR from r/bodyweightfitness, but due to travelling time and work hours (leaving the house by 8am and coming home at 9pm, exhausted), I wasn't able to continue those programs. This bummed me out a lot. I was scared I was going to go back to square one with both. I could feel my stamina and strength leaving my body with every passing week of inactivity haha.

But, as I only have two days left for my internship, I tried doing the RR yesterday, and I did the W3 run for c25k just a few minutes ago! And yeah, there was definitely some loss of strength and stamina, but I was still able to do it. I'm the type of person who usually quits these kinds of things altogether after taking a long break, but I don't know, I just felt like doing it, like out of the blue. Honestly, I'd feel bad about myself whenever I'd see progress updates from this sub, when I wasn't making any progress myself, but I guess it eventually motivated me to start where I left off (or in this case, the week prior haha). So, I just want to say thanks to this wonderful community. Seeing progress updates and seeing posts about first timers really helped. If you've taken a long break from c25k like I did, and you feel like quitting the program, all you gotta do is put on your running attire, and step outside. :)

Also, I just want to ask you guys, what else motivates you to keep going with any fitness program, especially after taking a long break from it?"

Her college is one hour away from mine so we are able to see each other for one weekend every 2 weeks.

She left for her study abroad about 3 weeks ago and I have been feeling some pretty strong jealousy and envy recently. She is doing a lot of fun stuff while she is away and we don't get to talk much. We text when she is at the lodge she is staying at which ends up only being about 5-10 texts a day and we skype for one hour on the weekend. Sometimes she will tell me good night and then for the next 10-15 minutes I will see her on Facebook or on snapchat using the app which hurts because she isn't using that time to text me, but I'm not sure if i can bring this up to her because it might come off as petty and me spying on her which will upset her. Can I ask her about this or should I just keep this to myself?

She is my main source of excitement, fun, and support while I am home from school since most of my friends don't live near me during the summer. So while she is away I don't really have much to do besides working at my internship.

I am getting jealous of all the memories she is making and how much fun she is having while I am at home just waiting to hear from her. I also feel as though she doesn't miss me. I feel this way because texting is usually just an update on what she has been doing and during skype calls I am usually the one that leads the conversation and she is the one to end it. She also doesn't ever say she misses me unless I say it first but while at school she is saying it once every couple days. I made a point not to say I miss you this week and she hasn't said anything along the lines of missing me. Can I ask her if she actually does miss me? Or is that feeling just me being petty and bringing it up will just make her feel bad while she is supposed to be having the time of her life?

I also worry that she is having such a good time and meeting so many new and exciting people that I won't be enough for her when she comes home and that we will end up breaking up. Again, is this something I can bring up before she comes home? Or am I just being petty and should keep that thought to myself?
 
How do I get over these jealous, envious, and insecure feelings?

I am concerned that my GPAs are too low and the lack of internship will damage my prospects. I do not think my resume stands out apart from the Spanish degree. Although it is not relevant, it may demonstrate communication skills and it signals that I can learn more than one type of thing. I hope it does, anyway.

In case you didn't know, you weren't the only one that ended up with a broken heart. I *loved* you more than anything. I cared so much about you. But I knew we couldn't keep going on the way we were. I was finishing school and you were still thinking about finishing your associates degree. Like you had been thinking about when I met you. I was going on to grad school and hopefully medical school, and you were perfectly content working the same 12 dollar an hour job. Despite being one of the smartest people I've ever known.

That didn't change the fact that I loved you. 

What started to was when you wouldn't drive the 25 minutes to see me any more. You didn't want to spend the gas money anymore. When you started bailing on plans we made to hang out with your friends. Even though you knew it wouldn't have bothered me if you told me what was up. While I waited on you for hours to show up. When I was no longer allowed to hang out with you when you were with your friends, despite getting along well with all of them. All because I was apparently ""too distracting"". When it became apparent that we couldn't go out and do anything unless I was the one who footed the bill.

You took me for granted. And I tried to work past that for a long time, because you were the only person I ever truly loved.

I thought about what I could do to improve upon our situation. I stupidly thought that I could give you an incentive to change. I thought that if we took two or three weeks, that you would maybe start coming up with a plan to go back to school, or a plan to quit smoking like a chimney.

Of course, that didn't work. At the end of that time period, you made it clear that you were certain you didn't want to waste money on taking courses that didn't directly apply to what you were interested in pursuing a career in and certain you didn't want to ever take out a loan to go to a four year school. You also hadn't even made an attempt to figure out how to stop smoking. Even though you knew how it was affecting your health.

I couldn't keep going on like this. The future that I thought we would share together was becoming more and more difficult to imagine. I ended our relationship with a very heavy heart.

I tried so hard to stay friendly after we ended things, but you needed time and I gave you your space. It was so hard to not have you in my life any more after all that time, but after 3 months I was ready to move on. 

Were you enraged when you caught wind that I was seeing someone else? It sure made you spiteful, didn't it?

I had thought that it was so wonderful that my friends got on so well with you while we were together. Now I really do wish that they had hated you. Because now, I have barely anyone. My friends of eight years chose you over me. That party last month made it very clear that I've become an outsider. I'm sure they only invited me because they felt like they had to. I noticed the way everyone would stop talking when I entered the room. You seemed so smug that night.

M is the only one I have. My only true friend.

She told me how much time my friends had been spending with you. She opened my eyes to the fact that they were cancelling plans with me in order to hang out with you. She told me about how you told everyone about our sex life. That you kink shamed me in front of everyone. Never mind the fact that you were always a more than willing participant. Or that you had other things in mind that I refused to take part in. Weirder things. 

I suppose I could have screwed you over and aired your dirty laundry as well, but I'm really not that kind of person. It didn't bother me that you told my friends what we did behind closed doors. What bothered me is that you used it to make me into a pariah.

I guess I'm just bitter that I'm so god damned lonely  now. I spend all the time that I'm not working alone and it's driving me insane. I have barely any human interaction. M and I are on completely different work schedules, and C is away for his internship. If you hadn't gone and ruined everything with the all the rest of my friends, then maybe I'd still have someone to socialize with. Then maybe I wouldn't be so miserable.

Was that what you wanted? For me to be miserable? Do you feel better about things now?

I hope you got what you wanted."
6ozryv,3,2017-07-23,[US] Accounting undergrad. I am so overwhelmed and would like some advice and answers to a few questions,kostavogi,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/6ozryv/us_accounting_undergrad_i_am_so_overwhelmed_and/,"Hi Everyone! This is my first time on Reddit. I have a few questions and need some advice. Here’s my story. 

I am going to be a sophomore this coming fall at a large state university in Texas. I started my freshman year as a premed student, but I quickly lost interest in pursuing that path, and by the end of my first year I decided to pursue my second choice, accounting. I was always a math person, and have a strong interest to go into corporate. This summer, I have taken my first 2 accounting classes and absolutely loved them (got all A’s). 

My whole life, it feels like, has centered on doing medical activities, from volunteering in hospitals for 4 years to interning at private practices for 3. Now, with this major change I feel like I was dropped off on a different planet and I am VERY overwhelmed. Can someone explain to me common routes students take after graduation? I often hear fellow students talk about the Big 4, and it appears as though all 4 have huge presences on campus.  I also looked around and after doing some research I am almost certain I want to be CPA certified. My school does offer a combined bachelors and master’s accounting program, which would allow me to reach the 150 credit requirement just a year after my original undergrad graduation date. 

When is the best time to start looking for internships? Would anyone recommend doing anything besides the Big 4 in regards to internships?  What types of accounting internships are offered at the Big 4 typically, such as what departments are available? I would like to hear some opinions on doing the master’s program. Will that change my job opportunities after graduation from the master’s program? Does this seem like a smart choice?

Lastly, for those of you who are at the end of your undergrad career or in the workforce, what do you wish you‘d done differently? 

Thanks in advance!!!"

Want to be a lawyer real bad but not sure how work experience affects admissions / work,throwawayfun13579,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/6ozshm/should_i_apply_this_cycle_or_wait_want_to_be_a/,"Can someone really clarify the importance of job experience (tech specific) for law school and law firm hiring? I was going to apply this summer, but some really fortunate situations for me have made me really start to question.
I'm a rising senior at a top 20 school, CS major with a double major in the humanities, and am sitting on a 4.0 / 172. I've made the rounds, internship wise, at the big tech companies. I really wanted to apply this cycle, as working in patent or digital privacy has really been a dream of mine.

I recently got some job offers: both pay &gt;110K, though one pays in the 120 range but it doesnt have the big name of the other. I'm an engineering student and have had internships at big tech name companies, but these are obviously super attractive. However, I really want to enter the legal field as soon as possible to really explore my options.

I've heard from people that having that work experience makes it easier to get into top patent firms. How true is that statement and why? If I'm gunning for HYS, would that year of experience make a deciding factor in black box admissions like Y and S? Lastly, will having that year of experience matter for getting into firms? I made some really lucky investment decisions with cryptocurrencies in middle school that make law school debt not too much of an issue for me.

6p03sm,1,2017-07-23,Am I the DB Problem? Venting.,jess_in_tx,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6p03sm/am_i_the_db_problem_venting/,"Sorry in advance this is gonna be long:
Husband and I have been married going on 5 years now. Everything started going downhill about 2 years ago. We were in the middle of selling our house. We didn’t find anything we liked so we decided to build, which can strain a marriage in itself. In the meantime, we lived in this tiny studio builder provided for a few months. During the stress of building and being cramped up in a tiny rental, husband’s father died unexpectedly. Shortly thereafter, I got pregnant after 2 years of unsuccessful attempts and we told his family about it. Unfortunately, a few weeks later I suffered a miscarriage. He was still suffering from his dads loss, and now the loss of the baby and had to retract telling his family about it. I was physically suffering having to go thru a miscarriage. In fact, the first round did not fully work that I had to do a 2nd round of medication. And I was laid off from work. For several days I laid in bed in pain and depressed. My family did not know about my pregnancy as I’m not really close to any of them. At the same time of my miscarriage, my brother, who I’m not close to, invited us to his wedding. I couldn’t physically get out of bed to go and was upset over everything. We got into some stupid argument and husband left me crippled in bed to go to my brothers wedding without me. He drank way too much and ended up getting in a terrible car wreck. He was lucky he had been drinking because a normal person wouldn’t of survived the crash. He came inches from losing his life. He ended up getting a DWI. Thousands later, added marital stress, and court costs he was able to get it dispelled from his record and kept his job. He was left with a lot of physical pain that he started drinking more heavily. I’ve suggested he go see a Dr for the pain he’s still having from the accident. 

Fast forward, we move into our house and move on from everything. I got a great new job. He was getting promoted at his. We had a beautiful new home. Sex life wasn’t as good since I had the miscarriage, but I still did my part in pleasing him in other ways if I didn’t physically feel up to it. We started trying to have a baby again and I was able to get pregnant in August 2015. Around the same time, my husband started having an affair with a new coworker that started working at his job. I was oblivious to it for some time until I needed to do something on his laptop and started snooping. I know snooping wasn’t something I should of been doing, but I’ve had such a long history of dating guys after guys who all cheated on me. Husband was practically the only guy who I never felt would do that to me. He had even told me when we first started dating he had a 3-year dry spell before me. When I found out about the affair, I was about 6 months pregnant at the time. There was never any evidence of anything physically going on between them. It was mostly just chats back and forth at work, emails, flirting in his office, texting, even 4 hour long phone conversations. I don’t even get a 5 minute call from him anymore, so I knew he was very much into this other married woman. I confronted him and I was so hurt, even more by the fact I was several months pregnant at this point and all this started before he even knocked me up. I had told him that I don’t tolerate cheating, even if not physical, and I have broken up with every guy in my past who did, so he was well aware of how serious I was about it. This was a huge deal breaker for me. If I hadn’t been pregnant at the time I think things would of ended right then. 

We went to marriage counseling and I think it helped. He said it all stemmed from the stress of losing his dad and then losing the baby and bottling it up inside and not talking to me about it. Although he broke my trust, things started to seem better. We had makeup sex like 2 weeks later. It wasn’t that great, more for him than it was me. I thought things were looking up. Weeks went by and apparently nothing changed with him at work. He didn’t end it with her. He just got better at hiding it from me. I didn’t know what to do to get him to end it so I found her husband on Facebook and sent him a message. Not the best thing to do in hindsight, but I figured if someone knew my spouse was cheating, I’d rather have someone tell me than not say anything at all. She went on to her husbands Facebook page, deleted the message, and blocked me from trying to contact him again. She started running around the office telling everyone I was crazy. (I was an intern there years ago and many people knew who I was.) Fast forward to 3 days before I gave birth, husband comes home in the middle of the day unexpectedly while I was home trying to prepare for labor. Turns out his job fired him because he and the other woman at work weren’t working out. Go figure. He came clean to me and said he had speculation she was running her mouth to everyone saying untrue things about him, me, and our unborn child. He hacked into the network to see what she was saying to others to see if it was all true and someone at his job who he confided in turned him in. You can imagine my level of disgust, anger, hurt, and trust was all out the window, just days before I was to give birth. I tried to put it behind me and just focus on the new baby and on helping him find a new job. Sex was last thing on my mind. 

I was pretty hurt and couldn’t trust him for a long time after. I should of left then but now that we had a newborn and knowing he couldn’t deal with not being ‘man enough’ to support his family, and him not fully dealing with everything in a healthy manner, I felt like he would do something awful to hurt himself. We’ve had moments in the past where we’d argue and I’d be gone and he’ll be home, and he’d start drinking heavily and texting me saying he was going to shoot himself or do something to harm himself over a stupid argument we had. For a long time I felt like I had to hide guns that he had so he didn’t do anything stupid anytime we argued. If anything like that happened, everyone would blame me. That in itself has made me feel guilty and stuck. 

Our baby was born via c-section and shortly after that I had to have gallbladder surgery. I didn’t want sex for a couple months or so because my body between those surgeries, nursing, sleepless new parent nights. Whenever we did have sex anymore it was just for his pleasure. I never got anything out of it and I told him that and even told him what turns me on/off. I can’t remember when it all completely stopped, but he has stopped all affection towards me. No kissing, no I love you's, complimenting, flirting, holding hands, hugs, etc. We’re like roommates who are raising a child together. I remember reading the convos with the other woman — he was always complimenting her looks everyday, and was always flirting, and talking about physical things he’d like to do with her. I feel like I compliment him all the time. I cannot remember the last time I got a compliment. It’s always him criticizing something, or the ever so unsexy ’wanna bang’. I occasionally oblige to sex when he asks, but it’s never great for me anymore. It takes both mental and physical for me to get there. This guy just wants to put it in and be done. I guess he thinks women are just ready to go anytime he asks for it or just doesn’t care about my physical needs. Many times it’s dry and uncomfortable for me because he doesn't want to put in the time to arouse me. It’s gotta be uncomfortable too for him, right? No working me up to it, no foreplay, no oral fun. Just wham, bam, thank you mam, rolls over and starts snoring logs while I’m on the other side of the bed just laying there just feeling raped. (I was raped by 2 different people when I was a child so anytime there’s no emotional connection, I just get completely turned off. I did seek help for it, but still rears up every once and awhile. Husband knows all this.)

Since being a mom, I have gotten dressed up, go get my hair done, and look attractive but it just goes unnoticed by the only person I try for so I don't put much effort in it anymore. I lost all my pre-pregnancy weight and more because of nursing. My confidence still isn’t where I wish it was with him just because he broke my trust, built it back up, then let me down again. I also don’t like being touched around my c-section scar as it’s tender and painful and I’m just generally not feeling as sexy as I used to because of my other scars. I love being touched in other areas and have to beg him for just a massage. I know I’m still attractive because I have had guys from my past reach out to me and try flirting and I shoot them down. I’m still in my 20s. I’ve gone on sites to try and find the missing piece of my marriage of being wanted/desired, but they usually want more and I don’t want any part of it. I’ve never met anyone up IRL, because I get repulsed by the thought of some guy only wanting me for sex again. I also feel guilty for doing the same things I got mad at my husband for, so I always leave the sites and just kind of deal with being lonely, depressed and sexually frustrated. I don’t feel as attracted to any other guy as I am towards my husband. And I'd like to think he finds me attractive because he does verbally ask for it. He always asks for me to be on top, but being that I'm not comfortable with my body as I used to be pre-baby, I really don't like that position and he knows it. It does nothing to get me off and the entire time I'm doing it, I'm self-conscious about my body and he just lays there with his eyes closed and either doesn't touch me or kinda forces my body to go faster/slower so he can get off. 

He does a lot for our family so I shouldn’t complain. Most guys are deadbeat husbands and fathers. He supports us so that I can stay home with our child and we don’t typically have a problem with money. He lets me do whatever I want with no complaints usually. He likes to cook for us. He’s good at taking care of our son when I ask for help. He’s even been working on his physical appearance and losing weight, almost too religiously to the point he doesn’t want to occasionally go on lunch dates with me or his child because he’s too busy at the gym instead.

I still feel hurt and pain from his cheating. I feel like it’s completely my fault he cheated. I don’t think I’ve fully gotten over it because every now and then heated arguments will cause me to bring it up, or sometimes I will feel the urge to snoop on his devices when he’s especially ugly towards me or is more ‘checked out’ than usual, but I'm trying to work on that. Our marriage counselor ended our sessions with 'devices should be unlocked, passwords should be known to one another, nothing to hide, keep devices to a minimum when at home', but he never followed the advice. He's on his phone now more than ever.

Since having our first child and him losing his job, we had to move out of state. There were no jobs that paid enough to support our decision of me staying home with our child. I was partially happy to move because we’d be getting away from the woman he had the affair with and all the bad memories and we could start again fresh. But by doing so it has left me with no family around, no friends, nobody I can talk to. At least he has coworkers he can talk to. I’m a stay at home mom, so I go days with the only interaction being between me and my child. I’ve tried play-dates and meet ups with moms, but I’m not a very social person, never had very many friends in school. I feel like moms are super judgy and I don’t want the added drama. We have decided to build a home again and a few months ago found out I was (unplanned) pregnant again from just having sex 1 time. I’m nearly 6 months pregnant now and haven’t had sex maybe a few times since this pregnancy. With our first child he was super excited and was completely involved, wanting to hear the heartbeat, etc. This time around, I’ve felt he hasn’t once cared, no touching my belly, no helping to pick out a name, nothing.

Our apartment recently burned down, so things just keep getting worse and worse for us just like when all this spiraled the last time. We’re living in a hotel temporally while we wait for our house to be finished building. We currently sleep in separate hotel beds. Nothing to do at a hotel so I take myself and child out to dinner and I feel so awkward. All these families around enjoying dinner and here I am, nearly 6 mo pregnant, 1 year old on my hip, doing everything myself, ring on my finger, but no hubby around because he wants alone time on his phone or decides to binge drink. I'm almost certain he's depressed and stressed, but he doesn't ever come to me about problems. He has a lot with our new house and things I know he deals with and he says he doesn't want to involve me so I don't get the added stress.

Even though I am still attracted to him (he can dress and look nice when he wants to), I’m turned off by his daily routine. M-F, he comes home from work, doesn’t say anything to me, changes his clothes into these ugly stained shorts my dad gave him (my dad wears the same ones (big turn off)), and plops down in front of the tv with his face glued to his phone for the next several hours until its time for dinner, showers and then goes to bed. The only convos he has in the middle of that is complaining about politics, traffic, or everything under the sun to the point that it wears me down. I’m sure he’s cranky because of no sex, but I don’t want to have sex with such a miserable unhappy person who does nothing but complain. I want to have sex with the happy, funny, attractive man I fell in love with. And so the vicious cycle begins.

We have sex maybe once a month. I haven’t got satisfied by him except once or twice this year. I’d like to think I have a fairly high sex drive. I take care of my needs by myself at least every other day or so, sometimes more if I can get time to myself. If he asks for it now, it’s 50/50 if he gets it just because I’m either honestly too tired from taking care of our child and growing this other human, he's being ugly towards me and/or complaining since he's been home, or because I know 3-5 minutes later I’m going to be laying there feeling unsatisfied anyways. I do love him and I am attracted to him, but the sex is no good for me. I currently get no physical touch or affection outside of the occasional sex. When he has tried to be affectionate, I know it's because he only wants to get himself off and leaves me unfulfilled which then it itself turns me off because all he's thinking about are his needs and doesn't care about mine.

Basically I just wanted to vent because it seems like a safe space to do so and I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm just wondering if this is all my fault, his, or both that there is zero affection and we have a DB?"

CSE 6040, ISYE 6501, MGT 8803 Introduction to Business for Analytics.

Syllabi/descriptions below:

http://cse6040.gatech.edu/fa16/syllabus/

https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/9f744ff0db29f572aed95e552dac7c76/asset-v1:GTx+ISYE6501x+2T2017+type@asset+block/OMSA_ISYE6501SyllabusMM_May23New.pdf

https://pe.gatech.edu/sites/pe.gatech.edu/files/Mkg-LPs/OMSA/OMS%20Analytics-Fall%202017-Course-List.pdf

I am trying to decide which to take the first semester- I only plan on one course this first semester, and want to take the course for which I am most set up for success and will help me determine if I am cut out for this masters program.

We are supposed to take at least two within our first year, so I'll take at least two of them in Fall 17/Spring 18.

I am leaning towards taking CSE 6040 right now for a few reasons, and would love your input

1) I would prefer taking this CSE course over the MGT course because I would like to get my hands dirty in analytics as soon as possible. The MGT course looks fascinating, but more oriented towards high level business strategy and finance. I would like to get my hands dirty sooner than later a) because I want to see if I have a technical aptitude for analytics ASAP and think the CSE course would better answer that question as opposed to the MGT course- I'm already a believer in the strategy and b) if I apply for a summer internship, I imagine that employers would prefer more hard skills in comparison to high level conceptual understanding.
^Thoughts on what employers are seeking?

2) I am leaning towards the CSE course over the ISYE course b/c of my research on Course Critique, a service that I used as a GT undergrad (BS ChBE 2015) in which you can see the GPA breakdown-history for teacher's courses.
a) it appears that Dr. Vuduc (CSE) has more experience teaching intro level courses than does Dr. Sokol (ISYE)
b) it seems that the CSE course focuses on Python and SQL, whereas the ISYE course focuses on R. I have a working knowledge of SQL, a little knowledge of Python, and none of R. So, I think that I've got more advantages coming into the CSE course than the ISYE course. Also, in a different thread, https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSA/comments/6o65wm/advice_for_preparing_for_omsa_fall_2017_no/,
somebody suggested that the MGT course focuses on Python and SAS. So, I feel like if I'm going to learn a new language (R in ISYE or Python in CSE), I would rather go for the more common language of Python.
c) does anybody know if Dr. Vuduc has taught on MOOC’s in the past? I didn’t know if he was one of the previous OMSCS professors.

Thoughts?

For what it is worth, the average GPA of MGT 8803 is 3.86 on CourseCritique
https://critique.gatech.edu/course.php?id=MGT8803

CourseCritique has no data about ISYE 6501

Dr. Vuduc has an average GPA of 3.85

6p0kf3,1,2017-07-23,Not sure what to do,Sansaery,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6p0kf3/not_sure_what_to_do/,"Okay so I'm a 19 year old student and I've been in a serious relationship for six/seven months now. The whole relationship started off kind of rocky- we had a mutual friend who introduced us in late October and had been trying to get us to hook-up after his break-up earlier that year. We finally did in January, and there was an instant connection there. We spent almost every night together and went 'official' a month later.

I found out through that mutual friend that he slept with a girl on tinder at our school two days after we started seeing each other, and he cried to me about it and how he thought that I wouldn't want to be with him if he was inexperienced. He said that he found that girl hideous and that he only did it because he didn't want to dash my expectations. We hadn't had the 'exclusive' talk yet so I didn't have as much of a problem with it, except that something else happened. Okay, so he brought it up to me before he knew that our mutual friend (let's call her Naomi) told me- he claimed that they hadn't had sex but had just 'hooked up' and that no penetrative stuff had ever happened. After Naomi and I were joking about it one night, we found out that he told her that he had penetrative sex with Tinder Girl. After a confrontation, he admitted that he lied to me because she was so 'beneath the bar' of his standards and that he was just embarrassed that it happened at all.

So that was over and done with. Another problem came in the form that he never stopped talking about his ex girlfriend. By April, we had been dating for three months and he still couldn't stop talking about how much he hated his ex girlfriend who broke up with him in August. He continuously brought her up to the people I lived with and to myself, and even to strangers. He complained about how emotionally absuive she was, and how she forced him into an open relationship, and just always talked about her. When he saw a poster of a superhero in my room and I mentioned that I liked X-Men, he was instantly triggered (and almost angry) because they were his ex's favorite superhero group. He even brought up to me, right before I met his mother for the first time, that she still talked to people about how pretty his ex was.

 This sort of stuff happened until around the end of April when I told him to knock it off because it was hurting my feelings. His mother insists that I'm her favorite SO that he's had, so insecurity in that department isn't really the problem. I felt like throughout the first four months of our relationship, that I was not a rebound but a therapist that he wanted to have sex with.

Every time I bring up how it hurt me, he starts crying uncontrollably about how he's hurt the 'best thing that's ever happened to [me]' and apologizes, but he couldn't have been completely oblivious to what he was doing for the first few months. Sometimes it felt like he was intentionally trying to make me feel ugly and insecure so that I would be grateful for his presence in my life. When I told him that, he denied it and rambled another apology to me and assured that 'things will be different' when I get back into the country.

And that's where another issue comes in. My family lives on another continent, and he's been extremely clingy. He keeps telling me that I'm the love of his life, and talks repeatedly about marriage and having two kids in the future. I only talked to him about that with him once in May when I was drunk with my two friends in the Hamptons- we had just done coke and Adderall and I was really out of it. I think he took me really really seriously when I said that, but I think that I was just too far gone and that I wasn't actually seriously thinking about that stuff.

He demonizes my parents whenever I have the smallest complaint about something they do. I'm working in an internship as a translator with an auditing company, and I have to be there for ten hours a day. Along with trying to manage my social life, work life and spend time with my parents, I have to deal with him nervously texting me constantly during the day. I wake up to 25-30 text messages every day, and they're constant."

How fluent can I expect to become in 5 months? What can I do to optimize my language learning? I started using ANKI and will be keeping a small notebook with me where I will write down all the new vocabulary which I will put in ANKI aswell. 

I'm from Belgium (Dutch part) so I am used to hear French once and a while. I think I have a pretty decent base to start learning French. My pronunciation needs a lot of work though! Especially the throat r.

To many outsiders last season looked like a bit of a fluke. Some untested, and low fee German Bundesliga 2 players together with a couple of loan players from the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City. A club finishing in the playoffs on a poor run of form, negative goal difference and winning promotion thanks to 2 penalty shootouts following 3 dull play off games...

This is pretty far from the mark. With Dean Hoyle (founder of Card Factory, local man and Town fan) the club has spent the best part of the last decade quietly building a solid infrastructure and the foundation that allowed this to happen. Eventually we were looking for a way to compete at the next level that didnt rely solely on money and Wagner was appointed as a left field appointment to help us do that. He was backed 100% in both the transfer market and with the whole club buying into his plans. We moved on players that didn't want to fully commit and brought in leaders that did. A careful approach to recruitment buying players early in the window and for a system rather than changing the system to suit players as well as breaking our transfer record (on a CB rather than a striker).

The team was bonded together in pre season and started well beating Newcastle away and drawing at Villa away a few days later. We were in the top 6 for all but a few days of the season and while we had some terrific performances smashing Norwich and Brighton live on Sky, and some howlers getting thumped by Fulham twice. We were actually very consistent, able to withstand lots of pressure and regularly see games out with only a 1 goal lead. We dominated possesion in the majority of games, but rarely looked like scoring lots of goals. Mooy was a key component, retaining possesion and keeping the ball moving, but more important was Wagner's tactics, game preperation, motivation and team selections. He eked out every last bit of quality from his squad and deserved promotion.

Mixed. We obviously did way better than what was expected of us, with pundits like that mug Ian Holloway and many of the bookies tipping us for relegation before the season had even begun. We sat comfortably in the play-off places for 90% of the season, and at one point looked close to catching Newcastle and Brighton who claimed the automatic promotion places. We even played some attractive football, with Wagner enforcing his high pressing, high possession style of football on the club. That being said, we lacked goals. Our top striker was Nahki Wells, scoring only 10. We won many games by just a goal. Our play-off campaign was without a win, relying on penalties to push us through to the Prem. We're the only club to ever be promoted to the Premier League with negative goal difference, which I love as much as it terrifies me. We're not really supposed to be here... but fuck it.

###**This Season** 

Being promoted via the playoffs, we could have been forgiven for taking a bit longer to get our plans in place. Thankfully this didn't happen and our recruitment started early. We have looked to replace our second 11 with players that can challenge or replace our first team, having 2 players competing for every position. We have bought players who are hungry with a point to prove, either getting their first chance at top flight football or a second chance after a setback. Lossl and DePoitre both were on the fringes of their national team before big moves that didnt quite work out, but both still young enough for a second chance. Zanka and Tom Ince are similar in the second chance club. On the other end of the scale is the young striker Mounie who won more headers than almost anyone else in Europe and hopefully will help address our goalscoring issue from last year. From the outside it probably looks like panic buying and quite unimpressive, but actually (hopefully) it is very measured acquisition of players we have identified early that will fit our system and ethos. Completing the bulk of our business in early July gives Wagner a full preseason to build the understanding and gel the team.

What do I expect? Who knows! I know we will try to do it our way and think we will be competitive with the bottom half. If a couple of teams have a disaster season then we will stay up. If not it will be pretty close, especially with our last few games looking so hard. Either way I can't wait, I hope the neutrals will enjoy watching us for our style as well as our Marmite kits.

We're probably going to get dicked. After reading [that post by /u/Cheapo_Sam where he laid down the facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6ct6ey/predicting_promoted_club_survival_rates_in_the/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) about how promoted teams fair in the prem, it looks grim. Brighton and Newcastle look strong and if history is anything to go by, at least one of us three has to go down... 

Having said that I think we've signed 10 players so far which will give us a lot more depth and Wagner some strong options.

**3 players to watch out for** - *by /u/jckshaw*
 
[](#icon-star-big) **Aaron Mooy**    
By far our best player last season. CM with pace, great passing and tackling. Everything goes through him. 
 
[](#icon-star-big) **Steve Mounie**    
We need goals. Hoping this guy can grab us some. 
 
[](#icon-star-big) **Tom Ince**  
Shit loads of pace and a fair amount of goals for a winger. Hoping he can be as good with us as he was at Derby.

**What the fans think**

*Thanks to /r/HuddersfieldTownFC for [their help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HuddersfieldTownFC/comments/6ojt20/contributions_to_huddersfields_rsoccer_premier/)*

&gt; **How do you think this season will go?**

*It's going to be tough for us, can't deny that all other teams have 'bigger' players than us but what we have that some don't is proper direction. Every one pulls together. We're a close knit team that know what Wagner is about and all sing from the same hymn sheet. I think because of this we'll surprise a few early on in the season and hopefully we can build on the positivity of promotion to bag a decent return of points before Christmas and end the season fairly comfortably. Though realistically I know we will probably be down in the dog fight!*

- /u/Finchester

*I don't think I've heard/spoken to one fan who seriously thinks we'll stay up, but who knows. Wagner has bought in a lot of players who seem to have potential, like he did last year, so if that pays off we could do ok. First 5 games, any other season you'd think we had a chance to get some decent points, but it's such an unknown. Last 5 games though...*

- /u/FourthTimeLucky
  
&gt; **Which player is going to be your star of the season and why?**
 
*Hard to say with so many new players. Mounie sounds a threat in the air, Zanka sounds a crazy character at CB. Ince is having a good preseason already. Mooy is the Australian star. But I'm looking forward to seeing Kasey Palmer and Van La Parra. Those two have more nutmeg in them than grandma's eggnog.*

- /u/Tomazao

*Tom Ince. He has looked the best player pre-season (even though I know pre-season form doesn't mean anything) and him scoring goals will be vital for us.*

- /u/Will1603
 
&gt; **How do you think the team will line up?**
 
*[Like this,](http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=f2s3) but there's a lot of changes that can be made. We've great some great depth, and I struggle to work out myself where how all the players hit in. Can see us dropping the CAM back into the midfield against stronger teams.*

- /u/TheRedditDinosaur

*Lössl - Smith, Zanka, Schindler, Lowe - Hogg, Mooy - Kachunga, Palmer, Ince - Mounie.*

*Wagner rotates a lot to keep freshness so also expect to see a lot of Williams, Malone, Van La Parra, Billing, Wells and Depoitre too.*

- /u/Finchester

*I have no clue what goes in the amazing mind that is David Wagner.*

###Wrap Up
by /u/NickTM
 
-
 
**Summary:** Huddersfield defied the odds to make it to the Prem, but will their understated signings promote good team spirit or will they simply lack the quality to survive?
 
**What to say:** YEAH THE MOOYS
 
**What you might end up saying:** Shouldn't have dogged the Mooys.
 
**Why to like them:** Huddersfield break the usual mould of clubs coming up from the Championship by not being one we've already seen in the past ten years. David Wagner's an interesting chap. Jonas Lössl's name has some solid potential for when he drops a clanger.
 
**Why to dislike them:** They're a bit boring to watch. Someone let the intern have a go at designing the home kit on Paint.NET.
 
**If the team was a Simpsons character, it would be:** Gil. Why won't anyone give a shot to 'ol Gil?!

6p1bcw,5,2017-07-23,"How We Raised 14,000 for our Podcasts' Kickstarter in 28 days!",CursiveWasAWaste,podcasts,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/6p1bcw/how_we_raised_14000_for_our_podcasts_kickstarter/,"We are just 2 days away from finishing our Kickstarter to convert a bus into a mobile studio and travel South America interviewing people for our podcast -[On the Bus Podcast](http://bit.ly/OTBItunes2). We reached our set goal of $9500 in just 9 days. And have since reached $14,000. Out true goal was $15,000, but as Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform, we lowered our set goal. The Great news? We are just $1,000 short.
 
[Reddit!](https://reddit.com)[You can see the Kickstarter here!](http://kck.st/2tAF6zk) It’s been an incredible experience and has helped catapult the business and monetizing side of our podcast. 

There were many reasons we decided to start a crowdfund project: Raise money for the tour, bolster the overarching concept, test different market segments for our podcast, increase audience, test the market for branded products, connect and build relationships with social media influencers and bloggers, see what type of ads work best, add emails to a list to promote episodes and products, find new guests for the show, link up with people across South America, test out different social media networks and improve posting quality, and improve listener experience. 

My goal is to give this community an outline of how we made the kickstarter PRE-LAUNCH happen and the potential reasons why it can work for you. I think journalism is the lowest funded of all the categories on Kickstarter and it can be very difficult to monetize and raise money (we havn’t set up a Patreon yet) so maybe this will inspire some of you to think creatively. As this is an outline of how we did it, feel free to ask questions afterwards for more details.

Also please note that if everyone loves this post than I will also do a post-launch case study post, and a data post where ill add my final analysis, and then potentially a follow-up 3 months after launch post talking about sending the rewards and following through on the campaign.

**PRE PREPERATION**
The prep work took roughly 3 months from inception of concept until the day we launched. Initially we thought we’d put it up within 30 days but to do it the RIGHT way requires that additional effort and trial and error. I suspect that had we put it up earlier we wouldn’t be nearly successful. Here is a shortened list of what we went through 
•	Decide between Indigogo and Kickstarter – Indiegogo is more directed towards creatives and art (podcasts included) but in our research we discovered that very few (or maybe none) had been funded at the level we hoped to accomplish. Kickstarter requires something tangible as an outcome. Each has its own rules and benefits. There is lots of reading material on this.
•	Ask people who have successfully funded campaigns before. Pick their brain on which platform to use. Ask for advice and take notes
•	List the main goal (Ours was make a mobile studio)
•	List the demographic of who is going to fall in love with what you are launching (People who thirst or dream for location dependance.)
•	[Tim Ferriss – Hacking Kickstarter: How to Raise $100,000 in 10 days](https://tim.blog/2012/12/18/hacking-kickstarter-how-to-raise-100000-in-10-days-includes-successful-templates-e-mails-etc/). We used this as a guide for many steps, it includes templates and it was a HUGE reason we were successful.

**CREATE BUZZ IN YOUR NETWORK**
One of the first things we did was generate buzz. We did this by adding intros to our show that discussed Kickstarter dates and slowly teased and leaked details through each episode. We also dripped out some social media posts and personally told our closest fans and friends. What worked very well was giving friends and fans a preview of the video and the writing copy and asking for feedback.

**BUILD A GAMEPLAN**
This is the most underrated part of the project. We outlined step by step every aspect of the campaign and we kept things flexible. We had a Pre-Launch plan, a post-launch plan and an after launch plan.

**HIRE A VIRTUAL ASSISTANT**
This is something that you want to do right away. I am luckily experienced in hiring freelancers through [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) and it will definitely slow you down if you don’t hire the right person. Take extra time to ensure you have a quality V.A. Some key elements of the job description: Speak good English (most important – I ask them to rank their English skills from 1-10), data entry skills, social media experience, can think outside the box, outreach experience, follows directions, always available. It may seem silly to list some of these as qualifications... I assure you its of the upmost importance.

Make sure to do live interviews- we used Skype or google hangouts. Setup multiple interviews and have at minimum 3 candidates that you are very interested in. You want to have another available in case one falls through, which is exactly what happened for us. We lost a week as our first V.A. couldn't get the job done and wasn't available when called upon. It also takes a few days to get the hiring process completed.  

Record videos of each of their tasks. Super important. We used a free 7 day trial program called SnagIt. Recording videos has many benefits. 1. They will always be able to go back and see exactly how something is done. There is no miscommunication. It’s a time saver (you only have to send them a video once).

Use Google Docs. Create a document in the google drive for all things Kickstarter. Here are the labels we used on our sheets (Social Schedule, Instagram Bloggers, Responses Tracking, Final Media List). The social schedule was where we pre-planned every social media release post for our V.A. to schedule such as Instagram and FB posts – we left space for photos and text copy, dates and times. 

**USING INSTAGRAM**
In the Tim Ferris document he talks about finding bloggers and media sources that will write about your kickstarter. What didn’t work for us was searching for bloggers in the same space. I suspect its because there are not many podcasts first of all and then we are a non niche podcast (talk radio) and its harder to find writers for that. So instead we decided to segment Instagram and twitter for writers in a similar fashion. (Although for you his directions may work).

Here are some key points we did to access Instagram for bloggers:
•	Create Instagram Blogger sheet – (can provide more details if you ask)
•	Have V.A. find most relevant hashtags to our kickstarter
•	Have V.A. Add 100 instagrammers to the blogger sheet
•	We went through every one of them and ranked them on scale of 1-5
•	Figure out what makes the 3.5s-5s so good. We looked at post content and hashtags and then analyzed which hashtags and content were similar.
•	Create a set of rules for V.A. to research instagrammers (for example we used the hashtags #socialgood #skoolie and #digitalnomad, we also said they can only have &lt;20% photos of themselves)
•	Have V.A. add another 300 people to list and rank those. 
•	Reachout to the names on this list. Tim Ferriss mentions how important it is that you get an introduction to people, and we found that cold intros are very hard so you have to really offer them something and appeal to their heart strings. There is a great Gary Vee Instagram video on this. Be very personal. Offer collaboration. Essentially though it took us 50-100 trial messages before we honed on the right type of message. Here is an example of a message that worked: “Hey xyz, love your profile and vision, adding comedic elements to travel is a unique space… We have a kickstarter about to drop and looking for some exposure. Our kickstarter is about making a studio mobile – traveling South America while interviewing and interacting with guests along the way. Our goals align really well with yours (lotta laughs on our show). Let us know what it takes to get a shout out on your page. Thanks!
•	Note: We preferred emailing people over Instagram DM but both work. Tim Ferriss doc has excellent further info on this method. Also know that this portion took the longest – people take forever to respond so this needs to be done almost first.
•	Once we had our list its important to confirm when they will post. Not all who said they would actually came through. 

Some influencers wanted financial incentive which we did – this was a key market tester for us. We paid influencers in that sphere to test the numbers in the market. We did a blog post, Instagram post, and Instagram story paid for. We found that the blog post didn’t do as well as we thought and the Instagram post and story did well but not as well as we hoped. We suspect this is from not having targeted enough instagrammers, OR we didn’t connect our campaign well enough for the general public. Great to know though for future audience building.

Hashtags were a key element of our social media posts (see creating photos section below). Our V.A. specialized in hashtags and picked out a few sets that would be used in our posts to get the best possible audience and engagement. She also followed and commented on relevant influencers pages. More details on this can be asked for

**CREATING A VIDEO**
I think without a video something like 90% of Kickstarters fail. We were lucky to have someone make us a video for FREE. How did we get a high quality free video? It took us about a month of asking around, searching our networks. In the end a business friend of ours donated the video to us because he loved the podcast and the project. He also wanted to add this to his resume. There are plenty of people out there that are willing to do the same. There are college kids that need internships. Leverage your podcast or your job. There is mutual benefit somewhere. My advice: Get a video no matter what. Even if its just you on the couch or you in the studio explaining what the project is. 

**DEVELOP YOUR REWARDS**
Creating rewards for a podcast is a bit tricky. For Kickstarter you have to provide something tangible. And as a podcast you want to provide something that is extremely relevant to the project and the message that you convey. Since our podcast is geared towards travel and millennials, we offered rewards that would support our audience and be very appealing. You definitely want to think outside of the box here. Surprisingly our fastest and bestselling reward was a decal with your name on the back of the bus for $100. It’s clear why – its interactive with the project AND personal. The most backers will be in the $25 range. Psychologically people won’t spend money on the most expensive and they won’t buy the cheapest, so we built a few rewards around that range ($3,$15,$20,$25,$35,$50) and it worked well. We were evenly distributed across all rewards.

However, what crushed was that we made some awesome rewards in the $350-$600 range that were super outside the box and selling those was a BIG home run for us. Those rewards included a FLAG for $350 – where we will take 15 photos with a flag with your logo – great exposure for a brand. $500 – your own episode. $600 – you’ll have to look at the kickstarter for more info on this one. We targeted a specific set of our audience. Awhile back - one of our monetization ideas was to give people upfront access to the exciting part of travel but are too lazy, scared, or busy to go do it themselves. When we discussed this idea with people they loved it. So we decided to offer a reward for those people. The trick here is know your audience.

**THE KEY IS TO FOLLOW HOW TO HACK A KICKSTARTER**
I’d say the most successful part of the campaign was building an email list using friends and family. Building a landing page. And getting our video to go viral the first week. This is a MUST. We followed the directions to the T. We leveraged leadpages.net for landing pages and they were easy to use and we are more than willing to share those with you guys. We made thank you videos and constantly expressed gratitude on our podcast, FB, Instagram and wherever we could. 


**CREATING PHOTOS**
Something we wanted to do was have a constant barrage of media releases related to podcasting. We are by no means experts at marketing or ads. We took as many cool photos as we could that were in differing scenarios. Some were us in a studio. Others on a bus. I took the photos to fiverr and for $35 total we got the kickstarter logo and our logo added to all of our photos. We also DMed other school bus conversions with great photos on Instagram and asked if we could use their photo for media release. We got 2 for free and 1 we paid $10. We asked our network which photos they liked the most and they helped us analyze which to use. 

Then we then added these photos to the social media release schedule for the V.A. and she posted them daily. Its important to note that we tested different types of writing copy here. We had our V.A. track impressions, reach, and engagement of each photo so that we could use the data down the road. We wanted to see which text copy and photo worked best so that we could use it for adds in the future. We also added other posts that were podcast related so that we didn’t blast our feed with pitches. We wanted to keep the integrity of our stuff. 

What was interesting was that the travel photos of our trip were more successful than the podcast aspect on instagram. We saw much higher engagement on the travel related text and photos compared to podcast. I suspect this is because of the type of user on instagram. Unfortunately we didn't spend enough time on twitter and the sample size is too small, however the engagement is at a higher %. If I could do this over again I would focus on growing twitter for the podcast element on instagram for the travel element.

**ACCESSING YOUR MAJOR NETWORKS**
Besides cold messaging instagrammers and bloggers and friends and family. Another important task is getting people who already love your message to share. We called in some favors and asked some of our guests to share. We got a friend over at a site called [LIVE a GREAT STORY](http://bit.ly/2u6UKCm) to make us ambassadors for his site and he wrote a 3 page write-up on us as a feature. We had a guest that has 11,000 youtube followers in the travel space give us a [1 minute feature on his newest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5D07VRry1Rc). There was more than that but the relationships we built with our show were leveraged. This was definitely the best method for posting from outside communities. The posts were very organic and directed at the right audiences. 

The one thing we wanted to accomplish the most that we never succeeded on was a BIG NAME Youtube influencer to share our video. We were thinking of someone with over 150,000 subscribers in our space. We messaged School bus and Van life conversion VLOGGERS and digital nomad vloggers. Most were very interested but they ALL wanted something major in return. A feature on the show in person was asked by 3. This was definitely something we WANTED to provide but the schedules conflicted. I suspect this would have been the best method to converting pledges. I think this is worth paying as well potentially as high as $1000 based on my data analysis. Unfortunately we didn’t get to try it out.

**2 DAYS PRE LAUNCH**
The last 2 days (besides being filled with anxiety) were spent messaging friends and family. A well known person gave us great advice “Get verbal commitment from each and every person before the launch.” So we messaged everyone who loves our show and told them about the email coming Monday morning. Asked them to share. We also asked what they would pledge and stressed the importance of pledging on the first day. Although I don’t know the algorithm of Kickstarter – I suspect that us getting so much the first 48 hours is what made us the #1 journalism kickstarter right off the bat. Being at the top of Kickstarter got us noticed. 

To reiterate: For this part its essential you follow the Tim Ferriss how to hack a kickstarter. Use their templates, use landing pages, use mailchimp to email friends and family. Ask people for their email addresses for those you don’t have. Don’t leave anyone out. 

Cheers to everyone who has a podcast. It can be difficult doing something you love with AND without support and if this just gives one person the chutzpah to take the leap than that’s a success.  Its very doable. Even if you JUST did the email to friends and family part with landing pages than I believe you can accomplish wonderful things using Indiegogo or kickstarter. Part 2 Post-Launch Coming soon!

6p1g8k,2,2017-07-23,Undiagnosed - Has anyone experienced a facial droop?,kristin74,chiari,https://www.reddit.com/r/chiari/comments/6p1g8k/undiagnosed_has_anyone_experienced_a_facial_droop/,"I am undiagnosed however have signs/symptoms of chiari and am also being referred to an ehlers-danlos clinic for many other issues that have been around pretty much my entire life. I also have hypothyroidism (back to normal levels with medication) and was diagnosed with open angle glaucoma in the winter, when the problems below really kicked in, and I was referred to an opthamologist due to ocular hypertension. 

In January, I started feeling like I had a sinus infection and from there came the constant headaches, pressure, ringing ears, pain around my head, neck, and ears, blurred and occasional double vision, major difficulty swallowing, tingling and numbness, ect.. At the time I noticed a gland on my left side by my ear (parotid) was also sticking out a little however it isn't swollen. I guessed sinus because I've had what I thought to be sinus issues for a long time.

A couple weeks ago I again felt like my sinuses were acting up and my nose looked swollen on the right side, so I took a picture to show my rheumatologist as I had an appointment the next day. When I looked at the picture I realized my left side was lower, my smile and eyes didn't match. My nose isn't actually swollen at all, it's just looks like it because the left side is lower.  I didn't feel like I was in danger of having a stroke so I left it until my appointment. 

My rheumatologist sent me to a stroke prevention clinic, which checks to see if it was a stroke or if there is immediate danger, and then basically fast tracks a referral to a neurologist. I was already waiting on a referral but had been told it would be a long time.

While I did not have a stroke (yay!) they confirmed weakness in the left nasoblial fold and a corresponding weakness seen inside my throat - the left side is lower. Likely the reason for the swallowing issue.. they asked a lot of questions and I was finally able to fully explain what's going on and where. Truthfully, it took what looked like a stroke to finally be taken seriously. 

They did a neurological exam and I apparently had at least one abnormal reflex - I only know this because the doctor explained it to the student doctor - both knees had a pendular reflex and swung several times before resting. I looked it up and abnormal reflexes are a sign of something going on in the brain. They are most concerned about the droop and swallowing problem as I'm losing weight pretty quickly, weight I can't afford to lose as I'm already underweight. 

I'm currently waiting for an MRI, echocardiogram, and holter monitor as well as possibly a sleep study as I've had insomnia for years and have noticed I'm waking up even more often than before,

Just before my stroke clinic appointment, I had a spinal MRI done to look for signs of ankylosing spondylitis as I had symptoms and my doctor wanted to be sure even though blood tests implied otherwise. At my follow up (2 days before the stroke clinic) the intern said all it showed was mild arthritis in my neck. A few days later when I received the report, it actually noted more than that, but I don't understand it or know if it could relate to chiari or if it's normal.

Report: Mild to moderate diffuse discophyte C5-6 with narrowing anterior CSF column, secondary mild narrowing spinal canal without overt spinal canal stenosis. Minimal facet effusions L4-5, L5-S1. Cord ends lower T12.

Impression: Mild to moderate diffuse discophyte C5-6. No imaging features of axial spondyloarthropathy.

Again, not sure if that means anything but when I looked into the narrowing CSF column it led me to chiari, and after reading so much about it, here I am.

So, as I wait for tests and hopefully some answers, I was curious if anyone else had experienced facial weakness/drooping? While I hadn't noticed before, in looking at pictures over the last year, I can see the droop started and has progressed over time. Funny how when you look at yourself in a mirror you don't really notice but see a picture and wham, there it is. The slow progression rules out stroke and bell's palsy, both of which were the initial potential causes. 

Now, once again, I wait in limbo and wonder how much worse I'll get before moving forward. Fingers crossed my tests are soon, this isn't living, it's just getting by.

Hello,
I am a computer engineering student in Turkey and i want to share some feelings with you guys.
When i first hear btc in 2012, i was in high school and didnt care much about its future and possibilities that i could get.I bought what i can at that time and literally forgot them.(lol i searched so hard to find them in my old computers)One month ago bitcoin videos started to appear on my youtube recommendations and i watched them.I watched them all and read every post, every comment about bitcoin here too.After that,i started buying the amount of i can afford.
I wont go into politics but if you know even little thing about Turkey, you would know that Turkey is a country with little chance of bright future according to economy and relationships with other countries.
(1 USD = 3,53 TRY and 1 BTC = 9.676 TRY)
After i get into bitcoin again and reading your comments about future, i started to feel hope again for me and my families future.I am feeling this much more than i used to.It's like hype including with hope,joy,cheer and all that.I am getting paid 150 USD a month as an intern and i am so lucky that i have salary is an intern.The reason why i am giving you these datas are, to see how big is btc in my future life, how big is bitcoin against my countries currency.From tiniest amounts according to you, probably me and my families life will be saved with bitcoin.Even i might be late for buying again, i have no regrets i feel no fear and i have so much hope that things will go pretty well.Thank you so much you guys, for helping me a lot without even knowing.Every post and comment you guys commit are increasing my hope in this situation day by day.Thank you so much for being in my life, leading my future.

tl;dr Dude im crying thank you for everything."

I went to college so bright and cheerful ready to take it on.  However my horrible girlfriend dragged me down every day.  Forcing me to spend my nights on skype instead of studying.  My grades slipped, I started smoking cigarettes and weed.  Something I thought I would never do.  I had a ""friend"" who made fun of me at every opportunity he god, encouraged me not to quit cigs, and to skip class.  

I was slipping into the deepest depression I've ever felt in my life.  my grades slipped, I began to lost my grip on reality.  My girlfriend cheated on me with the same ""friend"" who treated me like trash.  

I failed out, but was given a second chance with a program designed to help students who are failing.  However that program is for people who are bad at school.  Not depressed lonely people like me.  It didn't work, I failed out for real and was forced to leave.  


I let a shitty friend and a bad girlfriend ruin my life.  

I had to enroll in night classes to build up my GPA at another school, my previous GPA was a 1.7, nobody wants that in their life.  Every night I drove 40 minutes to and from this school to take these classes.  

I did excellent and was accepted.  I met my current girlfriend who is honestly truly one of the most caring people I know.  But If that was the end of the story I wouldn't be writing this.  

I carried so much baggage, I am disgusted with myself for having let someone walk all over me and beat me down to nothing. For having let someone 600 miles away form me dictate when I can and can't go out.  I haven't let go of this feeling of guilt yet.  

I'm depressed still, I have many coping mechanisms that allow me to forget this. I have a porn adiction, that has led me to view some extreme porn on the internet just to get off.  Everything from straight, to gay, to downright peophilic material.  

And here I am again disgusted with myself.  A year ago I just started my relationship, my addiction to porn led me to a shady site, where I met a man.  Chatted and shared pictures with him, he sent me a massive collection of child porn unprovoked.  I deleted it immediately.

To say I didn't look would be a lie, anything to fuel my desire to masturebate.  Nothing was off limits.   After that day I made a vow never to talk to anyone online or visit that website again.  I had just cheated on my girlfriend, after being cheated on by my ex.  However just like my stories before this doesn't go to plan.  

I lasted the rest of that summer, when I'm at school these desires are simple to control.  Its very easy to avoid porn when you have a girlfriend a mile away. However I still watched regular legal porn every day.  This took its toll on me, I was frequently unable to perform for my girlfriend.  God bless her soul she was never bothered by this and gave me full respect.

The semester ended alright and I went home, the first three weeks I took off.  I watched porn almost every day, however when I started my internship I made an attempt to stop again.  

this lasted about a week, before I was back at it.  The stress of an 1:40 commute back and forth drove me to crave a release every single day.  And as anyone who's watched alot of porn will tell you, you get desensitized very quickly.  eventually I found myself on the same website again, looking for someone to chat with.  however this time I couldn't find anyone, so I resorted to omeggle until I found a willing participant.  

A 15 year old male, I am 22. We chatted and shared images of ourselves.  

Immediately after I broke down, called my girlfriend and told her what happened.  I couldn't live with myself anymore holding this lie in, I couldn't do it.  I told her, and she is a saint because she agreed to work through this with me.      


last night I had a breakdown, freaking out about the fact that this individual I spoke to knowingly, was underage. 

I have panic attacks  
I have a porn addiction  
I am suicidal   
I feel worthless frequently  
I hold things in for fear of punishment  
I often choose coping over solving the problem  

I've decided to get help, I've told my parents that I am depresed, and I am going to get professional help. I wan't my life back, I don't want to be on one of those sex offender TV shows.  I wan't to be in control of what I do, I want to live again and feel alive once more.  

Wish me luck"

-----------------

Mark looked from the picture to the boy sitting in front of him. Braces, glasses, gangly, dumbass expression on his face. Yep, same person: Gregory Hammond, a local high school student. 

""Why is this a picture of you?"" he asked. ""The idea is you give me a picture of someone *else*. What, that wasn't in the guide when you Googled 'how to hire an hitman'? How *did* you find me, anyway?""

""You gotta make it look like an accident, please dude."" Tears were slowly gathering in the kid's eyes. ""I can't take it anymore - they never stop beating me up at school...""

""Who does?"" he asked, idly curious. It always paid to keep track of people like that over the years.

""Dan, Michael, Jared and Ben,"" Gregory rattled off the list of names and took a deep, shuddering breath. ""Bullied me since freshman year. There's not a single fucking person who likes me in that place. I can't take any more of it. But I don't want my parents to blame themselves by thinking I killed myself, they've always been there for me, and -""

""Yeah, yeah, this is all very sad. Answer the question, boy,"" Mark interrupted. ""How did you find me? Also, how would you even pay me for this hypothetical hit, mmm?""

Gregory flinched as Mark leaned forward across the desk, fingers steepled in front of him. 

""Oh, well, I found a few references to you online. Wrote a custom computer programme to trace you, and it led me here, eventually..."" he mumbled, then produced several wads of money. ""I - I brought payment, mister uhm...Mark.""

Mark snorted with laughter as he counted the cash: not nearly enough, anyway. But the boy had found him, that was the important part. If a pimply teenager could find him, so could the FBI. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, eyes flicking towards Gregory. He'd read up about him, of course, he did his research on every client: this kid had won just about every computer science prize that existed since he was out of diapers.

""Could you write another programme that erases all references to me? That makes my identity more secure, so to speak?""

The kid pushed his glasses up his nose and bit his lip in thought. ""I mean, sure, theoretically. But what about...""

Greg's voice trailed away as Mark stood up and drew his gun, quickly becoming even paler than usual.

""There's a computer in the corner there. Get started on it, alright? I've got some business to take care of, we'll discuss your hit later,"" he said, striding from his office and locking the door behind him. He fervently hoped the kid wouldn't slit his wrists in his nice new leather chair while he was gone, but he'd seen that light flicker in his eyes: Greg was interested in the challenge.

Just like him, in a way. It almost gave him a warm and fuzzy feeling.

Almost.

--------

When he returned, the boy had found a live stream of the news on the computer. The bodies of several boys were briefly shown.

""You...you killed them, didn't you?"" he said, his voice growing squeakier with each word. His eyes bulged as a picture of him appeared on the news, next. ""They're looking for *me*! What the fuck!""

""Yeah, I kind of framed you. Okay, here's the deal,"" Mark said. ""Your job is to continue help me make my identity as secure as possible, got that? In return, I'll keep you safe from the cops. Or I'll hand you to them. I think you'd prefer being dead to a juvenile detention centre, personally. And if you try to betray me, I'll make sure you die really slowly and in unbearable agony. Might send your parents a few pieces, too, as a little souvenir.""

He grinned to himself as the kid gaped at him. This was far better than getting one of the professional computer geeks in his line of work to help him out, the feds were always looking for them, too. But nobody would suspect *this*. Professional hitmen usually didn't take on teenage interns.  

""I would have helped you for free if you just *asked*,"" Greg said weakly. ""What the fuck is wrong with you?""

Mark stared at him, lost for words for once.

""Never occurred to me to ask,"" he finally admitted, then slapped Greg on the back. ""And I kill people for a living, kid, there's a lot of things wrong with me. Okay, fine, I'll pay you. And if you do a good job we can even let your parents know you're safe somewhere. How does that sound?""

Greg just shook his head and turned back to the computer, fingers flying over the keyboard. ""Sounds like I don't have any choice.""

""No, you really don't. But hey, at least you're alive,"" Mark said cheerfully, and tossed the kid's money back at him. ""And here's your first paycheck, buddy! Now that's what I call a sweet deal.""

The internship explicitly said a car would be necessary.  He said he would buy one at the beginning but eventually did not and started using me.  I had brought my car and agreed to drive him to work if he helped with gas (we were splitting 50-50).  We do almost everything together: workout, eat, weekend activities.  I've also been agreeing to let him take the car if he needs to go somewhere when I am at the apartment doing nothing. I only go out of my way to drive him to his lessons once a week and we agreed to $5 per instance.  Now I got into a car wreck and my car is totaled without insurance.  I am going to buy a car and i am realizing the true cost of the luxury that is having a car and 50-50 on gas suddenly doesn't feel right (my mom had been paying everything on the old one).  How do I now charge him for transportation in a reasonable way? My argument: shit's expensive and you need to help out.  His argument: you'd be going to work anyways.

6p3q91,5,2017-07-23,Mindfulness meditation is amazing and has given me the strength to finally break my PMO addiction,tablagetbetter,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6p3q91/mindfulness_meditation_is_amazing_and_has_given/,"I am 21 years old and have been struggling to quit porn and break my PMO habit since I was 17 years old and in high school. I started using porn around 14 and got hooked of course. Since high school and now well into college I've struggled greatly with low self esteem and stress especially in school. I've felt disconnected from my friends and awkward and anxious.

This past semester I worked a very stressful internship which just brought out all the worst of these issues and I experienced really bad anxiety to the point where I felt like I couldn't even talk to people. I felt no motivation, no energy, sleepy all the time, and very pessimistic about the future. Looking back I think I was (and maybe still am) suffering from some form of depression along with this anxiety. 

At the end of this internship and into the summer I started looking into meditation and mindfulness practices specifically because I had heard that meditation can help calm anxiety and also be as effective as an antidepressant for some people without the side effects of drugs. Over the past couple months I've been meditating every day. I started with 10 minutes a day, went to 15 a day, and now am at 20 minutes every day and I can feel that it has become a consistent habit.

By far, more than any exercise habit I've tried developing or any other form of motivation and self-help, the meditation is changing my life. I feel so mentally clear, optimistic, and just overall happy and hopeful about the future. With mindfulness training I feel like I'm actually able to just enjoy my life the way it is right now instead of constantly being anxious about socializing or not having a girlfriend or what people think of me.

Pertaining to nofap, it has given me a newfound resolve and drive that I never had before to quit PMO and cut out the garbage from my life to keep improving myself. I've relapsed so many times in the past few years just because I lose resolve and start feeling down and depressed again and feel like my future will never be better. I now feel like I've broken out of that vicious self-pity and sadness cycle and have a sense of energy and optimism that I haven't had since I was like 12 years old. 




**TL; DR: Meditation and mindfulness especially is a really effective tool to calm the mind and be more optimistic and give the mental strength to break a PMO addiction.**"

I spent 21 years of my life following the Bible and trying to ""spread the gospel."" My mother and I were a part of a cult when I was a kid that shaped me a lot in an unfortunate way. I was an intern at a mega church when I was 18 and then a missionary from 19-20. I saw a lot of hypocrisy the time I was in ministry, so I decided to change the course of where my life was going. 

Long story short, I am not even a Christian anymore. I cringe at the thought of telling new people that I was a missionary. I still believe in God, but in a totally different capacity. I'm still trying to wrap my head around my new belief system, but have found little resources for Christians leaving Christianity. 

I feel as thought I have been spiritually traumatized and abused as a child, and when I look at church today, all I see is the church making money and controlling their congregations by a threat of hell. 
I don't want to think this way anymore but it's hard when I've been behind the scenes and saw it first hand.

I look down at my watch, i can't believe i have a fucking year of this shit to sit through. I want to tear into this fucking 300lb neck beard who got busted spying on high school girls trying on clothes at American Eagle. Fucking pervert had a problem. Me though? I did not have a problem. My bitch of an ex had a problem. She reported that i ""assualted"" her last new years eve. We had done everything under the sun together, she even went ass to mouth a few times. She was filthy. It all went to shit one night when i was drunk and accidently said her sister's name when i was balls deep in her. She kicked me out and i had officers at my office the day to book me for sexual assault. I took a similar deal that you did and just got on with things as soon as possible. Having to clearly state that i was guilty of sexual assult did something to me, it planted a seed in a very dark corner of my brain that lucky had not gotten the light needed to grow. 

That was until Herb took the podium. Herb did have a problem. Herb was blunt about it. He liked having sex with girls that were not his wife, and did not want to have sex with him. On his light nights he would meet girls at bars and fuck them in his van. On bad nights he skipped the first step. He had done decades in jail for rape. Jail had robbed him of shame, or decency. If you asked, Herb a was the worst kind of open book. He would go into detail about his transgressions. Talking about the young girls that he charmed at the bar, their outfits, ages, and how they screamed when he pinned them down. Telling the room how he would usually look for girls in short skirts that smelled of cigarettes. He knew that they were with people who knew they dissapeared for periods of time to smoke, and he would not risk tearing pants to fuck them if there was a struggle. There is not telling how many he raped. Talking about how he would bind their hands with soft lined leather cuffs to not leave marks, quickly clipping them to the waiting wall in his van before he ripped their panties off. He talked about the rise of the thong in the 80's and how he was disappointed that pubic hair became almost non existent in the late 90's.He talked about the large tub of vasoline he kept in his van for ""the dry cunts that really did not want it"" and he bragged about the ""sluts who were already wet for him"". It was grotesque, but i was hanging on every word. He would take everything from these girls. If they tried to give in, letting their legs fall apart to offer him their young fresh cunts he would reach for an extra glop of vasoline and swirl it around their assholes, pushing himself deep into the last place they wanted him to be. He made sure to never cum in them, always pulling out and filling their panties with the evidence, releasing them to find their friends in the dark smoky clubs. He went on for over 20 years, finally being caught be a quick thinking sorority girl who snapchated her own rape. Police found him in the time it took him to drive home, discovering his stash of cum filled panties in large totes in his garage. Most of these ""addicts"" were total bone kills, but i looked forward to Herb, each story watering my dirty secrete seed until it was in full bloom pushing through the cracks of my morals to get through. Months went on like this. You sitting next to me, fidigiting when Herb spoke, me stealthy trying to hide my now frequent erections. Herb was there not for help, but as a cautionary tale of what giving in to our desires would result in. 

The counselor was nice enough, brought good snacks and validater parking. She always had tips for avoiding relaspes. Her biggest ones being to disrupt the conditions that lead to sex. She suggested all the ladies to stop shaving their pubic hair and wear basic panties. ""If you are not proud of your downstairs, you wont be tempted to go home with him or you would need an hour of prep to get in game shape."" You laugh loudly at her instructions, leaning over to tell me you have been clean shaven since you were 15.

My cock stiffens thinking about your bald pussy, then quickly runs to it not so bald, thinking of the coarse hairs growing in, your shame of your bits growing with it. I notice you squirm and try to sneak a scratch without anyone noticing over the coming weeks. I commended you on taking her advice the 3rd time i see you scratching your croutch. You turn beat red. ""Shit am i that obvious?"" I laugh, patting your knee, a big no no in this group. ""All of you are."" I gesture to the circle and you see the other ladies slyly scratching their boxes, their hair growing and curling back into their soft skin, irritating them to no end. All but one of you seem to be experiencing this for the first time. The other girl either has the self control of a saint, which judging by her stories is far from the case, or most likely, she was rocking a jungle bush before this program. 

""Well its hell for us. You guys have it easy. No special rules for you."" You say, a terse tone in your voice as you scratch a little less bashful this time. ""Hey its hard work keeping out of trouble. Its the begining of summer, that means a fresh batch of interns. I would normally be balls deep in an eager, stacked 19 year old right now. Telling her how she really showed promise, telling her about how bright her future was at the firm, right before i blow my load on her naive little face. Leaving her with nothing but student loans and hpv."" You give me a disguested look as you are begining to see that i may not be so harmless after all. 

You may have picked the wrong person to get through this with. The weeks turn to months as we go through the meetings, listening to person after person confess their darkest secretes. Some like Herb are truly fucked up, others are as we usually joke are ""adorable"" belittling their ""problem"" someone jacking off in the back of a comic book store to amime porn is not something that 20 people need to listen to. 

You seem to be doing well with the programs, still complaining about your ""unmaintained garden"" and rocking some very visable panty lines each meeting. ""So you are really doing it huh? No sex for you?"" You beam, feeling pride in your unusally long ""dry spell"" you stand up and announce its been months since you last had sex, praising the teachers tips, joking about the disaster between your legs, and borrowing your mothers panties. You sheepishly confirm the effectiveness of ""tactical masturbation"" that we learned about and declare that you are ready to start looking for a healthy, emotion based relationship, not one based on physical attraction. 

""Can i take you out for a drink? You know to celbrate how far you came? You deserve to blow off some steam with a friend. You look at me, trying to see past my smooth personality, and into my actual intentions. ""Sure, but this is not a date, this is the furthest thing from a date."" I smile and nod. 

""Oh this is for sure not a date."" I saw a little devilish.

Do I need to pay capital gains on the gain in property value when I gift?** 

Hello,

I came to the UK in 2012 for uni. 

In June 2014, my parents gifted me our family home (abroad in a country with a tax agreement with the UK) for my sister and myself to live in while they moved to another country. I have lived in this home since 2009 aside from when I was physically in the UK for uni. I returned here every break I got from uni and my sister has continued to live in this home.  This property has never been rented out.

My intention was to return home after graduating, however I received a year long internship offer the month before my graduation ceremony (July 2015), and have since found a permanent job living, renting and working in the UK.

Seeing as it looks like I'll be here in the long term I thought it would be appropriate to gift my sister the property as I intend to purchase here and would like avoid paying the stamp duty surcharge, if possible, as I do not think I will be returning back home any time soon.

Does anyone have any experience with this and know what defines a 'main residence'? In my mind, I have been renting since I've arrived in the UK and I lived in my family home when I was on my uni holidays, therefore it would make sense to call my overseas property my 'main residence' as it was the place I'd go to when I didn't need to be here. All of my UK mail is addressed to my UK rental address and all of my overseas mail goes to my overseas address. While I was in uni my overseas address was listed as my non-term-time address.

Alternatively, would speaking to HMRC help with this or should I find myself a tax adviser? 

Kind regards,

Just 24 days into his tenure as Donald Trump’s national-security adviser, Michael Flynn was forced to resign, having reportedly misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian officials. When Flynn departed, the men and women he’d appointed to the National Security Council grew nervous about their own jobs, and with good reason. The new national-security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, promptly began clearing out Flynn’s people, among them Dave Cattler, the deputy assistant to the president for regional affairs, Adam Lovinger, a strategic affairs analyst on loan from the Pentagon, and KT McFarland, Flynn’s deputy, who was eased out with the ambassadorship to Singapore. Even Steve Bannon, among the most powerful people in the White House, was removed from the meetings of the NSC Principal’s Committee, where he had been installed early on in the administration.

There was one person, however, who McMaster couldn’t get rid of: Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence programs. McMaster tried to remove him in March, but President Trump, at the urging of Bannon and Jared Kushner, told McMaster that Cohen-Watnick was staying, as first [reported](http://ift.tt/2mLFS7z) by _Politico_. According to a senior White House official, the two men had a sit-down meeting the following week in which McMaster acknowledged that he hadn’t been able to do what he wanted to do, and that they would keep things as they are and “see how they go for a while.” That was over four months ago. That Cohen-Watnick, 31 years old and largely unknown before entering the administration, has become unfireable reveals how important he has become to the Trump White House, where loyalty is prized.

The senior in Cohen-Watnick’s title reflects the importance of his job, if not the level of experience he brings to it. The senior director for intelligence programs on the NSC is a powerful position, designed to coordinate and liaise between the U.S. intelligence community and the White House.

""If the incumbent has an effective working relationship with the national-security adviser or even the president directly, the senior director for intelligence has an opportunity to exercise considerable influence on intelligence policy, covert actions, and sensitive collection operations,"" said Stephen Slick, a former CIA official who held the position during the Bush administration.

The CIA has traditionally had control over who fills this position, and normally the job is staffed by a more experienced official. McMaster, assuming he’d be allowed to relieve or reassign Cohen-Watnick, had gone so far as to [interview](http://ift.tt/2mSK5pM) Cohen-Watnick’s potential replacement, Linda Weissgold, a veteran CIA officer.

Despite his prominent, and apparently quite secure, position in Trump’s NSC, little is known about Cohen-Watnick, who had spent much of his short career as a low-ranking official at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Information about him in publicly available sources is scarce. Few higher-ups from the DIA remember him. Only one picture of him can be found online, a snapshot unearthed by Al-Monitor’s Laura Rozen.

Unlike other White House officials who have become public figures in their own right, Cohen-Watnick never speaks for himself publicly, leaving others to fill the void. Yet he hardly comes into sharper focus when you talk to co-workers, friends, and former colleagues. Ask around about Ezra Cohen-Watnick, and people get defensive. Some profess not to know him, or ask why anyone would want to write about him. Others simply refuse to discuss him.

“I won’t talk to any journalist about Ezra,” said Michael Ledeen, a Flynn confidant who knows Cohen-Watnick well.

“Is it one of your hit pieces?” asked Bannon, who didn’t respond to a further request for comment.

Bannon and Ledeen may be wary of talking about Cohen-Watnick after his first, and thus far only, turn in the national spotlight. Washington got its first real look at Cohen-Watnick when he was identified as one of two White House sources who provided House Intelligence chairman Devin Nunes with evidence that former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the “unmasking” of the names of Trump associates in intelligence documents. In the intelligence world, incidental collection refers to intelligence agencies obtaining, in the course of monitoring foreigners, communications that either refer to or involve Americans, whose names are typically “masked” unless officials request that they be “unmasked.”

The incident, coming in the aftermath of Trump baselessly accusing his predecessor of wiretapping Trump Tower, became one of the first dust-ups related to the investigations into possible Russian collusion during the 2016 campaign that have gripped the White House. The president later accused Rice of having committed a crime; for her part, Rice has denied that she ordered the unmasking for political purposes.

Despite that early controversy, Cohen-Watnick retains one of the most consequential intelligence jobs in the nation, and his influence is rising. He is in the thick of some of the most important policy fights at the White House; he is viewed as an Iran hawk and has been [characterized](http://ift.tt/2sCow12), for instance, as a main proponent of expanding U.S. efforts against Iran-backed militias in Syria. And beyond policy specifics, he’s become a flashpoint in the long-running tension between Trump and the intelligence community, a part of the U.S. government that the president has at times openly disdained.

Yet what we don’t know about Cohen-Watnick far outstrips what we do. Was he a central player in the Nunes scandal, or just a bystander? Has he retained his job due to his talent, or is he being protected because he's advancing the agenda of powerful West Wing patrons? What, besides loyalty to the president, are his credentials? Is he Flynn's mole on the council, or does he not even know the deposed national-security adviser all that well? Is he brash and difficult to work with, or modest and brilliant? And perhaps most important: Now that he has the president’s ear, what will he whisper into it?

Cohen-Watnick was raised in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington. His father is a lawyer; his mother a doctor; the couple is separated. Liberal, affluent Montgomery County is not exactly a hotbed of right-wing sentiment. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine won 74 percent of the vote there in 2016.

Cohen-Watnick attended Bethesda Chevy-Chase High School, graduating in 2004. It was in high school when Cohen-Watnick seems to have become politically active. One person who knew him at the time said that, together with a friend, Cohen-Watnick set up a table outside the Barnes and Noble in downtown Bethesda in the summer of 2003 to “just sort of argue with people about the Iraq War ... just to get into fights with Bethesda liberals.” A White House official denied this anecdote, saying it was “false.”

“Ezra’s politics are not at all normal for the cultural milieu in which he grew up,” this person said. (Cohen-Watnick did, however, intern for then-Senator Joe Biden in high school.)

Cohen-Watnick entered the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 2004. He struck one classmate there at the time as a libertarian, but over the years seemed to shift in a more hawkish direction, the classmate said. Cohen-Watnick was involved in an on-campus Terrorism Awareness Week connected to the controversial conservative writer David Horowitz’s “Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week” events.

""We need people to be passionate about the problem of terrorism,” he’s quoted as saying in a _Daily Pennsylvanian_article about the event, advocating more courses devoted to the subject.”

As a sophomore, Cohen-Watnick told _The Daily Pennsylvanian_that from a young age he had wanted to serve in the Navy. “Cohen said it was very important to him to be able to give back to something he has benefitted from—in this case, the national security that has kept generations of his family safe,” the paper reported.

But in September 2007, he also told a friend that his main goal was working for the CIA. Cohen-Watnick talked about his goal of becoming a spy “all the time,” this person said. “He did talk about the DIA,” this person said. “He always talked about it as the backup to his CIA goals.”

One White House colleague who has known Cohen-Watnick for a long time described 9/11 as a formative event for him, and remarked that members of his age group were old enough to remember the attack vividly, but young enough that it happened before they had embarked on careers. This person pointed out that Cohen-Watnick’s career path was unusual for his milieu: “Not many folks from our sort of sphere were making the decision to go into public service.”

Cohen-Watnick’s history becomes murkier around 2008, his final year at Penn. His friend from school says the last time they saw him or heard from him was before the spring semester that year. Cohen-Watnick is listed on an online roster among a group that attended the Penn in D.C. internship program in Washington in 2008, in his case interning with the Office of Naval Intelligence. Cohen-Watnick took a civilian job with the Navy after college.

A DIA spokesperson confirmed that Cohen-Watnick had joined the DIA in 2010, and left it in January of 2017, but would otherwise not confirm or comment on the details of his service. One colleague of Cohen-Watnick’s said that his last job was three or four ranks higher than the one in which he began.

_Newsweek_[reported](http://ift.tt/2pyuSJg) that Cohen-Watnick entered the Defense Clandestine Service in 2012 and was sent to “The Farm,” the CIA training facility in Virginia, in 2013. _Al-Monitor_’s Laura Rozen reported on Twitter that Cohen-Watnick had done work on Haiti while based out of the Department of Defense’s Miami office. Records show he registered to vote in 2012 with a Miami address, as a Republican and as a Hispanic male (his mother is Colombian).

According to a former senior intelligence official, Cohen-Watnick later served overseas in Afghanistan at a CIA base. “He was embedded with the Agency guys,” said a person familiar with Cohen-Watnick’s career. “But the Agency guys were all like ‘Fuck this guy, he’s just here to spy on us for Flynn and the DIA.’”

A White House official said that Cohen-Watnick did not know Flynn at the time he was in Afghanistan but did not dispute that there were “rivalries between CIA and DIA.”  

It was Cohen-Watnick’s connection with Michael Flynn that would catapult him into the top ranks of America’s intelligence officials. But even the seemingly straightforward question of how and when they met yields contradictory and conflicting accounts. One person familiar with his career asserted that Cohen-Watnick had met Matt Flynn, Michael Flynn’s son, at “The Farm.” Another, a former senior intelligence official, said he had briefed Flynn at the DIA.

According to a third person familiar with the matter, the real story is that Cohen-Watnick actually met Flynn much later, in 2016, at a coffee arranged by Michael Ledeen’s wife Barbara, who Cohen-Watnick knows from growing up outside of Washington. Ledeen is a friend of Flynn’s and co-authored the book Field of Fight with him. Barbara introduced him to Cohen-Watnick; the couple connected the young officer with Flynn, and the two kept in touch over the course of the year. Flynn became a prominent surrogate for the Trump campaign, famously leading a “lock her up” chant at the Republican National Convention, and was even considered as the running mate.  

Flynn’s time at the helm of the DIA was notoriously troubled. The general came in with a brash approach that rubbed his colleagues the wrong way and eventually led to his being forced out in 2014 by then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Mike Vickers.

This appears to have been a time at which Cohen-Watnick was at a crossroads. In the summer of 2016, Cohen, unhappy at the DIA, began applying for positions on Capitol Hill, interviewing with the House Armed Services Committee, a congressional staffer said. He was notified on August 16, 2016 that he wouldn’t be getting the job. Later that year, in November, Cohen-Watnick married Rebecca Miller, according to a notice on his family’s synagogue’s website.

Trump’s election changed everything for Cohen-Watnick, as it did for many people in Washington. He was chosen for the NSC job during the transition, surprising his new colleagues.

“I didn’t know Ezra from Adam,” said one former intelligence officer who is a member of the NSC. “I didn’t know what job he was going to have in the transition. I met him a few times. I didn’t realize he was running it at first.”

“It’s a very important position and essentially it’s a deep cull,” said a White House colleague who has known Cohen-Watnick for years. “It’s an early pick.” This official described Cohen-Watnick as someone who would seem like a natural choice for the job in five or 10 years’ time, but not now.

“It is noteworthy that someone with very limited experience (a very junior GG-12 in DIA) is appointed to such a senior and critical position,” said Doug Wise, who was for a time Flynn’s top deputy at the DIA . (GG-12 is the equivalent of an Army captain in the DIA; Cohen-Watnick’s rank before he left was actually GS-13, equivalent to a major, according to a source familiar with his career). “This is especially noteworthy when you compare Cohen to some of the individuals who have served in that position, George Tenet, David Shedd, Mary Sturtevant, Stephen Slick and other very experienced officers were already members of the Senior Intelligence Service when they were appointed. These and the other officers who served in that position were career intelligence officials with serious credentials, demonstrated maturity, and a wealth of experience.""

One way or another, Michael Flynn seems to have elevated Cohen-Watnick to his high station in the Trump administration. What remains a mystery is who exactly has protected him since Flynn went down, and why.

Cohen-Watnick’s ability to hang on despite the direct attempt by his superior to remove him raised eyebrows across Washington, and especially in the intelligence world.

“It is very unusual that when H.R. McMaster tried to move Cohen to another position within the NSC, his decision was publicly overturned by the president,” Wise said. “This says much more about Cohen’s political connections than his experience in the intelligence business.""

Here, again, multiple officials directly familiar with the events offer contrasting versions of what took place. Some insist that Kushner and Bannon were willing to expend capital on behalf of Cohen-Watnick. According to one person with direct knowledge of the meeting, the roots of their loyalty to Cohen-Watnick stem from a briefing he delivered during Trump’s first visit to the White House situation room in February, at which Kushner was present as well as Pence. Kushner and the president were apparently impressed with the young briefer and took an interest in him.

“Ezra is deeply thoughtful, hard working, and committed to serving the president,” Kushner said, offering a rare on-the-record comment, which is itself a testament to Cohen-Watnick’s importance.

But a favorable first impression doesn’t quite explain the president intervening to prevent his boss from removing him. Others stressed his commitment to Trump’s worldview, such as it is Trump’s foreign policy statements have been long on rhetoric, but short on specifics—prompting leading figures within the White House to contend for influence, seeking to persuade the president to back their preferred approaches. Those drawn from the ranks of the Republican foreign-policy establishment tend to favor its traditional views: committed to longstanding alliances like NATO, skeptical of Russia, and supportive of nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan. Others, who supported Trump’s insurgent campaign early on, tend to favor the ideas he advocated on the stump: concern that allies are freeloading, interest in strengthening ties with Russia, and a focus on the threat posed Islamic extremism in nations like Iran.

This split has created a decision-making process in which the responses to each unfolding event can point in a different policy direction than the last. After the Assad regime used chemical weapons against civilians in April, for example, Trump ordered strikes against one of their airbases, angering Syria's ally Russia. But the Trump administration recently announced a ceasefire agreement for southwest Syria negotiated with Russia.    

In this context, a staffer who personally briefs the president on his options can be an invaluable ally to other senior officials. And in an administration that has struggled to fill senior national-security roles with appointees sympathetic to Trump’s ideas, a staffer whose views are closer to the president’s than to the think-tanks that line Massachusetts Avenue may be too valuable to lose.

“I would describe President Trump’s foreign-policy vision as absolutely one Ezra completely supports,” said the White House colleague who has known Cohen-Watnick for years. “Ezra has consistently provided value, insight and support at the highest levels of the White House.”  

This may be why several White House staffers used the same word to describe Cohen-Watnick: loyal. One White House official praised Cohen-Watnick as a ""true professional and most importantly he is incredibly loyal to the president and this administration.”

“He’s loyal to the president and he’s made a super impression on everyone that deals with him, me included,” said the former intelligence officer who is now a senior NSC official.  

The Nunes scandal cemented Cohen-Watnick's reputation as a loyalist and as someone who could withstand the heat of public controversy. But once more, different officials offer flatly contradictory versions of what transpired.

The story was first reported by _The New York Times_, and then expanded by other outlets. On the night of March 21, House Intelligence chairman Nunes got a call from a source, jumped into another car and didn’t tell his staff where he was going. He was going, it turned out, to the White House. The next day, Nunes gave a now-infamous press conference at the Capitol in which he described how “the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.” Though the phrase “incidental collection” by definition refers to the communications individuals who are not targets of surveillance, Nunes’ statement was taken by Trump supporters as vindication of the president’s tweet accusing Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower, an incident intelligence chiefs have told Congress never happened.   

Nunes claimed at one point that his source had been an intelligence official, not White House. Citing four U.S. officials, the _Times_[later reported](http://ift.tt/2ofvEOL) that his sources on the intelligence reports were Cohen-Watnick and Michael Ellis, a lawyer in the White House Counsel’s Office focused on national security. But the question of who cleared Nunes onto White House grounds, and why Cohen-Watnick was looking into the material, have never been fully answered. The strong implication of the stories about the incident has been that either Cohen-Watnick, Ellis or both cleared Nunes onto the campus.

But one official with knowledge of the incident offered a sharply different account. Cohen-Watnick was asked to look at unmasking procedures by a civil servant working in the Situation Room as part of a review, this official claimed, weeks before the Nunes visit to the White House. In a tweet on March 4, Trump had accused the Obama administration of wiretapping Trump Tower during the election. Cohen-Watnick asked to see examples of unmasking and was given a block calendar year to review. In those, he saw “something that made him concerned” and informed John Eisenberg, the NSC legal adviser.

Weeks later, according to this official, Cohen-Watnick went over to Eisenberg’s office on a different matter and found the door closed; he was told that another White House staffer was inside the office with Nunes. He did not enter the office. According to the official, this was the extent of Cohen-Watnick’s involvement in the Nunes affair.  

The incident snowballed quickly. On March 27, Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking member on HPSCI, called for Nunes to recuse himself. Nunes eventually bowed to pressure—and an ethics complaint—and announced his recusal on April 6. In doing so, he blamed “leftwing activist groups” and said the charges against him were “entirely false and politically motivated.”  

(Nunes has gone on to claim that he never recused himself from the investigation, and has issued subpoenas relating to the probe. His spokesman did not respond to requests for an interview for this story.)

Whether or not Cohen-Watnick was actually one of Nunes's sources, the public reports tied him to the controversy. They also left the impression that, to defend the president against claims he had leveled unsubstantiated charges of wiretapping against his predecessor, Cohen-Watnick had been prepared to attack the actions of NSC officials and of other elements of the intelligence community. The reports about the Nunes episode suggested to career staffers, perhaps unfairly, that the NSC’s senior director for intelligence was less interested in presenting their views to the president than in imposing the president’s views on them.    

Since then, the conflicts within the NSC have settled down, at least publicly. But this is the Trump White House, a hotbed of resentments even when they're not spilling over into public view. Cohen-Watnick survived, but he's remained a topic of gossip and a target of leaks—a flashpoint in the ongoing fight over the administration’s foreign policy.

_The Washington Post_[reported in April](http://ift.tt/2tSzUSI) that days after McMaster’s effort to remove Cohen-Watnick, the CIA’s liaison to the White House was fired. The [_Guardian_’s story](http://ift.tt/2pWIsX0) on the firing cited sources describing it as an “act of retaliation” against the CIA for encouraging McMaster to sack Cohen-Watnick, a report unlikely to endear him to his colleagues.

But then, McMaster himself became the target of unflattering leaks. In May, Bloomberg reported that Trump had “screamed” at McMaster in a phone call and had become “disillusioned” with him, and that Flynn loyalists on the NSC perceived McMaster as trying to “trick” the president into supporting nation-building efforts. Also in May, _Foreign Policy_reported that “the knives are out” for McMaster over internal conflicts on Afghanistan policy, with him on one side and Bannon on the other. _Foreign Policy_noted that McMaster has become the target of online critics, most notably Mike Cernovich, the pro-Trump activist and blogger. Cernovich has also targeted other McMaster allies in the NSC such as Dina Powell.

Cernovich has cited White House sources repeatedly in his reports, though he has told me that he doesn’t know who his sources are and relies on burner phones to keep in touch with them.

One of the most recent McMaster-related leaks was to the AP last week; sources said McMaster had told foreign officials he disapproves of Trump’s closeness with Russia. The story made West Wing senior staff “furious,” according to a senior White House official, who added “if true, a man of honor would resign.”

The leaks have created an atmosphere of suspicion on the NSC, where morale has never been particularly high since the start of the administration. But they’re not always unflattering; some leaks have suggested a prominent policy role for the young staffer. Cohen-Watnick has developed a reputation as one of the primary proponents of an aggressive, Flynn-style stance towards Iran within the NSC. A recent story in _The New York Times_[said that](http://ift.tt/2rLTvHv) Cohen-Watnick was pushing for regime change in Iran from within the administration. And another recent story in _Foreign Policy_tagged him and Derek Harvey, the NSC’s top official on Middle East issues, as pushing for increased action against Iranian-backed forces in Syria.  

“I don’t think it was accurate at all,” said the former intelligence official on the NSC of the _Foreign Policy_ piece, calling it “fake news recycling other fake news.” This official argued that Cohen-Watnick, in his role as the liaison between the White House and intelligence agencies, has no purview over Iran policy: “I’ve never heard Ezra talk about; it’s not in his lane and he’s not involved in those regional policy discussions.”

Furthermore, this official said, those who think NSC officials are exerting broad influence over policy are misreading the current NSC by comparing it to the Obama-era one, where “they were micromanagers who had a long screwdriver and were fundamentally calling the shots even on tactical- level operations in places like Syria and Iraq.”  

“I’ve never seen the media [more] united about a topic than around Ezra and that’s a cause of curiosity amongst anyone with some sense of skepticism,” said the White House official who is close to Cohen-Watnick.

Cohen-Watnick’s allies see the leaks about him as evidence of a concerted campaign backed by his detractors in the intelligence community. They suggest that this is motivated by his conflict with the CIA. And they have a different theory as to why he has retained his job, and why he’s drawn attacks: It’s because, they insist, he’s good at what he does.

“He’s a genuinely funny, sardonic, very intelligent, interesting human. He’s not a robot or the way he’s been portrayed,” said one of the senior White House officials. “That human element has been I think completely lost in all of the coverage of him.”  

“He’s very engaging, very personable, he tries to connect with people,” said the former intelligence officer on the NSC. But he is “able to parse and probe in a way that makes some of his interlocutors very uncomfortable.” Plus, “the fact that he’s younger than many of these people creates a natural backlash.”

This official described a recent interagency meeting in which Cohen-Watnick was asking about the reasons for covert programs in a country that “on the surface seemed to make sense,” but Cohen “identified a waste of resources and ineffective application,” a duplication of efforts costing an extra $30 million.

Cohen-Watnick’s intense approach, this person said, “causes some people to respond negatively rather than saying a-ha, this is a good thing, now we can reprogram.” CIA representatives pushed back on Cohen-Watnick, and the atmosphere was “frustrated.”

Like most people in this kind of job, Cohen-Watnick is a workaholic, sometimes sleeping on his couch in case he has to respond to something or go somewhere in the middle of the night, the White House colleague who knows him well said. Asked what he does for fun, the colleague said Cohen-Watnick works out and reads military history and philosophy.

It’s an appealing account. The trouble is, like most everything else about Cohen-Watnick, it’s all but impossible to verify, or to reconcile with other versions. Perhaps it’s because he’s emerged so swiftly from the murky world of intelligence. Or maybe it’s because he sits on the fault line of a fractured administration. But now that he’s in the spotlight, he may find further scrutiny hard to avoid.

6p5vdj,8,2017-07-23,Turning 20 tomorrow and I have some thoughts I have gathered up until this point,ajkang97,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/6p5vdj/turning_20_tomorrow_and_i_have_some_thoughts_i/,"Tomorrow will be my birthday, and I thought it would be nice that I can share some of the thoughts that helped me with my life to others.  
  
**1) Enjoying my interests and hobbies for the sake of doing it:** This is a bit complicated to explain, so I'll give an anecdote that will accompany this thought. Towards the end of the first semester of my sophomore year, I was running out of steam and just wanted to leave my school. I became a dorm shut-in, and I think the reason for my inactivity was because I had this perfectionist attitude where my assignments had to be perfect, and because I was afraid of disappointing my professors, I started to stop turning in assignments and stop going to class. Luckily, I was able to spend some time off with my sister in San Francisco. There, I tried to apply for various software engineering internships, but my perfectionist attitude created the fear of rejection. However, what my sister said in response to this became what I try to keep true to myself everyday: ""Do your hobbies and interests because you enjoy them, not because you expect success out of them."" It was at that moment that I realized that I was pursuing interests expecting some end-reward, when I should have just been enjoying the journey and hardship. Now, whenever I start doing my work, I try my best to enjoy the ""now"" instead of worry about the ""later"".  
  
**2) Being okay with no friends/SO:** I don't know if this is necessarily a good thing, but I sort of come to peace with myself of having no friends. Several years ago, I was very conscious of myself and wanting to fit in with others, I tried to emulate their interests and actions; however, I think this may have contributed to destabilizing my identity. To make things worse, I failed at making friends, and whenever I tried to show my interests to others, I would just be ridiculed, which created a blow in my self-confidence. Recently, however, I sort of began to ignore the friend groups I wanted to fit in and started to just focus on my own interest, which is game development. And as I began to focus more on my own interest, the less I wanted to hang out with others/pursue a love interest with those who had dissimilar likings, knowing that the only relationship we will have is something superficial. And it's not that I necessarily gave up (well, part of me did lol), but it's more the fact that if I want to spend my time with others, it's with people who I can active talk about our interests with together. In a sense, this creates a solid identity for myself and allows me to know who my actual friends are.  
  
I think overall, I got my life figured out: I know what to do (go into game development), I know that I should enjoy myself doing my hobbies, and I know the people I want to hang out with. However, I still struggle with my perfectionist attitude. Sometimes, I go days without coding my game because I'm afraid it will turn out to be crap (even though I know the first games of any developer will be crap). Sometimes, I don't want to make any posts in the subreddits I like, or even here, in the fear that I might say something wrong. But I guess I just got to keep remembering that it's about enjoying the process rather than worrying what the result will be. "
6p5w45,25,2017-07-23,Christian turned non Christian,Moxida,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/6p5w45/christian_turned_non_christian/,"So I grew up an evangelical Christian. I spent 21 years of my life following the Bible and trying to ""spread the gospel."" My mother and I were a part of a cult when I was a kid that shaped me a lot in an unfortunate way. I was an intern at a mega church when I was 18 and then a missionary from 19-20. I saw a lot of hypocrisy the time I was in ministry, so I decided to change the course of where my life was going.

Long story short, I am not even a Christian anymore. I cringe at the thought of telling new people that I was a missionary. I still believe in God, but in a totally different capacity. I'm still trying to wrap my head around my new belief system, but have found little resources for Christians leaving Christianity.

I feel as thought I have been spiritually traumatized and abused as a child, and when I look at church today, all I see is the church making money and controlling their congregations by a threat of hell. I don't want to think this way anymore but it's hard when I've been behind the scenes and saw it first hand.

Is there anyone out there like me? It's hard to explain my background to people who haven't lived it. Let's talk if you are in the same boat."
6p5wje,1,2017-07-23,How do I get over the embarrassment of a speech problem?,violet_eyes30,depressed,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/6p5wje/how_do_i_get_over_the_embarrassment_of_a_speech/,"I’m going to try to make this as short as possible so I’ll have to skip over some details. I have been chronically ill since 2014.  Actually, I first started having health problems in 2001, and was bedridden off and on but was able to squeeze in some fun times between flare ups.  I traveled, went to college, moved a lot, had some great experiences etc.
So anyway, in 2014 I woke up one morning and I could not move. I was a junior in college at this time (I was almost 30) and was enjoying myself so I decided that I wanted to fight to go on since I was so close to graduating.  I also figured that I couldn’t get much worse and that I’d be able to fight.  I continued to get worse.  To make a long story short: I battled several autoimmune diseases (10 – 12 diseases possibly more) &amp; my jaws were dislocated (this happened when I was a teenager and I don’t know how), I also had a brain injury (which happened in recent years, I think from a car wreck). Ok so… I became bedridden but I still fought through it because I have no family support and I needed to get to doctor appointments. I also wanted to finish school.  I only had two hours of the day to where I was able to be up and functioning. I used those two hours to go to doctor appointments or to do schoolwork.  I had to finish my last semester of school online. I even had to leave my internship.
I was in the ER every week, I had several surgeries… the symptoms I had are absolutely horrific and too much to go into.  I ended up having to travel to Arizona for 5 weeks of aggressive medical treatment after being in non stop brutal pain for two years.
I lost my memory, I lost the ability to walk and talk. It’s entirely too much to go into.  I literally thought I was going to die at times. What I’m concerned about now is my speech.  I started having trouble speaking from ages 17 – 22 due to my dislocated jaws and autoimmune disease. It really affected me socially.  At the time, I didn’t understand that my diseases and jaws were causing me to speak funny.  I didn’t even know my jaws were dislocated until last year.  I knew that I had TMJ, and anyone that has TMJ knows that it’s hard to find a good TMJ specialist.  I finally found a good one last year.  Anyway when I started having trouble speaking at age 17, everyone assumed I had developed a speech impediment. It was embarrassing.  I got over the embarrassment though because when I was about 22, I started speaking better.  I sounded pretty normal from ages 22-31.
When I got sick in 2014, I struggled to speak here and there but nothing major.  Even in my bad health condition, I was still able to do class presentations. People always tell me that I’m a great speaker.  So anyway as my health declined, I lost the ability to speak.  I struggled to speak in 2015, and the problem got worse in 2016.  However, with all treatments combined, in September 2016 I completely regained the ability to speak normally. 
 
Here are the reasons why I lost the ability to speak when I got sick: I was in chronic non stop pain, had bone crushing chronic fatigue, my autoimmune diseases caused brain damage, my autoimmune diseases attacked my vocal chords, I had a brain injury, my jaws were dislocated, I had calcification in my throat, breathing problems, my airways were constricted, my autoimmune diseases affected the tissues in my jaw, I had a charley horse in each of my masseter muscles in my jaw, I had food allergies at the time that caused a speech delay, I had damage to my central nervous system, I had multiple chemical sensitivities that affected my brain… and the list goes on. With all of this going on, I’m surprised I was able to speak as well I did.
So obviously, I’m very embarrassed. My illness was traumatic, the treatment was traumatic…I couldn’t even begin to tell you everything that happened.  My body and brain shut down.
I’m embarrassed that people saw me that way, because not everyone understood.  People can be judgmental and cruel. A lot of people were very understanding though so I do appreciate that.
 
The main issue that I can’t come to terms with is my speech. I’m very embarrassed at how I lost my ability to talk. When it happened the first time at age 17-22 I always thought to myself how I was so glad that there were no cameras around. And that is now what I’m obsessing about.  During the year and a half that I lost the ability to talk this time, I used to make practice videos of me speaking on my iphone.  I’ve deleted all the videos. I also had snapchat because although I was very ill, I didn’t want to completely lose all contact with the outside world.  I was already isolated. So on snapchat I would sometimes do videos.  I never posted a video of me struggling to talk.  If I said a word wrong or I struggled, I would just do a retake until I got a good video I could post.
 
I’ve heard that the iphone and snapchat save all of our information (pics and videos). I am very embarrassed and scared that the videos of me speaking will leak.  I don’t want anyone to see me in that condition…I’ve been judged enough I feel.  And I fought the battle and I am now completely well and healed.  I’m able to walk and talk. I still have this overwhelming fear that the iphone or snapchat will leak my videos, and people will always view me as disabled or weird and that I’ll never be accepted socially.  Am I being rational? To make things worse, I lost my memory through much of the time when I was sick… so I always fear that I made an embarrassing video that I don’t remember.  I always fear being made fun of. How do I get over this? 
How do I get over the embarrassment of my illness giving me a speech impediment? How do I get over the fear of the iphone and snapchat keeping my videos and leaking them?  Am I being too hard on myself?"

6p6v4d,2,2017-07-24,Incredibly anxious about good developments?,sydofbee,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/6p6v4d/incredibly_anxious_about_good_developments/,"This is bonkers. It really is. I started an internship in March and I'm now writing my Master thesis at this company. It's going well. I've recently had some procrastination issues which sent my anxiety into overdrive (and results in more procrastination ugh).

But it was getting a little better. I was hoping the company would offer me a position after the internship because I know the team and workflow and I figured it'd be a pretty anxiety-free transition.

They offered me a job! But... the first three months until Christmas I'll have to work at another location to get a certification in something. They do this because otherwise it would only be a part time position which they wanted to avoid (probably due to me then likely choosing another job offer). 

So now... I have to go to that other location for three months come October. I've been there once before in March for two days and it was okay, everyone was nice. But I'll have to do lots of new stuff there, which is always trigger #1 for anxiety in my case.

I know this is a good thing, it's a great job with great pay and three months (really, 10 weeks with all the holidays) is nothing compared to what I stand to gain.

But it's gotten so bad I get stomach pains when I go to work HERE where everything is fine. I'm anxious about how it's so far away and I don't have a car. It'll be winter with lots of snow so a bike isn't feasible (it's how I get to work now). The company is in a small town with barely 1k inhabitants so public transportation is bound to be awful. Unless I happen to get a flat in the town itself (which thankfully the company is taking care of), it'll be problematic :(

And then there's the work there itself... I'm supposed to learn how a certain machine works. I'm not good with my hands. They want to place me in production, at least for a week or so. That... won't be good. Like at all. I went to university specifically so I wouldn't have to do much with my hands besides typing. 

I feel like I'm going to be sick, I'm sad all the time, yet I know this is a good thing. Getting a job the second you graduate is the dream. Why can't I feel like it? :("

6p9c3m,1,2017-07-24,He followed me to the women's restroom.... My Kroger's Stalker.,chichi016,u_chichi016,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_chichi016/comments/6p9c3m/he_followed_me_to_the_womens_restroom_my_krogers/,"Background: At the time of this incident, I was in my last semester of college. I was an intern at the communications department for my university and I was literally addicted to Starbucks! So in the small college town that I was in at the time had a Starbucks inside of the Kroger's grocery store. I was most certainly a regular who had a small selection of drink that I would always get depending on the season.

On the morning in question, I made my usual trip to Kroger's for Starbucks coffee before heading to my internship. This was an extremely hot day as for the southern humidity. So my clothing more than likely was firm fitting or short due to the heat and the fact that on campus a lot for my internship. I either had on short shorts or a maxi dress. Add this and my huge booty.... you see what I'm getting at right?

Anyway, I park my car and get out my car. I walked to the passenger side to make sure that door was locked. As I began to walk towards the store, I noticed out the counter of my eye a man checking me out. He literally stopped packing groceries his car in his to stare at me. Of course, not fazed by staring googly eyes and mouth opened wide I marched on, focused on being punctual which I never am. I go about my business. I checked my surrounding as I always do and noticed again this man, who was no longer packing but a few feet behind me. I thought I would humor myself and walk around to store to see if he wasn't following me. I walked up and down several aisles and what would have been something to laugh at myself about later began to fade, as the realization of this man intensively searching each aisle for me became more apparent. 

And this s*** freaked me the f*** out!

Granted after the first two aisles, I expected him to give up. Even on the third and fourth aisles, I thought he might quit. But he didn't. Without many options to find elsewhere and I had to think quickly on how to shake off this guy and get my caffeine fix for the day. ""Should I locate and employee/manager and explain the situation?"" ""Should I just leave now and settle for Dunkin' Donuts?"" ""Should I confront this man, and give him a piece of my mind?""

Holy s***, there he was, in the produce section, not looking for those pesky red potatoes that I can never seem to locate without my boyfriend. He was hellbent on seeing my face again for whatever reason. I decided to take the best option and find in my only refuge... The women's restroom next to the Starbucks.
Yes, in the Kroger's restrooms, next to the Starbucks was where I last saw the man before running around in the corner to definitely lock myself inside a stall... for 40 minutes. Keep in mind that I have completely ignored the fact that I'm basically an hour late to my internship and I haven't called my boyfriend or anyone else about my whereabouts or what's going on.

Eventually, I came out of the stall, cautiously scanned my surroundings in the produce section while I inched up to the counter of Starbucks. I ordered up my usual and left the store, still scanning everything that moved around me. I headed explained to my boss' coworkers what happened to me but I doubt they believed me. I never felt comfortable when men stared at me after that the day. It's one thing to just stare but to stare with lust/sexual desire is another thing. I refuse to be looked at like a piece of meat. It's degrading and so irritating. So fellas, keep in mind how a female may perceive your act of courage/manhood or what you think is a nice gesture. We may not want to be approached or catcalled. We might want to be left alone."
6p9g8m,1,2017-07-24,Need Advice on BTM and CompSci,9p5w1o,ryerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/ryerson/comments/6p9g8m/need_advice_on_btm_and_compsci/,"Alright so I'm a BTM student going into my fourth year. I was stupid enough to forget to apply for co-op after first year so I've really been struggling to get any experience in the summers, I mean I only had a single 4 month internship at a non-profit that had no relevant experience to my degree. So I've been taking courses during the summer, and I only have 3-4 courses left, including the two-semester course.

Over the past few months though I'e really been getting into programming, and I really think I'd prefer it or at least develop it into a real skill, one because I'd like to learn it, and because I think it'll help me get a decent job, I'm graduating virtually no experience going up against people with 3-4 extremely relevant work terms . My one complaint about BTM is that it's really not technical enough for my liking.  I'm just not exactly sure how to go about it. Here are the options I was thinking about: 

**Learn it myself** - reddit is full of stories about self-taught programmers, I don't really know if it'll help me much with the job hunt though, also I think I'd be missing quite a lot of important comp-sci knowledge that gets included in a formal education. Bonus is that I'm graduating soon and I could use the time to look for a job, my search has been bleak af for the last 3 years though. 

**Get a comp-sci degree** - If I do this I'd probably be doing it at Ryerson, and do it part time. My highschool average was around and 84%, but the problem is that I haven't taken Data, Calc, or a Grade 12 science. So I would have to take them during nightschool or academic bridging courses at Ryerson. This option would take some time, I'd have to complete those 2 courses, and then do 8 comp-sci courses through Chang school before I'm accepted to the program. 

**Get a comp-sci diploma/college degree** - [This](https://ict.senecacollege.ca/program/bsd/admissions-fees) program at Seneca is a Bachelors in Technology. I'm not sure if this is worth the time and the money, I think I'd rather be at Ryerson and do those extra courses. 


If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions at all I'd really appreciate it, even if you're not in computer science or BTM I'd like as many opinions as possible.

6p9ihz,45,2017-07-24,The Year of Yes [FM] [Fsub],Katie_Thimble,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/6p9ihz/the_year_of_yes_fm_fsub/,"**JANUARY**  

All eyes were on Katie as she danced in front of the band. Enthusiastic, that was the kind way to describe her dancing. She jumped up and down and her arms whirled in every direction as she span with the music. She wore a light blue dress with rose patterning, and a beaming smile. She was in her element, always happy to make a joke of herself at a party.   

It was New Year’s Eve and 2017 was quickly rushing towards them all. Katie’s office had decided to throw a party at a small bar just round the corner from the office. 2016 had been a mixed year for her. On the one hand she had been promoted: she was now Company Secretary. This had brought a certain amount of respect around the office since she was only 23. On the other hand her boyfriend of 5 years, her only boyfriend ever, had cheated on her twice and they had split up.   

Katie hadn’t been with anyone since they had broken up and she had become more and more convinced that she was wasting her youth. This was the time in a girl’s life where she should be walking home at 7am with her panties in her handbag, wasn’t it? She had never done that. She got plenty of advances sure, that would be no surprise of anyone who looked at her: she had a small, tight body with a gorgeous face, and she radiated youthful exuberance. But she had been nervous, thoughts of wanting to be a ‘good girl’ and worries that she would be labelled a slut had always been at the front of her mind.   

Well this was all to change with the resolution. It was very simple, for one whole year she was going to say ‘Yes’. Any advance, any request, any instruction. She had no clue how this was going to pan out for her but she was sure of one thing; it was going to be interesting. And when Katie made a resolution she stuck to it no matter what.   

Katie threw her hands upwards and synced their movement with the band’s tune. Jason wandered over, drink in hand, and she welcomed him to the dance floor by doing the robot in his general direction. Jason laughed and rolled his eyes but started dancing, imitating her robotic movements. They danced next to each other for a couple of songs, then the band struck up a slow melody and they came together. Jason put his hands on Katie’s hips and she reciprocated, putting her hands on his shoulders. She smiled up at him, enjoying the music. Jason dwarfed Katie even in heels, Jason stood at 6’2 compared to Katie’s meagre 5’3. He was very handsome and was a bit of a player. He had tried it on with Katie at the last office party and she’d awkwardly turned him down, he’d just shrugged it off and taken the receptionist, Jenni, home instead. As they danced his large hand slipped round her hips and he squeezed her ass. Katie playfully slapped his hand away. It wasn’t 2017 yet she thought.   

They danced until the countdown started. Everyone in the bar yelled ‘10’ over the noise of the band. This was it Katie thought, steeling herself for what was to come, only 10 more seconds until it started. Katie and Jason shouted the rest of the countdown looking into each other’s eyes. At midnight he kissed her and she kissed back passionately, her hand roaming up his back to his head, grasping his hair. They danced and kissed and danced some more as their colleagues wandered over and wished them a happy new year. Jason kissed her again and then pulled her towards the door at the back of the bar, pushing through into a large parking lot. The parking lot wasn’t busy as most of the patrons were drinking and would need cabs to get home anyway. He led her by the hand to his truck and pushed her up against it kissing her first on the lips and then on the neck as his hands squeezed her breasts.   

He lifted her dress and pulled her panties down, they slipped down around her ankles. He slipped two fingers into her pussy, she was soaking wet at the daring excitement of it all. Katie couldn’t believe what was happening, less than two hours into the resolution and she was already being fingered in public. She had never done anything like this before, she’d only ever been with one man and their sex had always been, well, ‘vanilla’ would be the polite way of putting it. Jason sped up going in and out of her and she gasped softly with pleasure. Abruptly he turned her around and pushed her down over the hood. He hiked up her dress exposing her tight perfect ass and dripping pussy. Katie wanted it so badly, it had been so long and she moaned in anticipation.   

“Wait, condom!” Katie had remembered at the last second.   

Jason grinned, removing a condom from his pocket before putting it on. Katie could hardly bare the delay and as soon as he had it on she was begging him to fuck her. He pushed deep inside her and she moaned again, this time in pleasure. He was much larger than her ex and he was charting unexplored territory within her. He worked up speed pounding her as she moaned louder and louder. She pushed back to meet each thrust trying to get him deeper within her.   

He grasped a handful of her hair, pulling it back and forcing her to look up. They had an audience. Across the parking lot there was a man watching them, he was leaned up against the bar smoking and holding a beer. As Katie met his eyes he raised his beer in salute, obviously enjoying the show. Katie was mortified and her cheeks burned with embarrassment, she looked back at Jason. There was no way that Jason hadn’t seen him she realised, he knew and he didn’t care. The realisation pushed her over the edge and she came hard, her knees buckling. Jason held her upright and continued pumping her until eventually with one final deep thrust he came. He panted on top of her as she lay bent over the hood.   

Katie pulled her panties up. She wasn’t really sure of the etiquette for a one night stand like this so she awkwardly thanked him and he laughed. Jason spanked her on the ass: “anytime honey”. 
With the hot lust dissipating she felt the sudden urge to prove she wasn’t a slut so she told him about the resolution.   

“Anytime?” he asked. “Anytime anyone asks you to do something you’re going to say ‘yes’?! Wow, in that case we might be seeing a bit more of each other”.   

Katie beamed her broad beautiful smile. Well why not she thought. She had never cum like that before, why not have a bit of fun with Jason. She walked away still smiling and hailed a cab. It had been a long night but the ‘Year of Yes’ was off to an exhilarating start.  

  

The first few weeks of the year were great for Katie. She hit the gym, toning her already fit body and she got fucked by Jason almost every day. It was much more carnal than romantic but Katie enjoyed it. Whispers of her escapades began to get around the office. Jason was obviously as loose with his lips as she was being. Katie could tell in small changes in the staff’s attitude towards her. The boss, an older man of wispy physique started to wink at her when he passed. She was sure that the middle-aged balding Management Accountant was making excuses to come and talk to her. And the young intern was acting very shy whenever he was in her presence.   

On the last day of January Katie walked to the office wearing a tight black dress and a lot more make up than she normally wore. She usually went with a more natural look but she had plans with some girlfriends and had to go straight from work with no time to get dolled up. Heads all turned towards her when she entered and she grew more confident with the attention.   

Katie was reading through some legal forms when someone blocked her light, looking round she saw it to be Jed and scowled. Katie hated Jed, he was a real jerk. He would put her down in front of other staff and undermine her in meetings. They were technically equals at the company but Jed always dumped his work onto her and Katie was always too polite to object.   

“What do you want now?” Said Katie irritably.   

“Come with me to the stationary closet will you, I need you to do something for me”   

“In the stationary closet? What on earth would you want me to do there?”  

“Just say yes” he said emphasizing the word yes and holding eye contact.   

Fuck! He knows, she thought. Jason hadn’t just been blabbing about their sleeping together, he’d told Jed about her resolution. That bastard. Her mind raced as she thought what to do. It was either go with him or break her resolution and she wasn’t a quitter.  

“Fine” She said at last, rising and making a beeline for the stationary closet. She could hear Jed following close behind her.   

The two entered and Jed closed the door behind them, it had no lock. As soon as Katie turned to face him he grabbed her hair and pushed her down onto her knees. This was more than I bargained for she thought.   

He took his dick out of his pants. It was average in length but had great girth.   

“Suck” he commanded.   

Katie took Jed’s cock in her mouth and began to work slowly forwards and backwards as he grunted in appreciation. Katie wasn’t sure why she was doing this, this guy was a jerk and she was on her knees pleasuring him, she felt dirty. And what if they were caught! She knew that public displays of affection were against office rules and was sure that sucking a cock in the stationary closet would certainly count.   

Jed placed both hands on the back of Katie’s head and began to thrust faster. She gagged a couple of times but he ignored her and kept going, pushing deeper down her throat. She felt a string of spit drip down her chin and onto her dress. She kept thinking he would cum but he just kept fucking her mouth and she kept sucking.  

Eventually he pulled out of her mouth and a build-up of saliva and pre-cum poured out of her in a strand down onto her dress, leaving obvious evidence where it fell. She pulled her dress down exposing her tits.   

“Come on my chest” she told him.   

Jed pumped his dick a couple of times and came, aiming his hot white streaks across her face. She had never seen a man cum so much. Four ropes of cum covered her face as she looked up at him.   

“What the fuck Jed, I told you to cum on my tits, you’ve ruined my make up, get me a towel” Katie’s makeup was indeed a mess, her lipstick was smeared and her eyeliner, that she had spent hours on, had run down her cheeks.   

“Sluts don’t get to clean up” retorted Jed and before Katie could think of a reply he put himself away, turned and walked out of the closet without looking back.   

Katie looked down and sighed at her ruined dress, a strand of cum was still slipping off her chin. She was at work, on her knees and covered in cum. Jed was right when he had called her a slut she thought. This year was going to be more complicated than she had expected.

6p9ksr,1,2017-07-24,26yo student in Utah. Trying to figure out how to go about getting insurance and could really use some advice,Yboc,HealthInsurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthInsurance/comments/6p9ksr/26yo_student_in_utah_trying_to_figure_out_how_to/,"So I'm a 26yo student who has been off my mom's health insurance since April. For a month I paid $100 for interim insurance before my summer internship which has health insurance. 

This internship ends on 8/18 and school starts the following week. My remaining 3-4 semesters will be pretty busy and will likely not be able to work full time and thus not be able to get insurance that way. I'm really unfamiliar with my options and how to proceed here, and hoping I could get some advice and some questions answered.

I don't take any medications and don't have any health problems. I have bad eyesight so eye insurance is a must as I need eye exams, contacts and/or glasses. In my mind I would like a minimal plan as I dont go to the doctor often and am pretty healthy. I mountainbike a lot and that's the only thing that ever worries me with injury.

The University of Utah offers insurance through United Healthcare. https://www.uhcsr.com/utah
It seems really expensive at $1700 a year. I just barely started looking into this, but is that what I can expect?

1.Where should I start?

2. Do I solely use the marketplace site? Should I visit local health insurance company sites individually?

I have some other questions but I have to submit this right now, I'll edit later. Thanks!

6pa3e2,9,2017-07-24,(Long) Is it my anxiety (F/22) or red flags impacting my relationship with (M/23),anxietyflagthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pa3e2/long_is_it_my_anxiety_f22_or_red_flags_impacting/,"Hi r/Relationships, 


I could use some outside input. I'll try not to make things too long but I tend to ramble.


Some background: I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and depression disorder when I was 17. I used to see someone for it and was on medication as well but I haven't seen a doctor regularly in ~three years and I haven't been on medication for about the same amount of time. (I stopped taking it when I went to college and found it difficult to find a psychiatrist in my town who could fill my prescriptions) 


I have been dating a, for all intents and purposes, wonderful man for the last two years. The way we met was a bit unorthodox. We initially met on Tinder, he came to my university with some friends for a concert, and we ended up spending the whole weekend together. It was infatuation at first sight. We started dating approximately a month later. 


The first year was great. I was head over heels for this dude. I had never felt this way before about a person and he said that it was the same with me. He went to school about two hours away from me. We saw each other two to three weekends out of every month. He was very affectionate but we made sure to maintain our own social lives outside each other. I met his friends and family, he met mine. It was pretty much pure bliss. I did have some of my own concerns then though. I have low self-esteem as a result of my disorders (I am assuming) and he had a history of being a serial dater. (His longest relationship prior to dating me was about 9 months) However, he made me feel like I was the best thing to happen to him. I can confidently say we were best friends. 


Problems started at about the year mark. Two of my best friends who I had been living with graduated and moved away. I moved houses with girls I wasn’t too close to. I have a hard time adjusting to change – a very hard time, so things just weren’t looking up for me. I was working a job that required me to be up very early and I wasn’t getting enough sleep because I was up late doing homework and studying. Around this time, I was starting to have what I best can describe as depersonalization episodes and anxiety attacks, especially when I would smoke weed. I would begin to question everything and feel anxious about everything, including my relationship with him. I began to convince (or was it my gut instinct) myself that he was manipulating me and using me. I began to obsessively research “signs that my boyfriend is a psychopath/sociopath/narcissism. I started questioning everything. Was that affection at the beginning of our relationship actually love bombing? He says that I am easy to read because I wear my emotions on my sleeve, is that because he’s actually a cold and calculating machine? 


Events from the first year of our relationship began to be seen in a different light. Early on in our relationship, he admitted to being arrested in high school for a petty crime (stealing) he committed with a friend when they were drunk. According to the internet, committing crime without thinking about the repercussions is the sign of psychopathy/sociopathy/narcissism. He also loves to do daring things and things that get the adrenaline pumping. Think exploring abandon buildings, things of that nature. It sometimes seems he has little impulse control. He likes to act before he thinks. And again, I started freaking out, thinking that this was also a sign of psychopathy/sociopathy/narcissism


Before long, this began to impact my relationship with him. I would constantly question his motives which he initially took in stride because he knows about my anxiety but after a while he started getting more and more annoyed with my questions. He began to tell me that I needed to seek out therapy, etc for my mental disorders. And I, in turn, took this as him dismissing my fears about his supposed “psychopathy/sociopathy/narcissism” because I was “on to him”. 


Things got worse when he got an internship in a different city for a semester, where he would be living on his own in an apartment. I began to stress out that he was cheating on me because after all, that what psychopaths/sociopaths/narcissists do. His temper got shorter with me, we began to fight more. (For the record, he’s never violent or abusive with me, he’s never insulted me or tried to make me feel inferior. He’s always encouraged me to have more confidence in myself) I was convincing myself that his temper was a sign of this red flag and that red flag. 


Our sex life also became a red flag. He is good at what he does and he knows it. And once again, the internet says that this can be a sign of psychopathy/sociopathy/narcissism. He’s extremely charming and seducing. 


He knows how to put spins on things – for example, he can make a mediocre job task sound absolutely amazing on a resume. Things like that. 


He also cares about impressing people and looking cool, which I know just might be an age factor and part of his surroundings currently. He is in a fraternity and he lives in the fraternity house (At his school they live in-house all four years) so I think part of fraternity culture might have a hand in this. But also, since psychopaths/sociopaths/narcissists are supposedly insecure, maybe this is also a sign of that? 


I know this is long enough but I hope it puts into perspective what I am struggling with. My dad is emotionally abusive and my biggest fear is ending up in a relationship with someone like that since I’ve never had an example of a healthy relationship in my life. In return, is this causing my anxiety to go into overdrive? Or are these valid red flags? I don’t want to ignore my gut instinct since sometimes it seems to be screaming at me but I don’t want to lose my best friend because my perceptions can be skewed. 


I have talked about this with friends and family, who all assure that it is most likely in my head. They say that he seems to really love me (but, again, is this him just putting on a show/being manipulative) and that at worst, he is just a young man who still has some maturing and growing up to do. 


So Relationships, what do you think? If anyone wants more information or clarification, feel free to say so in the comments. I tried to make it as comprehensive as possible while not making it a novel length. 


For some extra clarification, for anyone who is familiar with the Myers-Briggs personalities, he is ENTJ, I am INFP so I wonder if part of my problem is not understanding that he just functions pretty much entirely differently than me, that just because he is more logical and not outwardly emotional doesn’t mean he’s actually “dangerous.” I know he has emotions, or so I like to think. Certain events tell me that he feels empathy, remorse, compassion, love etc…but I also am half-convinced it’s an act because, once again, that’s what psychopaths/sociopaths do. 


I also know I use psychopath/sociopath/narcissistic throughout this post and I know they are all different disorders but I have been obsessively reading about all three of them.  


TL;DR: Is it my anxiety or some serious red flags with my boyfriend

6pa8co,113,2017-07-24,I fantasize about cutting all ties and starting over,mewithamask,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6pa8co/i_fantasize_about_cutting_all_ties_and_starting/,"Hi, everyone! I feel like there's no place I can write this other than on Reddit, but just wondering if anyone else ever gets like this. I have been struggling with depression of varied severity since I was 8 (I am 23 now) and sometimes find myself in this state of mind where I literally fantasize about cutting all ties with people and starting my life over again. Obviously, I would engage enough with my immediately family so they know I'm still alive, but I just feel like slowly fading out of touch with everyone ... On one hand, I feel this way because a lot of people just downright disappoint me, and then, on the other hand, I feel like I lean too much on the people who don't disappoint me and am always in a state of embarrassment about it. It makes me just want to disappear so that I can make a habit of no longer going to them for help.

I meet a lot of friends who are disappointing because, despite me having not that high of expectations, they just lack basic consideration. I'm from the states but am living abroad, and one ""good"" friend of mine from the US came and left this country recently. A week up to him leaving, we made plans to hang out (which he cancelled) twice — once because he ""just felt like sleeping"" and the other because he got caught up in his internship. The day before he left, I asked, ""Am I going to see you before you go?"" And he said, ""Idk, maybe, maybe not, not really sure"" — mind you, I literally don't know when I'll ever see him again. I was just disappointed and annoyed at myself for thinking he was a decent person. 

On the other hand, I have a few solid friends of 6+ years who support me by listening, though they can't relate and don't say much that's substantive. But I feel like I go to them with my issues too often, and I fear exhausting them. They were with me in middle school and high school when I suffered abuse at home, through college as I suffered depression, and so on. The thing is, they were supportive without me ever really revealing how bad anything was. And lately I have been struggling with all aspects of my romantic life, along with some other basic functioning — like going to see certain types of doctors — because of some abuse that's happened in my past. I feel like the only way I can get past it is to be open, to get rid of my shame and stop lying about it like it never happened. But I also feel like I can't tell my close friends about these events, because they only know the watered-down, sanitized version of my life ... I fear shocking them. But I also don't want to continue to live this ""everything is fine"" lie because that feels worse. Sometimes, that's why I just want to cut the world off and start over. 

I also have this insecurity that no one will really contact me or stay in touch with me if I don't initiate. Part of me wants to cut them off because I feel annoying, like I'm the one who always gets in touch, and I fear that perhaps these relationships are weirdly one-sided after all...

Does any of this make sense?

Yes, saw a therapist for five months in the States before moving here, never revealed the truth, really. Also now waiting to get a certain visa before I get the government health insurance in my new country, so then perhaps I can seek some help.

Does anyone relate? That's really all I'm wondering. "
6paaqs,25,2017-07-24,My adventures with a future JNMIL,pronounverbnoun,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6paaqs/my_adventures_with_a_future_jnmil/,"Now, my boyfriend (I'll follow the rules of this sub and call him DH) and I are not married yet and not at that point (been dating for a little over two years), but I already know that if and when we reach that point, my MIL will be rough. She's a short, Catholic, Hispanic woman. I feel like that's enough said. DH gave me warnings about his mom within the first few months of us dating. My short stories are not as bad as others on here, but I feel like I finally found my community!

When DH and I first started dating, she hated me right off the bat. I'm a white girl, and DH ""needs"" to date a Hispanic girl. If DH would call his mom (we were away at school), his mom would speak Spanish and then list off Hispanic single girls that she knew for him.

Now, DH and I are long-distance. I graduated school and will be heading to grad school (starting next week!) but he has to complete an internship (starting next week as well) and then will be able to graduate. Due to this, he is still living at home until he gets a job after this internship, and the few times I visit him I end up staying at his house. I love his dad and his sister, and I can tell they are getting tired of her shit.

I'm super lucky because DH HATES his mother. She always has to be the center of attention and is a huge hypocrite. DH is diabetic (type 1) and I have seen her yell at him for ""wasting the family's money"" though they have pretty good insurance and his dad makes six figures (he's in the military.) They always get into fights, basically yelling matches even when I'm there. He had to wait to hear back about this internship, and his mom started screaming at him because he was too stupid to figure out the internship paperwork...though it was all done, he was just waiting to hear back. She's a real joy to be around.

I visited his house over Thanksgiving. Now, her being Catholic, she has strict rules, one of them being we cannot sleep in the same bed. I am a rule follower. I hate breaking rules, even moreso when I am a guest in someone else's home. We were trying to figure out a sleeping situation due to them having a full house of visitors. DH suggested I sleep in the basement on the couch, and his dad said no because it was too small. DH, being the guy he is, said that we both slept on that couch and there was enough room. Cue daggers from his mom. His dad said we shouldn't have slept together (but also had a careless look on his face), DH tried to backtrack, it was too late. MIL ignored me for the rest of the day.

For the entirety of my stay, it was super awkward. Not because of that, but because MIL and FIL were fighting. FIL, like I said, was in the military, one of the higher positions, and just announced his retirement that week. MIL was salty that she wasn't getting the same amount of money and kept openly asking how they were ""going to make ends meet"" though he already had several job offers making even MORE. His dad slept on the couch all week, even after all the guests left. Yeah.

Fast forward to this summer. I was invited over for his retirement ceremony (his dad even called me family!) During the ceremony, there was a lot of eyerolling from SIL and DH because MIL was SUCKING UP the ""Oh my gosh you are such a strong military wife!!!!"" even though, according to both of them, she didn't do much for the family. She just wanted the sympathy.

I stayed a week after the ceremony, because long distance. Due to the ceremony, they had a full house again with guests, and I ended up sleeping in the basement. DH snuck downstairs every night and we slept together. It was really nice to be next to him again. It was easy to get away with it too, because we could just play it off that we were both hanging downstairs if anyone asked. One morning, MIL thought that we slept together, and she ignored me the whole day until FIL yanked her to the side, whispered something in her ear, and then she started inviting me with her and the rest of the family members.

It came to a head my last day there. At that point, all guests have gone, so I was staying in the actual guest bedroom, on the second floor with everyone else's bedroom. DH insisted on spending the night together, which I was wary about because I didn't want to be caught breaking her rules. I told DH that he should at least shut his door to his bedroom to make it seem that we did not share the same bed. He said ""Fuck MIL, I don't care what she thinks."" Okay, I actually want to go back home alive and not in a body bag, but I know he will stand up for me. Plus, we had to wake up early the next morning and thought we would be the first ones up...

We weren't. Everyone else in the family was running around upstairs, since SIL had to go to orientation for her university. I sat there, terrified, DH didn't care, he said they were leaving shortly. Then, his dad started calling his name. Oh fuck.

DH left and came back in a few minutes later. His dad needed to give him information for the day, and also told him that though he does not a give a flying fuck if we spent the night together, but his mom does and she didn't appreciate it or something like that.

Everyone knew we were in the same bed, so it was awkward going downstairs. But I was able to thank everyone for their hospitality and FIL and SIL were super nice and hugged me and everything. MIL though, COMPLETELY ignored me. Did not say a single word and had a scowl on her face. She wouldn't even look at me, complete cold shoulder. I even stood next to her at one point, and she turned farther away. It was actually hilarious.

But yeah, that's all the stories I have for now. I will definitely update as more stories happen. "

6papwr,14,2017-07-24,Prayer Request: Guidance on an monastic internship opportunity.,AgentSmithRadio,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/6papwr/prayer_request_guidance_on_an_monastic_internship/,"To those not in the know, [I've been toying with the idea of going to seminary for the last few months.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/60kdc9/what_should_i_know_about_seminary/) I have a love for theology and reading scripture but I've been unable to take the leap of faith to do so. I am dependent on my career to survive and it would be a long trek to get me on the path to ministry or academic study. I recently got promoted at work to a more stable position but the increased hours make me question if I can devote myself fully to work and to my education, should I choose to enter that world.

My pastor, knowing about this, passed along an interesting opportunity earlier today. A local monastic order is offering a 10-month internship opportunity. It involves book studies, regular dinner meetings, various side-projects, reflective writing, prayer meetings, retreats, meetings with a spiritual advisor and an independent project to be worked on throughout the internship. It's part-time and it would fit the hours of my current career. It doesn't cost very much and it's only a short drive to the various ministries involved.

This would be a major help if I ever decide to go to seminary and it would help me get better connected with the active faith community in my area. I appreciate the work which the order does and I know that they have solid support from my church. My pastor has offered church support, references, funding, prayer and various books required as part of the internship. We have a theological library which I am allowed to borrow from.

To put it lightly, I'm highly interested in this offer. I know of various people involved due to my involvement with the local seminary and my church and this sounds like the sort of thing I need in my spiritual life. However, I'm scared of the time commitment and my ability to follow through on this. As foolish as it may sound, I think that I need a bit of a push.

I have about a month to decide but I'd like to get my heart settled on this matter before the deadline approaches. I'd appreciate it if you could please pray for me in this time, that God may guide me to say yes if this is what he wants me to do. This is a moment of fear for me and I hope that I can be lead to the correct outcome despite how stubborn I can be.

Thank you."

Taking place in the first season of the Flash, using flashbacks, before the particle accelerator blew up- Kyle Rayner is a very curious and charming budding young scientist, who has gotten close enough to the Green Lanterns on several occasions that he actually picked up intel on how the rings worked.  With this intel he set out to build his own ring.  But this ring will be the complete opposite of the ones wielded by the Green Lanterns.  For this ring he will attempt to harvest glueballs from the particle accelerator at S.T.A.R. Labs and energize/power up the ring with energies and particles that are the complete opposite of the particles/energies used in the power battery to charged the rings worn by the Green Lanterns. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glueball

In particle physics, a glueball (also gluonium, gluon-ball) is a hypothetical composite particle.

Glueballs are extremely difficult to identify in particle accelerators, because they mix with ordinary meson states.[2]

Theoretical calculations show that glueballs should exist at energy ranges accessible with current collider technology. 

Constituent particles and color charge

Theoretical studies of glueballs have focused on glueballs consisting of either two gluons or three gluons, by analogy to mesons and baryons that have two and three quarks respectively. As in the case of mesons and baryons, glueballs would be QCD color charge neutral.

Color charge is a property of quarks and gluons that is related to the particles' strong interactions in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).



Particles have corresponding antiparticles. A particle with red, green, or blue charge has a corresponding antiparticle in which the color charge must be the anticolor of red, green, and blue, respectively, for the color charge to be conserved in particle-antiparticle creation and annihilation. Particle physicists call these antired, antigreen, and antiblue. All three colors mixed together, or any one of these colors and its complement (or negative), is ""colorless"" or ""white"" and has a net color charge of zero.

Using his charm and wit Kyle managed to get an internship within S.T.A.R. labs.  However knowing that he only had a small window of opportunity to work with he prepared a harvestor machine, the size of a grain of rice, far in advanced and waited for the right time to get into the particle accelerator.  But as the moment came and as he approached the particle accelerator with the small harvestor machine, the size of a grain or rice embedded in his finger, he sees a guardian of the Universe hovering above within the seconds of him harvesting the glueball energies of the particle accelerator with one swipe of his finger.  Also at the corner of his eye he sees Harrison Wells, Barry  and Cisco.  they had come back early from their outing.  Harrison was enraged.  He knew he had to reveal himself and kill Kyle.  Between the seconds Harrison plunged toward Kyle and gorged him using his vibrating hand but suddenly there was a very bright blinding light and Kyle and the Guardian of the Universe was gone while Harrison wells, Barry and Cisco lay unconscious briefly on the floor.  when they woke they will have no memory at all that Kyle Rayner ever existed.  Indeed they will come back from their outing as if time had rewind and a new reality had set in.  flash Forward to the current season/ season four when the Flash/Barry escapes Speed Force prison he suddenly remembers Kyle Rayner and everything that had happened that night.  He is obsessed with finding Kyle.  As he back tracks the events and digs up everything he can about Kyle Barry theorized that Kyle must now be the White Lantern- a member of the Green Lantern Corps."
6pbqqp,51,2017-07-24,Interviewing Tips,JL2585,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/6pbqqp/interviewing_tips/,"I graduated from law school in 2010, did on-campus interviewing and numerous callbacks for BigLaw, worked as a BigLaw associate, and now am on my second in-house job. Here are some suggestions for interviewing as a law student that I hope some of you may find helpful in the fall. Happy to answer related questions.

Be on time. Don’t miss an interview or reschedule it (unless it’s a true emergency). Don’t be late to the interview. Don’t be more than 10 minutes early either. If you are early, just walk around outside or at a coffee shop (don’t check in with the receptionist too early).

Dress reasonably. If you don’t know how to to tie a tie, ask someone to do it for you. Don’t wear someone else’s suit that doesn’t fit. It doesn’t have to be expensive, but you can’t look awkward.

Practice interviewing with friends or counselors or whatever. It will help you get over the nerves and give you a sense of the flow of a law firm interview.

Go where the interviewer takes you. If they want to talk about the law, then do that. If they don’t want to talk about the law, then don’t try to force it.

Have a question, but not too many, if they ask if you have any questions. If you don’t have anything, then you’ll seem uninterested. Don’t ask a dumb question that is easily answerable with Google. Also, you may have to carry the interview with leading questions if you walk in, and they just say, do you have any questions?

Be prepared to talk about every single thing on your resume. If you list a hobby, be prepared for your interviewer to be an expert at it. If you list a language, be prepared to speak in it. If you say you have experience in some area of law, be prepared to talk about it. Do some refreshing research if you have to.

No typos in your resume, in your email correspondence, or anything that suggests you will be sloppy. You’re only going to have a very limited number of interactions until you are hired, don’t blow it.

Don’t abuse the financial reimbursement from law firms for your callbacks, lunch, etc. At lunch, ask your interviewers for a recommendation of what to order so you can see the price range they go for (don’t get the surf and turf when they get sandwiches). Don’t order a drink if they don’t. Don’t drink alcohol at all, even if they do (unless you have a specific reason to think it is OK -- them telling you it is OK at the restaurant is not enough).

Remember names and what you discussed, in case it comes up again. You’ll be interviewing with maybe 50 lawyers. Write yourself a note after each interview or something so you don’t get mixed up. If you can’t keep enough facts straight during the recruiting process, they won’t trust you to be able to do so for your work.

Don’t say something that’s not true about the firm. For example, don’t talk about a practice area they don’t have in the office you want to go to. Don’t talk about an office that they don’t have. But it is a strong positive if you can point to something that the firm itself has heavily promoted/marketed as something that attracted you to that firm.

Don’t talk too much about how much you want to do pro bono work. You don’t want to indicate that you actually want to be a social activist when you’re interviewing for a corporate law firm.

Be responsive. Check your emails and do things that are asked of you. Submit your reimbursements timely. Just be organized.

Don’t say anything too negative about anything. If you’re asked if you like some kind of food, don’t say it’s disgusting; it might be their favorite. If they ask if you like Boston, don’t say you hate the cold because they might be from there and love it. It shows bad judgment to have strong negative feelings you express to strangers.

Don’t say anything potentially offensive or espouse strong political or social views. You don’t know if your interviewer is a Trump supporter or a a Trump hater. Don’t gamble on this. Show good judgment that you can be milquetoast for a 20 minute interview.

Don’t lie about anything. If you said you used to do X at your old job, assume that your old boss is the brother-in-law of your interviewer and that it can be verified. If you said that you wrote a paper, and it turns out you were just a research assistant, that will be a deal killer. 

Have a series of 3-5 prepared stories about 2 minutes in length (longer is boring) that can be used to respond to a variety of questions (biggest weakness/strength, example of leadership/teamwork, most interesting intellectual issue, why did you go to law school, why this firm). Sitting there in silence while you think is really uncomfortable, and doesn’t give the impression you are very articulate. Practice these stories so you get them tight enough to be an elevator pitch vs. wandering. But also don’t seem robotic in trying to make sure you get all of them out in each interview.

Don’t ask too many questions about work/life balance, billable hours or compensation. For larger firms, you can find those answers elsewhere, and for smaller firms you can ask after you get an offer or during the course of your internship with more junior associates or people you develop a rapport with, but you don’t want to signal in early interviews that you might be averse to hard work.

Don’t have a limp handshake or a bone crushing handshake. Be normal. Shake hands with people and ask for feedback if necessary.

Schedule interviews strategically - if possible, you don't want your first interview to be for your dream firm nor do you want to be tired with interview fatigue by the time you interview at your dream firm.

[Not uncontroversial] I don’t write thank you notes/emails at all. I don’t think anyone likes them, and they’re an opportunity for you to screw up with no upside.  Interviewers will tend to have finished their evaluation of you long before you get around to writing a thank you note."

Has anyone on here taking both? if so, what are the differences? I was going to sign up for the CASP CompTIA boot camp but doing more research on CISSP classes I found out that there's online training the same week of the class I was planning on signing up for. I know eventually, I will need to take the CISSP to advance in my career so I was thinking might of well just skip the CASP and do the CISSP but I was hearing that the CISSP is more managerial than technical. Is that true? I also read that some DOD offices are sending their CISSP holders to take the CASP? 

Also, did anyone take the online bootcamp training? if so, how was it? 

Background on me: I currently have about 2 years of experience working in a SOC. I have experience in IR and VM. Prior to that, I did some sys admin work(7 months) and 1-year technical internship. I finished my bachelors in cyber security and currently doing my masters in cyber and have my sec+. Would this experience be enough to qualify for the cissp? 

thanks, guys!"

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

I'm currently doing an internship and we use the base 2015 15'' MBP and I gotta say I love using this laptop. When this internship ends however, I won't have access to this laptop so I'll need my own. With the education sale being up I feel this is a good time to ask.


I study Computer Science and will be programming with it, social media, video, browsing, etc. I know I'd like it to be a 15 inch monitor as the additional screen size is great for seeing more code. I was wondering if the 2015 model is better than the 2017. In the one hand the 2015 has Magsafe, all the ports I need and is 800 dollars cheaper. The 2017 laptop has better specs, thinner, brighter, etc. Which would you say is better for my needs?


I had considered the 13 inch base but configured with better specs. I wish apple offered a 15 inch version of this, if I could avoid the touchbar that would be alright."
6pd0i4,1,2017-07-24,(22M) having relationship issues with my parents. I feel as though it's a very toxic relationship. Long post.,UngratefulBastardSon,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6pd0i4/22m_having_relationship_issues_with_my_parents_i/,"Throwaway account for reasons I guess. Never know who's a redditor these days.

I've never had a close relationship with my parents in my life. I've never had heart to heart talks. Never had talks about the future. I grew up in a tough love environment. My parents cut off most of my family cause they are really toxic people or because they didn't like them.

Most of the relationship strain started 5 years ago after I decided I didn't want to go to college and after my step sister left the family. My parents told me that they where only going to offer to help me figure things out for college once. I wasn't interested in furthering my education because I had no idea what I wanted to do and I didn't want to waste anyone's money, so I joined the work force. 

I worked retail since I was 16 decided to quit when I turned 19. I took 2 months to find another job. (which my parents where constantly on my case about, I was constantly screamed at and berated.) I found a dishwasher position in a hospital with really good benefits but it was a miserable experience. I worked there for two years then I got a a nice position as a real estate intern. Realized I'm not a salesman and I actually got fired. 

During those times my parents went through a whole divorce scare because my mother wanted another kid. Now they decided to adopt and foster. We have a 1 month old now in the house. I had to write a letter of recommendation for that and I knew in my heart I should not of supported them at all. I went through a lot of emotional and physical abuse growing up. My step sister is  estranged from the family and I can actually see why she made the choice to just leave.

That was about 3 months ago. In these past few months I just feel like a shadow in my ""own"" home. I resent seeing my parents or spending time with them at all. It's not because of the new baby either I really enjoy her and she's very very good. The only time I'm talked to is if it has to do with what I'm making for dinner, why the house hasn't been swept (I have 5 dogs and my back yard is a sand pit cause of them.), or anything to that matter. I try my hardest to do all those things I know if I don't I'm going to be in serious trouble. It's also hard to keep up with since I decided to volunteer at a summer camp for foster kids, and I finally have some friends that I enjoy spending time with, and I actually have some free time and a little bit of saved money to myself for once.

My new found friends are the best people I've ever met in my entire life. I seriously think they are one of the best things that has happened to me. I stopped spending all my free time on the computer and instead with these new people. They're family is supportive and nice. It's the type of folk you just want to be around cause they are so great. After spending time with this other family. I don't feel as suicidal as I once was and I'm really starting to get out of a deep depression I didn't even know about. It feels nice to get out of my home and be away from my parents. I got talking to their father and he's a professor at the local college. And I actually figured out what I want to go to college for now and I've been trying to figure things out with that.

I approached my parents about college after all these years and they said to my face that they didn't care if I figured out what I wanted to do. I tried telling them about scholarships I might be able to get and if I could get some help. And they just didn't care. I really have never been this hurt in my life. I noticed something was different about two months ago when I started hanging out with my new friends and when the summer camp started but I just shrugged it off.

Today my mother came into my room and called me a worthless piece of shit. That I'm ungrateful and unappreciative. I'm just really happy I haven't been kicked out and I still have a place to live.

I just don't know what to do, I'm not the type of guy to talk emotions with friends and to burden others with my problems but I'm in a really bad place in my mind right now and I didn't need everything that just happened. 

I have no way to move out and no family to talk to either. I'm just really sad that this all happened, when I feel like I now know what I want to do with my life. I just feel very discouraged but I think It'll be another thing that I get just have to get over."

A little about me: I was held in pre-school for two years because the teachers thought I hadn't socially developed enough for kindergarten yet. I was born with a speech impediment that was corrected by the time I was in 4th or 5th grade through speech therapy. I was bullied in middle and high school for reasons I couldn't rationalize. I went through a brief therapy for this because of depression it caused me. I joined a year-long speech class in high school to get more comfortable talking in front of many people and I can now say I've learned a lot and developed my self-confidence. I am now in college studying engineering and work at an engineering company as an intern at the same time.

I also met my first and only girlfriend in high school. We've been together for 5 years now--engaged for 2 of them. When she asks me who I want as groomsmen for the wedding I tell her nobody because ever since high school ended I've been so focused on pushing people away from me. The only friend I admit to ever have is my fiancee. I have acquaintances from work, most of them 50+ that are really nice and I like to be around. I can't understand people my own age and whenever I am invited out to lunch with the other interns I make up an excuse so I don't have to go. I'm happier eating alone.

The main thing that bugs me, though, is the fact my fiancee and her family can't understand why I don't have any friends to make groomsmen/best man. They are irritated that I might imbalance the ceremony. I ended up settling on making my sister my best man (you read that right) and my father and grandfather groomsmen.

Does anyone else out there have any similar experiences? I just want to relate to someone and know I'm not alone."

I am new to Reddit (and CMU!). I am currently a master student in the Master of Computational Data Science program at SCS. However, I know I don't want to stay in a developer/engineer role for a long period of time after graduation. I enjoy coding as much as doing the business aspects. I majored in information system management in my undergrad and took both business and tech internships/classes. I am deeply interested in data modeling and that's why I applied and decided to go for my current master program at SCS. (My undergrad program was too business-focused and I feel like I should take another year to strengthen my technical skills in data science before going into the industry)

In the long run, I plan to go into consulting/advisory/quant finance etc. and I am interested in positions where I can work with both data analytics and clients. I do enjoy coding but I just feel like a role in consulting/advisory better fits my interests and skill sets. (As I enjoy doing things at a strategic and higher level more than implementing a software or worrying too much about the details) 

I am thinking about the internship next summer and my first full-time job at this moment. Should I go for consulting/advisory firm immediately after graduation, or should I get a job in software engineering for a couple of years before going into consulting? What are options for SCS students who do not want to get a job in software engineering?

And, could anyone offer some advice about courses to take as well? I plan to focus more on machine learning/analytics etc. than computer systems. Is it worthwhile to take some classes from stat/math department to get more well rounded?

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you! "

I need any advice I can get and before you start reading I appreciate any advice you give. Thank you so much!


So I met this girl in January and have been talking to her more and more every day until we kissed around late April and moved into a hookup/pre-relationship phase. Now, this is around the times of our school's finals, and in about 2.5 weeks me and her were going to be 6 hours apart due to summer break (that was Junior year so we both were coming back after)  So I've always had the intention of dating her, but I didn't necessarily make it that known that was the case, although my behavior was very ""boyfriend-y"" and I told my friends, who told her, my intention was for us to become more serious. When summer break started, her and I would talk everyday for long periods of time, but she was frustrated that I hadn't asked for anything serious yet. The reason I didn't do this yet is because I was starting a very demanding internship (banking, 70+ hrs/week) and I wanted us to have a stronger foundation and build something organic and genuine- don't get me wrong, I was acting like a boyfriend without just asking her if she wanted to be a couple. She visited for a weekend and I took her to disneyland to see fireworks, I took her to nice restaurants, and it felt very date-y. In my mind I wanted to make sure the time we spent was fantastic before I REALLY made things official, even though to be honest, things felt official a long time ago with her, so I found comfort in that.


So in her eyes she thinks that because I took so long, she started to open up more to other people. She met a coworker who likes her tremendously and they become good friends. Now, she tells me about this and I realize that I can't sit around anymore-so I asked her to be my girlfriend. Things were great, we got even closer than before, which I didn't think was possible. I visited her once, and she visited me once. We spoke a lot, every day, and I thought things were great.

But her co-worker is a fucking problem. I knew he was a fucking problem when one time she told me he asked her to ride a moped with him to work one day (I told her she was wrong for even thinking that was acceptable) but I just thought she liked the attention and was being dumb. But, they hung out a lot because he was a co-worker and her and I were long distance. They hung out in group settings, but other people would think they should date each other due to their chemistry and she never made my presence known. Then one day her and I got in a huge fight and I told her to tell him about me, to which she agreed. Hooray, right? Fuck no. I remember that day so fucking vividly she really likes to make sure no one's feelings are hurt so as a result she took him to a view and told him about me-how she was taken and we are long distance and blah blah blah. Point is, that day they hung out from like 4pm to about 1AM. They ate, saw a movie, chilled on a view. And I was pissed. She said she did it to make sure his feelings were not hurt, but I felt like it was some kind of date. Whatever, she told him about me. I guess that is all that matters.

So time passes, and we start to fight every day. And the fights are always about her and her coworker. How other people would view them as people that should be dating and I would get so fuckin pissed at that and I would tell her and she kept not making my presence known. So, after more fights, she agreed to tell him that they should only hang out in group settings. In a way, I didn't like this because it was like admitting he was a serious issue to our relationship, but I was happy because I knew she cared about making us work. Hooray, right? So, after she told him they should only hang out in groups, she visits me where I live. We have a great time and to save money she stayed at my place-nice dinners, I buy her flowers, introduce her to my friends, she gives my mom chocolates. Things felt wonderful. But then a few days after she hangs out alone with the guy-breaking her promise.


Man I fucking lost it. I called her and told her she was unfaithful, disloyal, and a horrible girlfriend. I told her I felt emotionally cheated and how tired I was of putting up with someone else. After like 4 hour fights that occurred two, three days in a row I decided that we needed to break up. I remember after saying that we were broken up, she told me she was going to tell me ""I love you"" on my birthday in her intended gift-a nice photobook of us. That made me realize that maybe she did really like me a lot-I started hinting that I was going to tell her I loved her so when I found that out I almost broke down. But I kept my head cool-if she loved me she wouldn't do this.


So we are ""broken up"": the night we break up, we talk on the phone and we both cry-I cry and apologize that I'm so far away and say how much I miss her and she cries because she is sad that we ended. Deep down I felt like this ""break-up"" was never real. I've never had a relationship and I was under the impression that when two people break-up, they still are dating/really close for a period of time after that. So, the next day we end up FaceTiming the whole fucking day. The whole day. Classic stuff-it felt like the old us. Nice, no fighting, just the two of us appreciating each other. I thought she got back into her senses and decided to ""choose me"". It felt like a  classic storybook.

The day after that, she decides to tell me she needs to be completely honest with me. She tells me that she has ""feelings"" for her coworker. She also says that if she had a switch, she would choose me instantly, but the distance makes things hard and she needs attention. I was devastated when she told me that-I really loved this girl and for her to tell me this felt so awful. I kept telling her she was a bad  girlfriend and she was unloyal because I got so mad and I felt so helpless-here I am, giving my all to her even though she isn't doing the same.


If it means anything, I know she likes me ""more"" and I also know her mom and friends ""support"" me and like me a lot, even though I've yet  to meet them. 


So I just texted her saying she needs to make a choice, I said I don't want to talk to her until she makes her choice and we can only get together if she cuts him off 100%. I told her that I deserve someone that likes me unconditionally and her character makes me question if she is the right person to start a serious relationship with. 

My question is, is what I did right and how should I move forward? Am I warranted in feeling the way I feel and is there any other advice I should take to heart or mistakes to avoid as her and I sort through this situation?

I don't know where to go or how to reach out for help. The best and most comforting advice has been from the people on this sub. I have trouble making bonds and even communicating with people. I can barely string to together  anything that makes sense in writing or through speaking. Its exhausting trying to initiate a conversation because I feel like I am bothering everyone or just being a nuisance.

The only thing that keeps me going to school or going to work is the desire to just not be a burden on my mom. So many days I was just want to lay on my bed and sleep so I can wait to die.

I am not really good or valuable at anything and can't be of use to anyone. The only thing that has ever provided me any sense of consistent joy is just watching anime and movies and manga and just browsing the internet. Sometimes I like it when I complete a software project or can help someone put with a favor but those moments are so few and far between that it's not worth holding on for.

The only thing I guess I could feel good about was that some people would say I was smart. To be honest, I feel more like a pseudointellectual and a fraud. I know some things but can't really apply them. I'm not really smart or nice or a person worth caring about. I failed in everything I have tried.

I dropped out of school twice even when I had a year into my Bachelors. Quit 4 jobs with the longest being barely 1 year. I can't keep any close friends or even talk to a girl. I am a true loser. 

Even right now I managed to get a software-dev internship and I am just floundering every day and am wondering when I will be fired already. I am struggling to complete simple tasks like setting up environments and write documentation. I wonder how even got hired and feel like an idiot every time I am there.

It feels like my life is over and not really worth living really. The only thing that sort of kept me going was finishing school and becoming a software developer even though I knew deep down it was a pipe dream.

TLDR;
I'm 22, about to be 23 soon, the career I thought I'd be doing seems like a bad fit for me. I don't know what to do with myself cause I feel like ill just fail in everything I do. I feel constantly lost cause I don't have any other real skill or talent. I have no idea where to go or where to pivot my life now. Has anyone else gone through this and how did they get out? I honestly feel lost and want to die right now."

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

6ph9ey,1,2017-07-25,"Continue through school, or take a year off?",starpocalypse,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ph9ey/continue_through_school_or_take_a_year_off/,"Hello, I am a student who has completed (relatively) two years of school and a summer of courses, but I am just finishing up freshman classes because I switched majors.

I do not qualify for in-state tuition because I have not lived and worked in the state I attend school for twelve months prior to attending classes. This means my tuition is roughly *$14k a semester.*

I am considering taking a year off to try and prove that I have at least lived in this state for 12 months, and work full time, prior to attending courses, but I'm not even sure yet if this will count for in-state. But, should it count, is it worth taking that extra time off?

My parents want me to continue school and are willing to pay for it, but I *really* don't trust their financial skills. They purchased a new Mercedes and then complain about paying my tuition, and when I ask for help to fill out the FAFSA and guidance in how to take out loans myself, I get shut down. They tell me it's not worth filling out the FAFSA, etc etc. They've gone bankrupt twice while I was growing up.

Were I to qualify for instate, I would only be paying about 6k max a semester. My parents are insisting that they will dip into retirement and take on another job but I just don't trust them. I might have to take another three years to finish college and that's not counting any summers I may have to take (right now summers are $8k). I currently have a job but it's only a part-time student position. Right now I don't pay rent because I'm living in my parents' rental, but I'm willing to move out to a shitty apartment as long as they can find someone to rent the whole house for $1200 a month.

So here is my state:

**Tuition Options**

* Option A: Continue going to school, estimate $28k a year for three years maximum. Potential additional $8k for an extra summer of courses.

* Option B: Take off school to work full time and reside within the state. Potentially reduce tuition to $12k a year. Additional summer may cost about $3-4k.

**Living Options**

Option A: Continuing living in parents' rental, pay only bills and internet. Parents' rental is $400/mo worth.

Option B: If I were to live on my own in an apartment, I'm estimating my rent to be about $500-$600, not including utilities which can average $200-$300 depending on the month. My part-time income is estimated $900/mo.

**Financial assistance:**
I receive about $6k a year on a PLUS loan, and currently don't qualify for any school scholarships I've applied to because of grades (I'm working on that, it's gotten a lot better after switching majors). All of that aid goes to tuition, though.

My parents think that if I continue school, it's adding another year of higher salary to my life (my degree can make between 40-55k starting, depending on location). I could potentially try to intern for at least a semester, but I'm not yet confident enough to have one because I just finished the basic freshman classes for my degree.

Is it worth it to keep going? Or should I wait a year to attempt lower tuition? My biggest fear is losing the momentum to finish school. 

It's been so demotivating already, but I feel like I'm risking my parents being unable to pay for school. I'm very scared that I'll end up having to take on their load with private loans at a higher tuition that I feel is avoidable.

Let me know if I can clarify anything. Thank you!"

**Height:** 5'10'' 

**Eyes:** Blue 

**Hair:** Platinum Blonde (currently) 

**Clothing:** Eris prefers bright colors and loud patterns on most occasions, but has been seen in blacks and grays in rare moments. Even when sporting robes she tends to make them her own by adding accessories here and there. 

##Miscellaneous Info 

**Full Name::** Eris Morgana Carver 

**Age:** 17

**Birthday:** October 3rd

**Blood Status:** Half-Blood 

**Patronus:** Capuchin Monkey 

**Wand:** Ash, Dragon Heartstring core, 13 inches, rigid.

**Greatest Fear:** Immortality 

**Previous School:** Ilvermorny 

* *House:* Wampus 

**Pets:** None

**Trinkets:**  

* Decorative deck of tarot cards. She loves giving other students readings.

* Time-Turner. A **fake** she and her father worked together to build when she was little that she still wears. 

##Family

**Father:** Jasper Carver - current flying instructor at Ilvermorny. Previously, beater for the U.S. national quidditch team.  

**Mother:** Caroline Carver - muggle, lawyer at Shade &amp; Scoggins in New York City. 

**Bother:** Osiris Carver - twin, spending his last year at Ilvermorny and later intends to study magical medicine. 

##Background 

Eris grew up with her family in New York and until this summer had spent all her life there. She only recently brought up the idea to her parents of spending her last year at Hogwarts to give her a chance to experience something new for her last year. Fully intending to travel the world once she graduates, she decided to use this move as a gateway to the rest of the world once she was done. Plus she'd needed to get out of Ilvermorny like yesterday, her father was around way too much for her taste. 

Never finding a love for quidditch like her father and brother did, she was far more interested in creating things. Expression in any form from art to fashion to writing always drove her to find different forms of inspiration, hence her desire to travel. Muggle &amp; magical culture were equally as interesting to her. Eris wanted to see the best of both worlds when she could. 

Her mother always made a point of bragging her namesake held true as trouble seemed to follow her wherever she went. It wasn't her fault her old friends at Ilvermorny had gotten in trouble for slipping a love potion to their elderly potions teacher. She had in fact warned them to be more careful and definitely wasn't the one to mix up the cup of the intended target - a young intern with their school healer. 

So, technically, it was her idea to leave and come to Ilvermorny, but the school itself also strongly suggested their relationship end sooner than expected. Eris really didn't think they had long term possibilities anyway. Why the other three girls didn't get in trouble she had no idea...allegedly. 

______

##Current 

Eris seemed to have arrived rather earlier in the day than she had intended, but she'd nevertheless use that time to explore a bit before she settled into her new room. The dungeons. Ew. Really of all the places to have a common room something far less bleak should have been an option. Images of black on black on stone came to her mind as she strolled around the courtyard. Perhaps it would be different once she actually went down there, but it wasn't a bad idea to have decoration plans on the backburner. 

A glance at the cloudy sky had Eris huffing in annoyance. She wasn't going to go back in the castle just yet, deciding to be stubborn with the weather for a while longer. A stone bench nearby offered her just that much more of a leg up for her to attempt to look around the grounds more. Not much to see currently. Good thing she had an entire year to really figure this place out.

6phc82,1,2017-07-25,[x-post] In my 20s and wanting to start a career and move out. Need advice for dealing with my parents,Garothdyn,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6phc82/xpost_in_my_20s_and_wanting_to_start_a_career_and/,"Recently, I got accepted for a software development internship in a top company overseas. There's also the possibility of employment after the internship.

However, I've never been out of home for a longer period. I am my parents' only child, and they are practically obsessed with me. And yes, I am a bit spoiled (and recently came to realize it's a bad thing).

Now, to be fair, my parents are lovely people and I have many things to be grateful for, and I love them and want to do my best to make them proud, so I don't intend anything to be taken as if against them, as wonderful people who, albeit their weaknesses, do their best to make sure I am doing well. But the problems must be addressed, nonetheless.

Honestly, I don't think they are very emotionally/mentally stable, and I don't say this as if they were bad people or at fault for being who they are. I myself have my own problems, and I am trying to work on them. But, I mention it because they have great influence over me in my own mental health, and I often feel depressed when I spend a lot of time at home. I used to be much much more insecure in the past. I am still a bit of a coward when it comes to certain things, unlike others whose parents were not so controlling during the childhood years. And I am trying to change this, since it impairs my ability to function in this chaotic world where your very life's at stake.

Now back to the internship. It will last only 2 months, and there is still a lot of time till then, but my mum is so concerned about me that all she does everyday is talk to me about how would I get by on my own, what if this, what if that, whether I will have enough money, etc. I understand her concern. What I have problems with is that we talk about these things over and over again and she keeps being anxious about it while oftentimes expressing her disagreement about my going there mostly implicitly (sometimes even explicitly). To make it worse, she often goes like ""What will I do when you are not here? I will lose my appetite, I won't even cook, I will wait for you to return..."". Now this is getting even more difficult to bear. She often makes sure to stress how much she loves me. But it's really pressuring me. My dad is also not there to support me and encourage me, instead he also expresses his disagreement from time to time and is on mum's side. This is draining all my energy and enthusiasm.

When I wanted to study abroad, I was turned away exactly the same by my parents, telling me instead that I could look for a job abroad after graduating. Now here I am, still living with my parents, and they still have the same attitude to those things. Even though this is only an internship, and there is no guarantee whatsoever that I will be offered a full-time position, my parents find it pretty hard. Let alone if I should be offered a full-time position.

This time, I decided to not back off, since this is my life and this is very important to me, and I will pursue it. However, when I think of how they would feel if I were offered and accepted a full-time job there, I am very troubled and at pain to see whether they would be able to cope with it at all and what I am to do about it.

I don't think staying with them is a good idea imho; I think I will get a clearer head if I were to move out and start living independently. That's not to say I want to forget my parents, since I intend to visit them as much as I can and keep in contact often and let them know I still appreciate them, but I think it's in the best interest for all of us if I were to simply start my own life.

I sometimes feel like a bird in a cage. And whenever my parents express their wishes for me to be always next to them or how much they depend emotionally/mentally on me, I feel I will lose my mind if I don't leave.

Any advice/opinion/suggestion/comment would be much appreciated."
6phhka,8,2017-07-25,A question about PID calibration,SGNick,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/6phhka/a_question_about_pid_calibration/,"Hello! 

I had a question regarding the settings for a PI(D) controller that is being used to control a blower. The operator doesn't want it tuned too aggressively because they don't want the blower to go from say, 25% to 100% in the span of 2 seconds to prevent premature wear. 

Am I correct in assuming that the speed at which the blower ramps up should be controlled by the drive of the blower itself, and not by the PID? The system in question is very inertial and slow to react, and the current controller has incredibly small constants programmed, like 0.0005 for the gain, whereas when I performed an echelon test, modelled the response and calculated the ""proper"" values, I would get a gain of 25.

I've only brought this up once or twice with the operators (I'm a lowly intern at the moment) and they seem very hesitant to change anything about anything, I was hoping some of you could give me a bit more insight into the proper way to set things up. If their current method is a perfectly valid way of doing things, I am happy to keep things as they are!

Thanks for the help! "
6phi9z,2,2017-07-25,Worried landlord will try and evict me,throwlegal1,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/6phi9z/worried_landlord_will_try_and_evict_me/,"I'm a male student doing an internship for a year, I moved into this new place on the 1st of July with 2 other male interns. I'm just gonna lay out a general overview, give an indication of how much of a weird attitude my landlord has had since we moved in, and then go into why I'm worried he'll evict me.

NOTE: We're all from really well respected universities, doing good courses, and on placement at one of the most well known companies in the UK. We're good neighbours and definitely gave no bad impressions

- Theres 5 interns (all girls, split into 2 flats of 2 girls, and 1 of 1 girl) living in the same block. When we moved in he asked them all if they knew us, and if we were messy boys, straight away, didnt ask if the girls were messy, he already had an incredible bias towards us for no reason.
- The property is a new renovated house split into flats, we were assured it would be 100% done, I visited months ago and there were loads of builders and work was almost done (now its obvious it was just a show to make us think it was almost done), the day we moved in things were JUST being finished. There was a GIANT hole in the back garden, with a huge fire going in it (they were burning plastic, EVERYTHING in it, bad smoke and fumes) for the first 2-3 days when we moved in, fire service had to be called to put it out.
- A key point is that the property was advertised with bike storage. I moved up, had my bike with him, and politely asked him if I could store it in the house untill the storage was up (I promised not to use it, keep front wheel off, literally just leave it in a corner of my room not resting against the wall) he was fine with it, have multiple witnesses of him agreeing to it. He also allowed me to move my desk in as theres no desk in my room (again loads of people saw it, and he saw me move it in)
- He's yet to give us a third key for a house of 3 people, I don't have a key and have to make sure someone is in or steal their key, after 3 weeks.
- There's no bins (outside waste removal) so he told us to double bag and store waste inside untill bins arrived.

Okay so here’s what happened recently.

- He messaged us saying the key was done and he would drop it off tomorrow, this was last Thursday.
- He entered our place and carried a full inspection on the Friday (went into all our rooms), now I don't take saying he'll ""drop a key off' as a notice of inspection. (this was on a Friday, I work long hours from 7:30am to 6pm, my room is usually tidy, and this was the first time he’d inspected, everything else in the place was tidy)

This is what he complained about before saying he'd take it out of our deposits.
- We had bin bags in the kitchen as we couldn’t take it outside or put in garden (its a messy worksite) so the place smelt abit, but was obviously under control.
- My room had some plates in from the night before (no mould, literally had them from the night before) which he claimed were mouldy
- I had a pile of clothes in a bag in the corner to wash when I got home
- There was a box of open muffins on the couch from breakfast that morning(yes he complained about that)
- I had a pile of packing (plastic wrapping) and some stuff had fallen out of my bin (a yoghurt pot) but no damage to anything, was empty.
- The bike was in my room, not lent against the wall, obviously not used, front wheel off, clean as a whistle (he saw me move it in).

He told me to remove the bike immediately (even after advertising with bike storage, and allowing me it in the house until storage was ready), tidy up, and threatened to take our deposits. I spoke with my housemates and replied that he had no ground to take our deposits, and that I would be speaking to citizen’s advice bureau if he continued. He replied in a very threatening manner, and said things were getting serious now and I would be getting an email from him. I tidied up, there’s no damage to ANYTHING, I removed the bike (now have an £800 bike tied to a tree in the garden, love it). I sent him a message apologising, and that the place was tidy, he’s ignored my messages. He sent the group chat a message saying he’d drop the key off on Sunday (he didn’t) then he came in on Monday whilst we were at work (loads of signs he did) and didn’t drop key off or say anything. Another thing which is funny, my girlfriend is living in the 1bed flat upstairs, he told her not to come round or talk to “the boys”.

6phrx3,1,2017-07-25,"literally just got fired from an unpaid internship after slaving away for two months, apparently mostly related to my disposition, and it hurts so much",vanilacookie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6phrx3/literally_just_got_fired_from_an_unpaid/,"i had a really bad day in general. i forgot that i had a check in with my psychiatrist about my new meds. i'm clinically depressed, and medicine hasn't been helping for a long time. i texted my boss that the appointment ended at 10:30 so i'd have to be late. i was already on my way to work when i realized. i didn't think it was a big deal because shit comes up, and i can't constantly put off the doctor because of ""work"". if not today it would've been the same situation another day. i got the dates confused and thought that the appt was thursday. so i went to the doc and just sobbed a lot, like i always do in her office, because of how hard life is right now. i'm a college student in a big city with no money, doing an unpaid internship at great financial sacrifice because i'm a rising senior and wanted to better my chances of getting a job. i'm always depressed but the money thing in particular has never been this glaring because of what i'm working with right now. i basically cried on the phone to my mom for 40 minutes after my appointment because i just felt so terrible. because my internship is unpaid, my school gave me a stipend, but 95% of it goes toward paying for on campus housing, and i just got the second half of it, so having to give up so much money that soon again just killed me. i didn't know how i was gonna get myself to go to work. at this point i only had like two weeks left but even that felt like too much. 

i end up getting to work at, like, 12, because of the crying and because the doctor was like 200 blocks away. i texted my boss 15 mins before i got there that i had to wait and that the appointment went long. a lie, yes. as soon as i get there, my boss says 'we need to talk' and i'm like, great. so yeah, after 9 weeks of absolute drivel and unpaid ""overtime"" and general bullshit, she fires me because 'it's not working out.' i have two weeks left, five or six days of work, at the most, and she says that. if i were so fucking terrible, why are you just telling me this now? 

a large part of my job revolves around sample tracking, and she cited last week as a time where i, like, did everything wrong and signed nothing out and messed up their records. i was there TWO FUCKING DAYS last week, one of those days THE OTHER INTERN WAS THERE—she was there all week except for one day i had on my own last week, and somehow that all falls on me? signing things out as soon as my boss informs me of a request is so second nature to me and such a reflex i don't even have to think about it, so to hear her say that was fucking baffling. at least don't say it happened a week when i was barely fucking there. 

it seemed like my, albeit last minute, EXCUSED lateness was the last straw--am i just never supposed to do anything ever? i literally have NEVER had a set schedule because each week is different, and it's fucking impossible to schedule around it. literally i don't know what days i'm doing until the week of/during that week. it's a joke. 

i really wanted to start talk therapy this summer but i couldn't because of that. ive just made so many sacrifices and tried so hard and for someone to say i look like i don't care (also mixed in with this is my chronic bitchface which i can do nothing about and i even explained to her), that i roll my eyes when she tells me to do something (LOL WHAT), that im doing everything wrong (which i truly feel is literally impossible), after all the effort i've made in trying to be alert and there while i'm falling apart is just such a slap in the face. it hurts so much for no one to see how hard i'm trying/for me to believe i'm giving it my all and for my boss to see someone who is a huge mistake, it hurts so fucking much. it makes me feel like some delusional basket case who has absolutely no idea how she comes off to other people. why do i even try if it literally doesn't matter at all? i'm so angry and sad and it's like i got my wish but it also just made what i was going through so much worse. 

it's funny because she also cited my text to her this morning as being unprofessional because i added 'jsyk' at the end. she's a 20 something and we communicate by text; if the subway is running late or something and i text her, which she told me to do, am i supposed to have professional email etiquette or something? for a simple text? like, are you kidding me? she seemed like she was grasping at straws. she texts me casually if i'm in another section of the office and needs something, like it's nothing, i didn't think that was a big deal. even if it were to her that's hardly something to cite as part of the reason she's firing me, what the fuck?

also she cited my lateness today as if i just showed up late as fuck with literally no explanation. jesus christ i'm just at a loss

part of the stipulations of my getting the stipend from my school is her evaluating me at the end of it so i'm kind of terrified. 

my internship literally came down to shipping and receiving. i've literally lost so much weight this summer, ha, because i spend the entire day running around the office packing up shit, making boxes, putting clothes in bags, sending them up, putting them away, and shit like that. that is all i do, literally. it's fucking garbage and insulting, but that's what i signed up for, i guess. although i guess it's much nicer to be fired from something i couldn't give less of a shit about rather than from something i'm actually interested in. 

i know i'll get over it soon, as i get over things rather quickly, but i just feel like stakes are higher now because relatively soon i'll be graduating, and i'm worried about how this will affect me in the future. and i'm worried about getting a job or being successful in a future job when it seems like no matter what i do, i come off as a terrible person. 

how will i ever be a normal adult if my depression affects me this much? i don't know how to calm down right now and i'm just really worried about my post grad prospects right now "

6phvqe,6,2017-07-25,"literally just fired from unpaid internship after slaving away for two months, apparently mostly related to my disposition, and it hurts so much",vanilacookie,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6phvqe/literally_just_fired_from_unpaid_internship_after/,"i had a really bad day in general. i forgot that i had a check in with my psychiatrist about my new meds. i'm clinically depressed, and medicine hasn't been helping for a long time. i texted my boss that the appointment ended at 10:30 so i'd have to be late. i was already on my way to work when i realized. i didn't think it was a big deal because shit comes up, and i can't constantly put off the doctor because of ""work"". if not today it would've been the same situation another day. i got the dates confused and thought that the appt was thursday. so i went to the doc and just sobbed a lot, like i always do in her office, because of how hard life is right now. i'm a college student in a big city with no money, doing an unpaid internship at great financial sacrifice because i'm a rising senior and wanted to better my chances of getting a job. i'm always depressed but the money thing in particular has never been this glaring because of what i'm working with right now. i basically cried on the phone to my mom for 40 minutes after my appointment because i just felt so terrible. because my internship is unpaid, my school gave me a stipend, but 95% of it goes toward paying for on campus housing, and i just got the second half of it, so having to give up so much money that soon again just killed me. i didn't know how i was gonna get myself to go to work. at this point i only had like two weeks left but even that felt like too much. 

i end up getting to work at, like, 12, because of the crying and because the doctor was like 200 blocks away. as soon as i get there, my boss says 'we need to talk' and i'm like, great. so yeah, after 9 weeks of absolute drivel and unpaid ""overtime"" and general bullshit, she fires me because 'it's not working out.' i have two weeks left, five or six days of work, at the most, and she says that. if i were so fucking terrible, why are you just telling me this now? 

a large part of my job revolves around sample tracking, and she cited last week as a time where i, like, did everything wrong and signed nothing out and messed up their records. i was there TWO FUCKING DAYS last week, one of those days THE OTHER INTERN WAS THERE—she was there all week except for one day i had on my own last week, and somehow that all falls on me? signing things out as soon as my boss informs me of a request is so second nature to me and such a reflex i don't even have to think about it, so to hear her say that was fucking baffling. at least don't say it happened a week when i was barely fucking there. 

it seemed like my, albeit last minute, EXCUSED lateness was the last straw--am i just never supposed to do anything ever? i literally have NEVER had a set schedule because each week is different, and it's fucking impossible to schedule around it. literally i don't know what days i'm doing until the week of/during that week. it's a joke. 

i really wanted to start talk therapy this summer but i couldn't because of that. ive just made so many sacrifices and tried so hard and for someone to say i look like i don't care (also mixed in with this is my chronic bitchface which i can do nothing about and i even explained to her), that i roll my eyes when she tells me to do something (LOL WHAT), that im doing everything wrong (which i truly feel is literally impossible), after all the effort i've made in trying to be alert and there while i'm falling apart is just such a slap in the face. it hurts so much for no one to see how hard i'm trying/for me to believe i'm giving it my all and for my boss to see someone who is a huge mistake, it hurts so fucking much. it makes me feel like some delusional basket case who has absolutely no idea how she comes off to other people. why do i even try if it literally doesn't matter at all? i'm so angry and sad and it's like i got my wish but it also just made what i was going through so much worse. 

it's funny because she also cited my text to her this morning as being unprofessional because i added 'jsyk' at the end. she's a 20 something and we communicate by text; if the subway is running late or something and i text her, which she told me to do, am i supposed to have professional email etiquette or something? for a simple text? like, are you kidding me? she seemed like she was grasping at straws. she texts me casually if i'm in another section of the office and needs something, like it's nothing, i didn't think that was a big deal. even if it were to her that's hardly something to cite as part of the reason she's firing me, what the fuck?

also she cited my lateness today as if i just showed up late as fuck with literally no explanation. jesus christ i'm just at a loss

i even apologized for being depressed and having it affect my disposition, which she completely disregarded. 

part of the stipulations of my getting the stipend from my school is her evaluating me at the end of it so i'm kind of terrified.

6pirpm,1,2017-07-25,My health anxiety is destroying me. How am I supposed to know when something is serious or not?,thwanon4891,HealthAnxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthAnxiety/comments/6pirpm/my_health_anxiety_is_destroying_me_how_am_i/,"Yesterday I tried to close my mini umbrella, and a metal rib pierced the palm of my hand. I immediately started to freak out and spent the next several hours on WebMD, google, and on the phone with my mom (who is a doctor) trying to figure out what I needed to do besides put on a bandaid. I spent hours searching for a gauze and antibiotic cream (settled on cotton balls to add some pressure). And I spent hours worrying about getting an infection, tetanus, or sepsis. 

I spent hours trying to figure out if I should call my doctor. I called their office a few hours ago and asked the secretary if I should come in. I'm waiting for a call back, but the doctor's office is closed on wednesdays (tomorrow), so I hope he gets back to me by today. And I hope if I need a tetanus booster, I get one in time, because I heard you need one within 48 hours (I got my last tetanus shot a little under 9 years ago so idk if that's good). 

I'm supposed to be doing a lot of programming assignments for my internship, but instead I'm just sitting here freaking out, and can't get anything done. 

*****

I'm diagnosed with OCD and recently started zoloft. I tried to do intensive Exposure&amp;Response Therapy, but I had to stop because I couldn't get myself to do the exposure exercises at home and it was a lot of money. I made a lot of progress with the therapy, but it really mostly helped me with a lot of worries about food poisoning that I had, that were problematic given my drop in weight (I've gained some back). 

I was also went to the hospital this past semester for some really bad heart palpitations, that made me think I was going to die. It was really bad and I couldn't walk across campus without taking a cab for two weeks, but the cardiologist and basically every doctor that saw me said it was probably anxiety and I was otherwise fine. fuck me....

Everytime something happens to me I worry about if it's serious enough to warrant seeing a doctor or urgent care, and with that comes all the social anxiety with thinking I'm a silly patient for wasting their time and my money with something that could be too minor. And if I don't see a doctor or urgent care, I worry that it might actually be serious, and I doomed myself.

Is there an intelligent way to design this problem that makes it more maintainable than an intern's spaghetti jQuery? I feel like there must be a better approach.

I have a dropdown list with 6 different possible selections. For each of those 6 selections I'll need a unique form layout in the page and I would like it to update the form on screen accordingly without page refreshes.

I have been interning at this company for over a year and only recently started working on sprint tickets. This week is the beginning of the second sprint I am working on. There are only seven developers on our team and I am the only girl. I'm also not particularly close with any of the other developers. I feel the normal 'impostor syndrome' pretty hard on a daily basis but until today I hadn't had any big screw up. Today I was working on a low scored ticket (we score them based on difficulty) that I started yesterday. I had trouble finding the fix because the ticket was for our KPI (Key Performance Indicator) which I had never worked on before. It involved working with SQL Server Management Studio which I am still getting used to. So the ticket was to address the fact that one of the widgets in the KPI wasn't changing to the right color based on it's status. Like many places, we have a DB for QA and another for Production. So the color was changing in the KPI QA environment but not prod. I found that this was because the status thresholds in prod. were not correct. So I asked my boss what to do as well as another coworker. My boss said to go ahead and change it. I was nervous about changing prod. in the first place but must not have expressed that very well. Well when I went to change it I forgot a SQL 'Where' statement and accidentally changed the values for every row. Granted this was out KPI so it didn't affect clients but I still feel so dumb. My boss noticed first and came over to check what went wrong. He told me I must've changed the value for all of them then he went back to his office and just copied the values for the rows in QA over. Everything was fixed in like fifteen minutes but I feel so stupid! I apologized to him for the mistake but never heard back. Which isn't out of character for him, he doesn't talk much. Overall I know the mistake wasn't critical or project shattering but I'm just so embarrassed I don't know what to do! I'm scared to even pick up another ticket.

Edit: thanks fellow nerd ladies, you have made me feel much better about my mistake. I'll return to work tomorrow and just keep coding. I'll make mistakes again but I will feel better after knowing just how normal it is. I love knowing there are women in the tech field and that we can support each other. You're all awesome!"

I'm an intern at a newspaper in the midwest. There are 9 or 10 other interns and I'm the only black one. We have an intern group chat on groupme but I left the chat for a couple weeks but rejoined yesterday.

In the mean time the newspaper organized an intern lunch and it was a good time. They were laughing at all my jokes and we were really bonding for the first time of this internship. I'm a relatively quiet person and I'm not always the most welcoming or forthcoming but I rejoined the group chat to try to involve myself more with the group.

I was scrolling through the two weeks I was gone to see what I missed and what they were talking about. And boys, I saw some shit.

They were openly shitting on me. Hollin bout fuck me this fuck me that. The girl that sits next to every day expressed her disappointment that she had to do an assignment with me. Another girl said she'd rather go cover a double homicide than work with me. Not everyone chimed in but they were all liking these messages about me.

I posted in the chat, asking what all of that was about and said I didn't appreciate it. Of course they were all ""sorry.""

I talked with my mom and my close friends and they were all upset, as was I. Today I grabbed my editor and told her I needed to talk to her about some stuff and I showed her the screenshots and she was really upset.

Later in the day she came and got me and now I have a choice that I have to make. I can show my editor's boss (the highest ranking person at the paper) and he'll talk with the other interns or I can do nothing. Right now, I'm heavily leaning towards showing my editor's boss after I got off the phone with my mom a couple hours ago, she's really upset.

If you fellas were in this situation what would y'all do?

Also, I can post the screenshots if you all would like to see them. I'll have to cover up names and faces but still."

6pk46r,0,2017-07-25,My [19F] boyfriend [20M] cheated in an unexpected and bad way and I'm falling back in love with him in a super unhealthy way.,707866,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pk46r/my_19f_boyfriend_20m_cheated_in_an_unexpected_and/,"Hey guys! I wanted to explore the idea of my boyfriend, who I have been dating weeks short of 1 year, sleeping with other people. We have a long-distance relationship during the school year, so summer is the only time we have together. So the idea of him sleeping with other girls is kinda a fetish of mine and we talked about it the past few weeks. My most important condition is that there can't be any emotions evolved. He makes a tinder and talks to girls and stumbles on a girl he talked to a year ago on Tinder before he met me. He's been a really amazing boyfriend - we struggled with some jealousy issues on his part and miscommunication, but overall it's been smooth sailing and we could see ourselves having a long-term relationship and living together later this summer temporarily (we are both having internships and the rents just worked out for us living together for two weeks in August). 

This girl clearly loves him. In her description on Tinder she references something that he introduced her too and she superlikes him and then freaks out on him going like ""omg I'm so happy you remember me"". I'm uncomfortable with this and was basically like this girl wants a relationship, so you're either going to be straight up or just end it. He tells her that it's only going to be a one-time deal and she wants to be friends because she feels like they really get along. They keep talking and he tells her about me and she basically goes ""talk to me when you're single."" Either way, I tell him I'm uncomfortable and to cut her off if he won't have a one-time thing with her. He tells me ""I really want to fuck this girl."" This is on Thursday. The next day, we go to a bar and I basically fall asleep at 10 pm. Apparently when I was sleeping he added this girl on Snapchat and they talked and I couldn't see the messages, but the gist of it was that he lied to her and said he was going to remain friends with her after they had sex, but wasn't planning on talking to her. She sent some nudes. 

So I wake up and he's like ""Yeah I'm going to have sex with this girl today"" and I'm like ""Whoa what show me"" and he explains it's on Snapchat but that he worked it out. So things are moving really fast - we have a brunch with a friend and then he basically kicks me to go to my own place for the day. I try to play it cool and I'm like ""Okay yeah let's buy condoms for you"" and after that I basically leave. At my place, I start getting uncomfortable and message him a couple of times - nothing explicit like ""stop having sex with her"" but more like ""haha, I see you're using Netflix."" He leaves me on read. An hour and a half later I'm like ""are you done yet"" and he leaves me on read. I tell him that I'm hurt and I want to talk to him, and message him some stuff like ""call me"" etc etc. I call him 5 times. He sends me something 20 minutes later going ""Sorry I fell asleep"" and I'm like ""okay I'm hurt"" and then he doesn't respond again for 20 minutes. I go off on him again and I'm like ""you're the worst, why are you not responding when I say I'm hurt"" and he's like ""I'm sorry"" and then there's a lot of back and forth and he says he's sorry like 3 times. I then go liek ""Let's talk at 6 at your place"" because I wanted to cool down and think about what to say to him. I was like ""the sex isn't what hurts it's your lack of transparency and my feelings."" 

He has sex with her again at this point because he sees this as an open invitation for him to do whatever until 6, despite me saying that I'm hurt. I see this as cheating. I was crying by myself in my room, calling him again and again. After that, he does not mention them having sex again through text and I go ""is the girl still there"" and to my surprise (I thoguth she was long gone) he goes ""Yes, I'm kicking her out now."" 

He comes to my place, we argue and he is basically a brick wall. I tell him that I'm really upset at him and am considering breaking up with him with the knowledge I have now. Then, I ask him if he used condoms and he said no. I freak out and slap him, mostly because I am on birth control (something I got on after three months of sleeping with him, so it was very important to me especially because he was my first everything) and him sleeping with someone else with no protection really means he has no respect for my body. I break up with him and tell him to have my shit ready at 9. 

At his place, he says sorry and it's clear that he's been crying. At this point he's on his knees and begging for me to come back - that I'm his world and that he can't bear the thought of losing me. I say that we can talk in a week and that we're definitely broken up for now. He has been crying for basically three days straight - he took off work. He's kinda broken at this point.

However, I can't seem to stay away from this man. He says I'm his best friend and he hates himself for what he did and cannot bear to look at himself in the mirror. He really regrets it - I can tell. He has come over for the past few days and we have spent out nights together super restless. We have kissed a couple of times (but I swore we would nto have sex for three months bc of STDs) and I'm trying to not fall in love with him. I have invited him once and the other time he came because he just needed someone to talk to. If I don't htink about the cheating we have so much fun and we really connect on so many different levels - we can watch movies, play video games together, do sudoku, and talk about math problems. I don't think I will find someone I am so connected with, and he was such a sweet boyfriend before so what he did totally blind sided me. He has made me pie and brought me flowers and cleaned up my room, but our reliance is super unhealthy. He says he is willing to go without sex for 3 months and to be friends if I give him a chance to begin with. 

Help! 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I wanted him to sleep with a girl. He sleeps with girl I don't like and has sex with her again after seeing my text messages saying I'm hurt. He doesn't use protection. He is trying to make me fall back in love with him and it's becoming unhealthy since we still spend all our time together. "
6pl1x8,0,2017-07-25,"Big increase in income, parent needing financial assistance, am I being overly conservative in financial planning?",Aazadan,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6pl1x8/big_increase_in_income_parent_needing_financial/,"So here's the situation:  I've been on disability for over a decade and been attending school to eventually better my position.  I have 1 year of school left to go and landed a very well paying internship which has turned into a part time position while I attend school... with the intention to convert to full time after I graduate.  I have no credit card debt with about $10k in student loans,  also no savings, no assets, and a paid off car that only has about 1.5 years worth of life left in it.  Currently making about 70k/year with a cost of living of about $15k (low col area) with another $10k needed over the next few months for tuition.  Additionally, I'll soon have the need to cover my own health insurance and such thanks to the income which will raise that COL an unknown amount.  Credit is around 750 and top it off I'm 34 without a single dollar saved towards retirement and I need to make up for lost them there with additional savings.
  
Here's where it gets tricky.  My mom and stepdad have reconciled and split up numerous times over the past 15 years.  They bought a house 15 years ago that was a fixer upper.   Since then, they've sunk a lot of time and money into the house, but it's in worse shape than when it was originally purchased.  On top of that my stepdad died about a year ago.  With his death went any equity in the house as it was sold to reclaim unpaid taxes.  My mom has been living in the house rent free for the past year until the bank recently reacquired and sold the house.  It was appriased at $35k and the bank sold it to a mortgage company for $40k.  This company is willing to sell the house back to her for $50k, but she has no credit due to a bankruptcy a decade ago (and no attempt at rebuilding credit since).  Her bank is unwilling to give her a loan she can afford due to a combination of poor credit and lack of ability to repay due to living on a fixed income (and an expesive illness that will likely be fatal within 5 years can't help).  
  
So, we get to the question.  I've been asked to do one of three things:  
1. Take out a loan and buy the home, then rent it back to her.  
2.  Cosign a loan.  
3.  Help out financially so she can make the loan payments, but still have enough money for food and medicine.  
  
I don't want to take option #1.  Homes are expensive, homes that need a bunch of repairs (we're talking about $30k in repairs) even more so.  This route basically means I'll be paying $15k above market rate for the house, plus another $30k in repairs.  For that money plus what the house would cost I could buy a really nice piece of property in the area.   
  
But, even that aside, I've always felt that one should be able to make 3+ house payments per month on a home in order to get it paid off and build equity.  I would be living elsewhere (if for no other reason than who wants to live with their parents as an adult?), that means paying my own rent, and it means paying probably 2.5 mortgage payments per month.  All together that's around $1800/month (not including her portion) which on my income is 31% of gross.  That seems high for rent especially when you consider I would also be responsible for upkeep on the house.
  
Lastly, this is a pretty shitty thing to say about ones mom, as I do love my mom, but she's a shitty tenant.  I've seen her estrange her sister due to a disagreement when she was renting from her sister.  That relationship never healed.  At her previous apartment, she eventually got kicked out too for hoarding too much junk and blocking all access to the basement so that the landlord couldn't get in and fix the black mold problem the house was developing (this went on for 3 years before she was kicked out... there was plenty of time to clear her stuff out).  Mixing business and family rarely works out in the best of circumstances, and these aren't the best circumstances.
  
Now, for option #2.  My credit isn't perfect (it's starting to go up as my income and thus ability to repay has increased though) but it's not too bad.  I could likely qualify for a home loan.  At a minimum I could probably qualify for more than a high risk loan like my mom qualifies for.  This means I could cosign her loan and get better terms.  This saves her money, and lets her keep her house.  The issue here, is that I've been told by her several times while she's been squatting in it for the past year that she's barely breaking each month despite not having any rent to pay.  Just utilities, food, car maintenence, etc has her fully tapped out.  This greatly concerns me, because it gives me good reason to believe I'll actually have to step in and deal with the loan payments at some point which is a situation I want to avoid.  
  
Another issue is her health.  She probably has less than 5 years left, if/when that happens, if I'm cosigned on the loan I'm going to be stuck with a housing debt for a house I don't want, with little resale value, and almost certainly at 0 equity as medicare/medicaid will take what she does have in the house as part of their usual estate confiscation.  
  
One last issue, is that should things go well in my career over the next couple years, I may want to purchase my own home (likely in a different area).  That becomes significantly more difficult if I'm already cosigned on something else.  
  
Finally, that brings us to option #3.  Just subsidizing some money each month.  I'm the least opposed to this option, it would be giving away money with no return or repayment plan but when family is involved I think that's better than drawing up a contract as business and family don't mix.  The issue here is that I can't figure out what I could reasonably pay... if anything.  In theory there's a lot of spare money in my budget right now.  But after taxes, loan repayment (which I want done by the end of the school year as I'm in subsidized loans), the upcoming need for a replacement car (that I don't want to carry a payment on), the need to build a healthy savings, and what's effectively a crisis in my retirement plan right now... I just don't see where the money can come from.  It feels like I would need to compromise on one of the above in order to have anything to spare for at least a year.  
  
In the past few days I've been told by my mom that I'm stingy, greedy, self centered, and an outright horrible human being because I won't agree to any of the three options.  The thing is though, I grew up with her being poor our entire lives.  Then I became an adult and got my own set of problems, and continued being poor.  I told myself I would escape it (which for someone documented with a disability, getting out of the system is very rare) and I think I've got the opportunity now if I make the right moves with my income.  I don't want to simply not help my mom... but any of those three options feels financially catastrophic to me, and will pull me right back down to what I'm trying to escape from.  
  
Am I wrong?  Can I spend money on a house/stipend easily despite the need for building savings, retirement, and an emergency fund?  Or perhaps, is there something else I haven't considered yet?"
6pl3ol,3,2017-07-25,My job from Hell,MagicMirror11,WorkStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkStories/comments/6pl3ol/my_job_from_hell/,"This is my first post, so I hope this works out. I tried to leave out as much information as possible.

So, I worked at a software company for almost 4 years as part of the QA team. I made a post somewhere on /r/AskReddit, and someone was interested in all my other work-related horror stories. I had no other place to post this and was half tempted to put these up on /r/nosleep (because I still have nightmares about these) This is the original story: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6isl6x/what_is_socially_accepted_when_you_are_beautiful/dj8wjx2/

So, I will start at the beginning (They don’t start out as horrible, but that will change in a bit). I was hired to automate the regression testing that was being done at this company. Now, normally you expect a little bit of documentation so you know what the heck you’re doing, and a decent automation software. I got neither. The software they used was mostly drag &amp; drop based, the training for the software was non-existent, and the documentation for everything was incomplete. I had received this poorly written excel sheet with random test cases and email addresses all over the place. It made me shudder. So, what did I do? I had to write my own.

After I got the hang of the documentation, or lack thereof, I started automating tests, but the problem was, I was not testing in a stable environment. Every day, things would move around on the page, the names of objects on the webpage were constantly changing, and my automation software was always looking for objects based on their position and size, this was an utter nightmare. On top of that, the QA manager managed like a QA manager, and didn’t understand that just because I made x amount of progress for automation one day, didn’t mean I could make that same amount of progress the next day and maintain all these scripts that should have already been passing. He thought his motivational speeches were going to help me overcome this unstable environment and cheap automation software. They really didn’t

My first few months were pretty okay. My boss was extremely strange. He would call me into his office almost every day(this was all open cubicles and his office had really big windows so everyone could see when I was in there). He would usually ask me the same questions each time:
So, how do you like it here?
How do you like the company?
Am I a good boss?
Um… yeah, I guess you’re a good boss? This is my first real job after McD’s and an internship so I don’t really have much to base this on… you’re not yelling at the top of your lungs into my ear so I guess that’s a huge improvement over McD’s (Or so I thought. By the time I left, even McD’s cashiers looked like the perfect career choice for a CS major)?

These meetings happened for a while until…
I was given the mobile app as my product. And I was clearly pretty damn miserable. We had several people that worked on the mobile app. I’ll call them NiceGirl, Boobs, and Psycho. NiceGirl obviously never gave me problems and we still talk to this day even though I left the company about 10 months ago. NiceGirl also didn’t have to test the mobile app as much since I had joined the mobile testing group, (not team, mind you, just a group of people testing the same app for their own product), and she was nice enough to help me out. Psycho complained about the fact that the last person that tested this had a person to help them out, and since they started, they were feeling a bit overwhelmed testing their section of the app. Okay, cool… I was told to help out with that. Boobs… let’s talk about this individual. She was good-looking, but I doubt she had anything going on in that brain of hers. 

Boobs was one of those people that dressed in super tight clothes (I don’t judge, but this was not work appropriate according to the employee’s handbook, just before I left, she thought gym attire was perfect for work, and the tights she wore were sometimes transparent). She had a high pitched voice and only ever spoke to you if she thought you were important in the company because she loved to use people. She especially liked to use this one guy that was responsible for giving people their PTOs. She’d sit in his office for hours, and just chat. She also had an obnoxious laugh you could hear from space. She’d get free food from him. She’d do a bunch of demos so people could just stare at her. She also had this manner of speaking where… you knew she knew she was not very bright, but she’d try to pass off as a genius. It was so hard not to laugh at her when she thought something was a serious problem, but it really wasn’t, especially when she used her “I’m better than you” voice. She also had a serious problem with me.

When I was put on the mobile group, I got all the phones. I also worked really hard and her boss knew. Her boss once broke their leg, and was hobbling around the office for weeks. Well, Boobs got a tiny cold and was also out at this time, so her boss was pretty damn pissed that he was running back and forth between machines to get all the testing done for the team. So much so, her boss called her out in a meeting, and also mentioned that I should be trained to work for their team, in case she ever pulls this shit again (she really wasn’t that sick, the worst she had were the sniffles. I only know this because she would usually leave an hour into work to go home, and she would have a full face of makeup and everything on those days).

Because I got all the phones, to her it looked like I was in charge of the group. I wasn’t. I didn’t want the damn phones, cause they took up so much of the space in my desk for storage, and I hated it. Boobs was nice to me on my first day, she gave me wipes cause the last person that worked at my desk liked eating ramen and potato chips right over my keyboard and no one thought to clean this shit up for the next person.  But the day I got the phones, something was set off in that brain of hers, and she did not like it. She would always keep the phones in her own desk, she would take the good phones for her own testing, even though her testing should have only taken a half hour max, she'd never given them back. She’d spend the full day “testing,” and she was just downright witchy whenever she interacted with me. She also loved trying to get me in trouble by trying to find problems on my part of the app, instead of thoroughly testing her own part of the app, hence the story I linked. When we got mobile hotspots, Boobs loved taking those home. Company paid wifi, and she thought no one would notice. Baba (will be later introduced) was the one that turned her in for that.

This nonsense from Boobs continued for a ridiculous amount of time, so here’s what I did to exact my own revenge. Each time she took her usual phones to test, I would make sure to uninstall any game apps she had installed on them (Candy Crush, and messaging apps included). I’d make sure to hide at least one good phone so I could test with something that wasn’t a 5 year old model, and I’d make sure to “remind” the group via email to give me the damn phones back, cause if they were stolen, that money was coming out of MY pocket and she would never lock her desk.

Needless to say, this only made matters worse. At one point, she got so damn petty, that while I was in the middle of reporting a very serious bug, she was throwing a fit because an asterisk was missing in a warning message that was in the part of the app that I tested. But a bug was written because, of course, Boobs just had to prance about, and my boss would do whatever she wanted if she threw a big enough fit.

Now, let’s talk about Psycho. I could relate to Psycho. I was beginning to feel some of the work pains that they did, and we bonded over hating work as much as possible, but there’s a reason I call this person Psycho in this text. I was completely blind to just how psychotic this person really was (even though my friend at work had given me plenty of warnings). Psycho would guilt me into paying for their lunches. Psycho was very good at pretending to be your friend while saying very mean things behind your back (I would witness this often when Psycho spoke with Boobs and RM, who I will introduce later. As soon as Psycho spoke very kindly to them, I would be bombarded with messages of Psycho complaining about this person). And I still didn’t learn my lesson and tried to be roomies with this person. Psycho had quit their job to start school, but then complained about how they didn’t have money. They practically got another job thrown at them, and thought spending 16 hours on their computer was productive. And in the end, I was chased out of my apartment in the middle of the night, and was so scared of my living situation that I packed up all my stuff the very next day and moved out. Psycho then sent me an email about all the money I owed them for all the “gifts” they had given me, and addressed every weakness and fear I had confided them with. I did completely delete them and anyone else that sided with this person from my life, though. And I swear to never have roommates again, or spend time with people from work outside of work.

So, over the years, I was practically removed from automation and my sole purpose in life was testing bugs and regression testing every 2 weeks (and in all this time miraculously get my automation completed). If you’re ever in IT, you know that regression is absolutely soul-crushing. I would test 5 different devices, running the same tests on each, and this would be a 3 day, no break, non-stop regression because my boss thought that we should all try to shorten the amount of time we spent testing so we could spend time on other things. The automation team suffered the most because impossible automation goals would be set for us. Sometimes the builds would be redeployed because some serious bug was found, but it wouldn’t be serious enough to cancel or postpone the release. But that would mean I’d sometimes repeat regression testing up to 3 times every two weeks. I learned to use automation to automate some parts of the app, but it was never good enough. “Oh, you did 5% of the automation yesterday? Can you do 10% tomorrow?” “Oh, can you finish this section in a month even though this other section you automated in a month is not nearly as complicated?” “Why is your automation coming along so slowly?”

I was stuck in QA limbo hell. I wasn’t part of the automation team. I was never called into meetings when they were discussing goals. I wasn’t part of the mobile team, because when a prod bug came in, I would be the last person to find out about it, even though I’d have to eventually do all the testing for that bug, and usually knew what was wrong about 70% of the time when I was finally informed about the bug. I wasn’t part of the other team I was part of, for the same reason I wasn’t part of the mobile team. I was then added to yet another team I wasn’t really part of.

This new product came out, and it was tested on 2 different platforms. I was there from the first day. It was Psycho’s and my baby. We were there when it was just a theory. We wrote all the test cases, we knew all the problems for it. We knew that product like the back of our hands. We knew which developer worked on every section of the product. It was still in its testing phase, when someone who grew bored with their job was added to the team. This was RM. RM was such an effing nightmare to work with. Psycho and I were lucky that RM worked in another building, because RM would still managed to drive us nuts via IM, but you can ignore IMs. RM would get pissed if you so much as ignored them for five seconds, and a flood of IMs would come rushing in all at once. RM would randomly create rules about how we needed to keep open communication, but would never inform Psycho or me about anything they found out in terms of this product or mobile (which is the other team RM was eventually added to).

One day, we complained to our manager. Psycho was crying and had had just about enough of RM. Psycho demanded something be done about RM. Well, things in the other building flopped, and RM was moved into our building. My manager decided this would be a great opportunity to make RM our team lead WITHOUT EVEN ASKING US! We just walked into our morning meeting, and my manager just broke the news to us. Psycho and I looked at each other confused, my manager saw that look and angrily said “Do you guys have a problem with this?” HELL YES! RM knew shit about the products they were put in charge of. If there was a ticket assigned to them and they didn’t understand it, they suddenly didn’t have time, and Psycho or me would have to take care of it. RM also demanded an obscene of documentation, but hated all the drafts we turned in, but never had any constructive criticism except that they just didn’t like the documentation. You could also tell by the way bug tickets were updated, that RM barely understood the English language. Their documentation was super sloppy, and they would also miss bugs in the system, which would always come back to bite Psycho and me in the butt. If we caught it in time, it was marked “passed with issues” and a bug was always written up for Psycho and I to test in a rush to get out to production. If it wasn’t caught, Psycho and I would receive an hour long BS rant about how testing should be done better. There was no winning. The worst part about working with RM was that as team lead, even though they did none of the work, they got all the praise. That would break my heart. I don’t need recognition at work, but if you’re going to give someone credit for something, make sure it’s to the right person. You’d swear Psycho and I didn’t work in that company at all by the end of it all.

RM also got a developer fired. RM loved preaching about testing within the scope of a bug, but RM, of course, never listened to their own advice. So one young dev joined the company, and RM tested all this young devs bugs. RM would test so outside the scope of the bugs that by the time these bugs got to me for testing, I was jumping between applications, and a million different parts of our website with no idea how the hell any of this stuff was related. It was pretty damn annoying. And because all this was going on under the young dev's manager’s radar (or the manager really didn’t like this young dev), this young dev was fired for taking too long fixing their tickets.

Just about the time Psycho left, Baba joined. Baba was good at automation and was very determined to reach QA management position (unfortunately for Baba, there was no moving up in that company. QA was bottom of the barrel and you couldn’t climb up, you could only get lower because if you were around long enough and my manager didn’t like you, you’d just get piled with more abuse as the years went on). Baba started off one of the good guys. Baba ended being a backstabbing little traitor. Baba joined forces with RM (who used and abused Baba so much, Baba aged at least 15 years in the 3 years I knew them), and turned against me. Baba used my friendship to let RM know my frustrations, and in turn, RM abused their power even more to make my life a living hell. Trust no one. Ever. Baba was so desperate to be on top, they betrayed me any chance they got.

Bur also joined the team. I was good friends with Bur and wish they would get their pathetic ass out of that company and find something that would pay what Bur was worth, but it’s their life and their choice. Bur was good friends with Baba, so Baba would tell them secrets Baba heard from my manager and from RM. Bur would tell me these secret, and man, the betrayal was real. I found out how little my boss thought of me, and was never surprised with stupid shit was going down at work. I was always at the edge of my seat waiting for my boss to break news to me about whatever torture he had in store for me that day, week, month, whatever. I was also last to find out about production bugs and sometimes had to find out from developers in my team that something was breaking in production.

Other stupid stuff RM did: RM never tested the mobile app, but was made to test it whenever any member of the team was gone for vacation. Well, one day we get a production bug. No one knows what went wrong because Bur and I are intelligent human beings who know how to do our jobs properly. My manager walks up to us and asks us what happened? How did we miss this. RM, being team lead, had no idea what my job actually entailed. Right away, they say “Oh, magicmirror11 missed that.” I look at RM, fuming. “I didn’t test that part of the app.” RM thinks for a second. “Maybe Baba missed something in their testing.” I look at RM again, laughing this time. “Baba has been gone for a month.” RM has to think really hard again. “Maybe it was Bur.” Bur looks at RM, quite tired of this shit by now. “I didn’t test that device.” In the end, we found out RM missed this production bug, and when my manager finds out, his response is: “It doesn’t matter who’s fault it is, we just need to make sure to test it.” I stayed at work until 10ish that night. My drive home is an hour long. Needless to say, I was very much pissed. If people would just do their jobs, I wouldn’t have to wait around to figure out who to play the blame game with, and this blame game was very popular with RM and my manager.

Other stupid stuff my boss did: We once had a production bug and his most favorite employee was solely responsible for missing it and letting it get to production, and would have to test it alone because no one knew that part of the app as well as favorite employee. We used to have a four hour shift change on release days and I had already worked my full 8 hours by the time this problem was found. I wanted to go home cause I wasn’t going to get any credit for anything ever or any extra money for working overtime, cause this is “IT work”, and I was tired as hell and just wanted to sleep. The next day, my boss is pissed at me, because I didn’t stick around until 8 PM (I left at noon the day before), just to watch his favorite employee retest the crap they should have tested in the first place, and there was nothing I could have possibly done at that point, except stand around like an idiot and ask everyone useless questions, which is what RM had chosen to do with their time. My boss then makes an announcement during the meeting that everyone should be double checking each other’s work so that stuff like this doesn’t happen again. Why the hell should anyone be testing each other’s work? If someone needs to have their work checked, they should not be working anywhere until they learn to do their work correctly. Why should I sacrifice the little time I had to do my own testing to make sure favorite employee, who had no chance of getting fired, and probably got a huge raise every year, got their work done? No one was double checking my work.

In the end, I was offered a development position at this company, which was my dream. I hated, and still hate QA work because I would rather be a developer, but you gotta use your strengths and I’m a pretty damn good QA. My boss was not happy that I was offered a developer position, and didn’t want me to be one. Ever. He thought that his team was his only and any chance at success under someone else’s management was not fair because we were “his” people, like he owned us. He always called us “his” children, but never wanted to see us succeed or be promoted. No one ever moved up in QA, so being offered a developer position probably sent him into a panic. So when he found out, this is what he did:
Baba was going on vacation for a month, so the team needed to pick up Baba’s slack. Bur got to run the automation scripts (so, you just click a button, and the work is done). I got all of Baba’s work to do which was going to be DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE unless I stayed at least 5 hours late every night and worked weekends (on top of that, I had to brush up on C# in order to become a dev, so I’d also be giving up sleep at that point), until Baba returned. RM knew the product, and had nothing else to do because RM never did anything but watch other people do their work. I would literally only ever see RM standing behind people’s desks watching them test RM’s ticket. I was completely unfamiliar with this product and had been trying to automate it for a month, but had no idea what the hell I was doing. And damn RM gave me their work to do, cause this was the perfect time to ****ing slack off more. My boss saw nothing wrong with this, even after I confronted him, and was visibly upset about all this “fair” division of work. In return for my grievance, I was given a lecture about how “I had to believe in myself, and I could get this work done. And I had to take one for the team, and stay late, and work weekends.”

Then RM called a meeting with my manager. I see Baba and RM there, and thinking this is a team meeting, I thought Bur should be there too. But see, Bur and I were friends and Bur acknowledged that was an excellent worker and was taking on too much abuse, so of course Bur wasn’t at the meeting. Bur made it too obvious to my boss that they respected me as a person and was a good coworker. I always helped Bur out whenever they needed me, and Bur always tried to help me out when they could. Now, for a bit of background, our company was rewriting the entire mobile app at the time of this meeting, and if you’re a dev, you know that bugs will be missed, and it won’t be perfect the first time. Blah blah blah. Shit happens, you move on. And no complete documentation was done for any of the products. RM had asked for documentation about 3 times by the time I left, but was always too busy to review it, so I always assumed I had caught all the possible test cases.

Well, my manager, RM, and Baba came to the conclusion that all these bugs happening in production were not the fault of the app being completely redone. No. It was my COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS. #$@%$#@#$@##$@#@!!!
Like, what? I’m a quiet person by nature. This is how I was raised. I’m extremely non-confrontational and usually people like to use this against me, especially in a professional environment where you’re not allowed to be introverted, for some dumb reason, but I always made it a habit to let RM, Baba, my boss, and Bur know of any bugs I found in the system, and an email was always written up to everyone in the team. But this is not what they were talking about. They were talking about my testing and how I had missed test cases. This stupid documentation was floating around for two years and had been used by everyone that was rotated in and out of my team, and stupid RM never told me I missed some test cases. I was supposed to ask for them. Test cases only RM knew about because no one ever documented their shit in this company. I listen to these oozing, smelly, toxic people for a full hour, taking all the blame for everything with tears welling in my eyes because at this point in my life, I was so well-trained to think I was a complete POS worker because nothing I ever did was ever perfect.

I IM my friend at work and tell them what just happened, cause at this point, I’ve all but sobbed loudly at my desk. I pack up my desk, by this time, I had already decided to quit. My friend tells me to quit. Okay. I wait for 5:00. At this point in my career at that company, I had become suicidal. The thought of waking up another day to show up at that job was a curse and I prayed every morning to God and asked Him why the hell didn’t He just kill me already, because I honestly felt this useless and depressed. I had been brainwashed by my manager into thinking that this was it. This was the best I was going to do with my life, and I should just keep on keeping until I was old, or died.

I told my boss I was quitting at 5:00 that day. He pulls me into a room where there are no witness, where no one could hear me crying, and basically tells me that I shouldn’t quit because I have communication issues. All families are dysfunctional and I should just learn to deal with RM’s quirks, and work on improving myself because I could be so much better if I just learned to accept people the way they are, and just become more tolerant of my teammates. I was never going to find a job as good as this one. I was making a huge mistake.

Okay… I’ll stay. He made me repeat that several times before I was able to leave that room.

On my way home, I’m telling my friend what an utterly useless person I am. This friend had been listening to the conversation outside the door, and couldn’t believe I even thought about staying after listening to what went down.
I’m in a martial arts class, and we study philosophy. It’s part of our exam, and so I was writing an essay that night. Before I open my books to begin my paper, this friend of mine runs into my room, philosophy book open, and points to a line in the book. It says: “If at any point you say to yourself, ‘I am a useless person,’ then that is true defeat.”

With the help of my friend, I wrote my resignation. I politely explained to the manager that offered me the developer position that I was not going to be at the company any longer. I wrote to my boss that I would not be coming to the office for my last two weeks, that I would instead work from home.
My friend went to work the next day. My boss bragged to my friend’s boss that he had convinced me to stay with the company. My friend’s boss confided in my friend this information. My boss didn’t read his mail for… 3 hours. When he finally got around to it, my friend said he was in a panic. But nothing could be done.

My boss ignored me for my last two weeks. He’d send Bur to ask me for all the stuff he needed. My automation scripts, my documentation, my desk key to get tablets. Never once spoke to me directly. Two months after I quit, I found a job, and got higher pay at a location closer to my home.

How does NiceGirl come into all this? I still talk to her, and she tells me that from time to time, my old boss will walk up to her and let her know that he knows we're still talking. I'm unforgettable. :)"
6pldzm,6,2017-07-25,[Remorse] I'm not sure if anyone knows that I'm falling apart,fallingapartrn,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/6pldzm/remorse_im_not_sure_if_anyone_knows_that_im/,"From the surface, I look like a pretty high-functioning, successful person. Undergrad, at a good university on a full ride, moving into my own apartment soon, relatively good looking, and I'm very cheery and love talking to people. I get ready in the morning, not taking too much time but enough to look awake and decent despite lying in bed for hours at night being unable to sleep due to crippling fear of the future, subconsciously hyperventilating (that's a thing, I guess), or my repetition that I go through every night before I go to bed. Usually it's all three of these things. Yeah, I don't sleep very well. 

I'm sincerely, really, truly fucked up, though. Diagnosed officially with OCD two years ago, dealt with an eating disorder for three years (which was gone for awhile but it's baaaack), victim of physical/emotional child abuse for years, watched my mom almost get killed by my father, possibly *poisoned* by my father, you name it. I'm working in a really great lab on research that I'll publish, and I have professors vying for me to work with them. But earlier today, I had to make a hard decision and I felt like I screwed things up and my anxiety was so bad about terrible things happening that I A. Went to the bathroom to throw up (for nervous reasons and because hey, I don't need those calories), B. Took off my high heels and hit myself repeatedly until my legs were bruised, and C. Looked in the mirror and repeated to myself over and over again that I deserved to die and that I was an ugly, worthless, fat piece of shit. Because I deserved it. I put myself in situations that I could control, and I only end up in the situations I'm in because I'm really, truly that dumb. I'm an average weight (read: too fat and useless to control my diet enough to be underweight), an A and B student (read: not smart enough to get only As), and I've worked in numerous labs, internships, get recommendations, will be publishing, but I haven't done any of that *yet* despite having two more years until I graduate, so I'm a dumb, worthless piece of shit of a scientist. 

I've tried medication. I'm in therapy weekly. Nothing is working. I can't escape my mind, or the way I see things. I believe that comparing yourself to other people is the noblest thing you can do, since it means that you are working to better yourself. I believe that I need to eat ""pure"" foods and present myself a specific way and schedule and plan everything in my life and I need *certainty* in everything god damn thing I do. Am I tired? Of course, or I wouldn't have so many issues. But I can't bring myself to believe that my life is for myself, so it doesn't matter if I'm tired or unhappy or I want to die. I'm not here to gain pleasure. I'm here to make a positive difference in the lives of others. 

Sometimes I wish I was a beautiful machine. Rational, emotionless, smoothly functioning, and when something goes wrong, I could simply replace it, until it could no longer be done. I would be completely clean, I'd never gain weight, or even eat, and I'd be beautiful no matter what. But I'm not. I'm basically the opposite. I see myself as a big giant sack of fat and water and disgusting substances just barreling my way through life. I don't even see myself as human, honestly. 

And I don't even hold other people to these standards. I rave about how beautiful certain women are, even if they're overweight. I tell my friends that ""one C isn't the end of the world"" and that they're still intelligent and will do great things. Which they probably will. but I'm different. I'm so less than other people that I need to compensate in other ways, and I'm falling flat, and one day I will deflate, and all the blood and guts and fat will pour out and the whole world will notice.

6plxtt,2,2017-07-26,Can't find a job and it's making me severely depressed. I'm having trouble waking up every day.,Khayembii,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6plxtt/cant_find_a_job_and_its_making_me_severely/,"Just graduated from a top MBA program in May.  Last summer I didn't get an offer from a dream job at a summer internship, and a couple months after that my girlfriend of 5 1/2 years cheated on and dumped me.  She dated the guy while we lived together after that, too.  I had a friend die of leukemia over the summer as well, and my mom had a cancer scare (fine now, thank god).

I've been looking for a job for almost a year now.  I've withdrawn from most of my friends because my entire life is looking for jobs and sending out networking emails.  I have no life outside of this whatsoever.  It's every day.  Even the weekends are spent looking for job and researching connections.

The further I go, and the more I get rejected, the worse I feel.  Which makes it tougher to perform in interviews on the rare occasion I actually get one.  It's a vicious cycle and I literally am having trouble envisioning getting a full time job in my field, even at a small firm.

Lately I've started having anxiety attacks and my depression is getting worse.  I hate going to bed at night, because I hate waking up in the morning to have to face the world and my reality.  I'm sick of job searching because it feels hopeless.  I'm not suicidal but lately I've started having strong feelings that I wish I wasn't alive, because every morning when I wake up my own personal hell starts anew.

This is literally the lowest point in my life.  I have so much debt, and have good experience that nobody will even consider.  I've applied to dozens and dozens of jobs.  I've networked aggressively.  And still nothing.  It's such a mindfuck interviewing for both incredible firms that'd be my dream job, and small tiny firms that nobody's ever heard of that I have no interest in working for other than the fact that I need a job.  My self worth declines pretty much every day.  It gets harder to deal with every day.  I started drinking more often and eating comfort food because they make me feel better temporarily.  I can't help myself.

I can't afford a counselor until I get a job (what a joke).  I've tried going through everyone I know, alumni, the school, past coworkers, everything.  I'm not looking for job search advice.  I just need to vent, I guess.  I hate my life so much.  I feel both worthless and frustrated that nobody can see how my experience can translate into my being a great employee for them.  Just the fact that I didn't get an offer is a huge stain on my work history even though it wasn't my fault.

It just doesn't seem like there's any way out.  On top of all of this I have to move out of my home in a couple days because my lease is up and I can't renew it because who knows where I'll find a job.  My life has been a complete joke for a year.  I can't get myself to feel better."

6pm6zc,3,2017-07-26,"""The Drowned Man"" from 'Doorways to the Unseen: 6 Tales of Terror and Suspense' by James Dermond",JamesDermond,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/6pm6zc/the_drowned_man_from_doorways_to_the_unseen_6/,"“You made out with Joshua Barger? That is so gross. Please tell me you didn’t do that.” April sat in the front passenger seat, scrutinizing her friend Jessica as the two girls drove down a roadway devoid of other vehicles through densely forested areas on either side of them.

Jessica kept her eyes on the road as she steered, smiling slyly, arching her chin upward, and said, “He’s really cute once you get to know him. Not at all like what people have said about him. But it was only one time anyway. I wouldn’t say that it ‘counted.’” Jessica continued to smile—this time with a wide grin breaking out over her plush, full-lipped mouth—while April looked away from her and out the car window, watching the bright midday sun shine over the tops of the soaring coniferous pine trees as they sped past. They were now close to Jessica’s parents’ summer home, which the two would have all to themselves for several weeks.

Jessica’s black Labrador retriever, Marcus, sat up in the back seat from his nap and began to force his snout into April’s face, nuzzling and poking her as he panted. April pushed him away. “You should keep Marcus outside as long as it’s not raining. He hasn’t kept his nose off me since we started the drive this morning. My only reprieve was his nap time that must have just ended. Marcus!” April pushed Marcus away from her face again. Marcus began to whine and pant more intensely, as he knew they were nearing the trio’s destination; he then turned around and resumed his earlier prone position across the back seat.

Jessica held a paper-thin smile on her face but didn’t respond to April. She remarked to herself that April had always been oversensitive about nearly everything: school, boys, her parents, food, things that were “gross.” It was truly amazing that the girl had made it to eighteen intact. Jessica glanced over, observing April adjusting her glasses and then shifting around in the front passenger seat, unbuckling and then rebuckling her seat belt. Jessica and April’s friendship had begun in middle school and then continued on into their high school years. Even though they were an unlikely pair, the girls had remained close friends, one maturing and the other staying largely the same.

Jessica had competed on the varsity swim team at their high school and continued to swim in college, developing a lithe, athletic build due to all those years of continual exertion. April was the wallflower of the duo and was working toward a degree in English literature at their university, hoping to be a teacher upon graduation. Jessica possessed an almost classic beauty, with long, light brown hair that extended over her broad shoulders, and luminous blue eyes. April appeared remarkably similar in this respect, having hair and eye colors that almost matched Jessica’s, but in contrast she was frozen in a kind of permanent physical adolescence. She was very thin, and her body was nearly curveless, having grown in height during high school but otherwise appearing mostly undeveloped.

Jessica saw the unmarked entrance to the gravel road that intersected the two-lane highway and began to slow their vehicle to a crawl. Her parents’ summer home was at the end of a very long, winding path that was just wide enough for a single mid-sized truck and would accommodate no other traffic. After driving deliberately down the flinty road and then climbing the small hill near its low apex, Jessica stopped their car to unlock the waist-high rusted-iron gates blocking would-be intruders from parking on the property. Jessica then pulled the maroon compact car to a second stop by the toolshed in the unenclosed yard and shut off the engine.

As soon as Jessica opened one of the car’s back doors, Marcus bolted out and started racing in circles around the two girls, the moment for which he had been waiting all day. Bounding around the lawn in the back and in the front of the lakefront house, Marcus then sat down facing the house near the red cedar wooden dock that extended about ten feet from the sandy shore into the pristine lake. He became very quiet, his pent-up energy now somewhat spent. Marcus tilted his head and just stared at the vacant house, making no sound, his sudden stillness mirroring that of the lake’s waters.

“We’ve spent every summer at Lake Ultio for five years in a row, and it’s always tranquil.” Jessica stood next to the parked car and looked out over the circular lake’s sun-spattered surface with its clear, cerulean waters as the early afternoon sunlight reflected on it. “There are neighbors on the other side of the lake, but there are some thick woods between us and their cottages. We have so much privacy here that I hate to ever have to leave it.”

April, who was carrying two of her bags from the car trunk, asked, “If the neighbors want to visit, how do they stop by? Or don’t they ever come to see you and your family?”

Jessica reached into the tightly packed trunk of the car and grabbed a plastic cooler by the handles. “They have to take a rowboat from the other side and park it at our dock, but neighbors don’t really pay us many social calls—at least not as many as they did in past summers. Those cottages are rental units, so their summer residents are different almost every time. I can’t tell you who might be living over there this tourist season.”

Jessica continued to lug her cooler as she spoke to April. “I’ve only ever stayed here with my parents and brother, and we’ve never brought company. This is my first time flying solo. We used to rent one of the tiny cabins on the other side of the lake until we bought this house.”

Jessica walked toward the house’s cement side porch with the bulky cooler and placed it on the ground near the porch’s metal railings. The one-story ranch-style house was of simple design and construction, with white aluminum siding and a red shingled roof, but it was well maintained and could easily fit into any suburban neighborhood.

“I used to sleep in what will be your room this time around, with Marcus at the foot of the bed. He would wake me up with his whining and growling in the dead of night—I’d have to throw him outside just to get some rest. Marcus never seemed to like this place. He’s more of a water dog than a guard dog. If there is an intruder, we’ll probably have to fend for ourselves.”

Jessica sighed a bit at the thought of keeping Marcus in her room at night if they were hit with a bout of rainfall and he couldn’t be allowed to roam free. She scanned the somewhat overgrown front lawn leading to the dock for Marcus, before stepping inside through the house’s side door that abutted the porch. The dog had not budged at all and had made no attempt to enter with them, persisting at his spot by the dock, his sight locked on the house.


April sat down next to Jessica at the kitchen table after they had finished filling the refrigerator from the cooler and stocking the pantry shelves from a few cardboard boxes that had been taped shut for the trip. Jessica had been talking at length while they stowed away their supplies and continued with the story that she had begun while unpacking. “So Richard and I went to Times Square for New Year’s Eve. We saw a live show at Radio City Music Hall, and then we wanted to grab something to eat on the way back to the hotel. There was a Burger Mecca just a block from where we were staying, so we walked in and got in line to order dinner.

“Ahead of us was a customer arguing with the Burger Mecca employees who were behind the counter. He was waving his arms and shouting, demanding a refund for his meal but not getting anywhere with his request.

“With no warning at all—no one could have seen this coming, as the Burger Mecca workers hadn’t even raised their voices to the customer during all this—two of the female crew members jumped over the counter and just started wailing on him. I mean, they were punching and kicking, and he was just taking it.” Jessica hunched her shoulders and leaned in toward April from her chair, with a gleeful expression on her face.

“The man broke free from their assault, and they ran outside after him, pushed him to the ground, and there he was, getting his ass kicked in the snow.” Jessica smirked while remembering the beating. “We decided to order room service instead.”

“That’s a terrible story. You have a mean streak, Jess.”

Jessica smiled broadly. “I know. But you were always the good one, if not a little neurotic. A favorite of the holy sisters at St. Adjutor’s. I never had the disposition for pious observation.”

Jessica got up from her chair and said, “Time for me to hit the road. I’ll join you next week after I go white water rafting with my brother and his friends. Then we can spend the rest of the month here relaxing before our internship starts. You can catch up on some reading during your alone time, like you wanted to.”

April tried to seem pleasant. “Anna Karenina is tempting. I might be able to finish that in a week.”

April watched out the side door window as Jessica drove off with Marcus in the back seat, leaving her by herself in an unfamiliar house. It was late afternoon, so April decided there was enough daylight remaining to take a boat ride around the lake and see the other side with the rental cabins.

The latter part of the day had become windy, and April let the strong breeze wash over her while standing at the edge of the dock. She noticed a metal rowboat on cinder blocks placed next to a nearby tree, its inverted hull pointing up. The rowboat had been painted aquamarine and looked spacious enough for two or three occupants. April was able to find the oars in the shed behind the house and then returned to the shore, pushing the rowboat out into the water and stepping into the boat as it drifted past the dock.

She rowed fastidiously and made good time across the center of the lake and then coasted along the tree line near the opposite shore to rest from her endeavor. The boat glided by the rental cottages—six unadorned units, all within several yards of each other.

April saw a stout middle-aged man moving among the cottages. He was wearing a canvas teal fishing hat and carrying tin buckets that he then placed at the shore near the red cedar wooden dock shared by the cabins.

The man had been watching April’s boat askance as he laid down his burden. “Hello there, are you staying at the Snyder place across the way? The place has been empty since last summer.”

April sat up in her bench seat and responded, “Yes, but we’ll only be here for about a month. Do you know Jessica Snyder?”

The man shielded his eyes with a hand as he conversed with April. “Is that the daughter? I know that she stays with her parents each summer, but I’ve only talked to them, not her. Did know the previous owner, though.”

April’s boat came very close to the rental cabin dock and then halted its drift forward in the shallow water by the shore. The afternoon winds had died down and no longer disturbed the lake. The man continued speaking. “Name’s Bill Patterson, miss. You are…?”

“April. Jessica and I are friends from school.” April rested her hands across the boat’s oar handles as the two spoke.

“The last owner was a big-time lawyer from somewhere out west,” the man said. “Came up here for his vacations. I’ve been renting the same cabin here every year during perch season since there have been houses on the lake.”

Mr. Patterson took off his fishing hat and put one hand on his waist, holding the hat above his knee with the other hand. “Watched them build that house on the other side, the one that belongs to the Snyders now.” He gestured with the hat in his free hand in the direction of the solitary dwelling across the waters.

The orange glow of the day’s last rays before sunset began to shimmer over the aquatic-plant-filled shoal between Mr. Patterson and April, signaling the need to end their conversation and row back to the lake house. But April had become curious about the owner before Jessica’s family, so she continued. “Why did the first owner sell the house? Did he find somewhere else to take a break from his law practice or was it for some other reason? Just wondering.”

“No, ma’am, Mr. Tinsley is passed away. He drowned in this very lake.”

April was taken aback and now felt very uncomfortable returning to the unoccupied house by herself after hearing of the preceding owner’s fate. Why hadn’t Jessica mentioned this to her before she agreed to spend part of the summer at the house?

“I’m sorry to hear that. How did it happen? Wasn’t anyone around to help him if he was swimming in the lake?”

“I warned Charles about taking a dip at night—he had a weak heart—but he may have done it on purpose too. No one knows for sure. Happened five years ago this summer.” Mr. Patterson was noticeably upset but went on with his local anecdote.

“Don’t know why he would have gone swimming at night, but the sheriff’s deputies found his body on the lake floor, buried under layers of sediment. Lake Ultio is thick with freshwater plants, especially in the middle where it’s deepest. They had to drag the bottom and haul him up with chains around his hands and feet. I saw the whole thing happen and what the corpse looked like after it was recovered.

“The Snyders had just bought the place from Mr. Tinsley, and he was getting ready to move out permanently the next day. They were staying at a hotel in town when it happened.”

April looked away from Mr. Patterson and over the horizon, noting how little daylight was left. Even if the idea of being alone in a house with a checkered past didn’t appeal to her, she didn’t want to be out on the lake at night, either. “Jessica never mentioned any of this to me. She only said that her family has stayed at the house every summer, starting five years ago.”

“They did. They moved in for a while after the death was declared an accident. Then they came back the next summer as if nothing had happened.” Mr. Patterson replaced his fishing cap on his head and gave April a weary look.

“Good to meet you, Mr. Patterson, but I have to get back to the house. It’s been a long day.”

“Good to meet you too. I’ll be out fishing all day tomorrow.” Mr. Patterson extended his open right palm at April as a farewell and then stepped inside his unassuming abode for the evening.



April turned down the sheets on her bed and fluffed the pillows, flipping off the switch of the lamp on the nightstand as she lay at her side on the mattress. A dog-eared bookstore copy of Anna Karenina was close at hand next to the lamp, the evening’s reading that had helped April unwind and ease her nerves after the day’s disquieting revelation.

The dim radiance from the plastic night light plugged into a power outlet near the bed contrasted sharply with the total blackness that poured in from her bedroom window. A waning moon was barely visible over the peaks of the pine trees, and the kind of absolute lightless night only found in the deep countryside permeated the room, obscuring everything beyond the bedposts.

April drifted into a fitful sleep but after some time was able to find her first dream. She was out in the middle of the lake at night, sitting in the rowboat from her visit to Mr. Patterson. There was nothing discernible around her except the proximate murky lake waters and the perimeter of the boat, with all else being a yawning void. April looked down at her sandals and saw that brackish water had begun seeping into the boat from a hole in its floor. The boat was beginning to sink steadily.

While watching as the water filled the boat’s interior, April stood and then dove into the lake head first in proper swim form. April hit the water with a splash and then attempted to paddle forward into the nothingness, but her partially submerged body was held in place by an unseen force. It was as if she was being pulled down into the lake by invisible attendants, grasping at her clothes and holding her legs tightly as she was dragged downward into the tangled mass of underwater flora. April struggled and attempted to tread water, but the lake was able to engulf her, her head abruptly disappearing beneath its surface.

She had inhaled and taken an emergency breath before she went under, but April’s supply of oxygen was soon exhausted. She was hyperventilating and convulsing as her lungs filled with lake water, her nostrils burning from the unwanted intrusion.

April’s vision grew dim as she ceased fighting, and she involuntarily choked up on the fouled water, but she was still able to make out a figure that was under the lake’s waves with her, floating above her close to the surface…

April lurched forward in bed and gasped for air. She leaned onto her knees and consciously breathed until her breath had become somewhat even and normal again. Even so, she was inundated with a feeling of overwhelming sadness and loss that seemed to derive from nowhere. The nightmare had been so vivid; she had never dreamed of death by drowning before tonight.

A man stood at the foot of her bed and stared at April, bloated and saturated with lake water. He had clearly been underwater for some time, as he had aquatic plant debris in his dripping wet, matted hair, and his saucer-like eyes bulged horrifically. The man stood silently and said nothing, not making any motion at all but continued to gaze at April as she sat covered by her blanket.

Not sure if what she was seeing was more of the drowning nightmare, April crept out from under her blanket and onto the bedroom floor, reaching into the nightstand drawer for the crucifix that had been left by Jessica’s mother. She knelt at the side of the bed and said the first Our Father, periodically glancing at the unmoving phantom.

“Our Father, Who is in heaven,
Holy is Your Name;
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our sins,
as we forgive those who sin against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.”

April continued praying a second Our Father followed by a third and then a fourth. The fourth Our Father provoked a reaction in the drowned man, as he took one step back from the foot of the bed and also become less defined, melding into the bedroom’s outer darkness.

April watched him as she recited the next prayer, pressing the top of the crucifix to her chin. The specter retreated from her bed yet again as she prayed, and she could now see that the man’s distended hands folded in front of him at his waist were chained together at the wrists.

April lowered her head and continued to pray, observing that each subsequent prayer would cause the apparition to step farther back and become increasingly faint. The Our Fathers continued until April could no longer see the dreadful figure in her bedroom. This was definitely no longer a nightmare, as April was sure that she was wide awake and could sense her heart thumping at breakneck speed as she uttered the words to the final prayer.

Barefoot and wearing only the soccer shorts and plain white T-shirt in which she had slept, she stumbled past the foot of the bed and dashed outside through the front door of the house. Breathing hard, April was about to flee down the path to the highway when she heard Jessica’s voice call out for help. “Someone…I can’t make it! I’m going under!”

She looked out over the lake shrouded in the nighttime sky and could see Jessica in the distance, flailing and attempting to keep her head above water. A slight man of about forty years old with horn-rimmed glasses suddenly ran up to April’s side, oblivious to her presence, even though she was only a few feet away from him.

The man called out to Jessica, “What are you doing? Swim to the dock, and I will pull you to shore!”

“I can’t. My leg is cramping, and I’m sinking. Get the sheriff…please!”

“We don’t have time. I will swim out to you.”

The man turned around and ran toward the shed. As he moved, April could see that he was almost translucent. He then passed April again, holding a flotation vest. The man removed his sweatshirt and waded into the dark waters of the lake.

He swam clumsily toward Jessica, the life vest strung around his neck, but she was far from the shore, and his progress was slow. The man paused his strokes to breathe and then asked while he treaded water, “Why are you out here?”

“I’m a star swimmer…thought I would be fine…but I can’t move my leg. Hurry!”

The man resumed his efforts and reached Jessica, passing her the flotation vest. Jessica donned the vest and began to push herself through the water with her arms, back to land. The man did not move as she swam away but instead began to struggle to stay above the shallow waves washing over him.

He called out to her, “I’m having an attack. Jessica, come back for me! I can’t make it without you.” Jessica stopped and floated in place for a moment, facing the man.

Without a word, Jessica turned around and continued to swim back to the shore, overcome by her fear of drowning in the lake. As Jessica came within reach of the shoreline, the man’s head went under the lake’s waters once and then resurfaced, gasping for air, and then went under for a final time, sinking out of view entirely.

The vision ended as the early morning sun rose over the lake’s tree line, bathing April in the light of dawn. She staggered back inside the house and collapsed on the living room couch, losing consciousness instantly.


“Did anything exciting happen while I was gone? Any of the local boys come looking for me, I hope?”

April met Jessica at the side door after watching her park her car near the shed as she had done before. Jessica was tanned from her outdoor excursion with her brother and seemed to be in high spirits.

“Jess, let’s just go home. We can relax there—catch some movies, go shopping. It will be fun.” April almost wanted to reveal her ordeal to Jessica but knew that she would be seen as delusional. Who could believe such a thing?

Jessica was adamant. “No, no way! We are staying put. I haven’t had any quiet time since last summer, and I want to be rested for our internship. My parents and your parents are at home, remember?”

April smiled weakly. She vowed that she would never set foot in the lake house again after this summer.

“Where’s Marcus?”

April looked behind Jessica for the rambunctious canine and then outside past the open door, but he was nowhere to be seen.

“I left him with my brother. We’ll be fine. Marcus is sort of a pain, remember?”

“The house will be quiet without that dog. I’m going to get back to my novel if you have everything unpacked.”

“Suit yourself. I’m going for a swim. Be back in a few.”

Jessica walked past April with a carrying case and then minutes later came back out into the living room in a one-piece bathing suit. She was headed out of the front door for the sunny waters of the lake, a perfect day for a swim.

April looked around the corner into the hall that ran in front of the house’s three bedrooms and the single bathroom. “Hey, why did you put your bag in my room? You can have a whole bed to yourself, you know.”

Jessica stopped at the threshold of the front door and turned around to answer April. “I’m going to stay in your room instead, which is actually my room, anyway. I like the view of the lake better. You only have one bag, so just move it to one of the other bedrooms.”

Jessica arched one eyebrow as she continued, “But what’s with the crucifix above my bed? That’s my mom’s. Are you entering a convent? You just need a date, girlie, that’s all.”

April walked toward Jessica and furrowed her brow above her clunky glasses. “I feel safer with it over the bed. It’s really a beautiful, hand-carved piece too. Leave it up, please, Jess.”

“I was worried for a minute that you had swallowed all that hocus pocus. I’ll leave it up…I promise.”

Jessica stepped inside the front door several hours later with a towel wrapped around her waist.

“I’m going to change, and then we can play a board game. I know which one is your favorite,” Jessica said, grinning. “The Monopoly box is in the linen closet, on the top shelf.”

Jessica and April put the game box away after sundown and decided to go to sleep early. Jessica looked out of the large front picturesque window from the kitchen at the calm waters, which were barely touched by the faint moonlight.

“April, there is something I didn’t tell you about this place…this house that we bought five years ago.”

April was yawning but then became expectant, hoping to hear a confession from Jessica. “Yes? Is it important? I’m really tired and just want to get some sleep.”

Jessica sighed and then gave her friend a genuine smile. “All right, I will tell you in the morning. Nighty, night. Don’t let the bedbugs bite.”

April moved her bag with her clothing and toiletries from Jessica’s room and closed the door to the bedroom farthest down the hallway as she retired for the night. Jessica sat at the side edge of her bed with only the nightstand lamplight illuminating the open drawer in front of her. She stared at the crucifix she was holding in both hands, running a finger over its depiction of the Christ figure. Jessica put the crucifix in the back of the nightstand drawer and closed it, shutting off the lamplight. She decided that she would tell April about Charles Tinsley first thing the next morning.



April woke to a still house. She rolled over in bed and peeked at the clock on the nightstand. The digital display said 9:27 a.m. Jessica had not knocked on her bedroom door yet for breakfast, so April went into the kitchen and poured a bowl of cereal and milk.

“Jess? Come and get some breakfast. It will be lunch soon if you don’t get up. Really. Jess?”

April went down the hallway from the kitchen and knocked on Jessica’s bedroom door. No answer. She knocked again. “Jess? I’m coming in. I hope you are decent.”

The shag carpet was drenched, and April’s bare feet sank into the soaked fibers with her first steps into the bedroom. Jessica’s body was sprawled over her mattress, the sightless eyes and slack mouth of her pallid, distorted face gaping up at the bedroom ceiling. Lake water ran in rivulets from her icy corpse over the bed sheets, dripping onto the floor around the bed that was littered with dead lake plants.

April gagged from the overpowering fetid smell of the drowned that permeated the room and wafted over her. She covered her mouth as she began to reflexively vomit, running from the bedroom tomb to escape its stench and the ghastly sight that lay on the bed before her. As she fled, April was able to glimpse that Jessica’s right hand was clutching the nightstand crucifix"

Now I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing or how to get a job in my field that has less than 80-100 hours a week. I went on my first date with a very pretty girl, but idk, I fucked it up. I tried to be myself, but polite and funny and relaxed. I thought I gave it a real good shot, I thought she had fun. She ghosted me afterwards. I'm 23, I've never had a girlfriend. No girl has ever wanted me. My dad, step dad, never wanted me. It seems like all my friends are getting tired of me. Most have moved away, but I've been trying to do stuff with old friends who are still in town, but it seems like they're too busy. Seems like they just tolerate me. No job, no gf, live at home with mom. Ever since I came back home from the internship, it reminds me of when I was a kid and in the hospital for months and only got a few visitors. Seems like this loneliness and isolation is a defining trait of my life.

---In college I was smart and did a lot of extra curricular, it helped me have self-esteem. That whole identity as a good, involved student is gone. I go to the gym now, I want to look good in case I do meet a girl. But I don't know where I'd meet a girl who would like me. There was another reddit thread that had some cutting, clever quip about retail workers who are battling their depression but without medication or therapy and it really hit home. I scheduled an appointment for a counselor, but idk. My life fell apart, I'm isolated and sad. I hate myself sometimes, but a lot of the time I wonder what's so wrong with me that nobody wants me. I feel ok about myself for the most part, that I'm funny enough, or smart enough, or handsome enough. But if nobody else thinks that, maybe I'm the one who's wrong. When it seems like everyone else hates you, or at the very least wants nothing to do with you, it's hard to keep believing that you're an okay guy."

I've recently been accepted a year-long program which I find is a tremendous opportunity, but not really sure if it'll be helpful for my path to medicine.


6 months of the program is based in Korea, the next 6 is in DC. While in Korea, I will be studying Eastern and Western history/politics/philosophy/literature. After that, I'll be in DC as an intern. The organizations that I'll have a chance to apply to are well-known organizations that are mostly NGO/NPO/Thinktanks that are concerned with human rights/international politics/etc. I've been told (depending on my performance) that I'll be able to participate in their research and/or have a chance to submit my own pieces to various journals. 


All costs for the year are covered by the institute(so kind of like a scholarship?), and the institute is founded and run by Hyundai (top 4 company in Korea). I feel like this is a tremendous opportunity as a Canadian-Korean to experience, but at the same time I'm not sure if losing a year is worth it, if it will not help towards med school.



Please any advice would be great! Thanks!"

6pmzk1,3,2017-07-26,I (M22) am uncomfortable with the relationship between my girlfriend (F 22) and her mentor (M~35),ZestyQ,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pmzk1/i_m22_am_uncomfortable_with_the_relationship/,"Sorry for any formatting issues, I’m posting from mobile. 

A few short weeks ago, one of my long time best friends and I started dating. We had been in and out of each others lives a couple times, and have had feelings for another for the past couple years. We are now getting to know each other better than ever and I’m looking forward to becoming a bigger part of her life and letting her more into mine. 

On the night we decided to label ourselves “boyfriend / girlfriend”, we discussed what being in a relationship meant to us. We discussed goals, expectations, priorities, and we talked about where our previous relationships fell short. 

I’ve never started off a relationship on a stronger foot, and, to be frank, I’ve never had that initial conversation in any previous relationship at all. 

We’ve been on several dates since that night, each going much longer than planned and each filled with laughter and intimate moments. 

Now, for the negative. The relationship she has with her (10 years married) mentor “John” makes me extremely uncomfortable. He now acts as a mentor in her professional, personal, and spiritual life. I may be a typical over-protective boyfriend (let me know your opinion in the comments), but I feel he is way too involved in her life, and vis versa. 

Small backstory: John (not his real name) is my girlfriend’s boss’s boss. John and my SO met a few years ago at a church camp. After the camp was over, he offered her an internship that led to her current job at a group home. She will soon be promoted and managing a new home, so she’s been tagging along with John to meetings lately. 

I take comfort in the fact that John is married, and that my girlfriend is friends with his wife and their kids (she’s even babysat when John and his wife are out of town). However, my girlfriend has told me that she not only knows the details of John and his wife’s sex life, but she has even acted as a peacemaker when they are having marital problems. The three of them are in a group text that is often used for John to remind them of a work-related project and the wife to reply passive-aggressively. 

Over time (when my now SO and I weren’t as close), John and his wife have become the people my girlfriend goes to when she has drama or issues in her personal life. John’s opinion specifically carries a lot of weight, to the point where it concerns me. He recently convinced her to attend a venue she has very strong personal convictions against (day-long sea world event for work that she was excused from) by telling her she’s “not part of the family” and “setting a bad example for the kids” if she doesn’t go. 

Currently, my girlfriend is out of state for work for a few days. Due to her being the only woman employed at the group home, instead of staying with the other male workers and the boys, she is staying with John, his wife, and their kids at the nearby beach house he rented. She has told me that John plans to re-baptize her tomorrow. Shortly after, she told me that she doesn’t think baptism is even necessary (I agree), but that’s a separate discussion. 

Tonight, John, his wife, and my SO were all drinking at the beach house. My girlfriend messaged me and we had a conversation that didn’t make much sense, but concerned me. 

SO: “John and I just had a really emotional heart to heart and I’m taking on all of his emotions and stress and worry” 
Me: ”Don’t do that! That’s not your cross to bear babe. (wife) is there to support him, right?”
SO: “I can’t help it. Of course (wife) is there but it’s just fresh right now and how I am as a person I guess” 
Me: “Yikes. I hope everything is okay. Is there anything going on I can help you with?”
SO: “That’s not your job, but I appreciate you asking”

I left the conversation at that.  I figured we can talk about this specifically in the morning (this happened around 1am) or when she gets back in town the following day. Not over text though, because I want to make sure we can talk in a way where she knows I am approaching this from of a place of concern. I am not at all comfortable with their relationship and I want to communicate this with her without sounding frustrated or jealous. 

I am typically able to talk about things that bother me and express things in a healthy, conversational way. This mentor relationship though, I can’t figure out how to approach it without coming off as overbearing or controlling. 

Any ideas what I can do? I want to talk with her when she’s back in town and not let it fester. 

Also, if this matters. Before I was as uncomfortable with John as I am now, I scheduled coffee with him because I wanted to get to know him better. We’re meeting in about a week. Should I mention anything to him?


**tl;dr I started dating one of my best friends, she is much closer to her (married) male mentor than I am comfortable with and he seems to be emotionally manipulative. How do I approach this with her? With him?**"
6pnsek,0,2017-07-26,I feel no guilt stealing from self service checkouts because I see it as revenge for stealing jobs from young people in the community.,fucksupermarketgreed,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6pnsek/i_feel_no_guilt_stealing_from_self_service/,"20 years ago, the major supermarket chains in my country used to have 10-12 checkouts open at your supermarkets and manned by an operator, giving a job to several people. I was one of them when an undergraduate student. The job gave me the opportunity to save for an exchange semester/some prestigious Model UN conferences. I was able to use my supervisor as a reference when applying for internships and scholarships. Sure, it was just a supermarket checkout job, but it was invaluable to have someone be able to vouch for my reliability/work ethic/teamwork skills. 

Now every time I go into one of these supermarkets, I see 1 open checkout and 1 person supervising the self service area. I'm no longer a student, but I now actually work in academia and teach undergraduate students. They are finding it more difficult to get jobs, because much of the retail sector (one which hires a lot of students) have decided to get machines to do the job instead. I now have a 8 year old and a 2 year old who won't be able to use supermarket/department store check out jobs as a foot in the door to the working world when their time comes, because companies would rather put in machines instead of creating jobs. 

Fuck you.

So every time I use these checkouts, I'll help myself to some shit, and I won't feel a trace of guilt because you are robbing the community of jobs to boost your own profits. I'm smarter than doing things like putting everything through as carrots, but I'll innocently not realise that my premium apples are not the cheap ones I'm putting them though as, or 'forgetting' the item or two I put on the hood of my daughter's pram that I then put my coat on top of or the crate of water bottles at the bottom of the trolley or whatever. 

I have a very good paying job and don't have to do this, but I loathe the way you now make you customers do the job themselves and ring up and bag their own items while not passing on any of the savings you make by reducing your wage bill, and I loathe the way you want the police to come and help reduce theft in your stores, a problem caused by your own greed when you removed the human element of your business. The police force is already overstretched as it is. They ought to be out serving the community and attending to more important matters than protecting the profits of companies worth tens of billions of dollars. 

Fuck you.

If you want to cut back on staff and choose a higher profit margin instead of providing jobs to young members of the community, you will reap what you sow. People are sick of your greed and loathe your machines and will stick it to you....and we don't feel bad. Fuck you."

How life can throw you a curve ball,Zyphlan,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/6podfw/nftrue_story_foreigner_living_in_china_how_life/,"Well this is just an intro and was wondering what people think.

Seeing it takes me back to the last 2 years i wanna see if its enjoyed before i decide to go dig in those wounds :). Any tips or comments are appreciated

------------------------------

20 March 2017. 8 o clock in the evening and Beijing is covered as usual under a blanket of smog. The sun throughout the day has tried to penetrate the smog and give a gleam of hope to the 20 million people living on this little piece of earth. Spring is in the air and the coats go off and are replaced by people eating outside on the street wearing summer clothes. The view from my apartment is of a Chinese apartment building built at the time when Mao was still the ruling force and it’s crumbling slowly perhaps it couldn’t be a more befitting sight. Once a start of something new the years have broken it down piece by piece and it’s now suitable as scrap metal.  .A sweat droplet runs over my forehead and flows over to tears running over my cheeks. How did I arrive at this station and why am i on the edge of my 11th floor apartment ready to trade in the short for the eternal. Some people call it a combination of circumstances and others call it a list of wrong choices but I would like to see it as a parachute jump in which I left the parachute behind in the aircraft. Predestined for success and ending in the deep. My name is Jack and this is a story of how life can throw you a curve ball. 

24december 2015

Christmas night is the night children excitedly look forward too. The cold night in which people come together. The night in which dreams come true or perhaps turn into nightmares. Raised in a loving family with a father and mother who have been happily married for 30 years Jack decided in 2012 after an internship to find work in China. In China are the opportunities for people who are willing to take risks and graduated from the university of Amsterdam in Marketing and sales and an exquisite sense for business, china is an excellent opportunity for a young and intelligent Dutch male. To cover the basic costs of living Jack decided to accept an easy job as an English teacher. He visits the gym 5 times a week to keep the muscles on a level where women and men are so easily distracted by them and to silence the voice in the back of his head which keeps repeating the same lines over and over for 14 years now. Working on a project to find 200 teachers which would give the profit required to start up a company Jack has the key to success at the tip of his finger. The final pieces of the puzzle fell in place in the negotiations during the day and all that was left was to sign the contract which would earn him 1.000.000RMB in a matter of weeks. What could possibly go wrong?

Which three pillars in live the so called bastions of fortitude do people put most meaning and value towards? To go forward in life people use these pillars to build their house and their sanity.   Friendship, Career and probably the most important thing a soul mate. 
On the 24 of December Jack had all three of these in his pocket and was able to live in bliss of happiness. 

Meet Jared a 38 year old Canadian male, blonde hair and muscled for his age good looking but timid in his behavior often not knowing what to say on the moment before carefully thinking through what reaction he might get.  Jared graduated with a PHD in history and was desperately looking for a job as a professor in Canada but unfortunately being a straight white male doesn’t help in the application process in a country which is trying its very best in being political correct. Seeing getting the PHD was a very costly enterprise Jared decided to teach English in China considering the costs of living would help him pay off his student debts.  


Michael was the youngest of the group and with the age of 21 jared had the age to be his dad. Michael might have chosen China as an escape route from the daily routine in America. Blonde hair with blue eyes and the looks of a model helped him not only in America but also in China. Scoring at the top 1% of the SAT in America should have given him a chance to be able to attend an Ivy League university. Unfortunately like most in America if you don’t have the parents who can back you up financially the gates to heaven stay closed and china becomes the entrance to another life. Although Michael was young he and Jack had a connection from day 1 and a beer turned into a friendship for life. 

Taana the illustrious girlfriend. An Angel in bed and cute as a Nightingale.  24 year olds and Born in Russia (Yakutsk) she emigrated to China at the age of 18 and walked into jack in a bar and for jack it was love at first sight. And after 3-4 dates they decided to start a relationship. She was Jacks first real love. 

But as with many stories and realities dreams are dreams for a reason.

2 o'clock in the night and after consuming a drink and some snack at the corporate Christmas party. Jack decides it’s time to go home and close his eyes so he’s fresh for the Christmas dinner he organized with friends and his lovely girlfriend.  Stepping on his electric scooter he suddenly realizes it only has 5% power left and that it will take some time to drive home seeing the scooter will not go faster than 15kmph. Beijing shows its cold face and with a temperature of -10 and snowfall last week. It might actually be a blessing the scooter can only go 15kmh. 

During his drive Jack contemplates over his girlfriend. She is his treasure and he loves her with all his heart but she keeps demanding more and more. Where it was first meeting each other during the weekend it very quickly became 5 times a week and maybe this is going too fast for a stable and loving relationship.  The daily weed and computer gaming too relax and too keep the voice in the back of his mind at bay have worked for 14 years and Taana hates his drug use and his gaming and leaves no chance to tell him. She is slowly helping the voice in the back of Jacks head to become louder.  Jack takes a deep breath and thinks about this while driving home and takes a turn left to get to his home and then ………….

Jack opens his eyes and it feels like somebody has hit him with a hammer. The world is spinning and the urge to throw up is constantly there. What has happened i can’t even stand up? What happened and how did I end up where I am.  What is the Chinese security guard doing here looking at me so weird wasn’t I driving home? Why won’t my brain work? Even though I don’t speak Chinese I got to find a way to communicate with them. WORK BRAIN WORK and in a moment of serenity his brain reminds him his address is on his phone. And before the abyss takes Jack back into the dark he shows his address to the security guards. Slowly my eyes open and I am stuck between 2 Chinese security guards sitting next to me who make sure I can’t fall over and back to the abyss I go.

6podx4,11,2017-07-26,The Drowned Man,JamesDermond,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/6podx4/the_drowned_man/,"“You made out with Joshua Barger? That is so gross. Please tell me you didn’t do that.” April sat in the front passenger seat, scrutinizing her friend Jessica as the two girls drove down a roadway devoid of other vehicles through densely forested areas on either side of them.

Jessica kept her eyes on the road as she steered, smiling slyly, arching her chin upward, and said, “He’s really cute once you get to know him. Not at all like what people have said about him. But it was only one time anyway. I wouldn’t say that it ‘counted.’” Jessica continued to smile—this time with a wide grin breaking out over her plush, full-lipped mouth—while April looked away from her and out the car window, watching the bright midday sun shine over the tops of the soaring coniferous pine trees as they sped past. They were now close to Jessica’s parents’ summer home, which the two would have all to themselves for several weeks.

Jessica’s black Labrador retriever, Marcus, sat up in the back seat from his nap and began to force his snout into April’s face, nuzzling and poking her as he panted. April pushed him away. “You should keep Marcus outside as long as it’s not raining. He hasn’t kept his nose off me since we started the drive this morning. My only reprieve was his nap time that must have just ended. Marcus!” April pushed Marcus away from her face again. Marcus began to whine and pant more intensely, as he knew they were nearing the trio’s destination; he then turned around and resumed his earlier prone position across the back seat.

Jessica held a paper-thin smile on her face but didn’t respond to April. She remarked to herself that April had always been oversensitive about nearly everything: school, boys, her parents, food, things that were “gross.” It was truly amazing that the girl had made it to eighteen intact. Jessica glanced over, observing April adjusting her glasses and then shifting around in the front passenger seat, unbuckling and then rebuckling her seat belt. Jessica and April’s friendship had begun in middle school and then continued on into their high school years. Even though they were an unlikely pair, the girls had remained close friends, one maturing and the other staying largely the same.

Jessica had competed on the varsity swim team at their high school and continued to swim in college, developing a lithe, athletic build due to all those years of continual exertion. April was the wallflower of the duo and was working toward a degree in English literature at their university, hoping to be a teacher upon graduation. Jessica possessed an almost classic beauty, with long, light brown hair that extended over her broad shoulders, and luminous blue eyes. April appeared remarkably similar in this respect, having hair and eye colors that almost matched Jessica’s, but in contrast she was frozen in a kind of permanent physical adolescence. She was very thin, and her body was nearly curveless, having grown in height during high school but otherwise appearing mostly undeveloped.

Jessica saw the unmarked entrance to the gravel road that intersected the two-lane highway and began to slow their vehicle to a crawl. Her parents’ summer home was at the end of a very long, winding path that was just wide enough for a single mid-sized truck and would accommodate no other traffic. After driving deliberately down the flinty road and then climbing the small hill near its low apex, Jessica stopped their car to unlock the waist-high rusted-iron gates blocking would-be intruders from parking on the property. Jessica then pulled the maroon compact car to a second stop by the toolshed in the unenclosed yard and shut off the engine.

As soon as Jessica opened one of the car’s back doors, Marcus bolted out and started racing in circles around the two girls, the moment for which he had been waiting all day. Bounding around the lawn in the back and in the front of the lakefront house, Marcus then sat down facing the house near the red cedar wooden dock that extended about ten feet from the sandy shore into the pristine lake. He became very quiet, his pent-up energy now somewhat spent. Marcus tilted his head and just stared at the vacant house, making no sound, his sudden stillness mirroring that of the lake’s waters.

“We’ve spent every summer at Lake Ultio for five years in a row, and it’s always tranquil.” Jessica stood next to the parked car and looked out over the circular lake’s sun-spattered surface with its clear, cerulean waters as the early afternoon sunlight reflected on it. “There are neighbors on the other side of the lake, but there are some thick woods between us and their cottages. We have so much privacy here that I hate to ever have to leave it.”

April, who was carrying two of her bags from the car trunk, asked, “If the neighbors want to visit, how do they stop by? Or don’t they ever come to see you and your family?”

Jessica reached into the tightly packed trunk of the car and grabbed a plastic cooler by the handles. “They have to take a rowboat from the other side and park it at our dock, but neighbors don’t really pay us many social calls—at least not as many as they did in past summers. Those cottages are rental units, so their summer residents are different almost every time. I can’t tell you who might be living over there this tourist season.”

Jessica continued to lug her cooler as she spoke to April. “I’ve only ever stayed here with my parents and brother, and we’ve never brought company. This is my first time flying solo. We used to rent one of the tiny cabins on the other side of the lake until we bought this house.”

Jessica walked toward the house’s cement side porch with the bulky cooler and placed it on the ground near the porch’s metal railings. The one-story ranch-style house was of simple design and construction, with white aluminum siding and a red shingled roof, but it was well maintained and could easily fit into any suburban neighborhood.

“I used to sleep in what will be your room this time around, with Marcus at the foot of the bed. He would wake me up with his whining and growling in the dead of night—I’d have to throw him outside just to get some rest. Marcus never seemed to like this place. He’s more of a water dog than a guard dog. If there is an intruder, we’ll probably have to fend for ourselves.”

Jessica sighed a bit at the thought of keeping Marcus in her room at night if they were hit with a bout of rainfall and he couldn’t be allowed to roam free. She scanned the somewhat overgrown front lawn leading to the dock for Marcus, before stepping inside through the house’s side door that abutted the porch. The dog had not budged at all and had made no attempt to enter with them, persisting at his spot by the dock, his sight locked on the house.


April sat down next to Jessica at the kitchen table after they had finished filling the refrigerator from the cooler and stocking the pantry shelves from a few cardboard boxes that had been taped shut for the trip. Jessica had been talking at length while they stowed away their supplies and continued with the story that she had begun while unpacking. “So Richard and I went to Times Square for New Year’s Eve. We saw a live show at Radio City Music Hall, and then we wanted to grab something to eat on the way back to the hotel. There was a Burger Mecca just a block from where we were staying, so we walked in and got in line to order dinner.

“Ahead of us was a customer arguing with the Burger Mecca employees who were behind the counter. He was waving his arms and shouting, demanding a refund for his meal but not getting anywhere with his request.

“With no warning at all—no one could have seen this coming, as the Burger Mecca workers hadn’t even raised their voices to the customer during all this—two of the female crew members jumped over the counter and just started wailing on him. I mean, they were punching and kicking, and he was just taking it.” Jessica hunched her shoulders and leaned in toward April from her chair, with a gleeful expression on her face.

“The man broke free from their assault, and they ran outside after him, pushed him to the ground, and there he was, getting his ass kicked in the snow.” Jessica smirked while remembering the beating. “We decided to order room service instead.”

“That’s a terrible story. You have a mean streak, Jess.”

Jessica smiled broadly. “I know. But you were always the good one, if not a little neurotic. A favorite of the holy sisters at St. Adjutor’s. I never had the disposition for pious observation.”

Jessica got up from her chair and said, “Time for me to hit the road. I’ll join you next week after I go white water rafting with my brother and his friends. Then we can spend the rest of the month here relaxing before our internship starts. You can catch up on some reading during your alone time, like you wanted to.”

April tried to seem pleasant. “Anna Karenina is tempting. I might be able to finish that in a week.”

April watched out the side door window as Jessica drove off with Marcus in the back seat, leaving her by herself in an unfamiliar house. It was late afternoon, so April decided there was enough daylight remaining to take a boat ride around the lake and see the other side with the rental cabins.

The latter part of the day had become windy, and April let the strong breeze wash over her while standing at the edge of the dock. She noticed a metal rowboat on cinder blocks placed next to a nearby tree, its inverted hull pointing up. The rowboat had been painted aquamarine and looked spacious enough for two or three occupants. April was able to find the oars in the shed behind the house and then returned to the shore, pushing the rowboat out into the water and stepping into the boat as it drifted past the dock.

She rowed fastidiously and made good time across the center of the lake and then coasted along the tree line near the opposite shore to rest from her endeavor. The boat glided by the rental cottages—six unadorned units, all within several yards of each other.

April saw a stout middle-aged man moving among the cottages. He was wearing a canvas teal fishing hat and carrying tin buckets that he then placed at the shore near the red cedar wooden dock shared by the cabins.

The man had been watching April’s boat askance as he laid down his burden. “Hello there, are you staying at the Snyder place across the way? The place has been empty since last summer.”

April sat up in her bench seat and responded, “Yes, but we’ll only be here for about a month. Do you know Jessica Snyder?”

The man shielded his eyes with a hand as he conversed with April. “Is that the daughter? I know that she stays with her parents each summer, but I’ve only talked to them, not her. Did know the previous owner, though.”

April’s boat came very close to the rental cabin dock and then halted its drift forward in the shallow water by the shore. The afternoon winds had died down and no longer disturbed the lake. The man continued speaking. “Name’s Bill Patterson, miss. You are…?”

“April. Jessica and I are friends from school.” April rested her hands across the boat’s oar handles as the two spoke.

“The last owner was a big-time lawyer from somewhere out west,” the man said. “Came up here for his vacations. I’ve been renting the same cabin here every year during perch season since there have been houses on the lake.”

Mr. Patterson took off his fishing hat and put one hand on his waist, holding the hat above his knee with the other hand. “Watched them build that house on the other side, the one that belongs to the Snyders now.” He gestured with the hat in his free hand in the direction of the solitary dwelling across the waters.

The orange glow of the day’s last rays before sunset began to shimmer over the aquatic-plant-filled shoal between Mr. Patterson and April, signaling the need to end their conversation and row back to the lake house. But April had become curious about the owner before Jessica’s family, so she continued. “Why did the first owner sell the house? Did he find somewhere else to take a break from his law practice or was it for some other reason? Just wondering.”

“No, ma’am, Mr. Tinsley is passed away. He drowned in this very lake.”

April was taken aback and now felt very uncomfortable returning to the unoccupied house by herself after hearing of the preceding owner’s fate. Why hadn’t Jessica mentioned this to her before she agreed to spend part of the summer at the house?

“I’m sorry to hear that. How did it happen? Wasn’t anyone around to help him if he was swimming in the lake?”

“I warned Charles about taking a dip at night—he had a weak heart—but he may have done it on purpose too. No one knows for sure. Happened five years ago this summer.” Mr. Patterson was noticeably upset but went on with his local anecdote.

“Don’t know why he would have gone swimming at night, but the sheriff’s deputies found his body on the lake floor, buried under layers of sediment. Lake Ultio is thick with freshwater plants, especially in the middle where it’s deepest. They had to drag the bottom and haul him up with chains around his hands and feet. I saw the whole thing happen and what the corpse looked like after it was recovered.

“The Snyders had just bought the place from Mr. Tinsley, and he was getting ready to move out permanently the next day. They were staying at a hotel in town when it happened.”

April looked away from Mr. Patterson and over the horizon, noting how little daylight was left. Even if the idea of being alone in a house with a checkered past didn’t appeal to her, she didn’t want to be out on the lake at night, either. “Jessica never mentioned any of this to me. She only said that her family has stayed at the house every summer, starting five years ago.”

“They did. They moved in for a while after the death was declared an accident. Then they came back the next summer as if nothing had happened.” Mr. Patterson replaced his fishing cap on his head and gave April a weary look.

“Good to meet you, Mr. Patterson, but I have to get back to the house. It’s been a long day.”

“Good to meet you too. I’ll be out fishing all day tomorrow.” Mr. Patterson extended his open right palm at April as a farewell and then stepped inside his unassuming abode for the evening.



April turned down the sheets on her bed and fluffed the pillows, flipping off the switch of the lamp on the nightstand as she lay at her side on the mattress. A dog-eared bookstore copy of Anna Karenina was close at hand next to the lamp, the evening’s reading that had helped April unwind and ease her nerves after the day’s disquieting revelation.

The dim radiance from the plastic night light plugged into a power outlet near the bed contrasted sharply with the total blackness that poured in from her bedroom window. A waning moon was barely visible over the peaks of the pine trees, and the kind of absolute lightless night only found in the deep countryside permeated the room, obscuring everything beyond the bedposts.

April drifted into a fitful sleep but after some time was able to find her first dream. She was out in the middle of the lake at night, sitting in the rowboat from her visit to Mr. Patterson. There was nothing discernible around her except the proximate murky lake waters and the perimeter of the boat, with all else being a yawning void. April looked down at her sandals and saw that brackish water had begun seeping into the boat from a hole in its floor. The boat was beginning to sink steadily.

While watching as the water filled the boat’s interior, April stood and then dove into the lake head first in proper swim form. April hit the water with a splash and then attempted to paddle forward into the nothingness, but her partially submerged body was held in place by an unseen force. It was as if she was being pulled down into the lake by invisible attendants, grasping at her clothes and holding her legs tightly as she was dragged downward into the tangled mass of underwater flora. April struggled and attempted to tread water, but the lake was able to engulf her, her head abruptly disappearing beneath its surface.

She had inhaled and taken an emergency breath before she went under, but April’s supply of oxygen was soon exhausted. She was hyperventilating and convulsing as her lungs filled with lake water, her nostrils burning from the unwanted intrusion.

April’s vision grew dim as she ceased fighting, and she involuntarily choked up on the fouled water, but she was still able to make out a figure that was under the lake’s waves with her, floating above her close to the surface…

April lurched forward in bed and gasped for air. She leaned onto her knees and consciously breathed until her breath had become somewhat even and normal again. Even so, she was inundated with a feeling of overwhelming sadness and loss that seemed to derive from nowhere. The nightmare had been so vivid; she had never dreamed of death by drowning before tonight.

A man stood at the foot of her bed and stared at April, bloated and saturated with lake water. He had clearly been underwater for some time, as he had aquatic plant debris in his dripping wet, matted hair, and his saucer-like eyes bulged horrifically. The man stood silently and said nothing, not making any motion at all but continued to gaze at April as she sat covered by her blanket.

Not sure if what she was seeing was more of the drowning nightmare, April crept out from under her blanket and onto the bedroom floor, reaching into the nightstand drawer for the crucifix that had been left by Jessica’s mother. She knelt at the side of the bed and said the first Our Father, periodically glancing at the unmoving phantom.

“Our Father, Who is in heaven,
Holy is Your Name;
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our sins,
as we forgive those who sin against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.”

April continued praying a second Our Father followed by a third and then a fourth. The fourth Our Father provoked a reaction in the drowned man, as he took one step back from the foot of the bed and also become less defined, melding into the bedroom’s outer darkness.

April watched him as she recited the next prayer, pressing the top of the crucifix to her chin. The specter retreated from her bed yet again as she prayed, and she could now see that the man’s distended hands folded in front of him at his waist were chained together at the wrists.

April lowered her head and continued to pray, observing that each subsequent prayer would cause the apparition to step farther back and become increasingly faint. The Our Fathers continued until April could no longer see the dreadful figure in her bedroom. This was definitely no longer a nightmare, as April was sure that she was wide awake and could sense her heart thumping at breakneck speed as she uttered the words to the final prayer.

Barefoot and wearing only the soccer shorts and plain white T-shirt in which she had slept, she stumbled past the foot of the bed and dashed outside through the front door of the house. Breathing hard, April was about to flee down the path to the highway when she heard Jessica’s voice call out for help. “Someone…I can’t make it! I’m going under!”

She looked out over the lake shrouded in the nighttime sky and could see Jessica in the distance, flailing and attempting to keep her head above water. A slight man of about forty years old with horn-rimmed glasses suddenly ran up to April’s side, oblivious to her presence, even though she was only a few feet away from him.

The man called out to Jessica, “What are you doing? Swim to the dock, and I will pull you to shore!”

“I can’t. My leg is cramping, and I’m sinking. Get the sheriff…please!”

“We don’t have time. I will swim out to you.”

The man turned around and ran toward the shed. As he moved, April could see that he was almost translucent. He then passed April again, holding a flotation vest. The man removed his sweatshirt and waded into the dark waters of the lake.

He swam clumsily toward Jessica, the life vest strung around his neck, but she was far from the shore, and his progress was slow. The man paused his strokes to breathe and then asked while he treaded water, “Why are you out here?”

“I’m a star swimmer…thought I would be fine…but I can’t move my leg. Hurry!”

The man resumed his efforts and reached Jessica, passing her the flotation vest. Jessica donned the vest and began to push herself through the water with her arms, back to land. The man did not move as she swam away but instead began to struggle to stay above the shallow waves washing over him.

He called out to her, “I’m having an attack. Jessica, come back for me! I can’t make it without you.” Jessica stopped and floated in place for a moment, facing the man.

Without a word, Jessica turned around and continued to swim back to the shore, overcome by her fear of drowning in the lake. As Jessica came within reach of the shoreline, the man’s head went under the lake’s waters once and then resurfaced, gasping for air, and then went under for a final time, sinking out of view entirely.

The vision ended as the early morning sun rose over the lake’s tree line, bathing April in the light of dawn. She staggered back inside the house and collapsed on the living room couch, losing consciousness instantly.


“Did anything exciting happen while I was gone? Any of the local boys come looking for me, I hope?”

April met Jessica at the side door after watching her park her car near the shed as she had done before. Jessica was tanned from her outdoor excursion with her brother and seemed to be in high spirits.

“Jess, let’s just go home. We can relax there—catch some movies, go shopping. It will be fun.” April almost wanted to reveal her ordeal to Jessica but knew that she would be seen as delusional. Who could believe such a thing?

Jessica was adamant. “No, no way! We are staying put. I haven’t had any quiet time since last summer, and I want to be rested for our internship. My parents and your parents are at home, remember?”

April smiled weakly. She vowed that she would never set foot in the lake house again after this summer.

“Where’s Marcus?”

April looked behind Jessica for the rambunctious canine and then outside past the open door, but he was nowhere to be seen.

“I left him with my brother. We’ll be fine. Marcus is sort of a pain, remember?”

“The house will be quiet without that dog. I’m going to get back to my novel if you have everything unpacked.”

“Suit yourself. I’m going for a swim. Be back in a few.”

Jessica walked past April with a carrying case and then minutes later came back out into the living room in a one-piece bathing suit. She was headed out of the front door for the sunny waters of the lake, a perfect day for a swim.

April looked around the corner into the hall that ran in front of the house’s three bedrooms and the single bathroom. “Hey, why did you put your bag in my room? You can have a whole bed to yourself, you know.”

Jessica stopped at the threshold of the front door and turned around to answer April. “I’m going to stay in your room instead, which is actually my room, anyway. I like the view of the lake better. You only have one bag, so just move it to one of the other bedrooms.”

Jessica arched one eyebrow as she continued, “But what’s with the crucifix above my bed? That’s my mom’s. Are you entering a convent? You just need a date, girlie, that’s all.”

April walked toward Jessica and furrowed her brow above her clunky glasses. “I feel safer with it over the bed. It’s really a beautiful, hand-carved piece too. Leave it up, please, Jess.”

“I was worried for a minute that you had swallowed all that hocus pocus. I’ll leave it up…I promise.”

Jessica stepped inside the front door several hours later with a towel wrapped around her waist.

“I’m going to change, and then we can play a board game. I know which one is your favorite,” Jessica said, grinning. “The Monopoly box is in the linen closet, on the top shelf.”

Jessica and April put the game box away after sundown and decided to go to sleep early. Jessica looked out of the large front picturesque window from the kitchen at the calm waters, which were barely touched by the faint moonlight.

“April, there is something I didn’t tell you about this place…this house that we bought five years ago.”

April was yawning but then became expectant, hoping to hear a confession from Jessica. “Yes? Is it important? I’m really tired and just want to get some sleep.”

Jessica sighed and then gave her friend a genuine smile. “All right, I will tell you in the morning. Nighty, night. Don’t let the bedbugs bite.”

April moved her bag with her clothing and toiletries from Jessica’s room and closed the door to the bedroom farthest down the hallway as she retired for the night. Jessica sat at the side edge of her bed with only the nightstand lamplight illuminating the open drawer in front of her. She stared at the crucifix she was holding in both hands, running a finger over its depiction of the Christ figure. Jessica put the crucifix in the back of the nightstand drawer and closed it, shutting off the lamplight. She decided that she would tell April about Charles Tinsley first thing the next morning.



April woke to a still house. She rolled over in bed and peeked at the clock on the nightstand. The digital display said 9:27 a.m. Jessica had not knocked on her bedroom door yet for breakfast, so April went into the kitchen and poured a bowl of cereal and milk.

“Jess? Come and get some breakfast. It will be lunch soon if you don’t get up. Really. Jess?”

April went down the hallway from the kitchen and knocked on Jessica’s bedroom door. No answer. She knocked again. “Jess? I’m coming in. I hope you are decent.”

The shag carpet was drenched, and April’s bare feet sank into the soaked fibers with her first steps into the bedroom. Jessica’s body was sprawled over her mattress, the sightless eyes and slack mouth of her pallid, distorted face gaping up at the bedroom ceiling. Lake water ran in rivulets from her icy corpse over the bed sheets, dripping onto the floor around the bed that was littered with dead lake plants.

April gagged from the overpowering fetid smell of the drowned that permeated the room and wafted over her. She covered her mouth as she began to reflexively vomit, running from the bedroom tomb to escape its stench and the ghastly sight that lay on the bed before her. As she fled, April was able to glimpse that Jessica’s right hand was clutching the nightstand crucifix.

6pofym,1,2017-07-26,"My cousin(33/M) has turned his life into a side show and I(28/M) find myself resenting him, even though I don't have a reason to.",f1sh_,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/6pofym/my_cousin33m_has_turned_his_life_into_a_side_show/,"Warning: This may be very, very long. 

Backstory on me and my cousin:

As long as I can remember my cousin and I were best friends. We both grew up in pretty nasty homes. His mother was a raging alcoholic and his father was a Vietnam veteran with extreme PTSD who turned to drug use when my cousin was very young. My mother was an extremely abusive borderline personality and my father was a raging alcoholic who was in and out of my life until I was about 19 when he stopped drinking. For the longest time we told everyone we were brothers because we were both only children and helped each other get through everything and grow up together. My brother, let’s call him Andrew, was always really troubled. Early on he became a compulsive liar and would tell grandiose stories of all the amazing things he was doing in his life that always seemed like they started with some basis of truth and then were exaggerated beyond recognition. I always tried to look the other way with this as I figured it was a defense mechanism for insecurity. He dropped out of high school in 9th grade due to excessive bullying and started working pretty young. He never could stay in one place long as he was always trying to make the next big change that would fix his life. When he was 18 he joined the army but never made it through boot camp as he was “honorably discharged”. I never got the full story on how he got out as he excessively lies, but I think he claimed he was majorly depressed and needed some kind of medication and the army decided he wasn’t fit for service. Less than a year later he was getting married to an 18 year old girl fresh out of high school and was moved out of the house again. They were divorced before their first anniversary. Less than 3 months after that ended he’d met another girl, quickly got her pregnant, married her, and gotten divorced a second time by the time he was roughly 23. Between ages 24 to 31 he would go on to get married two more times and have two more children. He’d moved in an out of at least 3 houses with his various wives, lost complete custody of his first son and hasn’t seen him in years and can only have supervised visitation of his other two kids. He’s currently married to his 4th wife, a recovering alcoholic with a child of unknown origin, living in a trailer park. Through all of this he’s had more “careers” than I could count with both hands, all of which he was always telling me he was in some exceedingly important role. When he was an EMT he was telling me things he was doing at work that I knew were straight up lies (performing CPR on a baby for 2 hours and saving its life was among the most outrageous). He was a manager of a restaurant of which he told me he personally made into the “only kosher/vegetarian restaurant in the country” and he was making 100k a year. At one point he was flipping houses, which I later learned were actually trailers, and he was making 25k profit per trailer. Most recently he was a greeter at Walmart making “18 dollars an hour because they were desperately hoping he would accept a management position because of his amazing resume”. As before, I tried to take all this with a grain of salt as I knew he was insecure and lying to try and seem like less of a failure. 

The lying is really what started to hurt our relationship though, as what he was doing always seemed to be much better than what I was doing in life and he always tried to pull attention completely on himself. I’m currently in my last year of college finally and will be graduating with a degree in engineering in May. I think this makes Andrew angry as he often says nasty things like “Yeah I would have been able to do that too if my parents paid my rent and my tuition” which is really hurtful and frustrating because I live exclusively off loans and pay my own rent working a part time job. He often bragged about how his jobs paid more than mine (his Walmart greeter job making conveniently 1 dollar more an hour than my current engineering internship). Our relationship was further hurt by other things he did, which is where I get confused a bit. Andrew is horrifically selfish and self-centered. He will turn his back on anyone for his own gain in an instant without a second thought, but never to me. He’s always done everything he could to help me, even when I despised him and I’ve felt guilty about resenting him for years. 

A few examples of his utter selfishness that stick out:

1)	After his second divorce (where our relationship first really starting going downhill), I was 18 and still living at home with my mother. He told us he was “severely down on his luck” as his wife had gotten virtually everything (partially his fault for not getting a lawyer and taking his divorce seriously). I jumped at the opportunity to have him back in my life and talked my mom into letting him stay. I was fresh out of high school working a part time job at Best Buy fixing computers. I had no credit so I talked my mom into getting him a phone on my plan that I was paying for with my job. He seemed thrilled and thanked us over and over again. A few months into him living with us he’d started drinking excessively. He’d say really backhanded things to me like “well my life is great. I’m living in my aunt’s attic with my cousin who works at best buy”. This stung a bit, but I tried to ignore it. I’d had my phone for a year and loved it. I started getting calls from my provider saying our bill was getting higher and higher as Andrew was downloading games and making long distance calls. He kept telling me the charges were “incorrect” and was calling the provider to correct them. Eventually he came to me and said “Sorry man, I just can’t afford the phone bill anymore” and told me several horrible things that were supposedly going on in his life. Soon after he’d moved out with the girl who would later become his 3rd wife. He completely stopped paying his end of the phone bill and I couldn’t afford it all with my meager part time job and my phone and his were turned off. The final bill ended up around 1200 and my mom’s credit took a nasty hit and he never spoke to her again. I later found out his girlfriend got him a new, better smartphone on his plan and he didn’t want to pay the other bill he had a contract under and just stopped paying because he knew he wasn’t on the hook for it, my mom was. This was my first glimpse into what kind of person he really was beyond the grandiose lies. 

2)	Soon after his 3rd marriage his wife was pregnant with his second child. Right around this time he started talking to an ex-girlfriend and started having an affair. Andrew isn’t very intelligent, and soon found himself getting caught over the course of 8 months while his wife was close to having their child. At one point his mistress was getting impatient because Andrew was telling her he was going to leave his pregnant wife and marry her (this girl was kind of…off). When she gave him an ultimatum he claimed he was going to kill himself and said he’d taken pills with alcohol and slit his wrists. His mistress for some odd reason decided to call me frantically crying and telling me what was happening. Naturally I called the police who quickly arrived at his home to find him completely sober playing PlayStation in his living room. No cuts or bleeding or pills in his house. He wasn’t even held in the ER for more than an hour. His wife eventually found out about his cheating and was devastated. She divorced him a year or so later after they couldn’t make their marriage work (unfortunately after having 1 more kid together).

His current situation is almost like a sitcom. He’s living with his 4th wife in a trailer park telling me he’s managing some food company and making 75k a year. Before he married his 4th wife he started this lie that some people in our family are Jewish and he’d converted to Judaism and had a Jewish 4th wedding (no one in our family is Jewish… It was extra ironic because his 3rd wife was very Catholic and he had to be confirmed so they could get married in a Catholic church). The new Jewish thing is his new life changing event as now he wears a Yakama (sp?) everywhere he goes and a star of David around his neck (even when he’s eating nachos with pork). He knows nothing of the Jewish faith, just likes to tell everyone he is Jewish. I think he believes if he tells people he’s Jewish it gives him some sort of successful status like he’s financially better off. It’s so embarrassing. Me and my fiancé make fun of him constantly and I find myself resenting him more and more with each passing day. I don’t know what to do. He’s really my closest and only family and I miss how close we used to be, but his life has just become some a ridiculous joke that I don’t even know what’s real anymore. He lies and lies and lies so much that I can’t even hold a conversation with him without wanting to just cringe and walk away. I find myself angry at him even though he’s done nothing wrong to me personally, it’s just like I hate him for what a horrible stupid person he’s turned himself into. Sometimes when bad things happen to him it makes me happy because it’s almost like he’s getting what he deserves for all the horrible selfish things he’s done but that makes me feel guilty as he’s still my family. He still walks around with this ego like he’s accomplished so much and I just want to shove all his failures in his face and make him see what a joke of a human being he is. Like he has no right to feel good about himself and it sounds so terrible to say but I just want him to act like a real person and not this cartoon character he’s made himself into. If he could take some responsibility and take real steps towards fixing himself I’d help him every step of the way but instead he just gets married, has another kid with another woman, gets a new career, does something else absolutely ridiculous to try and reinvent himself. He’s like not even there anymore. 

I really don’t know what advice I hope to get on this ridiculous situation. I just want to know what people think on what I should do? Should I be even trying to rectify my relationship with him? Should I be pushing to get him into therapy if that's even my place? Am I wrong/right to be angry with him for all of these things? Or should I just try to move on and wish him the best? Honestly, typing all that out was really therapeutic and I feel a bit better voicing my anger towards him while also acknowledging my guilt about feeling that way. This is probably far beyond the scope of this sub, but if anyone has anything nice to say on this situation, whether it be advice or just comfort it might make me feel better.

If you read all of that, I seriously can’t thank you enough. 


TL;DR : My cousin and I used to be really close. He's the closest family I have, but his choices in life and issues have made it harder and harder to be close with him. Want to know what, if anything, I can do. "

6povns,2,2017-07-26,I am so frustrated about possibly being trans but being unable to figure myself out,n8in8,questioning,https://www.reddit.com/r/questioning/comments/6povns/i_am_so_frustrated_about_possibly_being_trans_but/,"I am a 20 year-old male-assigned college student. I was raised in a conservative area of Texas, which is where I still live and go to school. Currently, I am out of state for a summer internship.

I don't know when, exactly, my struggle with gender identity began. Having been raised in a conservative household in a conservative area, I was very conservative for most of my life, but around 15 and 16 I started opening my mind and changing for the better (i have details about all of this in another post). The first time I can remember anything resembling a struggle with gender identity was when I was 16, and my first girlfriend put lipstick on me. I absolutely loved it, and after that, the idea of crossdressing and acting more feminine has been on my mind.

It wasnt until 18 (about 2 years ago) that I started legitimately questioning my gender identity and wondering if I was a trans woman. And over the past few months to a year, it has steadily gotten worse and worse. Now it's to the point that at every moment of the day, it's in the back of my mind at best, and it's screaming at me and taking over all of my thoughts at worst.

I don't know if I'm trans, but I think I might be. I want to experiment with possibly going by different pronouns, or cross-dressing, or anything else I can think of. I want to talk to a professional about it. But I can't do any of that right now. I can't experiment with cross-dressing or pronouns because I don't want to out myself to anyone. I can't talk to a professional because the only affordable counseling I have access to is provided by my school, and I'm out for the summer.

I don't know what to do. It's frustrating, it's stressful, it's angering, it's upsetting. I don't know who I am and I don't know how to find out."

I had a 3.40 overall GPA and a 3.76 major GPA. I completed two internships. I went to as many academic club meetings, networking events and career fairs as my schedule would allow.

And yet, eight months later, I have been rejected from *every* job. Something about me is fundamentally unlikeable to these companies.

It's not like I've had no success at all, which I think makes it worse. I have made it to the final round of interviews for several companies, but was rejected in favor of someone else because they were slightly better. If you want a job, you have to be the epitome of perfection and confidence - anything else and you're worthless.

I just moved across the country from rural NC to Chicago to try and help my prospects. I've had a few staffing agencies call me about potential jobs that they never followed back up on, and a lot of different companies wanting me to do terrible door-to-door sales jobs for 100% commission.

I just don't understand why it's so hard. It's not like I chose something unmarketable to study in school. I was told that with the CIS program, my university had a 96% job placement rate within 3 months of graduation, with an average starting salary of $65K/year. I was told that the Supply Chain industry is growing so quickly that there aren't enough people to take all the jobs that are being created. Yet here I am, with nothing.

I feel absolutely worthless. I have about $3K left. Once I go through that and have no money left, I'm going to end it. I gave it a good shot, but I'm just not good enough to work apparently. I'm not perfect enough. All I wanted in life was stability - a steady income so that I could enjoy my life and pay back my student loans. But I don't deserve that it seems."
6ppgyd,1,2017-07-26,"m4f parents, siblings, friends, and more",MrCoffeeNJ,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6ppgyd/m4f_parents_siblings_friends_and_more/,"1) Mom and Dad's Roleplay: Dad has started to notice his daughter as she blooms into a gorgeous teen. While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.

 2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member. 

3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature. 

4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas. 

5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters.

I'm happy to substitute step-siblings or parents if your prefer to play that way.  "

(Vent/Journal/Cry for help)",akeinator,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/6pryf0/our_issues_combined_have_me_feeling_like_an/,"Hi, I am just looking for some space to vent and I hope this is a good place for it. All I am trying to do is communicate the level of confusion I experience on a daily basis, and maybe it will resonate.

My partner is a quiet BPD and doesn't let it shine through very much, but it is often quite obvious through other cues in body language, tone of voice, etc. 

We are both very sensitive. She seems to be in tune with her sensitivity whereas I am not so much. Often I get angry because of my tendency to block out emotions until I get really riled up at something. This lashing out I do hurts her feelings so much that I feel like the worst kind of person, and I honestly have never had to deal with this level of frustration and anger before in my life. It feels like everything is my fault even though I know it's not. Sometimes it has me wondering if I am taking on BPD traits, as I have lower self esteem and self worth than at any point in my adult life. Every sentence seems to have a double meaning...

""Can you wash the dishes"" = ""You should have washed the dishes and I can't believe I have to tell you again"".

This morning I made her breakfast. Brought her the food and gave her a kiss. I was shirtless and she noticed a pimple on my shoulder. She is a popper and can't stand them. Wants to get rid of every one she sees. She stares but has been working on not paying as much attention to it. I notice her stare, and wonder what's up. I turn, and see my shoulder. ""Oh, it's a pimple..."" I say out loud. I am very self conscious about them and it seems like she is predisposed to finding and rooting out every single one that shows up. It's been ongoing for the 3 years we've been together. Aside: She finds it weird that I'm not okay with her popping my pimples because all of her previous partners were, and even enjoyed it. I find it very invasive and reinforcing of my insecurities, as though when they are there, that's all she can pay attention to. Like a stray nose hair or a piece of spinach in the teeth.

""I didn't even say anything! All I did was look!""

My own self consciousness is triggered. I am angry (inner thought: I'm so sick of her finding so many flaws with me""). My therapist tells me that in trying to access my emotions beyond anger I must fully feel whatever I have, even if at that moment it is anger. So I try.

She starts to cry, hurt that her effort to not say something in the moment was glossed over. I continue. ""Just don't look!"" I spout in frustration. Breakfast is beginning to get cold. Now she is extremely hurt. How dare I raise my voice when she is already crying? Way to twist the knife. She's trying! How dare I get upset when she is *trying*?

""I am trying so hard to work on this and get better at not saying anything. All I did was look for a fraction of a second and you got mad! How can I get any better when even if I try, you still get mad? Why did you just jump on me like that?""

Explanation of why I jumped on her like that.

""Why are you just defending yourself and not apologizing?""

A calmer discussion ensues as I eat my breakfast. Hers continues to get cold. She lost her appetite.

We both discuss the feelings that come up in these situations. My quickness to anger and her quickness to notice flaws. She doesn't understand the buildup. The death by a thousand small cuts. My attempts to explain cause too much guilt for a meaningful discussion to be had unless the statements that come out of my mouth are surgically precise. 

She tries to reassure me that I am okay and a good partner but the years of hurt I have caused have been making me feel otherwise, despite what I know about the disorder and everything it causes. 
 
I am a (student, but soon to be practicing) therapist myself yet I feel powerless to do anything about this in my personal life.

I do so much heavy lifting and it seems to be glossed over in favour of what I do wrong. We are in a long distance relationship and she is visiting for three months. I am in a full time internship, leaving me emotionally exhausted already. She is gaming/youtubing/netflixing her days away, unable to muster up the emotional strength to look for a job to bring her here permanently, so naturally this will also become my job when my internship is over, as she needs my emotional support. She feels like she can't do it herself and is therefore literally unable to do it without me by her side. I always say it's okay because the alternative is unthinkable. The pain I would cause if I were to express myself fully. All the reading in the world leaves me still unprepared for reality.

I have a life outside of her. She needs me to exist.

I feel like I am with not a person, but a series of behaviours with nothing to tie them together into a full human. "
6psas2,4,2017-07-26,[FR] First ever approach,Tige-rbalm,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/6psas2/fr_first_ever_approach/,"Howdy y'all, from Austin Texas. I've read a decent amount of seduction material, (Models, Double Your Degeneracy, How to be a 3% pimpgangster, Magic Mullets, No More Mr Douchebag) and finally decided to approach today. Goal was 10 approaches, result was 1. Might be worth mentioning I'm a decently good looking dude.

The Approach:
I saw a cute little blonde gal at Starbucks as I walked by. She's on the phone so I go elsewhere. Come back (blunder 1 - never walk by multiple times. Though I don't believe she noticed.) She's off the phone this time reading a book, so I make a B-line. I'm nervous. Really nervous. I continue my path anyways.

""Hi!""

She looks up, confused.

""I was walking by and thought you were really cute so I wanted to come say hi""

She's receptive, smiling ""Hi""

""What are you working on?""

She tells me about her job search, and I tell her about how I just finished one, and it's not a fun process.

Did I mention I was nervous? I couldn't keep my leg from shaking, perhaps unnoticeably to her, perhaps she smelled the fear. I was like an injured baby seal, lathered in sweet delicious otter blood and dropped into a pool of thumbtacks with 5 food-deprived great-whites. I press on.

""Where do you work?""
""Accredo"" + an explanation.

I explain that I was looking there and wanted to work at their Stockholm office, and say some other stuff superfluous to this report. Something about my hairy buttcrack I think. Just kidding.

""Are you from Austin?"" I ask.
""Yep""
""Because I always ask Austinites about their favorite foods, being that this place is world renowned for its food""

She tells me about Hot Doddy(sp?) this burger place, and how their milkshakes are good. I go into how I was happy that in-n-out burger is in Texas because I just moved here.

She explains that she goes to Clemson and is just here on break and and internship.

Blunder 2 goes as follows ""Nice! Where do you work?""
""...Accredo"" still receptive and smiling, albeit perhaps a little confused.
""Ahhhhh yeah"" I try to explain that I was confused somehow because she was in school. Really I'm just dumber than a bag of hammers.

The conversation flows on, finally, I say

""You seem really cool - do you want to hang out before you go back for school?""
Hesitation...
""I have a boyfriend back home""
""Oh Nice! What's his name?""
(No hesitation)
""Nathan""
""No hesitation, very nice. That means he's real"" (Thanks Sasha)

A little smile ""yeah"" more light conversation.

Time to Eject: ""Well, I will let you get back to it. Best of luck with everything""

""Thank you, enjoy Austin!""

Anyways, made me feel really good to get a first one in.

My main sticking points were:
Eye contact (decent here, I made a lot of eye contact, but also stared off into space while talking a little bit).
Physical shaking from nervousness - Don't know how to prevent this, but I need to chill the hell out.
No humor - Need to be a little funnier, instead of play 20 questions.

Oh and this was with a lack of superpowers, I fapped 3 days ago.
Just kidding about the super powers.
But only a little bit.

Any advice for what I might work on based upon this story is highly appreciated.

If anyone wants to offer assistance to an Austin newcomer, please reach out.

But I mean sue me but methinks this season the trailers look like they were put together by an intern. Like with the first teaser I was pretty *""meh""* about there being voiceover, and it looking like a low budget music video, and the teaser after that being footage they just didn't use on the first trailer, but yeah nah I dunno.

Like the shots of bees that have popped up in trailers look stock-footage-y as fuck and badly composed/inserted into the trailers, the transitions look like shit people would use for an AHS *fan trailer*, they look like, again, they were directed and edited by some intern on a 30 day trial of After Effects.

My parents paid for that school so I'm currently debt free but they told me if I went back I would be paying for most of it. I will still pursue my music career on the side but I want to start taking classes at a community college and get a degree in either Computer Science or Software Engineering. I would rather not be poor and still living with my parents at 30 so I thought I would do this now instead of waiting. Would going back for the degree be worth it or at this point should I just do a coding bootcamp? I'm just really worried about being in debt if I went back to college but I never really got the college experience due to going to a music school plus I've heard a lot of companies throw out applications without degrees.

TL;DR: Thinking about going back to college for either Computer Science or Software Engineering for something to fall back on if my music career never takes off. I'm currently debt free but I'm worried about being even worse off after graduating."
6psttx,2,2017-07-26,For those who managed to rise up and become functional or stable ? How did you guys learn to cope and escape the self-destructive cycles you were in ?,pinhead94,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6psttx/for_those_who_managed_to_rise_up_and_become/,"Hi I have been having trouble sticking with goals and coping with adversity and at times not knowing how I am doing.

For the past 4 years I was studying computer science. I didn't have a passion or interest in it but my friends and family all thought I was smart and so I kept going with it. In all honesty, I was never meant to go to college or university. I went to due to family pressure. I managed to get decent grades and even a dev-internship but I never managed to feel happy. 

This caused my depression to become worse and worse. I literally quit my internship today because my anxiety was causing to me have a mental breakdown. This is the third time this has happened where the past times had me quit restaurant job I liked for 1 year and quit a semester of school with two weeks left in the semester. Each time I feel the anxiety I try to fight it by trying to work and focus on something else but I end up crashing hard. I then quit and feel like a defeated failure.

It is weird in the two days I decided and committed to quit my career trajectory and quit school, I feel better. This is due to me being very honest and self-reflective about my feelings and actions. I am still anxious about the uncertainty in my life. I will be frank and say I have a lot of social anxiety and issues in general so my dreams for a future were always pretty humble. I just wanted to make enough to be independent (apartment and enough to pay for internet, car, etc ). With where I am at right now and how my mind works, I know I don't have the potential to really support a family or spouse.

Right now I decided to just look for therapy and for the first time in my life, put my mental health in the forefront of what I should work on. I would always minimze chances for therapy or medicine because I had to work or go to school. My mom says I can take a break as long as I need, a year or longer if need be. Right now I am considering doing some outpatient stuff or other counseling and what-not to get help. I realized that I cannot do any job or school if my mind cannot work. 

I remember just sitting there in my internship struggling with what were to me simple ideas and concepts. I felt so ashamed and worthless cause I couldn't get out of my own depressed head to apply any thought or idea I had into action.

I had always thought that if I accomplished something like getting a job, doing or completing school, or finding some opportunity I would feel complete and satisfied. Sometimes I depend or crave validation or praise from others to stay motivated and feel good but even then that wears off. 

Looking back on nearly all my past jobs, my managers said I was a great worker and they were sad to see me go. Even on this internship I got compliments, which shocked me because I thought I was performing like crap and was waiting to be fired. They even said I could come back to get my health better as a part-timer. Those comments made me feel a mix of emotions because I felt so pathetic and unworthy of anything. I am realizing how bad my mindset and how self-destructive it is.

I probably veered way off topic. My main concern right now is this : How bad will my employment outlook be if I take a break for a month or two just to get my mind back in order ? 

As someone who has had 4 jobs (min-wage retail and restaurant) and at most 5 months of student dev experience (from internship and a web-dev program). I don't what kind of opportunity lies out there for me. I don't think I'll ever go back to college. I had 1 year left but if I completed it would just be to get a degree for its own sake. 

I liked coding but its more of a hobby at-most. I cannot do it as a full 9-5 job. At least not in the state, my ability to think at a high level where I can put a concepts into fully understandable code and documentation is just too hard when I get into my depressive state. I once did a year of a vocational program for HVAC and it wasn't so bad but I'm not sure. 

I guess as a disclaimer I am also autistic. I like jobs that are more repetitive and predictable and not incredibly social. 

I realize not every job can be like that and I recognize what I need to improve on is my anxiety, coping, and constant pessism. I realize and am so frustrated by the fact that I cannot get out of my own head all the time and just focus on the present. I hate the fact that my behavior and attitude is my worst enemy. The frustrating with this premise is that the solution is in my hands but I have no idea how to get better which makes me feel like a complete idiot. 

I don't want to stay like this forever. I want be stable so I can have a job. I want to be able to cope with that job long enough I can live independently. I don't want to leech off my mom for everything for the rest of my life. I feel like a complete loser at times. I am almost 23, never had anything past the 4 minimum wages job and the internship. I live at home and have so much anxiety I cannot really keep friends. I never finished school and I don't what skills I have if any. I do not want to be stuck in this self-defeating cycle. 

For so long I had defined myself in relation to others or to things in a way. I defined myself by my intelligence or by working hard or by always striving to accomplish and be productive. The one problem was whenever I had difficulties or would achieve a goal the happiness or 'high' I would get would be short and fleeting.

 I thought transferring to a university would help. I thought getting a job and doing well would help. I thought getting an internship where I got paid more than my last jobs would help. It didn't, all I felt was a sense of brief satisfaction, disappointment, and shame that the what I did just did not make me happy. I realize that maybe I have to redefine how I value myself and learn how to create happiness from within.

I am at the point where I truly am scared and don't trust my own thoughts and judgements. I think ""look where has this gotten me"" and lament and wallow in my own indecisiveness. 

For those that can understand or can relate to what I have been going through what is the best course of action for me ? Is taking a break to get intensive therapy a good idea ? I am open to the idea its just I know I am gonna hate the feeling of doing nothing and being unproductive with no school or work anymore"
6pt0fg,1,2017-07-26,[HELP] Chase bank says my check (from Citibank) is invalid and refuses to return it to me.,lookingforhelp1763,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6pt0fg/help_chase_bank_says_my_check_from_citibank_is/,"Hi folks,

I am very frustrated with the situation. Earlier this year, I got a coupon from Chase bank which gives me an opportunity to get $200 if I open an bank account with them and deposit certain amount of money within certain days. So I closed my Citibank account and got a check for the remaining money in my account (I did this because I didn't want to manage too many accounts and I needed money to get the $200 bonus).  Let's refer to this check *check A*. I happened to have another check that I hadn't deposited from my internship employer. Let's refer to this check *check B*. I went to a local branch of Chase bank, opened an account, and deposited both check A &amp; B and some cash. 

However, it turned out that check B had already expired. This is completely my fault. Because of this, Chase bank closed my account but they only returned 
1) a check for the cash I deposited
2) a legal copy of check B (the voided one from my internship employer)

They told me that check A was invalid so they couldn't deposit it. But they also couldn't return it to me because they couldn't return it to me. This doesn't make any sense but unfortunately this is what I was told. They suggested me to talk to Citibank.

I talked to Citibank. I asked them to just void the check and issue me a new one. However, they said the money was no longer in their bank. The lady I talked to opened a case for me. It's been about 2 months but I never hear back from them.

So now I am in a frustrating position: either bank claims that they don't have my money and I don't know what I should do next.

TL; DR:
I closed my citibank account and tried to deposit it with another check at Chase bank. Chase bank claims the check from citi is invalid but also can't return it to me because they couldn't verify it. Citibank, on the other hand, claims that the money is no longer there.

It's definitely been a thorn in my third year constantly being told to speak up during rounds and ""not assertive"" was the theme of my evals this year. I think I just came here to rant. I feel like a lot of it does indeed come from confidence issues/imposter syndrome. I know that in other settings I can be a little louder. I guess this year I feel like I have been working on my assertiveness. Examples are speaking up to ask questions and taking initiative when it comes to patient care. Anyhoo, I had a practice Step 2 CS that our school does for us and I actually did feel confident with SPs but I still got remarks about how my soft spoken showed I had lack of confidence. Looking back, there is some truth in the soft spoken ness but I felt like I knew what I was doing and I felt comfortable if that makes sense... What has really gotten to me today is that I was told that someone has failed Step 2 CS due to that. I'm just frustrated because I feel like as a fourth year I've made no progress. I'm still the same bimbo in a white coat. Maybe I'm just super stressed out with applications and Step 2 CK/CS coming up. I feel so overwhelmed these days. I'm scared of matching somewhere where my fiancé will hate the city. I'm scared of letting him down. I'm scared of disappointing my parents because they put so much faith in me. I'm scared that when I start intern year I'm afraid that I will be the most incompetent one to walk in there. I've been taking my medications although I could probably do a better job with my diet and exercise these days. Just writing this out makes me feel a little better since I get to write out what I've been feeling. I guess I got to put some big girl pants on and take this day by day.

6pte0z,677,2017-07-26,"My [24] parents [50; 57] don't want me to move out because ""I'm not done cooking,"" but I want out.",anxietymaybemoving,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pte0z/my_24_parents_50_57_dont_want_me_to_move_out/,"Hello, /r/relationships. I apologize in advanced for the length.

Sorry if this is a long ramble, I don't know how to put this in a narrative.

So i have generalized anxiety disorder which disrupted a lot of my life, and naturally, my parents are extremely protective of me. I would get panic attacks, go through extremely bad relationships, and worry over nonsensical things. They've told me all my life to not worry about getting a job and to just let them pay for things. 

I would feel pretty guilty about this, especially since my parents were always giving money to my bio dad to take care of my severely autistic bother, and to my older sister who has a kid and has terrible money issues of her own from her own screw ups (she crashes cars, got fired from work all the time, and more.) So every chance I got, I would try to get a job. But my parents would always talk me out of it saying I'm not worried and that they would take care of it. I was in high school, so I didn't have much free time anyway. 

This was fine as a teenager but now I'm 23. I'm constantly driving between campuses and my internship, while also living an active social life and participating in the speech/debate team which gives me a grant that covers half the tuition. I make straight A's despite any trouble I run into, and just today found out that since I turn 24 in September, I qualify for a pell grant that will cover my tuition. Not to mentioned I am only 6 classes away from graduating with my BA! My anxiety is also ten times better, and I feel extremely accomplished. Even my speech coaches have told me they're so proud of how far I've come.

But every summer during my college years I would try to find a job and my parents would make me quit. I only succeeded in keeping one job at a retail store, and they decided to push me to babysitting my brother so much I had to quit for ""the family."" After I quit my babysitting duties suspiciously subsided. I am only allowed 200 dollars a month for food expenses and gas, and since I go to school everyday back and forth in-between my internship, this isn't enough to sustain myself. I tried to bargain for more, they say I need to budget. I offer to get a job, they say absolutely not.

Thing is, this is my last year. My tuition is being paid for myself and I only take three classes a semester now. This would be perfect to get a job to save up some money and to move out and transition to true independence. I also have an amazing, loving boyfriend who wants to take the next step and have me move in with him. I'm delighted but my parents 100% do not approve, despite him being so polite and making so much effort to get to know them (he bought my little brother two expensive transformers toys and didn't receive any thank you from them at all, much less bothered to even talk to him).

I feel so discouraged. I tried hinting that I want to leave but they keep saying weird stuff like ""you're not done cooking yet,"" and how I need to focus on my studies. Well I've been focusing on my studies and obviously they are fine. When I told my (step) dad about potentially having good news about my Grant money, he immediately berated me: ""No, you're not moving out."" Even though I wasn't even going to TALK about it.

They put a lot of pressure on me to do impromptu milk runs in the middle of the night, to take care of my brother while they go out. They say I can come and go as I please, but demand me to text me where I am through out the day and make extremely snide remarks on how I practically live at my boyfriends even though they establish that it was supposed to be absolutely fine.

I'm getting sick of living here. I get berated for hanging my bath towel in the ""incorrect"" towel rack, have to stop at home to do the dishes between school and my internship even though I'm barely home enough to do the dishes anyway, and I get fussed at for not being home but when I AM at home they don't even acknowledge my existence unless they need something. I'm so tired of them seeing all my anxieties as me not being ready, and not seeing the strides I could make on my own.

But I'm still conflicted. I don't want to lose them, I just want to move out and live my life freely and develop responsibility. I feel weird that they aren't even letting me do that. I don't feel like I'm even home here anymore. 

tl;dr: despite me being responsible, straight a, productive student with grant money to pay for tuition, parents still won't let me out and I feel trapped. 


Edit: Wow! I never imagined my post would get this big! I am extremely grateful for the advice and constructive criticism. I do think my parents have slight narcissism issues, but ultimately in their weird way they seem to think they are doing the best by me while also taking extreme advantage of the situation. I'm applying to multiple part time jobs, and have been for a while - but the advice everyone has given out has just reaffirmed that I MUST do this. Once I get a job and have a decent amount of income, I am going to let my mother know that I will move, and that she can't say anything to change my mind. I know she'll be pissed, and that my step dad will be enraged, but I suppose that's the cost of seeking happiness.

I might schedule a therapist appointment in the mean time with someone who is quite familiar with how my mother can be, and seek her advise as well. 

Thank you everyone again I truly appreciate the outside perspective!"
6ptw3y,4,2017-07-27,27 [M4R] SF Bay Area - Venture Funded Bachelor Seeking Help,saviourQQ,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/6ptw3y/27_m4r_sf_bay_area_venture_funded_bachelor/,"It is a truth universally acknowledged . . . oh? Wrong script. Terribly sorry. Let me try again. Oh dear. Where do I start? 

I've been a sponsored bachelor for thirteen years now. At 14, some acquaintances of mine (I still haven't found the best term for them but middle aged makes them incredibly unhappy. Perhaps slightly less young women? There's no good way about this is there?) kept insisting that I, being such an 'upstanding and good' young man ought to have a girlfriend (This seemed rather confusing, since apparently they were all married to no good scoundrels). 

But they had no idea what sort of girl I should date. I insisted that dating would be a horrible waste of my time and money. They insisted I try anyway. I asked to be reimbursed for any expenses and they agreed.

And as I moved around from place to place, this pattern of finding insistent sponsors repeated itself with remarkable consistency. In recent years, people that take a liking to me tend to add that I am very brave if they've heard a bit of my story. 

A friend was also kind enough to explain that most women in their 20 somethings want to have fun (which is why I get sponsored to do fun things, whatever those are suppose to be).

I never tried at all but I ended up on dates anyway every now and then. Usually when I noticed after a couple hours (it used to be days or months so I am improving) that some unlucky girl had been following me around, trying to engage me, usually while I was helping with an event of some sort and not paying any attention to her except to ask her to hold this or fold that or give that to someone else.

Unfortunately, a couple things have happened to interrupt this  state of affairs. 

My protege of six years recently proposed to his girl of five years (She was delighted to meet me. Apparently I was his favorite topic for the first 18 months they dated. I was delighted that she passed my brutally high standards for strength of character and intelligence). He asked me very seriously when I would get started on this. Step zero of dating is fixing your life I had told him years ago. I finished that one a few years ago.

I went on a walk to talk shop with some family friends. They're the only happily married couple I've ever personally known (Most got married too young and don't believe in divorce). Thirty years. They run a business together. They were holding hands almost the entire time we walked. I asked about that. They had goals together. They still put in an effort to do things for their relationship and to know each other.

And lastly, about a year ago, I made a new friend. She's one of the brightest people I've ever met. An outsider. Hired by NASA at 14, that sort of thing. We talked for a bit about everything. Well, mostly her educating me about the origins of Arthurian Legend (she went to the churches, quite a few of them and translated engravings), HBM2 memory, math references in Alice in Wonderland and anything else I was curious about.

For the first time in forever, I found myself struggling to keep up. I asked if she would be the sort of girl I should date. She agreed. She added it was a shame she was twice my age and married. She said it's rather hard for her. Most men don't like being around women much smarter than them. I said it's exhilarating. 

Lastly, I've promised probably dozens of friends I would find a lucky girl someday. At their insistence. I try to keep promises. Unfortunately, I'm not terribly perceptive so it makes more sense for the girl to find me. Also, the whole not experiencing attraction very often thing or strongly makes it difficult on my end- I had an internship with a guy that successfully picked up women everyday for 3 months. He very kindly explained that he did it because 1) He was incredibly horny all the time 2) People like being told they are attractive 3) Sometimes there were multiple women a day. Tried it, wasn't really my thing and I didn't have that hungry look he always had. Nice guy though.

I'm sorry this has dragged on. Love to chat if you think you can help in any way. Or, if there's anything you suspect I can help you with.

Meeting new people is my second favorite thing in the world. Asking about their lives, finding what they want and then updating my spreadsheet and pinging them when I find something or for no reason at all other than that it is nice to have friends. My childhood was very lonely and I've tried to become who I needed back then.

I got very depressed last summer but it seemed to get better over the school year, but I'm thinking now it just distracted me enough from it that I forgot. It's summer now and it's worse than ever. 

I've never been this bad mentally, I feel broken. I right in my phone notes every time I have suicidal thoughts but it's been everyday so far. I write how these thoughts invade my head and won't leave. They're so visceral and angry, one that keeps coming up is me smashing my head with a butt of a pistol. I don't know why I'm angry at myself. And my life is good right now but depression consumes it all. I have a new nice job, I'm looking nice and lean, I have an amazing girlfriend, yet everyday I just want to bash my fucking head in. Some things are also really bad. I haven't talked to my dad in weeks or seen him in months. He divorced my mom when I was 8ish and I didn't hear a peep from him for 6 months, he could have moved to a different country for all I knew. He came back into my life and bought me and my brother tons of cool stuff and I forgot all about it pretty quick. I didn't even think about it until it all hit me a few months ago when my stepmom just mistreated and yelled at me in front of him and he didn't say a thing, then it kind of hit me that he cheated on my mom all the time and left and would hear dozens of voicemails everyday from us just balling for months. But we never really connected so I don't really care that much, it's more the social pressures of it all that bother me about it. 
I just stay with my mom now which is much nicer. But recently I feel estranged and alien when I interact with my mom, I don't know why and it scares me. I know her so well and we're so close yet her hugs don't feel warm and safe anymore but just like any other hug. 
Luckily I have a great girlfriend who I love more than anyone in the world, but depression has been sticking it's greedy hands into that too. I've been so consumed by my mental health I'm not me anymore, and she loves me, not a husk of me. I'm scared when she realizes I'm not there anymore and scared she'll leave me. I want to be me, but I forgot what me is, and I can't help it. It's so tense I'm worried what will happen. 
I'm just so scared and feel so alone. Just a few months ago I was dreaming big, I told myself I'll be president one day or try until I die to make a difference. I made a whole road plan, what school I'll go to for undergrad, where for law, who to intern for, what kind of policies Id push. Now the only thought I have is dread and that recurring of bashing my head in. I'd never do it though, it'd hurt everyone too much and it's not really what I want, although sometimes it looks oh so tempting. 
I just want to restart, to take a break and change my life, but I don't know how to. Simply expressing how I feel to my mom might kill her, and without her there's not much I can do in terms of changing my priorities. I don't know, I really just don't know. I've looked into inpatient a bit but I don't want to give up my contact with friends, or nicotine, or any drugs even thought I only occasionally partake. I just want to be in the woods and go for runs or walks, drink smoothies, read, do art, meditate, and sort myself out with a therapist. 
But I don't think that's a possibility, I'm going to pass any initiative for the sake of everyone else and just get washed up into this life. A few hours ago I more strongly considered killing myself more than any other time, and although I feel better now i won't if I just keep going like this. I hope in writing this I can talk to some people that relate or maybe some people who went through it, idk I just feel really alone. "

The thought that she even partially shared intimacy with a new person so quickly sickens me, let alone somebody I know and confided in at times. It's fucking terrible and humiliating. I know it's my biology telling me that she was ""mine"" and that this strikes an inner chord with my desire to spread my genes, but no matter how much I can break it down scientifically I fucking hate the forethought of another partner. For people who have experienced similar things, how do you get over this?

We had intentions of seeing each other again within a month when I got back to school since I've been at an internship over the summer. She's been working very hard and has complained to me about being unable to feel affection towards many people because she's compartmentalizing her emotions, feels stressed about work, etc and wants time to herself. Lo and behold, she also had developing mixed feelings for this close friend. She claims that that was only a ""side reason"" for the breakup to begin with and that it was mainly her feeling distanced from the relationship from a combination of larger factors, one of them including issues she had with my family. 

I know it is better for me rationally to be away from her and let her figure out her own fucked up moral judgement system, but I can't get these images out of my head half the time. It's just so traumatizing to have my trust breached like that on TWO ends. I don't even know where to begin with ""acceptance"" of the event or if I can even ever offer her forgiveness. While she technically wasn't being unfaithful in a traditional sense, I was deceived and disrespected, all while losing my girlfriend (who was also my best friend), and a distancing yet still close friend. Loyalty apparently means nothing anymore.

I'm rambling a bit at this point just to get my feelings out but I'll say that this ""friend"" is now cut out of my life for the rest of my foreseeable future, and I've talked to my ex about it to a degree to which I am still furious and extremely disappointed, but also sympathetic towards her confusion. HE was the one who was always initiating conversation and the event itself with total knowledge of the relationship. Ive seen him do this with other girls too and he ruined them. She even told me when he first started acting weird/flirty. Her mistake was letting it continue and apparently being receptive because he is our friend, and she didn't know how to shut it down. The only reason I'm more understanding of her is because she was more or less a somewhat passive party in this emotional affair, whereas he was plotting. I know it's not an excuse but i loved this girl for so long and after this happened, she could not stop apologizing and saying how badly she fucked up and wanted to show me she could be different. How this is the worst mistake she's ever made in her life and how she can't believe she lost me all from her own doing. She said she had no intentions of sleeping with him and that the alcohol was a huge part of it, and claims to not even remember most of the night after she got to his place. 

I want to believe her and I want her to show me, at least for the sake of getting to know her again maybe, because we really did get along great and had great chemistry. But I know out of my own self respect I can't let myself be drawn in. Part of me wants to add on ""...for the foreseeable future"" to the last sentence because I guess some glimmer of hope is still alive in my heart. I want to believe she's a good person underneath all of this shit and insecurity but she will have to work extremely hard to prove her worth to me again to even be in my life.

Anyway. Yeah. This is terrible. Can't stop imagining them sleeping and even though I know it could not have been nearly as passionate or intimate as when we ever did anything, it hurts to think that she facilitated a fucking SEQUENCE of events that led to this terrible, terrible mistake. It's not like a makeout in a bar. It was agreeing to go home with, ditching some other friends who offered her a place to sleep, making out, agreeing to get protection, etc. And that is fucking despicable. I hope nobody has to go through this. "
6pwc17,1,2017-07-27,I'm [22F] being forced to move back home for the remainder of the year to complete my internship. My parents and I have always had a strained relationship and I'm dreading it.,kassiebby1124,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6pwc17/im_22f_being_forced_to_move_back_home_for_the/,"I'll try and keep this short but it probably won't be. Basically since the age of 12, I've been emotionally abused and manipulated by my mother and on the rare occasion physically assaulted by both my mother and father. My sister started college the year after I started middle school (7th grade for me) and she has always been charismatic and involved in the school. Spitting image of my mom's academic record. Makes sense though since she was the first child. 

I've been called a fuck up, been told I'm a disappointment more times than I can count on my hands and feet, been told I'm my earlier youth that wasn't their child, they didn't love me and I was a disgrace. When I told them I lost my virginity I got called a whore, slut and my parents wouldn't speak to me for 2 weeks. I've been punched and slapped so hard my nose bled for muttering ""fuck"" under my breath when I my mom was in the back of the house. I'm African American if that is any relevant information. My father is the epitome of ""family first"" and continues to this day to question why I hang out with my friends (AFTER EVERYONE IS ASLEEP MIND YOU) and why I can't spend time with my family even though I do and when I do I get insulted and chastised. 

When I left for college our relationship improved slightly (and I believe that's because of the limited contact we've had with one another). 

About a month ago my mom and dad came down to talk to me about moving. I told them I don't want to leave and they had the nerve to ask me why. To this day whenever I see my mother she comments on something stupid. Every. Fucking. Time. Usually it's a variation of these:
""you're dressed like a homeless person""
""you look like shit, what happened to your hair (referring to my hair being dyed red)""
""your hair is so dry if you took match to it it'd go up in flames (then proceeds to torch a lighter less than 2 inches from my hair)""
""do you know how many times I wanted to apply for you to be on what not to wear? I'm doing the paper work now to get you on the show maybe they can show you how to dress since you don't ever take my advice""

I've been overweight and bulimic (trying my best to recover because we can't afford therapy and the last time my mom found out she literally followed me everywhere after I ate something. Listening in on me in the bathroom, following me to the stalls in restaurants, that kind of thing). I've managed to lose ~70 pounds in a healthy manner but have fallen off the wagon and struggle with motivation and self esteem sometimes. My mother constantly pinches my fat rolls and tells me I've gained so much weight (even though I've lost like 20lbs since she saw me last) and deliberately buys me clothes bigger than I wear, although she may do that because she buys a size larger for herself for ""room"" but she gets me sizes 2 or 3x my current size even after being corrected. 

The biggest kicker is jobs. I have a great business opportunity here for baking during the school year and I've not only explained but also have the money and calculations printed out and give to her. My profit margins, expenses, etc. I pull a minimum of 500+ a month when business is slow. I make upwards of 700 or more on average and well over a 1000-1500 when party season starts. She told me that I should get a part time job. 1) who hires someone to work only weekends? My internship is unpaid and I have to work 40-60 hours a week from it. In addition to taking an online class and 2) her reasons for why I haven't gotten another job (I've had 3 in the last 1.5 years at school) is because I go to interviews in a dress and I need a pants suit. This is a point of argument with her. A FUCKING PANTSUIT will apparently solve all of my young adult employment problems. She's hell bent on revamping my wardrobe for some stupid reason. I admit I dress like a bum on the days she visits but it's usually a weekend and in the morning. Im in sweats or PJs. 

My mom asked my why self esteem is so low at home and I want to tell her the truth but I don't want to break her feelings. Part of that could have been years of manipulation but I still love my family. Everyone is telling me to set boundaries and I've been trying but nothing comes of it. My mom is convinced that we will be fine as long as I do chores for dishes that aren't mine and ""contribute to the family"" and household. 

What can I do or say to make sure I'M being treated fairly for these next few months?

Tl;dr I hate living at home and really don't want to be back in this situation with manipulative parents and don't know what to do. "

6pxhdz,4,2017-07-27,A numerical oddity about Ko,maniacmartial,HunterXHunter,https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/6pxhdz/a_numerical_oddity_about_ko/,"I feel like we've come very close to tackling this topic in the past a few times (Halt_kun, VeraciousCake, sumukhgupta, etc.), but we always steered clear of it - in my case, because I did not know how the inconsistency could be circumvented. While I was doing nothing at my internship, I came up with a few possible explanations. However, unless Togashi tackles the topic head-on at some point and explains why this specific case is an exception to the rule, a small inconsistency in unavoidable.

The oddity I'm talking about is that a Ko punch (100% aura in fist) should be, for everyone but Enhancers, *weaker* than a Ryu one with 99% aura in one's fist.

A little bit of background. We know that, aside from physical strength (as well as mental and physical conditions), what determines the actual force of an attack is the sum of physical strength plus the amount of aura one is using. Izunavi explains it [here](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fV3voO2zQc8/WBzJffrSzII/AAAAAAABi4Q/V0BtD7mDGio5bMIbU3n7ojRxLDyXVAtFwCHM/s16000/0083-006.png) and [here](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tofJAtU-bMM/WBzJ0CCZShI/AAAAAAABi4Q/Fbr1tZ6_k04_4af-d3OlcHHDvNnR5bgwACHM/s16000/0083-007.png): meaning that when you use Ren, Ken, Ryu etc. the only factor that matters is your affinity for Enhancement (of course, if the two Nen users have the same aura output etc.). 

A few chapters later is where the inconsistency begins. Biscuit [revealed](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Pq2imhTNSCs/WBzECzVVrPI/AAAAAAABgCI/ZeD3wdIK88k4dlrMncyap19qbTfuJGYUACHM/s16000/0141-010.png) that Ko is a complex Nen technique that, aside from the 4 components Gon [had identified](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W0XXQh2VA5k/WBzAdXlv8lI/AAAAAAABi4s/FyvLhPiV3nIleFkxy1CTBFQO8lX8eaTDQCHM/s16000/0124-002.png) on his own, also makes use of Hatsu. However, when explaining Emperor Time to Gon, Kurapika [revealed](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QsU_qNIbNkk/WBzCgpeSCiI/AAAAAAABi4Q/4nXJiByteL0lX4LN1PuG4BIe4GzYIFMIACHM/s16000/0108-006.png) that there are two layers of affinity to abilities that use Hatsu: in fact, the minus 20% rule (an Enhancer can master Transmutation only up to 80% of his level in his natural category) *recurs* in the determination of Power and Accuracy, which is the reason a Level 10 Conjurer using Level 4 Emission can use only 40% of that Level.

Here's the problem. From Izunavi's explanation, it is apparent that proximity to Enhancement determines just how ""reinforcing"" one's aura is. However, the divisive action of Force/Accuracy when Hatsu is concerned should reduce the power of Ko for all those who are not Enhancers. For example, even if a Conjurer has 100% of his aura in his fist, the intervention of Power and Accuracy would reduce its power to a mere 60%.

All clear here? Below are some possible ways to solve this, although, again, we will still be forced to admit there is a small inconsistency somewhere.

* **Force/Accuracy do not apply to Ko**

This would actually be consistent with Izunavi's explanation, since he spoke of concentrating all of one's aura in one's fist. Personally, I believe this was either to simplify things (100% instead of saying 99% -&gt; Ryu) or an oversight. Either way, the question remains, it merely changes: Why would Hatsu, when making up Ko, be exempt from the Force/Accuracy rule? 

A second possibility connected to this hypothesis is that the Hatsu used during Ko is somewhat ""neutral"", not affected by Force/Accuracy. However, this is impossible as well, as why would it be so? If it were possible to render one's Hatsu neutral,not only it may be easier to use Hatsu abilities, the water divination test would be useless, since it is founded on the belief a person will always use their natural Nen type when performing it, and the only thing they are required to do is to activate Hatsu.

* **At 100% (Ko), the boost is exponential**

This would mean that the moment you focus 100% of his aura in a single body part, what you get is not an increment of 1% when you go from 99% (Ryu) to 100% (Ko), but one so big it erases the negative action of Power/Accuracy: using the same Conjurer as before, according to this theory the boost he'd receive with a mere 1% more strength would be equal to at least 61% more strength.

You could make the case that increasing the aura concentration increases force in an exponential way (going from 88% to 89% gives you a bigger boost than going from 3% to 4%, even though the difference is 1% in both cases); but this doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, especially since the 99% -&gt; 100% gap would remain comparatively huge.

* **The Force/Accuracy rule is additive in this case**

Although this theory is no more sensible than the others, it may be the one I currently believe According to it, going from 99% Ryu to Ko would not only cause a 1% increment in aura concentration, but would also add the Force/Accuracy rate: still using our Conjurer, instead of the power of the Ko punch dropping to 60%, he'd get a 60% increase, meaning his 100% punch would in fact become a 160% one in terms of strength.

Again, why would the rule be different all of a sudden? Maybe because Hatsu is mixed with other techniques (Zetsu, Gyo etc.)? I have no idea, but thus far, this seems the theory closest to what we actually see in the manga, and would explain why people actually use Hatsu in combat, depriving themselves of even the lightest aura shroud when the difference from Ryu would be a mere 1% (still good enough to absorb some minor damage). Yet I have a fourth.

* **Hatsu is not used on the punch itself**

This is speculation of the highest grade, and it would also be yet another unexplained irregularity. The idea would be that only the 4 other components are present in the punch itself, and that Hatsu is used for something else - for example on the rest of the body for some weird reason. However, no water is held here either: Hatsu is a characteristic of aura, and if 100% of a person's aura is focused in their fist, Hatsu can only be used on their fist.

Is everything clear? What do you guys think? Do you have any other theories?

I'm Alex and I'm a 21 year old guy from the north of England.


I love music!
I go to concerts and gigs as often as possible and I listen to quite a wide variety of music. However, at the moment I'm particularly into post-rock like Mogwai.
Other kinds of artists I'm into include Kyuss, Sleep and Electric Wizard.

I went to see Ghost and Iron Maiden recently, they were great. I'm planning on seeing Electric Wizard in Newcastle soon too!


I'm actually a musician myself. I'm a trained saxophonist and also play the bass guitar.
I've always wanted to learn to play the mandolin or the sitar to play songs like Losing My Religion by REM or Norwegian Wood by The Beatles.

I actually built one of my bass guitars from scratch, I couldn't find anything just right on the market so I decided to design one myself. Even though it didn't really turn out as expected it was a fun experience and now I have an instrument totally unique to myself!


Academically, I'm currently studying for a Masters degree in computer science at university. In the future I hope to pursue a PhD in digital manufacturing and virtual reality.
I'm also currently working at the university as a Research Intern researching LiDAR scanners and 3D printing.


If you're interested in having a chat please feel free to send me a message I'm looking to get to know a few people around here, maybe meet up in the future after chatting for a while..



I hope to hear from you soon,

Alex."

I'm new at this but I decided to reach out to the inter-webs since I haven't tried this method yet, here goes nothing.


I've been in a little bit of a (well kinda big) rut recently since entering the university system last year, I still have no idea what I want to do although I definitely know what I don't or wouldn't like to do in the future (e.g. definitely not mechanical engineering or the sciences). I used to be interested in film (fueled by my enjoyment from making YouTube videos for fun) but that kind of died off, just like my interest for business studies/commerce. I've been attempting programming during my time in university, but recently that has been dwindling too. It's not like I am failing horribly at those subjects, in fact i'd say i'm doing decently; it's just that I find it really hard to justify doing something if I don't enjoy it (for an extended period of time). I started to notice and acknowledge that my work ethic revolves around random bursts of high energy and motivation whenever I find something I am genuinely interested in whether it be a subject, a hobby or even something as minuscule as shooting a basketball, I would literally dedicate my entire life towards that activity and become the most efficient and hard-working person that I personally know of. But as a result, if nothing ignites me or interests me in the first place, I procrastinate (a lot), lose motivation and as of recently, start questioning whether I made the right choice in choosing media as my major. I am jealous that many of my friends found their place at their unis and seem to be excelling in their fields and healthily developing as an individual, finding internships and what-not, getting fit and healthy, making money etc. And here I am again, wondering what went so wrong.


Why can't I handle stress and/or bite the bullet like my friends? Why do I mentally and physically crumble under (the smallest amounts of) stress? Why do I procrastinate so much even though I know that I can physically do a certain task?  Why am I always unsatisfied and anxious? Those are probably some of the questions I google every night before I worry myself to sleep (am I even an ISFP?). It's just so depressing thinking about this stuff but I feel if I were to suppress these feelings, they would probably creep up on me in the future. I tried sharing with friends and family, but they don't seem to fully understand (comprehend), maybe because I am bad at explaining what's going on inside my head, or they're not taking me seriously. Every time I try to explain the struggle i'm going through (especially to elders) I get the ""you're not in the workforce yet, so just get good grades"" talk. I understand that they might have gone through the college experience and found some secure 9-5 job that pays good money, but that doesn't mean I should subject myself to that same path (of torture) doing something I have no interest in, come out working some random job which I will hate for the next 20 years only to say ""I hate myself"". 


Speaking of hate, I sometimes hate how emotionally sensitive/weak I am. Maybe I can attribute that to my weak strength (relative to the world) so I can't exactly put up a fight, nor do I want to since I know I'll lose. Or my mental capabilities, especially the ability (inability in this case) to keep up my side of a verbal argument, it seems to always get to a point where I start realizing where I might be wrong and then I implode; so I feel that unless I am 100% correct I cannot win (I usually lose in those arguments too since the other person tends to arrogantly think they are correct anyway). I don't exactly have high self-esteem nor the willpower to just will it to existence like my brother did. Don't get me wrong, I do have willpower, but it just comes and goes at the worst of times; I'd go out my way to spend time with a friend if they are in need, but I just can't get started on that essay.


I've been told many times that I view things too much in black and white, ones and zeroes, and that I take things way too seriously/personally (even social interaction), but habits are hard to break right? I have no idea what the solution is, I doubt it can be found through a simple google search. I have tried taking things less seriously and become more lenient to halfway points (not winning 100% of the way, at least I put in effort sort of thing), but it seems during moments of high stress (work or play) I throw all that out the window whenever things are going south and it's back to square one. It almost feels like I let my guard down and as a result I let the result slip. A common example would be: while I am playing games I relax a little and enjoy the game with a few friends. Then some random player on my team says that I suck (usually after a round loss); the casual match then becomes some personal mission for me to do everything I can to prove him/her wrong so I can rub it in their face later (not verbally of course). This puts a lot of stress on something that is meant to be a relaxing activity. The thing is, I know that it's not a healthy thing to do, but I do it impulsively (explosively) and usually I can't control it although I am aware of my actions. It usually ends badly as I tend to set impossible expectations for myself but still be disappointed if I don't reach them. 


I probably said enough, I could go on for ages but I doubt fellow redditors would want to read such a long post (especially if it's a rant). I don't really expect much from this post, nor do I know what response I want to see (just like how I don't know what I expect my family or friends to say after hearing my rants), but at least I got it out."

This is my first time on this subreddit, but it certainly looks impressive! I am hoping to get a copy of [PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS](http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/) so I can play with my brother while we each attend college 1,000 miles apart (actually 1,005 miles to be precise). My Steam ID is [GiantDwarf01](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040676166/)


**What is this so called ""Playerunknown's Battlegrounds?**

Well, I'm sure everyone has heard of this game by now, but if not, PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a online 'Last-Man-Standing' survival game. You're basically dropped onto an island or map and try to find equipment and survive in an ever shrinking battlefield. It's currently in early access, but according to my brother, it's really well done and is constantly being improved. It seems to be a fun game, and the important part for me, is there is a co-op game mode apparently that my brother and I can play together on.

**Why do I want this?**

Because it's one of the only games my brother plays that's online currently. Before we both went to college, we would play a lot of local multiplayer games on consoles and such. Alas, our college careers took us to different parts of the country, one of us to Denver, the other to Chicago. I'm a comp sci major, so I've always had an interest in computers and PC games, but only recently has my brother joined the PC gaming world. And it's easier for me to just play games he's interested in rather than trying to convince him to try games that I already have. And if we're able to play games together, like we used to, I'm hoping our relationship will remain solid rather than weakening as I hear other families have done due to college. That, plus the fact I literally have no friends after a year at college means I've been fairly lonely and he is my best friend. But at the moment, my access to new games is a bit limited...

**Why am I too poor for this game?**

Because the first few weeks of school is the tightest budget wise - them math and comp sci books ain't cheap ya know. That, plus I haven't been able to find a good part-time job since I moved to school, means I don't have much in the way of disposable income for video games... I may have an internship lined up for down the road but at the moment... not so much.

So yeah, that's my story, not sure if I formatted everything right for this and I didn't miss any of the rules... But yeah, thanks for taking the time to read this!"

His intent was obvious, when he asked you to  pick out the file from the bottom drawer. So you gave him a show.

With a graceful flourish of your ponytail, you bend at the waist and give your boss a long, deliberate view of your ass - making sure to give a coy little wiggle in your tight pencil skirt. 

You can almost feel his eyes on you. Predatory. Ravenous. It was expected.

But his strong hand running up the inside of your thigh is a complete surprise.

Goosebumps race up and down your limbs. The iced lightning of adrenaline floods your veins, and every little hair on your body stands on end. Shock twists together with sheer excitement in your belly, and hot, wet heat blooms immediately between your legs.

You straighten, and your back meets the toned outline of his chest - your two bodies separated only by layers of cloth. The outline of his suit is distinct. Crisp, tailored wool. Charcoal. The rich burgundy of his tie flashes through your mind.

His hand gives your ass a playful squeeze, and your ruby lips part sensually in mock surprise. You've spent so many months carefully painting them every morning, waiting for this exact moment. You shift, preparing to turn - to press your lips firmly against his, to show him how desperately you've been craving him.

But his arms tighten around you.

With a single shove against the small of your back, you're bent over his desk. The mahogany is cold and hard beneath your hands - you can feel it through your blouse, against your belly and your breasts.

There's a sudden, harsh tug, and your skirt is up around your waist. His fist tightens around your ponytail, and pulls. A gasp is torn from your throat as he forces your back into a sensual arch - your ass pressed outward, grinding against the growing bulge in his slacks; your slick, black pumps shaping your curves against him.

There's the distinct sound of his belt buckle. The soft rasp of leather on wool. Your panties rip, torn from your body in his burning need for you.

An excited giggle bursts from between your lips - the pent up desperation from months of fantasizing being released all at once. From the moment you stepped through his office doorway on the first day of your internship, up until this very moment - every second, of every day, you've craved him. A desperate, overwhelming yearning. 

You can feel it now, growing at a fevered pitch, deep in your belly. It's a coil of lust, twisting about itself with growing tension. 

When you feel the swollen head of his cock at your entrance, it snaps - a low moan is drawn hoarse from your lungs, and you can feel your own hot juices trickle down your inner thighs.

He thrusts.

With a fistful of your ponytail in one hand, and a grip on your hip with the other, he penetrates you. Your soaked, burning sex welcomes him, and you can feel each granite inch of his cock as it sinks into your body.

When your lips are finally wrapped tight around the very base of his shaft, with his full, heavy balls pressed up against your clit, you can feel the muscles of his thighs flex against your ass.

The power of his body is intoxicating. You push back into him, savoring the rigid feeling of his toned legs and abs flush against your skin.

He thrusts again, and your knees quiver. 

Again. And again. The thick, hard length of his cock plunges into your body, claiming you. It's everything you've been dreaming about, and more. No amount of daydreaming at your desk could have prepared you for this. 

There's a fluttery, tense feeling in your belly. You can tell that a wave of orgasm is about to crest, but it's something more than that. There's a new craving from somewhere, deep in your most primal, ancient instincts. 

Those lush, ruby lips part, and your lashes flutter in surprise as you realize you're hoping he cums inside of you. 

The thought of it sends you over the edge, and the wave crests - a sudden cascade of intense ecstacy that sends ripples of pleasure coarsing through your body. Instinctively, your pussy grips him - the powerful contractions of your soaked, searing walls milking him hungrily.

All the while, he continues to thrust. Deep, powerful strokes that leave you gasping and begging between heaved breaths. 

You're his now. You know it. He knows it. A cute little plaything - young, pretty and eager for her boss.

His muscles tense. They flex. He bottoms out inside of your with a final, aggressive thrust, and you can feel his balls against you as the entire length of his cock gives a single promising throb.

He erupts.

With a rough growl, the first, thick rope of his cum splashes into your tight little slit. The heat of it fills you. A second hot splash, and a third. It coats your walls, floods your womb, and drips slowly down the insides of your thighs. 

In the coming months, you'll look back on this moment as you stroke your swollen belly and grin. But right now, in the moment, your mind is blank - focused only on the animalistic fire raging between your legs. 

The feel of his seed is overwhelming, potent and thick within you even as it coats your thighs. You tighten yourself, tensing, gripping his shaft in rippling waves of pleasure.

Your tongue peeks out from between your lips and grazes your teeth in a knowing grin as the last drops of him are planted deep in your belly."

Is this normal, and am I expecting too much from marriage?",throwawaydoesntconfi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6q25iz/my_26f_husband_27m_doesnt_talk_about_emotions_or/,"We've been married two years and have a toddler together.

While dating, my husband was very romantic, and we would talk for hours about philosophy and our lives and how we felt-- especially how we felt about each other.

Once we got married and I guess he became more comfortable with me, he would often make comments about sentimental things and expressing emotions being ""gay"". Often when I tell him something romantic he will either say, ""that's gay"" or, ""that's weird"". If I text him something romantic he won't respond. He still tells me he loves me daily and will hug me occasionally, but that's the extent of his show of affection toward me outside the bedroom. We do laugh a lot together though, and our sex life is fine.

He mostly talks about his job, but doesn't ask me about anything going on in my life. If I talk about my life, he doesn't seem interested and rarely responds. He doesn't talk about anything he's feeling, unless he's annoyed about something I've done. I don't feel comfortable discussing my own feelings with him because I feel judged-- he will often hug me when I'm sad which is sweet, but he doesn't respond to what I say, and sometimes he'll tell me I'm oversensitive and I should stop feeling bad.

A couple months ago he had a falling out with someone he had always described as his best friend over money. They had known each other over ten years and used to hang out all the time. Aside from being angry during the fall out, he didn't show any distress over it once it was over. The one time I asked him if he was feeling bad about losing his friend, he said, ""No. Of course not. Lets just move on."" He really doesn't have any friends now, aside from a few distant friendships with coworkers, who he doesn't talk to or hang out with outside of work.

Earlier today he informed me that he would need to do an internship next summer and will have to go alone due to cost. I became distressed and couldn't figure out why. After thinking awhile, I told him I thought the idea of him being gone for a summer might be upsetting me because he's not here emotionally, and having him also be gone physically just feels like too much for me to handle. He started laughing hysterically, and he said he doesn't understand what I mean about him not being there emotionally (these are things I've talked to him about a lot in the past, but he hasn't really seen them as problems the way I do).

I don't really feel like we're friends because we don't talk about anything that matters. This wasn't what my last relationship was like, and I was with my ex a lot longer, but when I've discussed it with female friends they all seem to agree that this is just what husbands are like. So am I expecting too much? Is this a personality difference? Or does my husband's behavior seem a bit out of the norm?

TL;DR: I feel my husband is emotionally distant because he doesn't talk about feelings or express things. He does not agree."
6q2t0y,0,2017-07-28,Beyond The Numbers: HardPoint,mstrite61,CoDCompetitive,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoDCompetitive/comments/6q2t0y/beyond_the_numbers_hardpoint/,"This is a project of mine that has kept me up all night. When we look at two teams matching up in Hardpoint, 4 factors determine who wins and who loses. Here are the factors ranked from most to least important.
Edit: I didn't expect being over-confident to have such a negative impact on my audience. Geez, Look at things for face value and the body of work created rather than the person with goals and ambitions who's behind the product.

1. Passive slaying ability, how well the team is slaying together
2. Extremes. Is anyone going off? Is anyone costing?
3. Variance, whether a team is off their game or just playing amazing for some reason. The random and unpredictable part of sports that we refer to as ""parity""
4. Objective Skill/Strats: The Team Chem/Call-Outs, and Hill Sharing allow a team to over/under perform their own slaying numbers. Only about 25 points can swing from one team to another using this, and that's the extreme case.

I am going to be focused on the first two factors, and looking beyond the simple statistics to better understand what teams have the advantage in Hardpoint heading into Stage Two Playoffs. Disclaimer: All analysis is conducted only using the info from Stage Two groups, I would love if I had access to more stats, but I don't work at MLG (MLG if youre reading this, just imagine how deadly accurate/informative these stats would be if u hired me and let me work on this as a full time job and not a hobby), and I dont have the resources currently. Regardless, just the data from Stage Two provided a clear picture for us to analyze. To begin, we look at all of the slaying margins from every Hardpoint played by every team, I don't care about score I just dial in on what team slayed better. We must remove all extremes, all the great and terrible performances, and what we are left with is an abundance of data that indicates how well a team performs in a natural game. I then simplified this by sorting all the Stage two teams into 5 categories, based on their natural slaying capabilities in Hardpoint.
5 Star Teams:
Luminosity Gaming
4 Star Teams:
eUnited, FaZe, Cloud9, Enigma6, EnVyUs
3 Star Teams:
Red Reserve, OpTic, Ghost, Splyce
2 Star Teams:
Mindfreak, Fnatic, Rise Nation, Epsilon, Evil Geniuses
1 Star Teams:
Elevate EU

Now before you start commenting about how wrong I am with this list, allow me to introduce factor number 2. The 2nd most crucial factor to a team's success is whether or not someone is carrying. Many of the team's that you think are ""overrated"" here, simply don't benefit very often from being carried, and they often battle against ugly performances by someone. Teams like E6, Cloud9, and EnVy, have been successful in HardPoint without the help of insane performances, and they are often plagued by someone like Aches, JKap, or Kade, performing far below the expectation. These teams may have a 4 Star Rating, but they're more likely to suffer from someone costing then be benefitted by someone carrying. Similarly, Splyce and OG are both considered elite Hardpoint squad at times, but in a natural environment neither of these teams stand out with slaying. Literally every single time OG wins a Hardpoint, Formal or Scump is tearing up the scoreboard. To no fault of their own, their team style simply requires either Formal or Scump to play amazing, but in a world where neither of those players is far ahead of the lobby, OG is nothing special in Hardpoint. Splyce relies on someone like Zer0 or Bance to be going insane. While Splyce was at the top of the game, there was someone carrying them in every Hardpoint, with a constant force to carry them, Splyce doesnt stand out at all from the pack. LG is a unique team, where the entire team literally beats the crap out of you with slaying as a unit. Nobody needs to make hero plays, they whole squad is equally likely to be best on the team or worst on the team, and their scorelines often stay close to one another. So if any two teams are matching up during Stage Two Playoffs, refer to this list, and the team that has more stars is likely to win the Hardpoint, ASSUMING nobody is costing them and nobody is carrying the other squad. Now that we have cleared that out of the way. Let's look at the probabilities of carry/cost from the playoff teams. The truth is, although OG may be nothing special when Scump and Formal are quiet, one of the two is going off most of the time. A carry is defined as when a player's plus-minus is more than 5 kills away from the next best teammate. If Scump is best on the team with a Positive 10, and Karma is next best with a positive 4, Scump gets credited with a Carry. If Formal is going positive 11, and Scump is positive 9, then Crimsix is only positive 1, both Scump and Formal get credits for a Carry. A Cost is the polar opposite of a carry, where one teammate is more than 5 kills below the next best player. With both Carry and Cost defined, lets look at the rosters of the 8 playoff teams and analyze how often their players either carried or costed them in Stage Two Groups.
Luminosity 
Classic- 10% Carry, 0% Cost
Octane- 0% Carry, 10% Cost (he was sick, expect better)
Saints- 0% Carry, 10% Cost
Slacked- 0% Carry, 0% Cost
As you can see, this team gets a 5 star rating because almost never is anyone playing great or terrible, they just collectively out muscle everyone they play against, someone on your team has to be going off to match their raw slaying.

Fnatic
Skrapz-33% Carry, 11% Cost
SunnyB-0% Carry, 11% Cost
Tommey-0% Carry, 22% Cost
Wuskin-0% Carry, 11% Cost
Fnatic qualified for playoffs because EG is just as bad as them at Hardpoint, and they are a dominant Uplink team, but unless Skrapz is an animal, expect Fnatic to struggle this weekend.

FaZe Clan
Attach 22% Carry, 0% Cost
Enable 11% Carry, 0% Cost
Gunless 0%Carry, 22% Cost
ZooMaa 0% Carry, 33% Cost
FaZe is already a scary Hardpoint team, and as long as Gunless steps up his game and ZooMaa doesnt have hand injuries bugging him, this team is simply elite.

Enigma6
General 12% Carry, 0% Cost
Kade 12% Carry, 25% Cost
Proto 0% Carry, 12% Cost
Royalty 12% Carry, 0% Cost
This team is really strong at Hardpoint, and they are especially strong at playing team Hardpoint, with Proto having an off weekend, the sky is the limit for this team when players start turning up. 

eUnited
Arcitys 11% Carry, 0% Cost
Clayster 11% Carry 0% Cost
Prestinni 0% Carry, 22% Cost
SiLLY 0% Carry, 11% Cost
This team is so dominant, even though Clayster was getting all the press for an insane weekend, his teammates were often slaying well right behind him, so he wasn't ""carrying"" his team. Expect this team to be elite, just so long as Prestinni or SiLLY isn't going double negative, which certainly may happen.

Splyce
Bance 20% Carry, 20% Cost
Jurd 0% Carry, 10% Cost
MadCat 30% Carry, 10% Cost
Zer0 10% Carry, 20% Cost
This team always relies on someone turning up, and last weekend despite MadCat and Bance playing up to par, both Zer0 and Jurd had awful weekend and they barely had any highlight performances. When this team is at peak performance, despite having only 3 stars, any one of these players could go off and win a map for them at any time, but that simply relies on Zer0 and Jurd not being burgers. 

OpTic Gaming
Crimsix 0% Carry 11% Cost
Formal 11% Carry, 0% Cost
Karma 0% Carry, 11% Cost
Scump 44% Carry, 0% Cost
Like I said earlier, both Karma and Crimsix are nothing special in terms of slaying, so if Scump and Formal are playing at the same level as the other two, this team is pathetically average. OpTic went 5-3 in Hardpoint WHILE Scump was playing one of his best weekends of the year. This team can certainly be competitive, but it requires some combination of Scump and Formal kicking butt. 

EnVyUs
Apathy 22% Carry, 11% Cost
John 11% Carry, 11 Cost
JKap 11% Carry, 33% Cost
Slasher 33% Carry, 0% Cost
This team was really good at Hardpoint and that was just a week ago. They get a 4 star rating because guys like Apathy and Slasher go off, in the same maps that JKap or someone is lagging behind. This team isn't exactly reliant on someone playing great, but usually someone like Slasher HAS to play great, otherwise JKap or practically anyone goes big negative and hurts the team's chances. This team is right on the cusp of being elite, but we'll see if Slasher or Apathy, or maybe John can keep the magic going to keep up with the heavy hitters.

That's it folks, every team you can get an idea of how good they are on paper, and what needs to happen for one team to beat the other. This is statistics that nobody in the world is doing, but Im blessed the Reddit is such a great vessel for me to share this with the world. I literally pulled an all nighter for this but it was worth it. Enjoy these Beyond The Numbers Stats, and email me at mukhers@hotmail.com for employment or internships (*cough*cough* MLG, Im doing this as a side hobby imagine the things I could do if it was my 9 to 5).

TL:DR LG is so so good at Hardpoint, Fnatic does not look good for HP this weekend unless Skrapz is a beast, OG will suck at HP unless Scump/Formal is best in the lobby. I'm shamelessly bating MLG to contact me, which on one hand looks really cringey, but on the other hand nobody else in the world can do stats this deep.

6q3et8,4,2017-07-28,Considering getting into sales,arktal,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/6q3et8/considering_getting_into_sales/,"Greetings !

I am soon reaching the end of a 6 months internship in a small company (4 people + 2 trainees) in France selling sterilization machines and services to the food industry.

At the beginning I did not take any pleasure in it because all it was about was doing cold calling all day long on prospects I'd have to find myself on the internet. During my higher education (which will end with the internship), I haven't been taught how to sell (insane when you consider that I studied international trade all these years right?), and in the company all I've been told was ""Ask for the quality manager and offer him our services"". Not only was it boring as hell, but stressful because when you know nothing about how to actually do cold calling the fear of failure is real.

I recently started watching Jordan Belfort's Straight Line Persuasion system and it completely changed my vision of the sales process. Now I see the prospecting/selling process more like engaging in a new relationship by actually speaking with the other to try to understand him and offer him what he actually needs (and so helping him and his company), rather than just calling with the hope to finally make a sale so my company would get money (that's the way I felt considering the pressure put by my boss : sell at all cost).

So now it finally got my interest I'd really like to get the most out of the experience I can get in the two weeks (next week then one in late August) I have left in the company but I'm still unsure about the best way to do this. I tried making a script (based on Belfort's sample one) but it just doesn't feel right both on paper and on the phone.

What do you think would be the most effective way to learn as much as possible in two weeks that I'd be able to apply on the spot?

Another question is more oriented towards my own professional orientation : I'm still struggling between looking for a job in purchases (which is what got my interest for 3 years) or just looking for a job as a sales rep. However there are quite some points which get in the way of that :
- As I said, my actual knowledge and experience in successful sales is close to zero so I'm afraid that either I wouldn't find a sales job, or I'd be fired quickly for having poor performances
- At first I'm quite the introverted guy so it can be felt on the phone as I sound like I don't want to disturb (I'm actually working on this, trying to sound more self-confident and assertive)
- I don't know in the US, but I feel like in France being a sales rep is extremely bad perceived (I myself have a terrible image of sales rep : ""all they want is to sell me whatever sh*t they have"")
- As a consequence, when I spoke about it with my parents, the reply was ""you didn't study international trade for 5 years just to be a sales rep. That'd be a complete waste"" (because you can be a sales rep after 2 years of study in France)
- Part of my motivation is ""sales reps get to talk with a lot of different people, learn about them and help them, which I find interesting"" and the other part is ""I wish I could get a nice income from my job""

Because of all this, I'm quite struggling : should I look for a job in sales, for a job in purchases, or should I look for a job in purchases and make up my own SME so I can train on cold-calling without having the pressures of having to get results while being able to choose my product (I'd really feel bad having to sell a bad product as if it was a good product). I understand that's a very personal thing to ask, but I feel like I'd need more objective points of view than mine and my parents' to really take a decision.

Finally, I'd like to ask : what got you to work in sales?

Many thanks for your future replies !

TLDR : I have 2 weeks left as a sales trainee selling pasteurizing machines and services to the food industry. What would you recommand to learn as much as possible by linking theory and practice in these 2 weeks?"

6q3zb4,70,2017-07-28,[BEC] Beach Slut on Facebook,tomorrowneverknows5,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/6q3zb4/bec_beach_slut_on_facebook/,"My first post on this sub was a few months ago now, an exasperated account of the insane vacation I took with my FMIL (Beach Slut) and our subsequent escape from it. I haven’t posted since because, well, she’s been giving us the silent treatment. Let me correct that…giving FDH the silent treatment. She still kind of pretends I don’t exist. But anyway, she’s been quiet and out of sight, out of mind…except that she still is very entertainingly active on Facebook.  

Facebook is where I first got to know Beach Slut, as she friended me a couple months into my and FDH’s relationship. As you can imagine, due to her narcissistic tendencies, Beach Slut loves Facebook. Her page is mostly composed of pictures of partying and the general teenagery-BS that this woman likes to fill her life with. The grossest phenomenon in my opinion is her selfie validation thing. She takes a lot of selfies, which in itself is fine, but in the comments are always a bunch of men giving her creepy compliments like “OH, hot mami! [big eye emoji]” Who even are all these men? She dates a lot, I guess? Anyway- she always responds with thank yous and hearts and flirty comments. I don’t want to be a super judgey person. If Beach Slut wants to relive her party girl days, fine. But, she’s Facebook friends with both of her teenage daughters and they can see all of this! I don’t think it’s healthy. 

Then there’s the issue of Beach Slut crying poverty all the time. According to her Facebook feed though, she’s not being frugal in any way, shape or form. There are constant trendy concerts, events, and nights at the club. There are even relatively frequent trips to (you guessed it) the beach. Any beach she goes to is going to be pretty far away, which means she had to take time off work, pay for some type of transportation, and accommodations. I literally wouldn’t care how Beach Slut misspent her alimony and what little pay she can get from jobs she can hold down for more than a few months, if it weren’t for her constantly guilting FDH about not seeing her enough. 

Some backstory here- FDH and I live about a three hour plane ride away from his family. There is a budget airline that flies directly from our city to theirs twice a week. In the time we’ve been together (about two years), FDH has been back to see his family five times and I’ve accompanied him twice. Both times I was there (including the fiasco that was our April vacation), we spent pretty equal time with his mom and dad. And yet she is always complaining to FDH that she never sees him when he’s down there and he should make more of an effort to visit. Guys- it’s kind of a hassle with the weird times that the budget airline flies and the fact that while I have pretty flexible hours, FDH has a job that it’s hard to take time off from. 

And yet- he makes the effort. Beach Slut, on the other hand, kept saying for months that she was going to come visit him. We tried to help her plan for it, decide on a time that worked for all of us, offered her our pull out couch so she didn’t have to pay for a hotel, etc. Then after all our planning, she suddenly backed out, saying she didn’t have the money to spend on airline tickets. This might be understandable, except that airline tickets between our two cities are on average about $120 round trip. It’s not nothing, but as college students, FDH and I are able to fit it into our budget if we plan right. I think it’s just obvious that while she likes to guilt FDH about not seeing her (which she still continued to do, even after this stunt), she doesn’t actually care about seeing him at all. Judging from her Facebook feed, she spent that $120 and then some on a weekend trip to a trendy nearby vacation destination a couple weeks later. That really hurt DH. 

And finally, there’s Beach Slut’s weird competiveness on Facebook. Like many, Beach Slut uses Facebook to show others how great her life is, but sometimes she’s just trying too hard. For example, after FDH and I fled our nightmare vacation with her, she blitzed Facebook with pictures about how much fun she was having.  A more recent example was actually her competing with my mom. FDH and I are staying with my parents for the summer because I landed a really cool internship here and he was able to find a good summer job in his field. My parents have zero home DIY know-how, so FDH has spent a lot of his free time fixing up our house. My mom posted a picture of him fixing something with a goofy caption like “best future son-in-law ever” or something. Literally a few hours later Beach Slut posts a lavish thank-you to her older daughter’s boyfriend for making eggs that morning. I mean, maybe I’m seeing desperation and ill-intent where there wasn’t any, but I don’t think so. Remember- Beach Slut isn’t talking to us right now and passive aggression is her MO. 

Well, anyway- Beach Slut continues to give us the silent treatment, which is fine with me. However- I know that she’s for reals mad because she stopped liking my Facebook posts [gasp emoji].

I am very fortunate that i have pretty much everything available to help. Kratom, ibudilast, benzos, a very supporting wife, real life things to keep me occupied which i either can do or pass up. Coming up on the 48 hour mark and its been ok. Im uncomfortable in my own skin a bit, VERY low energy and a bit depressed. I have about a month break between the end of my internship and back to classes so i hope thats enough to get me to a sense of normalcy. 

My habit was about 200 mg hydro a day with a good bit of oxy mixed in, i much preferred hydro because it seemed to give a good euphoria as compared to the oxy. I had outpaced my hydro supply though and was taking percs when they popped up to supplement.

Im posting so i can get it out there and perhaps get some support and hope. What can i expect? Am i delaying the wds by taking the kratom for comfort? How long until i want to do life? Anybody familiar with this? 

I have a history of drug use. I was on meth from.childhood til i was about 30,then started taking pills because i didnt really respect them, i know better now of course. Any insights?

6q4eaa,57,2017-07-28,Three ways to get a job in podcasting or radio [x-post from r/podcasting],neuroamer,podcasts,https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/comments/6q4eaa/three_ways_to_get_a_job_in_podcasting_or_radio/,"[Note: originally wrote this as a blogpost, if you want to read it with links/better formatting it's here.](https://neuroamer.com/2017/07/27/how-to-get-a-job-in-podcasts-and-radio/)

From talking to people in podcasts and radio, and reading people’s stories it seems like there are three ways to get jobs: applying to them, making something great, and persistence.

1. Apply to Everything
First, check websites of shows or networks you like. For example:

* Gimlet: https://gimletmedia.com/careers/
* WNYC: http://www.wnyc.org/careers/
* NPR: http://www.npr.org/series/750004/careers
* Earwolf / Midroll: http://www.midroll.com/jobs/
* And look for positions at your local NPR member’s station.

Some shows or networks with recurring internships/fellowships:

* Maximum Fun: http://www.maximumfun.org/fellowship
* This American Life: https://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/fellowships

Listserves – Jobs, freelance gigs, and opportunities for collaboration are sometimes posted on list serves:

* AIRDaily Listserve – https://airmedia.org/airdaily/ (for paying members only)
* NYC Public Radio Listserve – https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/publicradionyc (requires an invite for some reason, so let me know if you want one)
* LADIO Listserve – for women in radio in NYC (you’ll have to get someone else to invite you to that one)

Databases – regional radio jobs are often also posted to a few databases:

* Media Bistro: https://www.mediabistro.com/jobs/
* Corporation for Public Broadcasting: http://www.cpb.org/jobline
* American Public Media Group: https://americanpublicmedia.applicantpro.com/jobs/
Some jobs (though mostly ones that require a lot of experience) are posted in the classifieds of Nick Quah’s hotpod newsletter.

2. Make something great

Pitching stories to shows you love can be a good way to meet producers and editors and show them how you work and think about stories. They might keep you in mind the next time something opens up on their show.

Producing your own stories, and if they takes off and gets heard by the right person, they may want to collaborate or hire you to work on your project. Whether or not the “build it and they will come” or “be so good they can’t ignore you” philosophy still applies in this attention-based economy, I’m not sure, but by making something good at the very least you’ll have something to put on your resume and list as a clip that might just clinch you that job.

You’ll want to create some kind of show reel that quickly shows your editing skills, style, and voice on mic, which can help give employers a sense of you, what you’re all about, and what you can contribute to their project.

3. Be persistent

Advice I’ve gotten from a few people, and from the book Out on a Wire is to be persistent–eager but not desperate. Let the people who make stuff you love, know that you love it. Pitch them stories, ask them if they need any help, and repeat every few months. Famously, Alex Blumberg worked as Ira Glass’s assistant and Stephanie Foo started her own storytelling podcast called Get Me on This American Life. Know what you want, know why you want it, and then figure out how to pitch yourself and your story.

---

Hang in there!

If you’re brand new to all this there are some books and resources that can help you out. Take all of my advice with a grain of salt, I lucked out and managed to get my foot in the door, working as an intern for Science Vs, but I’m struggling with finding a next step. The advice I’d get repeatedly from successful producers was essentially: yeah, starting off in this field is difficult, but if you want to make radio podcasts, you just have to put up with it, and hold on tight to any opportunities you get, and build up your experience and skills.

For me it’s helped to try to reset my expectations. I’ve  I’ve been trying to change my mindset, accept that it’s just part of the field, and imagine myself as an actor getting rejected from audition after audition.

When I applied to college and grad school, I had some sense of where I stood based on grades and test scores, and, while I worried about slipping through the cracks, I knew that statistics were on my side. Now, applying to jobs in a field where there might only be a couple of dozen positions open at any time that receive hundreds of applications, the cracks I worried about slipping through have grown into chasms, and I feel like I’m on a tight-rope. And I’m not even walking on the tight-rope because I’m not making any forward progress. I’m just dangling from it by one arm and trying to hold on as best I can and hoping someone sees something in me.

Well, that was awfully melodramatic. The bright-side is that making and distributing podcasts has an incredibly low barrier to entry, so you don’t need to wait for permission. If you think you’re qualified for the job apply. If they don’t take you prove you’re qualified for the job by making something great. But keep in mind, it’s not going to be easy when you’re starting out, so persist, hang in there, and keep making stuff.

Finally, everyone’s route is different. If you have the time and means you might want to think about going to journalism school (columbia seems to have a strong program by their representation at Gimlet) and audio-specific programs like Salt or Transom are short and highly-esteemed. Lastly, attending Third Coast seems like a common path for newcomers to network with the people they’re interested in working with."

He stood and stared at the pot of water, waiting for it to boil. He turned his head and tried to glance out the window but saw only the white of snow pressed against the glass. ""Day three of being snowed into our cabin. Good thing we have lots of tea and jerky,"" he mumbled. A few minutes later he poured himself a cup of tea, sat in front of his computer monitor, and addressed his wife.

John took a sip of his tea, ""Hey, love. Do you remember when we first met?""

Karen hesitated a moment before responding with just what would set John off, ""Hmm. I'm not sure I remember that.""

John almost smiled. ""It was our AP computer science class. You caught me copying one of your answers on the first test.""

Karen replied, ""Why do you think you did that?""

""I never did get a handle on those LSTMs."" A smirk spread across his face. ""You know, you may not have liked me cheating that first time, but that was my 'in' with you. After that, I made sure to have a question for you every class.""

""Oh, John. Do we have to talk about that now?""

John sighed and looked down, but smiled again a moment later. ""What about that hack-a-thon challenge in college. Do you remember telling me to go copy the other team's code so we could figure out how to beat them?""

""Yes. I remember.""

""When they caught me I really was expecting to just walk out defeated. It never even crossed my mind that those skinny engineering guys would start hitting me with their keyboards!"" John paused, then continued, ""That was the night I proposed to you. Right there in the hospital while the intern was stitching up my lip. I could barely get the words out.""

""Go on. I know you're going to anyway.""

John looked down and focused on remembering the details. ""I promised you that if you accepted we'd have a life filled with adventure. I know it hasn't all worked out that way. We've had a few years now and then when we had to hunker down and just work. But even then, we had our Pasta Fridays, we had our weekend picnics by the lake, and we'd always go out and look at the stars together. It hasn't been all adventures, but it has been fun.""

""Tell me more...""

John looked around at the cabin. ""Look at us! We're halfway up a mountain in a cabin that we built ourselves. We're completely covered in snow. And I'm even talking to you.""

""Do you enjoy even talking to me?""

John furrowed his eyebrows and exhaled deeply. ""This is just not the same, Karen. This isn't you.""

John stopped the program and stared at the code he had just run. He shook his head, ""I was with you for 43 years, Karen. You'd think some of your software engineering would have rub off on me. You'd have this chatbot reminding me of old stories that I forgot about it. Instead, I've been working for 12 years and all I have are these generic half-broken responses.""

John carefully added a new 'if' statement to avoid copying adverbs when generating a response. He then added a condition to completely disallow copying the adverb 'even'.

John closed his eyes and whispered quietly to himself, ""I'm so sorry, Karen. I'm just a hack without you."" He typed in 'python karen_chatbot.py' and started again.

John took a sip of his tea, ""Hey, love. Do you remember when we first met?""

I have been dealing with these symptoms for the longest, and now I am just getting really upset. I feel as if the Linzess is not working well anymore, and prunes and figs are not working. I eat healthy and exercise, but I have been really constipated lately. I have to wake up early in the morning so that I have enough time to use the bathroom. Otherwise, if I'm not comfortable, I can't go. Thus, this has led to me falling asleep at times at work. I am on an internship, so that makes it worse.

Additionally, I am always ether in the bathroom for a long time, or I am having to use the bathroom multiple times. I am always tired, and I am embarrassed. I have a great internship right now, and my IBS is just destroying it.

I have developed into an introvert because of my constant urges of having to go to the bathroom. I'm upset this keeps happening. I'm worried I won't be asked to come back for my internship. Most of all, I'm worried and scared I will never figure out a solution to this. I had surgery last year to remove my appendix, fix a twisted intestine, and I had Meckel's Diverticulum. I'm just really sad right now. I feel so helpless."
6q61xd,27,2017-07-28,32 Disasters/32 Days: Los Angeles Rams,PinkertonRams,nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/6q61xd/32_disasters32_days_los_angeles_rams/,"**Welcome to the absolute joke of the Los Angeles Rams**

I’ve been a fan of the Rams since 2005 (I was young and chose the worst possible time to become a Rams fan). I’ve never seen us make the playoffs, we’ve finished above .500 once. In my time as a fan, our combined record is an intimidating 60-131-1. One of my most exciting moments as a Rams fan was watching the Rams dismantle my hometown Broncos in 2014 so I could gloat the next day at school. That’s about all I have.
Rams fans, we watch what we can of the Greatest Show on Turf days religiously and as we should. To this day, I vehemently argue that Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce are the most underappreciated WR duo to grace an NFL field. But I’m here to break down how this mess came to be, so let’s start with 2010.

**Built Bradford Tough: The 2010-11 Rams**

From 2007-2009, the St. Louis Rams embarked and what is quite possibly the worst three year stretch in professional sports history, compiling a record of 6-42 in those three seasons, effectively wasting the twilight of Torry Holt’s career and Steven Jackson’s prime. I know what you’re probably thinking, “Well the Lions didn’t win a game in 2008, how were the Rams worse?” You’re likely forgetting, or just unaware, of the fact that the 2007 Lions went 7-9 (some kind of irony). The Rams were so mind numbingly bad that the only team to go winless in the 16 game era still had a better three year span than the Rams did.
2010 was supposed to change that and what an optimistic year it was. Sam Bradford was the first somewhat capable QB the Rams had since 2006 Marc Bulger. Danny Amendola was playing like an unholy combination of Wes Welker and Tyreek Hill. Chris Long and James Laurinaitis led the young defense as well, and this exciting group was sitting at 7-8 entering the final week of the season, needing only to beat the Seattle Seahawks for a playoff spot -- only to lose in hilarious conservative fashion by a score of 16-6. Even when down by ten late in the fourth, the Rams were dead set on a conservative approach to the game.I have seen beloved pets die, my sister battle cancer and I have never cried harder, been as furious and lost as I was in that game. The following year, the Rams opened the season against the Eagles and were being picked to win the NFC Worst, err West. Steven Jackson hurt his hamstring on a touchdown run on opening day against the Eagles (I could be wrong about what he hurt but that season was a blur of disappointment and I think I subconsciously blocked out most of that season). With Jackson down, Bradford was left alone with a constantly injured Amendola and a “pretty good, especially for what they have” lineman in Rodger Saffold. Bradford was in limbo with injuries and when the Rams received Brandon Lloyd from the Broncos, it was too little, too late.

**Jeff Motherf*cking Fisher Oh My God the name is a trigger word in of itself**

I want to get serious here. A lot of people shit on us for the Fisher years, as Rams fans did better than anyone else, but I want to look into this era beyond the horrible “durr 7-9” jokes that Black Adam Schefter and whatever other uncreative pages and jokes were made.
Fisher, initially, was an improvement. He helped us improve to 7-8-1 and 7-9  in his first two seasons. Rams fans, for the most part, were ecstatic. Sure we lost Steven Jackson, Danny Amendola and Brandon Gibson, but for the love of all that is holy, we were 15-65 from 2007-2011 and we nearly matched that win total in just two seasons. We were surely going to reach that elusive winning season, right? After all, we just executed the modern day Herschel Walker trade, no way we could fuck that one up!
I want to say that even with the horrible three year stretch I mentioned earlier, the Fisher era is the most painful. In the Scott Linehan/Steve Spagnuolo eras, the Rams were hampered by injuries to their best players and were left with absolute crap. Those teams were laughably untalentented. The Jeff Fisher teams were different, though. The defenses were great. Chris Long was playing tremendous as was Robert Quinn. We had one of the brightest young secondaires with Janoris Jenkins, Trumaine Johnson, Rodney McLeod and TJ McDonald. In the beginnings of the 2013 season, Sam Bradford was playing spectacularly as was the entire NFC West. Bradford’s statline was this before his first of consecutive ACL tears: 14 touchdowns, 4 interceptions, a 60.7 completion percentage and 1,687 yards all in seven games. After the his torn ACL, the season was lost. After he tore his ACL in the preseason the following year, I knew we were going into rebuilding mode. The team wasn’t going to admit defeat however, and when Bradford (for some fucking reason) refused to take a pay cut (seriously, how the fuck did he think he deserved that money?) we traded him for some player whose name no one needs to utter. All that man, number 5, needed to do was perform at an average level and the Rams would be in the wild card hunt. That’s it. He couldn’t even meet the most modest of expectations. Interestingly enough, this would be a recurring theme for Fisher’s offense.

**That offense, that damned offense**

Jeff Fisher is not good offensive coach. His pride comes from the defense and special teams, both of which he does deserve commendation for. Perhaps his offense style was passable in the early days of Eddie George, but to say he got the most out of Steve McNair and Vince Young in Tennessee is simply a blatant lie, a disregard for the truth. Bradford was a good fit for Fisher because Fisher likes pounding the rock and passes that won’t stretch the field, an outdated yet occasionally effective tactic. Looking back, the selections of talented players like Todd Gurley and Tavon Austin were ill-fated by a coach who seemed to get his offense out of Madden. Not even the most current Madden, but one from ten years prior to whatever year it was. The painstakingly vanilla offense held back the Rams. With the talent the Rams had, especially in 2013 and 2014, the Rams offense didn’t need to be great or even good. It just needed to be above average and the Rams would be almost assured a wild card spot. The offense was that bad. The best points per game average came under OC Brian Schottenheimer in 2013 when the offense averaged 21.8 points per game, good enough for 21st in the NFL. At that point, fans were crying foul in facebook groups and boosters meetings for the firing of Schottenheimer. The offense simply wasn’t good and the fact that the Rams were able to reach seven wins in those seasons is a testament to how good the defense was. The successors to Schotty, Frank Cignetti and Rob Boras began as laughable, but the offense quickly became sad. Yes, Todd Gurley is a monster, but with such a vanilla offense (Fisher openly said time and time again that the offense was very basic and it was working even when it clearly wasn’t). In his tenure, Fisher’s Rams scored 30+ points in 11 games, 40+ in just two, out of 61 games. The post-Bradford QBs consisted of Kellen Clemens, Shaun Hill, Austin Davis, Case Keenum, Nick fucking Foles and Jared Goff (more on him in a bit). Todd Gurley is suffering the same way SJax did, insanely talented with zero help everywhere else. The offensive line was atrocious year in and year out. Greg Robinson had some secret fetish for big, bulky football players. I feel bad for him, he couldn’t contain it and had to hug every damn defender he ever met. Perhaps it was incompetence, perhaps it was love. Penalties would be a recurring issue for Fisher’s Rams, as the team always finished in the top ten of most penalized teams in the league every year under him. The lowest the Rams ranked was seventh in 2015--the only time they finished outside of the top five. However, this can all be traced back to one monstrosity...

**Seriously, screw Stan Kroenke**

I want other fans to hear this because so many Rams fans refuse to believe it because he brought the Rams back to LA, Stan Kroenke is a terrible owner and an astounding asshole. Kroenke chases the money. If you don’t know who Stan Kroenke is, just think of the real life personification of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons only, somehow, worse. He helped bring the Rams to [[St. Louis]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvLUiXgLnQ) and kicked the city to the curb twenty years later. Personally, though I love St. Louis to death, I think the move was necessary for the team. It sucks, I have friends on the committee who raised funds for a new stadium and gave Kroenke everything he wanted and he still didn’t keep the team in St. Louis. Kroenke was always missing from games, usually sucking off Jerry Jones, playing golf in south beach or burning down an orphanage because fuck it. Kroenke is the epitome of the worst parts of greed and capitalism. His total disregard for success by his teams and total disregard for basic human emotions is evident of that. The fans of the other teams his company owns, the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, Colorado Rapids, Colorado Mammoth and Arsenal FC, despise him for his indifference towards a team’s constant mediocrity for the sake of revenue. Mainly, I was bewildered by a situation where Kroenke kicked elderly Texan residents from their homes, leaving them with nowhere else to go. A resident killed himself and named Kroenke specifically in his suicide note. He’s like Immortan Joe from Fury Road except instead of keeping women as sex slaves, he fucks the fanbases of six franchises collectively. Is that some kind of record? Say what you want about Dan Snyder and Jerry Jones. At least they care about making their teams good. Snyder just fucks up---a lot---but at least he cares. If Kroenke had the option to be successful and run a team into the ground, he’d take that chance in a heartbeat. Stan Kroenke is like if Eric Cartman grew up and somehow become more of a cuntbag.

[Bonus pic of Stan Kroenke](http://wallpaperclicker.com/storage/wallpaper/Mr-Burns-evil-shadow-64347692.jpg)

**The Future**

I’d be lying if I said I’m thoroughly optimistic for the Rams. The current front office and management failed spectacularly with picks like Brian Quick, Isaiah Pead, Greg Robinson and likely Tavon Austin, as well as failed free agents in Kenny Britt and Jared Cook. This is a young team searching for identity and talent. That said, I’d be lying if I said the team was headed in the wrong direction. I believe in Jared Goff. As I mentioned the dysfunction of the Fisher squads, it should be noted that the receivers refused to put in extra work when Goff took over last year. Goff wasn’t ready and to surely say that the Rams should have picked someone else than Goff is ridiculous simply because it’s too early. Dak Prescott would have performed just as bad, if not worse, if he were on the Rams a year ago. Goff finally has a coach who knows what he’s doing and coaching is key. Sam Bradford and Tavon Austin had none, thankfully Gurley and Goff have some help on the sidelines this time. Looking back at the New England game this past season, Goff was making good throws to open receivers, the receivers just kept forgetting to catch the ball. It’s too early to predict how a team is going to finish, but I have confidence that the Rams will show improvement. The team has made improvements, and the team has some potential, but it’s going to take time. What is making a lot of Rams fans cautiously interested is that for the first time in what feels like a lifetime, the team actually looks like it’s serious about improving.

**TL;DR:** The Rams have been in a constant state of awfulness since 2006. Jeff Fisher led the disaster with ineptitude on offense, in the draft, in free agency and just general coaching. Stan Kroenke seeming lack of care towards how team performs has made the situation worse. However, with a potentially competent coach, a tasty offensive scheme for the young talent, the Rams are making the effort to become a better team and Kroenke is realizing that you can’t be mediocre in LA and be successful. It’s just a question of whether or not they’ll reach those heights.

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

She is a really light sleeper and goes to bed at 9-9:30.  It wakes her up whenever I enter or leave the room.  I try to avoid doing that but sometimes I need to grab something, drop something off, go to the bathroom, or do other things (before 10:30-11 except bathroom). 

I am also a student so sometimes I stay up late doing work (midnight at the latest).  I keep my computer on silent but the light wakes her up.  I could move to the dorm lounge but there is no air conditioning and I work badly when people keep walking by.

I have already compromised by agreeing to pack a bag that she can leave outside with my toothbrush and pjs so I can go in and out 1 less time. I really don't like doing this, but I am trying to compromise.

I have not asked her to do anything other than don't put the air conditioning below 65 (and I got an extra blanket to even cope with that).  I am perfectly happy to use my flashlight when I need to do things late, but that also keeps her up.

Basically I am asking should I do everything else she requests, or am I justified in continuing my current behaviour?

TLDR: How much should I accommodate my roommates sleeping habits?"

I graduated with a BA in Graphic Design in May and I've applied to quite a few jobs since then. I've done 5 interviews so far, and an additional 4 got back to me for an interview, but were out of state and only wanted in-house designers, so I ended up turning those down. It's been almost three months since I started applying in early May, and I'm starting to feel less and less confident about my career. I did, however, take a month-long break in June because I just burned myself out with applying. 

A couple of my friends work in big-name companies either for an internship or a job right out of college and I feel like I'm hopeless. I have another interview next week and I keep asking myself, ""Why even bother researching their company and preparing? You're not going to get the job anyway."" 

I know, feeling sorry for myself isn't going to accomplish anything, but I so badly want to get a job, earn an income, and finally be an adult. My girlfriend needs help and I want to support her and be a good partner. I want to move out of my parents' home and be independent. 

I worked really hard on my portfolio during college and was even a Teacher's Assistant. I've extensively researched the companies I applied to, done mock interviews, and asked for feedback from my friends and professors on what I could do differently during interviews.

I just... I dunno. I spend so much time on the details I get crushed when it doesn't pay off in the end-- not hearing a peep back from anybody. I know there are a crazy amount of designers in the city I live in so there's big competition, but I just feel so much pressure to not only be successful, but to work with a big name like my friends do.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone that's been sending me kind PM's of advice and positive messages :')

And to everyone that responded with their wisdom and experience :D"
6q7obp,1,2017-07-28,What tools/frameworks/platforms should I use to develop my first desktop app,major_asmask,appdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/appdev/comments/6q7obp/what_toolsframeworksplatforms_should_i_use_to/,"I've had this idea in my head for a while now about an app I want to make. I finally have the time/courage to make it now and I'm a bit lost about where to start.

Basically, my problem is as follows: I want to make an app but I don't know with what tools I will be able to make it.

I have significant experience using Unity, making games in C#. But I don't think it's a good idea to develop a non-gaming app in Unity just because I ""know my way around it"". I have worked with WPF during an internship on an existing software and I actually started a few WPF projects on my own right now to know what it would feel like to develop my own app without any of the structure that the company had when I worked there. It turns out it's super intimidating for a beginner to start from scratch and I don't really see myself being able to bring my application to life with that any time soon. I feel it's a bit overkill for what I wanna do.

So here I am, having tried to look for other tools but I have no idea which one of them are actually realistic for my level of experience and appropriate for the simplicity of the app I have in mind.

What have you guys used to make your first desktop apps? Should I really just buckle up and learn WPF (I hear UWP is an option, but to me it's still intimidating) or are there alternatives out there that are as ""simple to learn"" as Unity in terms of data binding, dependencies and stuff. I'm in need of some advice here.

Thank you so much!

I've gotten it together since then currently I work in TV Media Sales for a latinamerican company here in the US.

the turnaround started in April 2016 I started as an intern at the ad agency then they liked me so I moved to the media sales firm (both owned by same corporation) and after another internship basically I kept on coming and they kept paying me so here we are now 1 year later. Currently I've technically been considered a contractor w/ commission but starting next week in August I will officially become an employee w/ commission, I plan to stay here at least until I finish school entirely because it's close to home/school and they give me time flexibility.

By the time I graduate Summer 2018 I would have 2 years of work experience, a BA in Marketing and also 2 certificate programs (Social Media/E Marketing &amp; Marketing Research/Analytics)

My goal is to eventually work in Account Strategy or Management which is why I'm taking the courses for the certificate programs to be as well rounded as possible plus reading/learning as much as I can about behavioral economics/psychology on my own. Plus I know the money is in digital marketing and analytics so if anything I can fall back on that with the certs. However given that my direct work experience is in TV Media Sales im worried it will be looked down on. 

TLDR Basically i'm wondering is my situation in Summer 2018 (BA, 2 certs, 2 years work exp) gonna be enough or am I still gonna have to deal with entry level marketing pay? Or is getting the MaS (+1 more year of work experience) financially worth it ($29k MaS program cost) and I make my move with that into the big corporations Summer 2019? "
6q80h3,3,2017-07-28,My Story,buffalob97,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6q80h3/my_story/,"Hello and good day everyone.

I'm writing on NoFap because I just had a binge session of porn and masturbating, something that I've done quite a few times over the past couple months, with only a small amount of damage (if much at this point) to my sexual health.

Let me explain. 
I started MOing and watching sexual material at about 12 years old (I am 20 now). I never really saw it as a problem and it escalated from underwear catalogs to legitimate porn (never anything too brutal or hardcore, I may glance but that kind of stuff makes me uncomfortable). I did this for years and even started hard drug use and once stopping, I used porn as a crutch and doubled up on that instead. In my junior year of high school I discovered NoFap and had my first streak of 21 or 22 days. Now after this I struggled to get anywhere but I started dating a girl and just missed 60 days. I felt better in that time period than I had ever before. I had many struggled streaks and our sex life definitely took a loss and I couldn't get off or stay hard for long periods of time. Eventually I came out about it to her and she was receptive and helpful. We cut back on being sexual and let some time pass and then we started up again. Our relationship was going downward so the most it got to was a lot of oral and my first handjob that I was able to finish with. I then continued my streak to almost 150 days.

After this I went downhill again. For the next two years I struggled to get streaks past two months but I was making progress compared to my past, I just didn't see it because it ""wasn't perfect"". Eventually, 2016 came. I started seeing this amazing girl and after asking her out very awkwardly and a couple more relapses, I decided I wanted to drop it for not only myself but her. I then went on the longest streak of my life, one that I have not beaten as of today (180ish days I think, don't remember). I had the best summer of my life and learned so much about myself, interestingly without getting off once other than wet dreams. After about 11 months of us dating, we finally decided to start being sexual and we lost our V cards to one another (the only other time I had sex before was with my jr year girlfriend and I was blackout drunk, thanks to poor life choices and constant anxiety about PMO at that point). 

Sex with a partner you care about and love is infinitely better than porn. Yes, I will admit that the stimuli is greater in porn for just getting off but when I make love or have sex, not only am I getting off but I am developing and furthering a connection with someone I care about. When I binge on porn or instagram models, it feels good in the moment but I have a couple days (at least nowadays) where I feel shitty sexually and try to avoid it like the black plague because I know I'm not super interested. But when I have sex with my gf, I can go multiple rounds and feel okay with myself because I'm doing the right thing and something I enjoy.

Anyways, after a while I decided to try to learn how to masturbate in a healthy way again. I've gotten a better grasp on it but I do genuinely find it difficult to MO just once, not a couple or few times and I have to focus on just doing it to my gf or fantasies instead of digital stimuli. But when I do it naturally, I do feel much better.

I've had a lot of ups and downs with this new stage but my sexual health is okay. My MOing to porn is not causing me to necessarily be as addicted as I once was although I'm starting to feel its a problem and as of tomorrow I plan to start up a new NoFap streak (easy mode, sexual acts with the gf are okay and MO to her although this could be edgy so I may remove it). But after a MO or porn binge, I don't start back at square one. It takes a day or a couple days but then my sex drive is roaring again and I'm okay to have sex. Sometimes I even have sex later that day (depending on the severity of the binge).

So what is the message here? Well I figured I'd write a story in case someone is going through the same thing, but the biggest takeaway is that a relapse won't kill you or make you a miserable failure or loser, something that I once truly believed. It sucks afterward and it hurts and looking into my girlfriend's eyes, knowing I'm not super functional in the pants is very painful but I'm okay. I'm making progress and learning about myself. The time from when I started MOing again and to now has actually been the greatest period of my life. I learned so much about myself, got accepted into a national internship program, finished my collegiate athletic career, became sexual after years of being disgusted with my sexual health, studied abroad in China (I live in the US) and now I'm planning to do so much more.

 Think about where you were a year or two or 5 ago. Compare your sexual health now to then. If it's better, pat yourself on the back and keep pushing the bar higher. If it's worse, look yourself in the eyes and promise to make a change for yourself and your loved ones. NoFap is just one aspect of your health and I believe it played a major role in my getting things together but don't cling to that all or nothing attitude so tightly that your quality of life decreases when you relapse. That's what I did and it sucked."
6q8di6,6,2017-07-28,I was in the hospital for 4 days. I feel really guilty.,LucySparky,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/6q8di6/i_was_in_the_hospital_for_4_days_i_feel_really/,"[i wrote this sunday night](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/6p67i9/i_think_i_want_to_go_to_the_hospital_what_do_i_do/) 

Basically I was experiencing a lot of paranoia and hallucinations. So I got the idea that I needed to commit suicide to make it stop. It was like a flight or fight thing. I wrote that post thinking it was only going to be on this forum but I ended up showing my mother in the morning, I had felt so confused and weird and nothing I was doing made much sense to me anyway. I think I was looking for her support so she told me I needed to call my therapist for an emergency appointment which I got monday evening. Then I was sent to the psychiatric hospital that night. I showed everyone this post printed out. Which I'm grateful for because I didn't have to talk to anyone about what I was actually feeling, they could just read it. Everything was voluntary.

Anyway, I'm out now. I feel a lot better. The psychiatrist there gave me some really strong anti psychotic, which made the voices and paranoia stop so suddenly. It was so weird to think clearly. I can feel the paranoia and hear the voices start coming back again, which kind of bums me out cause now I have to wait the two weeks or whatever it takes to feel the effects from a normal anti psychotic. But I feel like I have more control over my psychosis which is stupid to think, because I've learned you don't have control over psychosis even if you think you do. Psychosis slowly chips at your sanity so you don't realize how deep in the hole you get. It just a lot more milder symptoms I can ignore easier for now. Hopefully this anti psychotic works out, it's zyprexa. I'm putting a lot of hope in this drug because it was so nice to think clearly and rationally and not hear these fucking voices. I got to see how my paranoid or strange behavior effects those around me which is why I feel so bad.

I also feel bad because I had wanted to commit suicide and all my loved ones found out. I feel really bad for making them stress over me. I knew they loved me very much and I always thought I didn't want to kill myself because it would hurt them too badly. I just wasn't thinking rationally at the time. I feel so much guilt, for my family especially. They visited me every night. My dad took some time off work. You were only allowed two visitors at the time so they'd rotate. Even my sister, who hates my fucking guts, started crying and shit. When I got home my mom bought me flowers, made me a whole bunch of vegan food, washed my clothes and sheets for me. Like shit, I have such a good family, people love me so much and I drag them through that. They didn't even say anything mean about me or negative, nothing like suicide is selfish or along those terms. They just said I was sick and they were glad I could get help. They don't really know much about mental illness because we don't know the extended family and they don't have that type of problems, and all they try to do is understand me. These are such good people and I made them worry so much.

Then on a side note the hospital was kind of fucking stupid which made it worse. See there were two women there named Jeanette. They always mixed us up. But the morning, the psychiatrist told me he'd sign my discharge papers, the other Jeanette had a seizure and had to go to the hospital. I called my mom on the phone, and say I'm being discharge and I'm so happy. So an hour later she calls the hospital and asks how discharge is going and they tell her I'm not there, I'm at the hospital and I had seizure. Like what the fuck, why didn't you figure out which Jeanette you were talking about? My mom freaked the fuck out. I guess one of her fears was that the hospital would accidentally OD me on medicine, especially after seeing me all zombified on anti psycotics. So she's on the phone looking for me at the regular hospital and they kept telling her I'm not a patient there, even when she called multiple times. Then she calls this psychiatric hospital and ask again and they say the same thing again. So, she's rummaging through the house. I have about a couple hundred in my room in stash for emergency and so does my father and she's trying to find how to get money at this point, to the point where she's raiding people's stashes, cause we don't have this kind of money any more, no one has money to pay for a seizure too. I'm grateful I had just enough for those 4 days there. Then my dad leaves from work because he's under the impression I just had a seizure. Then she gets another call from the psychiatric hospital asking if she can come and get me as if nothing happened. Like how fucking unprofessional. They didn't even say sorry.

I guess I just wish I didn't feel guilty. I made no actual attempt and I voluntary committed myself. That's what you're suppose to do, not ignore it because if I would have ignored it longer I would have a psychotic breakdown again. But it's just likes shit, that hurts people. They worried so much about me. I've been worse before, so that kind of makes me feel worse because I checked into the hospital even though I wasn't at 'rock bottom' so to say. I'm really glad they loved me so much though. A lot of the people there didn't have anyone and came from a toxic environment. And here I am with a good home and good people in my life and I wanted to end it. It's because of my great life I was able to accomplish things, despite my illness. I kept telling the nurses there and the interns for the case workers, and doctors that I was enrolled in graduate school, and I'm actually a smart person when I'm not a psychotic lunatic. I even went to ask this nurse to empty her pocket because the voice was telling me they had guns and they would shot us and I was worried about the security there. And she looked at me as if I was stupid and I just told her I was in grad school and I wasn't stupid and I was on to them. Then an hour later she tells me the psychiatrist needs to talk to me. 

I don't know what I need to be now or what I need to feel. I just know I feel guilty, my mom keeps walking into my room and says she's so happy to see me in here again and smiles."
6q8lyi,2,2017-07-28,Relationship about to fail?,stayalive225,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6q8lyi/relationship_about_to_fail/,"Me [M20] and my girlfriend [F20] have been dating for almost a year. She is starting an internship 7 hours away, and we did long distance for a month. Basically first two weeks went great, then second two she started getting distant. When i asked she said she is still really in love with me, but she needs to do her new life there. I told her when i finish at the school im at this year i can go wherever to school to make things work between us bc she will be done with her internship there too, but she said she cant really think about that and she cant really promise it will be the same and she thinks most likely we need to break up. Im really heartbroken i thought this was the love of my life. At first i said everything reassuring her we could make it through these next nine months together and then we will have everything we have had together again, but she didnt seem to budge on the subject. and she just got back for 2 weeks (havent seen her yet but tomorrow or sunday) and i dont really know what to do. I love this girl to death, and if any of you have any advice on what i should do, please let me know. I want what is best for her, and i know right now that is probably to let her figure out her internship where she is. But for me, i need to have the hope that we can be together again someday.
Tl dr; gf moving away for a year and is saying we wont work in long distance and i have 2 weeks to do something about it."
6q9duk,1,2017-07-29,Paying for College,theyinhuman,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/6q9duk/paying_for_college/,"I looked at my student loan balance today. Probably shouldn't have. Is it weird to say that college is both my best and worst decision? 

Pros: met some of my best friends, made professional connections, learned how to socialize, landed a job (outside my field, but really all people care about is whether you have a degree), and met my fiancé. 

Cons: ...Where do I even begin? The thoughts of suicide after a semester of taking 18 hours where I would come home from class, do homework and study until 1:00 a.m., and collapse in bed to cry myself to sleep every night? The incompetence of the school's administration? The distance it is not just from my home, but from any semblance of society? No, those are temporary problems. The biggest thing is the cost. 

I attend a notoriously cheap college, and they granted me their top academic scholarship. It's worth a pretty penny. People in administration at the school called it a ""full ride"". The plan was to take out a small loan to pay for any extra costs that popped up since I didn't get any other scholarships. Yeah. Great plan. Here I am, about to graduate in one semester with upwards $20,000 of debt in my name (and please, *please* don't tell me that it's not that much compared to yours or your friend's) . What schools don't tell you is that the things the scholarship doesn't cover--books, meal plans, fees--can cost thousands of dollars. I've had to take out a $5,000 loan every semester just to pay all those extra fees, ignoring gas and food entirely.

But I could get financial aid, right? No, sorry. That's only for people whose parents make $1,000 less than yours do. Sorry, just missed it. My parents should have been richer or poorer if I wanted to not be paying off student loans until I'm 45. 

But there's always scholarships! Not really. I mean, look. My GPA is 3.94. My resume is great for a student. I have both relevant work experience and internship experience in addition to numerous awards and research publications. I am active in clubs and volunteer work. I have great references. But, I'm also white and middle class, and I have the ""full (of shit) ride scholarship"" at my school. I have applied for more scholarships than I can count over the past four years, but scholarships like to take into account what they call financial need, which I apparently don't have. I've received three scholarships aside from the one mentioned above. One my freshman year for $250, one this year for $250, and the luckiest break--another this year for $1500 (thank you Jesus). 

Something really disappointed me this last year when applying for scholarships. I applied for a departmental scholarship. They give out about 200 scholarships, and since there are less than 1,000 students in the school of business and even less in accounting, there's a pretty high chance of receiving one. I applied, attached my updated resume, listed my references (2/3 in the accounting department), filled out some demographics information, and wrote a cover letter that essentially said ""I have loved every second that I've been able to represent this school. Please help me continue to do so, because it is not possible without your generosity."" I also wrote that I wanted to continue to attend graduate school here this Spring and have started working toward that, but would be unable to continue since all my scholarships will expire once I get my bachelor degree. 

Awards ceremony comes around. I watch my peers get scholarship after scholarship. I don't mean to sound harsh, as many were very deserving, but many others were not. People who just glide by in class were getting thousands of dollars...while I received nothing. Not a single cent. I know this will sound conceited, and I know more is considered than just academics, but I do feel like someone as academically achieving and community-involved as I am should have received something. Anything? 

The next day, I found out that half of my scholarship was being discontinued due to me being enrolled in graduate classes, despite the fact that I confirmed with the Bursar's office three separate times that I would keep the full amount prior to enrollment. One mental breakdown in the office later, they decided to award me the full amount. Thank God that tears make people generous. 

How am I going to pay for graduate school, for the CPA exam, for my loans? I don't know. I really don't. Even more loans, I guess. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I could seriously rant about college forever, but this is enough for now. Pity party is over."
6q9gfd,1,2017-07-29,An Introduction to my friends and fellow PCs,Crowshot111,DnD,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6q9gfd/an_introduction_to_my_friends_and_fellow_pcs/,"Hi everyone, I have been having an absolute blast with my friends in a Dnd campaign hosted by an absolutely splendid DM and I thought I’d share my personal opinions and thoughts about the campaign and PCs involved thus far. This post will only include the PCs and a sort of Bio about them. 

*Disclaimer- I said these were OPINIONS and therefore I can only give you my perspective on the other PCs* If you recognize who I am and realize you are in my party, then drop a comment and let me know if I got anything wrong so I can edit it! Thanks everyone*

Let’s start off with my cast of friends and my fellow PCs: 

Firstly, there’s Scrap the Kobold Wizard:
This character is a crossover character from the last campaign we played but instead of being a Druid, the player decided to turn Scrap into a Wizard. Scrap acts much less intelligent than he actually is -  making fun and innocent jokes and yet pulling his weight pretty reliably in the party.  His Rope Trick has gotten us out of many sticky situations and his attention to monsters and their weaknesses has saved our hides. Sure, he blasts us with friendly fire every now and then but we trust in his and our ability so we don’t give it too much mind. He carries a magical ring that increases his AC by 2 which makes him much more independent in fights, meaning we can safely let him maneuver around the battle even if he grabs a little aggro. He also brings Shield with him at all times so even if something manages to get past his decent AC then he manages to stay standing and gives us time to get to him. He is also a part of the School of Divination, so using the Portent class feature, he usually makes his rolls count in combat (unless you piss him off, in which case he will make you roll low on your next check or attack). I personally love Scrap both IC and OOC, I will get into that a little more when I introduce my character. 

Second, let’s introduce Namfoodle the Gnome Rogue:
Namfoodle is sister to Fennoa (who will be introduced next) and is also arguably one of the most aggressive characters in the cast- always darting into battle and landing some sweet, sweet Sneak Attacks. Out of combat she has a bit of a sinister approach to life- kill first and ask questions later. She rarely trusts any NPCs and would rather cut off loose ends than deal with possible repercussions later. She carries a magical +1 dagger with her and has been known to cut off more than her fair share of body parts with it. In a fight, she reliably targets the important targets and stays out of harm’s reach. Also, being a trickster rogue, she blasts targets from distance if things are getting hairy and she can’t afford to dart into the front lines. Most fights admittedly start because she hurls insults at other creatures until they are provoked- a weakness we all acknowledge. Still, she pulls her weight and doesn’t ask for much so long as she gets to stick a baddie in the ribs. 

Third, let’s introduce Fennoa the Gnome Cleric:
Fennoa is Namfoodle’s sister, although they never agree on who is oldest. She is almost the character foil to Namfoodle. Fennoa is gentle and caring, and tends to assume the best in people. Although she sometimes disagrees with the violent acts the party takes, she usually just laughs it off and supports us as best as she can. You can count on Fennoa to get us out of the toughest situations alive- always checking up on us if we have low HP or buffing us to help us succeed in special situations. If there’s a sticky situation then you can bet Fennoa has a spell or approach to solve the issue at hand. She dons heavy armor and a shield but can rarely be found on the front lines (something the rest of the party really appreciates). Although we almost lost her to a tough fight, she still sticks around with us and gives us her best. She is also holding onto the most important items in the game- the Rod pieces of Deerguard (I probably butchered the spelling). The Rod gets more and more powerful as we find more pieces for it and nobody is best fit to hold onto them than our trusty Cleric friend. 

*SIDENOTE* The main conflict in our campaign arises from the fact that the Big Baddie took Fennoa and Namfoodle’s city over and in the process also killed their family. ***

Next is Borris the Dwarven Eldritch Knight:
Borris is one tough son of a bitch. He is aggressive in battle and a skeptical man outside of it. He always has something clever to say and it usually involves not trusting an NPC or situation. Borris is actually brother to Bram- a retired PC who was abandoned because he didn’t quite fit the Underdark setting we are playing in. However, Borris has quickly integrated into the group and is an honest dwarf. He is well trusted within the party and that’s partly due to his dedication to the team.  As a fighter, he brought the Protection fighting style which allows him to impose disadvantage on an enemy’s attack so long as they are attacking Borris’ ally within 5 feet. He has kept us all from suffering some pretty nasty blows so we really appreciate what he does even though we never really say it to him. He carries a magical shield which adds +3 to his AC and also wields a magic sentient sword that sought him out in our last session. He is decked out in great gear which makes him the powerhouse of close combat in our party. Not only this, but he also packs a punch with the spells available to him as an Eldritch Knight- which means we can afford to start fights from further away as our spellcasters can barrage the enemy with spells as they approach. 

Up next is Arsene the Tiefling Warlock:
Arsene joined us recently due to his last PC dying in an unfortunate event- but Arsene is one hell of a replacement. His excellent Eldritch Blasts are a pain in the ass for the creatures we encounter but even more important are his attention to combat and willingness to dump spell slots. Seriously, Aresene is a champ when it comes to Counter Spelling. His utility in battle has kept mini-bosses from running and has prevented the party from suffering big losses in combat. At first, Arsene was sent out on a mission to kill a Ghoul and came back to the party diseased. Luckily he managed to get the disease out in the form of a thorn thanks to his Patron. Unfortunately, the patron asked him to be devious and infect someone else with the disease if he wanted to keep his powers. The unlucky bastard to suffer this was my PC (we will meet me soon). It was an awesome roleplaying moment and my character never found out it was Arsene who caused his (near) transformation into a ghoul. Seriously though, no hard feelings- it was an awesome story moment and that’s what Dnd is all about. Arsene isn’t decked out in anything noteworthy yet but he has gained the trust of the party and has just been promoted from Intern to Intern Supervisor- YAY! 

Now it’s Kilrin the Dragonborn Eldritch Knight’s time to shine:
Kilrin is a notably nice member of the party. He doesn’t provoke many fights but he puts all his might into every encounter once it (inevitably) results in combat. He easily melds into the group due to his ability to trust the party members and work with them. He particularly is good at listening to Scrap and using spells of the adequate type to damage enemies.  In a fight, he lays down the pain on enemies and has a pretty high kill count since he gets the last big hits on many enemies. This also means that he gets to describe his kills often- and he always has a new and interesting way to kill his foes. Kilrin also provides a lot of comic relief in the story, which is always a plus. Kilrin uses a Greatsword to cleave his enemies and always does considerable amounts of damage when his turn rolls around. We are still waiting on Kilrin’s magical gear to fall from the sky but luckily, we have an item to gift to him next session- shhhhhhhhh don’t tell him. 

Finally, it’s me, ROBB THE HUMAN BARBARIAN:
Seriously, I love my character. He is a dumb and dimwitted man but nice enough to travel with, apparently. If anything, though, Robb can take some serious punishment. He loves the glory of combat and then the glory of drinking after combat. He started off as a slave miner in the Underdark until Scrap saved him and kept him as a meat shield- luckily, Robb already considered him his best friend by that point. He was a simple man until he met up with the current party… and then he encountered enough gold to swim in. After his taste of wealth and combat with the group he has loved adventuring with them.  The risk of death is not a problem at all, as long as he gets to die swinging his Greataxe and beside his only friends. Since he doesn’t have Darkvision, our DM blessed me with glasses that allow me to see in the Dark- THANK YOU!!! 

ANYWAYS that was a short (but very long) insight into the PCs I am playing with. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading it and if you want to know anything else about the campaign or the PCs please let me know and I’ll maybe write up some more stuff about the campaign thus far. Thank you for your time 😊

""Ok.."" he nods as you beg for him to fuck you raw...he drops his backpack and starts to unzip his shirt revealing a large bulge under his underpants. Before he continues you presse ""STOP"" button on the lift.
Bassically you are someone who is aware of his condition and either by pure need of cum or altruism reasons you take the opportunity of us being alone to make me unload a large period of time worh of cum. As it is a generous amount it would be life threatening to have it all done in one go, so you would plan to have me nut several times throughout the roleplay 

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the youngster had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of them, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous young cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no considering that he's a horny (age?) year old, how can he be this ripe at this age? The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**Daughter on a Business Trip**

i won a sales contest to a resort. A bunch of other reps from around the country got to go. My wife had to work so my teen daughter came with me. After a couple of drinks by the pool i started watching her in her two piece. Some guys even openly hit on her. I ignored when they bought her drinks as they flirted. Back at the room later she left the bathroom door open as she got ready for the awards dinner i didn't even hide my hardon when she looked. Once dressed i convinced her to lean over and show me her ass. This is the look she gave me on the way down stairs after she had to leave without panties because I came on them.

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw Kaley (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that Kaley was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as Kaley? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Hotel Girl**

you are a (age?) year old girl whose family owns a motel, as part of the family business you help out when you are not at school, most of the times with room cleaning or room service. You are often left alone because parents trust you and also they have to work a lot and look after your babies twin brothers. Will you find me at the room doing something inappropriate? would you come around delivering some food and end up staying? perhaps the strangers that come are very good looking or mysterious and you find that appealing or even you decide to get some extra tip offering extra services?

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavor by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**teasing stepdad/dad**

Chris and (your name) are just as a normal stepdad/daughter as any other. He looks after her as nothing else in the world matters, and he does it by sometimes spoiling her with her favorite cake or buy tickets for her favorite band....and sometimes by scolding her off for her bad exam results or bad manners towards her mum... however they both like each other very much and that was the normal until recently. (your name) started to grow up to (?age) and as her body started to produce hormones and boys around her started to be more 'interesting' and attractive....so did the way she saw her dad...which, after all, is everything she can wish for in a man of her own... Without realizing she started to imagine her dad touching her....kissing her...and even taking her on his bed...such as every night or so she hears her mum moaning as the bed noises get higher next door....even the scent of sweat makes her a bit moist 'down there' Chris arrives from work, his wife (Rita), she is at work, started late shift and won't be home until the early morning next day. (your name) is at home waiting to have her dad around to try something more than just imagining....today she is willing to test the waters and overcome boundaries


**Beasts**

(I'm open to play different beasts, more use to Dog/horse)

A.) I'd like an innocent little girl to be playing with her big great dane you know: playing fetch, running around, or even scratching him in the right for him to get nice and horny for her. Maybe she's a curious girl and wants to explore? or she's a little tease and leads the dog on long enough for him to force himself in her tightly little ass under that sundress of hers.

B.) A innocent little sleepover with your 2 friends and you girls cant stop talking about boys, you're both so curious about every aspect of them and want to learn everything, but no boys ever answer the questions you girls have asked so this time you girls take it upon yourselves to learn more with the family pet

C.) You're still up late at night and you cant help but be bored since there's literally nothing to do. You decide to go downstairs to watch tv at a low volume but your greeted by your overly excited dog, he sure seems happy to see you in more ways than one, but ya gotta remember, everyone is asleep so you gotta keep quiet

D.) You've recently been discovering the joys of masturbation and since you cant really do much but play with your little fingers. You begun asking your parents for a dog, since your friend has told you how dogs like to play with little girl ""thingy s"". Once they do agree, what's your next move? Will you explore his body? Will you let him just get straight to licking your ""thingy""? Maybe you've seen a blowjob being given in some porn before and you decide to start practicing on being a good future wife

Being innocent isn't the main thing, just an example, you could also play curious, bratty/know-it all, or even nerdy. Just. Not. Slutty. 

**Centaur**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the center of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place).
in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?"".
the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human. Any variations are welcome, try me and I will let you know what of think of it.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of my **favorite kinks** are: tight/skimpy clothes (that wedge or leave skin marks), lingerie, thick girls, name calling, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing, creampie/risky sex/impregnation, squirting.


Suggestions for how you might look: r/tinytits or r/slightcellulite r/ThickThighs/
Things I would Would like to see r/girlsinyogapants r/seethroughleggings r/visiblepantyline r/cameltoe


remaining kinks: https://i.imgur.com/734mF8q.png 
Also it would be great if you can stick to describing things rather than just using pictures (both are welcome).


I'm flexible in terms of age and I'm equally open to brainstorm/adjust this or other scenarios so feel free to message me your idea for a good naughty RP :). I also have kik if you prefer

6qad7j,190,2017-07-29,My family are against me [21/F] getting married at the end of this year.,AgnesGrey22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qad7j/my_family_are_against_me_21f_getting_married_at/,"I live in the Southern hemisphere so December is our summer time. Our school year usually runs from January to early December, to avoid any confusion. Also I'm turning 22 in September. 

I'm in my 2nd year of university, and my fiance [24M] is in his final year of med school. At the start of next year he would begin his internship. We're conservative evangelicals (Christians) and so that means that we believe sex should be saved for marriage (shock horror), this means that to avoid temptation we're advised to get married soon. My fiance and I have been together for 20 months are planning on getting married at the end of the year. 

My family is totally against us getting married, because we're too young. My sister says getting married now means that we'll miss a pivotal stage in our lives that we cant get back, and we lament getting married so young when we're 40, that my dream of becoming a professor wont happen if I get married so young. My mom keeps telling me that being married to a medical intern will be lonely and hard, he will work crazy shifts, coupled with my being in my final year of university next year,  and it's all in their opinion setting up to be a disaster. 

My fiance would be our sole source of income for the next 2 years, my mom has agreed to continue to pay for my university fees. So financially we should be fine. My fiancé's dad is a pastor and he got married at 25 and so he's okay with us getting married, and so is his mother. We're also doing pre-martial counselling at our church, and so far so good. 

Is there any merit to the concerns my mother has brought up ? Divorce isn't really an option so she doesn't have to worry about that. We're not having kids until I'm like 30. How do I make my mother and family see that getting married young, can be disastrous, but nothing guarantees your marriage won't be a failure ? How do I ease her tensions ? 

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm getting married in December, and my family is terrified that me marrying a mediocre student, as well as being young and still in university will be disastrous and possibly end in divorce. How do I help them see this isn't the case and ease their tensions. "
6qaxtf,2,2017-07-29,UK Graduate - deciding between Capital/Pricing role in the Lloyd's Market?,sportsvolume,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/6qaxtf/uk_graduate_deciding_between_capitalpricing_role/,"In the very fortunate position to be offered two graduate roles at two syndicates:

Syndicate A:

- Pricing role, relatively small syndicate. Pricing team is very small but has two guys who seems to have a ton of purely pricing experience

- Opportunity to do capital/reserving projects in the future if wanted to

Syndicate B:

- Has a slightly bigger name (if that matters at all). The role is in capital, using ReMetrica. Fairly large actuarial team.

I am not sure which to go for. I'm a fairly technical person (really into programming and stats) which is leading me towards the pricing role. I had a 3 month internship in pricing and it was really great but it was at a really technical place. Syndicate A seems like it would be a much more pricing actuaries sitting with underwriters role which to be honest is not bad at all but I am not the most ""outgoing"" person, I am definitely fairly nerdy at heart I would say. I do enjoy talking to a ton of people and I think it would be good for me to do more of it - but I am not sure if it is a ""natural"" fit for me per say? I have a ton of experience tutoring, and my communication quite good I would say but I am definitely not the type of person who would jump into a conversation which I had no interest in.

Syndicate B seems OK - I wasn't a big fan of the interview process/people if I'm honest. But it's in Capital, and I am not sure if that's much more a fit for me. I think technical pricing would definitely be for me as it seems a bit more dynamic.

Questions:

- Future outlook for capital/pricing actuaries? Are some more in demand than others? 

- I read a few things (from this subreddit) that pricing actuaries, especially in the lloyd's market are pretty much only contained to the lloyd's market. Not that I have an intention to move, but it's just good to know

- My ideal role would be pricing I would think, but I have spoken to a qualified actuary (in reserving/capital I think) who says that pricing actuaries are really outgoing and in your face, and I wouldn't describe myself as that. I'm pretty good technically and can speak well and influence people/backup my points but I am not the type who would be out most nights.

Any advice/thoughts would be brilliant."

6qcbiw,1,2017-07-29,I [18F] am confused about who I want to actually pursue [20M] [25M],throwawaygjvnf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qcbiw/i_18f_am_confused_about_who_i_want_to_actually/,"So I've never had a boyfriend before, not for lack of choice, but because I'm scared of dating and the vulnerability it implies. I don't have problems talking to guys if I'm not romantically interested in them, but I think I have a big mental block about dating. My parents hate each other and I wanted to spare myself the drama. I've turned down a lot of people (decent and otherwise) and forced myself to spend less time with crushes (which are few and far in between) but as I'm growing up I feel like I might be ready to actually date someone.


I started a summer internship position at an office in March and met 2 guys, A [20M] and B [25M]. Me and A hit it off right away, because we are both among the 4 people doing an internship there, and spent a lot of time together talking about random stuff. I really do think A's cool, but I don't know if I like him the way I'm starting to think he likes me. He's an intelligent guy and we always have a lot to talk about. It's never awkward between us and I generally have a good time when I'm with him, but there is only a little of what reddit has told me is the defining line between friendship and romance: sexual tension. I rarely feel the need to impress him and I would hang out with him in a heartbeat but I don't know if I could see myself being physically intimate with him at all. I'm kind of torn up about passing on him because he's so fun to talk to and realistically I know we are, on some level, compatible and I think I could grow to ""like"" like him.


B is really physically attractive to me (I'll be damned he looks great even when he's barely alive) and he's really considerate/kind. We don't hang out much individually because we don't normally work together (he's an actual paid worker and does a lot of actual work) and he's so busy but I can't deny I have a pretty solid crush on this guy. I want to talk to him and every time I come in I get nervous about whether or not I'll see him. (I get really disappointed if I don't, but then I just kind of hang out with A anyway.) I have solid foot in mouth syndrome when I talk to people I like....so our conversations have been limited even though I kind of find myself taking weird routes through the office to see him more. But he's always really patient and nice with me and the people we work with. We both stare at each other and smile and are awkward a lot, so I am kind of delusionally hoping he likes me too (this is nothing to go by honestly). Frankly I don't know a lot about him but he's friends with almost everyone in the office but he's the serious, focused type overall. He gets stuff done and he's a little awkward but really really nice and fun, and having established/secure finances is a plus. But I'm worried that if I hit on him or try to talk to him it would be hella awkward to come in and work again next summer or if I get a job offer there after uni.


I'm leaving soon to go to school in the fall, and the internship is about over so I probably will never see either guy again (though I've exchanged contact information with A and there's a possibility I might work with B again in the future). I have no relationship experience so I can't and I don't want to ""go for"" both guys at the same time (especially because I think that's kind of messed up and inconsiderate to them). But I can see myself in a relationship with either of them and it's really rare for me to feel like that. I know there are no guarantees that either of them feel the same way although I've gotten some subtle hints/green lights that I could be misinterpreting. I just don't know what to do or who I should go after.
  

TL;DR no dating experience, like and am interested in at least trying to date two different guys. don't know if I should go for good conversation bro or smokin hot/nice senior worker"
6qcj6t,11,2017-07-29,Mom isn't a fan of my boyfriend and I'm struggling to cope.,emlutz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qcj6t/mom_isnt_a_fan_of_my_boyfriend_and_im_struggling/,"Okay, I've seen a couple similar posts but I need to share my personal experience because I would love to get some feedback. Basically my boyfriend (21M) and I (22F) have been dating almost two years now. We met in high school but did not get to know each other well until we were in college marching band together. He is an aerospace engineering student and I am a first year medical student. We have such incredible chemistry; he's truly my best friend. He is loving, supportive, kind, funny, and smart. 

My mom is the definition of a ""helicopter parent."" Since I was a kid, she has always tried to have control over everything I do. She constantly tags me in Facebook posts, has to hear from me daily via text and call, and is generally overly involved with every detail of my life. She is also quite religious. As a child, she was my closest friend, but I have become much more independent as an adult and she struggles to comprehend that our relationship has changed and that I am no longer a child. I also believe I still have some sort of psychological need to please her. 

I was raised religiously, and still identify as a Christian, but do not subscribe to the ""waiting for marriage"" or ""one true soulmate"" hypotheses of Christianity. My mother is aware that my boyfriend and I have a sexual relationship, and she has stated that I ""wasn't raised like that"" and other words of general disappointment. 
This isn't the only reason she has expressed a lack of enthusiasm for my boyfriend. 

My boyfriend is actually living with my parents over the summer because he has an internship in my hometown (his parents moved after he started college). Since we started dating, I have always gotten small hints that my mom doesn't fully approve. She would make snide comments about how ""nerdy"" he is, etc. Since he moved in at my house, this has escalated. She would make comments directly aimed at him about how he's ""spoiled"" and doesn't contribute to his internship, etc. None of these were remotely called for/accurate. Eventually I had a heated talk with my mother about the situation and she ended up saying that she thinks he is ""lazy"" (based on him not being able to help with mowing the lawn due to rain) and ""immature"" (he is a little over a year younger than I am and is successful in his major at a fantasic university). She even went so far as to say she does not think he is the one. 

Since this talk I moved up to medical school and have been under a lot of stress due to that. In addition, I cannot stop thinking about this conversation and the relationship between my mom and my boyfriend. My boyfriend is doing everything he can to improve the relationship - putting forth effort to talk to my mom more, cooking her dinner, and helping out as much as possible around the house. I called my mom and told her it gives me anxiety (I have an anxiety disorder) to think about this situation and that I would appreciate if she would put forth effort to try to see what I see in him/develop a positive relationship with him. She reluctantly agreed, adding the addendum that she ""wasn't going to be fake"" and that she would always ""tell it like it is."" She's an extremely strong personality and I know this, but I still long for her approval here. Since that talk things have improved ever so slightly, but my boyfriend has still called to tell me of a few incidences where she was passive-aggressive regarding his studies, plans, etc. 

My boyfriend and I have already talked about a future together (engagement probably within the next year) and it stresses me out to think that this strained relationship could be a stressor on a future marriage. I want more than anything for the relationship between them to improve, and I am having trouble coping with the fact that my mother can't/refuses to see what I see in my partner as well as the fact that she may not offer her blessing over our marriage when the time comes. Any similar experiences/advice? Anything is appreciated! 

TL;DR My mom doesn't approve of my boyfriend for pretty bogus reasons but I still long for her approval here. Wondering how to improve their relationship or searching for good coping mechanisms. "
6qd0j4,3,2017-07-29,Recent graduate under a lot of unnecessary pressure,1throw0away10,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/6qd0j4/recent_graduate_under_a_lot_of_unnecessary/,"I graduated college in late May and have been searching for jobs since a few months prior. I studied computer science but more on the graphic design side. I figured I would want to do marketing, but since an internship and falling out of love with art, I don't want to do that anymore. I don't know what I want to do at all.

Now, I'm applying for jobs but my heart isn't in it. My mother, whom I'm living with since I have no source of income, screams at me every day for not having a job. She thinks my BS in computer science should mean I came out of college with multiple $100k salary offers with full benefits. She is putting unbelievable pressure on me to apply for every job she finds (whether it is in my field or not, whether I am qualified or not, etc) and it is severely effecting my mental health.

I am applying to anything at this point. Cashier jobs, retail... just for a source of income because my loans start very soon and I'm broke. She screams at me about this too because she says I'm ruining my life, I shouldn't have gone to college to work at McDonald's, and that I'm never going to get anywhere if I work at one of these places.

I just want to experiment and try different jobs. I've never worked in retail and I want to learn how to work with people. I got turned down from a pet store job because I've never worked in sales. If I can't even get a job selling cat food, how will a full time position ever want me? All of my experience has been in internships or work study, but apparently that counts for nothing.

I'm just tired of getting screamed at and rejected. I'm trying my best but apparently that doesn't matter to anyone I live with. They claim they ""just want me to be happy"" but then scream at me. "

I will be working both as an intern at BTSR and (hopefully) part time youth minister at a local church.

A little about me, I studied French and International Affairs and Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, VA. After a super fun gap year in Normandy, France, I am so excited to start a new chapter in Richmond!

I plan on spending a fair amount of time studying and working, but I love hanging out with popcorn and rosé during a movie/Netflix binge or drinking beer playing board games. I also cannot wait to explore Richmond and find delicious restaurants and fun bars--if I have time.  I would like to get a pet within the next year, but I’m not sure what kind. Depending on finances and what my job’s time commitment looks like, I would love a puppy, but maybe a guinea pig will be more realistic.

I'm looking to spend around 600 a month and live in the West End/Fan/Carytown area. Would love to move in or find a roommate and then go house hunting together. Want to be in RVA between Aug. 15 - Sep. 1.

Let me know!"

I am living alone because they are very abusive people. I have been working as much as possible, but I have little time to stop and think about choices I am making or what I actually want in between working to pay for everything and balancing school.

It affected my grades my first year, but I quickly bounced back and improved my gpa. 

Between work and school I have no time, and it can be extremely isolating when others seem not to be working, and have time to invest in things they want to be doing, exploring interests, doing unpaid internships and working on projects.

Sometimes I struggle to afford books, supplies, technology, ect. 

How am I actually supposed to figure out any sort of direction when I am running on a financial treadmill?

How do people start out in life with flat out zero support?
I do not want my family to effect my chances for success.

I feel extremely limited in what I am able to consider with my future as money seems to be a constant hindrance in nearly every aspect of my life.

6qd7yo,1,2017-07-29,Just a rant,AllTheDarkness,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6qd7yo/just_a_rant/,"I just wanted to rant about me and my life to someone anonymously, without the pressure of having to see/talk to them again. 
I had to create a new Reddit account just for this.
I'm a 20 year old female, who has had a depression filled childhood, and who has always been overly self conscious. 

Even when I was a kid, I think I've felt pretty neglected then, but that could just be me looking back at those memories with a prejudice. 

But ever since (pre) puberty kicked in, it has been awful. A face full of pimples and a self-control-less me =&gt; entire face filled with deep black scars that won't go away even after ~7 years. If that wasn't enough to make me feel conscious, I was ridiculed heavily for it too. Be it the guys in my high school who claimed my face looked like an ""acid attack victim's"", or my first boyfriend's best friend who said ""Dude, why are you with her? Her face looks like the craters of the moon. You deserve someone hot. "", or even my ex who conveyed this to me with a proud face. 

The one that hurt me the most however, which made me cry for hours every night for 2 years without a miss, was my mother. She never failed to let me know about my flaws.

I remember coming back home from school the day I was called ""an acid attack victim"". I had cried in front of my class that day, and I felt horrible and alone. My mother was back home from work early that day, and I tried to cheer myself up and greeted her as I reached the door. But the moment my mom saw me, she said with a pained and disgusted expression on her face, ""Ugh, don't you ever wash your face? Go and wash it now, and rub your face with soap hard enough"". That was it. Hardly two steps inside, with my ""Hi-"" still hanging in the air, and my fake smile still on my face, I was greeted to that. No ""How was your day?"" or ""What did you learn?"".
I grunted and locked myself inside the room, and cried and cried for hours, with my parents banging the door outside repeatedly. I felt that living this was wasn't worth it. But as soon as I realized the gravity of what I was thinking of, I promised to myself that I'd never ever think of killing myself. That taking an easy way out was for the weak.

That incident built up a hate inside me towards people who valued outer appearance. I would mentally loathe anyone and everyone who wears make-up, or looks at good looking people with interest, or even who is just naturally beautiful. I loathed them all, and I still do it in small amounts even though I'm trying to stop it. I kept telling myself that intelligence was the only virtue that ever mattered. That, and a good heart. 

So fast forward to me studying intensely and joining one of the best colleges in my country. My life turned around.  I finally felt accepted and appreciated by my mother. And I could see how proud my father was, which was enough for me to forget about all my insecurities. And now that I visit home only 3-4 months a year, my mom has started treating me better too. It has been over 3 years since she last hit me, and even though she still does ridicule me about my worth, she tells me once every two months or so about how she's proud of me. 

I'm now surrounded by a bunch of the smartest people here. My grades have gone up now from (my first year's grades were bad), am in a happy relationship (this is my second relationship now, after the ex that I've mentioned before) with someone who is smart, wonderful, loving, and funny. I no longer feel that depression in me, aside from my monthly mood swings. 
 
However, I failed to get a good enough internship, and these day I feel like I'm no longer smart. I've got my placements coming up and I'm stressed as ever worrying about it. Any tips for this would be wonderful too. 
Of course, my adoring mother didn't think twice before letting me know that I was the most useless girl that she has ever seen. Because of the internship. 

And my boyfriend had recently told me that the only beautiful person that he could think of was Lily (fake name for one of his previous crushes). He said that I was not beautiful according to him, but that that was okay. He no longer looked for beauty anyway. 

While that's fine, and I'm glad that he can at least be frank with me, it still hurts that I can never be someone's ""something beautiful"". 

Anyway. I was hiding and crying by myself today because I do want to be smart and beautiful, and one of them isn't something that can be helped. I didn't want to share this with anyone else whom I knew. That's it. I just wanted someone to hear all this and talk to me about it. 
Cheers. 

PS: English isn't my first language so if there's any issues with my writing, correct it but a bit politely if you could.

Edit 1: formatted slightly for better reading. I'm sorry, I'm still typing from my phone and this is the best that I could do.

6qdtgf,701,2017-07-29,My coworker's [25M] girlfriend [25F] threatened me [21F],coworkercatastrophe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qdtgf/my_coworkers_25m_girlfriend_25f_threatened_me_21f/,"I’ve been working at my dream company in the city for about a year and two months now. We have a very small office, less than 15 full-time employees and with the exception of about 4 “higher-ups”, everyone is pretty young. There are one or two people in their 30s, but everyone else is in their early to mid-20s. The company specializes in something extremely specific, and we all like to nerd out about what we do. Couple that with the fact that most of them moved from far away for this opportunity, and don't really know people in the city outside of work, my coworkers and I became fast friends when we were interns for this company last summer. Another thing to note, without giving too much away, this company is in an extremely male-dominated industry. I’m the only girl in the office, and it’s been that way since I began as an intern. It was weird at first, but the guys were so welcoming and treat me with the same level of respect as everyone else. Since we have been working together for over a year, a group of six of us have become super close and hang out together a lot outside of work. They’re some of the best friends I’ve ever had and spending time with them is always a blast. 

One of the guys, Jack [25M], and I were very close last summer when we were interns. We sat next to each other every day at work and would get lunch sometimes. One day, he started texting me out of the blue, and this continued into the fall, when I had gone back to school. It definitely got flirty at times, and he would initiate conversations about random things for no reason at all, which made me think he was possibly interested in me. I wasn’t really looking for anything at the time, but after thinking about it, I decided if he asked me out, I definitely would’ve said yes. He was cute, had a great personality and we had a ton in common. Obviously it’s never a great idea to date coworkers, but we were interns at this point, both of us fully expecting to part ways when our internships ended, so it didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. We never went on a date or anything, it was just harmless banter. 

As time went on, I kind of realized that even though he’s a great guy, there were a lot of fundamental incompatibilities between us and we would probably never work out as a couple. In addition, we both got hired full-time, so not wanting to risk this golden opportunity I was given, I stopped flirting with him. And just as well, because I started crushing on someone else (not in the company, for the record) and he started dating a girl from his hometown over the winter and pretty much stopped texting me altogether, unless it was work-related. We still continue to be great friends.

So fast forward to yesterday. One of my coworkers in our group, Sam, threw a party/BBQ at his place after work and invited our usual crew. Jack’s girlfriend, Lisa, was visiting him this weekend, so he took her along. It was mainly us sitting around, drinking and talking, while Sam grilled. Lisa and I were the only two girls there, and since she didn’t know anybody other than Jack, I struck up a conversation with her while a bunch of us were outside on the porch. She seemed really nice at first, and we were getting along. We start talking about work, and at this point, all the guys went inside to play video games, so it was just her and I outside talking. She asked about what I did, then asked how many other girls work there. I told her zero, and that I was the only one. Her face visibly dropped and she said “Really?” in a very judgmental tone. At the time, I was taken aback by the fact her demeanor just turned on a dime, so I just went on to say that it was weird at first, but they treat me like one of the guys, and we’re all friends, so it doesn’t really matter. She asked me if I had a boyfriend, which was pretty random, but I answered honestly and said no. She was silent for a second before she looked me dead in the eye and said “You better stay away from mine then.” I kind of just laughed uncomfortably, thinking she was just kidding, until she stood up and said, “No, really. If I find out you’ve been hanging out with him, I’ll ruin your goddamn life.” I was stunned. The things she was saying sounded like she was spouting lines from a badly-written movie. I didn’t really know what to say to that, so, probably not making much sense, I just said something to the effect of “I don’t know who you think you are, but you don’t get to tell me who I can and can’t hang out with.” I know I shouldn’t have even engaged, but she just made me so mad, and it all came out of nowhere! She stormed back into the house. I followed her in, and just hung out with the other guys, on opposite sides of the room from her for the rest of the night. Lisa kept making eye contact with me while touching Jack, but I just tried to ignore her. Jack didn’t seem to notice a thing, and didn’t act any differently toward me for the remainder of the party.

So now I don’t know what to do. For the record, I’m not scared of this girl on a personal level. She’s clearly ridiculous and crazy possessive. She also lives in Jack’s hometown, which is about 4 hours away from us, and this is the first time in the 7 or 8 months they’ve been together that she’s come to visit him, so it’s not like she’d be around to check up on me. Jack and I never hang out one-on-one, it’s always in a group. If I stopped hanging out with them and decided to live in fear of her, I’d be letting her win, and like I said to her, she doesn’t get to keep me away from my friends. However, I am scared about what she could do to me professionally. Jack and I are on the same team at work. We sit next to each other, we work on projects together and are in constant communication throughout the day. I’m afraid she could tell Jack a rumor about me to make him uncomfortable around me at work. Or, she could make up something really bad, Jack could believe her, get the company involved and have my job be in jeopardy. I worked so hard for this job, and it’s a golden opportunity for people in our industry – I wouldn’t get the experience or opportunities anywhere else. I get the vibe that she’s done this to other girls before, since she was so quick to launch right into a threat, and I don’t want her to actually ruin my life if she has the capability.

So what should I do? Should I bring up to Jack that his girlfriend made me uncomfortable? What worries me is it’s my word against hers at this point, since no one else was outside with us, and he has no real incentive to believe me over his girlfriend, who he seems to really like. Sam and I have gotten very close over the last few months, and Sam is also very close with Jack – should I confide in Sam what happened, and maybe he can low-key bring it up to Jack? Or should I just drop it completely and try to move on with my life? Any advice would be appreciated. 

TL,DR: My coworker's girlfriend threatened to ""ruin my life"" if I continue to hang out with him."
6qe7ez,58,2017-07-29,"Advice for new freshman on succeeding your first year in Engineering/Science, etc",terrawp,OSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSU/comments/6qe7ez/advice_for_new_freshman_on_succeeding_your_first/,"Here is some advice that you will either a) already know b) roll your eyes at because you think you're good, c) be happy you followed or d) wish you had followed while you start looking for other majors to apply for.

This advice is for freshman who are looking into majors that have minimum or competitive GPAs to be accepted. This is meant to be encouraging but also let you get a head start into reality ""before its too late.""  I will try to make this general, since every program has slightly different requirements on tranfers, makeup classs policies, which classes they consider, etc.

So here it goes:

Don't underestimate college. Spend the absolute majority of your time focusing on getting into your major and then you'll have smooth sailing the rest of your four years and have a much higher probability for success, fun, and friends.

Many degrees, those from the science and engineering departments for example, require you to finish about 2-3 semesters before you can apply.  Your very first semester out of the house (possibly?) you'll be taking 12-18 credit hours.  Many, if not all, will be calculated together to determine whether or not you've got what it statistically takes to be successful in the OSU program for X degree.  Some of these classes you take will be 5 credit hours, such as calculus and physics. In fact, Calc 1 and 2, Physics 1 and 2, is 20 hours right there, a whole ~1/6 of your entire degree.  This means these are pretty important classes.  But, they only make up part of your schedule. There's other classes that may also count for your entrance GPA, though maybe 3 or 4 credit hours, that also require your focus. However, these 5 credit hour classes are notoriously difficult for many students (just search this sub for physics 1250 or calc 1151 or calc 1172) and a low grade in them can hurt.

So what's the big deal? Just do well like you did in high school, right?  But the thing is, now you're in college.  College is harder.  One subject, say Physics 1, is likely much more fast paced and rigorous in college in 16 weeks than it was over an entire year in high school. But many students make the mistake of underestimating this. The best thing to do is prepare for a class to be both difficult AND conquerable.  Meaning, plan and study a ton to get an A.  Some will say, ""Oh come on, it can't be that hard."" And that's true for some people.  Some will get an A quite easily while others will spend hours on end to barely make a C.  But which one are you?  After all, you're new to college, so how can you know what worked in high school will work in college?  The answer is simply to plan ahead, stay on top of material, and don't fall behind.  By assuming it's difficult, but still possible, to get an A, you'll know that you need to plan to spend a long time studying and that other floormates might go off to do fun sounding stuff but you know you should probably study.  Some may not be in a difficult major, or some might be in your same and either be very quick at understanding the material, or they might be some of the ones that fail out. You're all freshman so everyone is having a great time.

Your day's and week's schedule can be misleading.  Your first week will feel like a breeze.  You'll be meeting people, getting used to the campus and where to eat, do laundry... After all, first time on your own.  Then the second week comes around, and you're still learning the ropes of living on your own and love hanging out with a small group of friends you met.  You're doing some homework here and there.  Then you meet a girl or guy you like and hey, that's cool. Going along with your weeks, and suddenly the professor tells you about your first midterm.  Not just one, but maybe 3-5 of them across your classes.  But wait, it's only been 5-6 weeks, we just started!  Well, that's a third of the semester... Time for a ""mid""-term.  So no biggie, you study a few hours, after all, your friends only studied a few hours and you want to go play volleyball.  Test day rolls around, and you get a 60.  This 60 isn't horribly failing, but say the exam was worth 20 or 25% of your final grade.. You've now almost immediately dropped out of potential A/A- range, and you're sitting at a B assuming you get 100s on everything else, even the final.  That won't happen.

So say you shrug it off, and focus on other classes, and before you know it, second midterm rolls around and this time you prepare more, but just slightly.  Now you got a 70, but now your highest potential grade is a C+ (of course, this is different for every class, but for example..). Then the final rolls around, you're stressed, you're doing only so-so in your other classes, and you don't know how everything moved so fast from starting your first day as a wide-eyed freshman to burying your head in books until 3 am and waking up 5 hours later.  You barely scrape by with a C- in a few classes and are happy to have your first semester done.

""And hey, C's earn degrees!"" was the advice you got from the guy/gal who didn't apply to a degree with a gpa-requirement.  This doesn't apply to you since you've heard that unless you have a 3.0 or above, you'll have a super hard time finding an internship, which are very important for employment 4 years from now. ""Whoa, 4 years. That's so long off and i've got time!"" you think.  So now you decide to get your shit together, and maybe start studying more, learn more effective strategies, and maybe eventually turn it around in your second semester.  Then comes time to apply for your major and you're just below it.  ""But I gave it all I could!"" you said.  And for some, this really will be true. But for many, they actually didn't, they just don't see it and underestimated the difficulty of college.  You see, that exam you took that was 20 or 30% of your grade? A few extra hours per week could have turned that 60 to a 90.  But now, you're 3 semesters in and trying to apply for your major, missing the cut off, and potentially looking to take an extra semester to pad your grades, or re-take a class you took. This time taking class X, you're going to take it seriously, you say.  So then if this is a possibility, why not take it seriously the first time?  Why not assume you should maybe study 15 hours instead of 3 for that midterm?

By over-estimating the difficulty, but still knowing it's possible, you can then re-evaluate your study habits from a better position.  After EVERY exam, students do this consciously or subconsciously.  But wouldn't you rather say ""Hmm, I studied 15 hours for that exam, got a 95, so maybe I'll try just 12 next time. Cool.  Good job on that A self."" instead of ""Oh shit, I barely studied for that first exam and failed. Now my grade is low and I NEED to ace this next exam or i'm screwed, ah shit.""  In the latter scenario, you're stressed, you're pissed, you're now unhappy and start to blame everyone else or the professor on your bad grade. While it may feel good to bitch for the time being, bitching won't get you into your major.

So here's the point of all this.  Take it seriously the first time if you're serious about a major that has admittance requirements.  This isn't to say don't have fun, don't socialize, don't meet new people and friends... No, do all of those things. Stay happy and balanced. Enjoy college and all it has to offer, in moderation (don't drink too much, make sure to wear a condom, don't be an asshole/creep, always respect girls).

But, the only thing you don't want to do is underestimate the effort that is required of you to meet your goals of getting into your major and the amazing opportunity to pursue a dream, passion, and career that will make a positive, lasting impact on your life and potentially the world.  If it's truly what you want to do, what's a few more hours a week?

Lastly, this isn't meant to stress anyone out, just a reality check. It's all very possible by studying effectively, asking other students who've taken classes what to expect, going to office hours, doing all your assignments and going to class. Not getting too distracted by being out of the house for the first time and having freedom, or that hot girl/guy, or drinking ""natty lites bro."" Again, you may be 10x smarter than the average engineering student. You may only need to study 5 hours to get that A.  You may be on top of all of this. Then good for you, but from experience, and other people on this sub can hopefully back me up, that isn't everyone.  When you sit in calc 1 and physics 1... Look around, because at least 1/3 of them won't make it because they underestimated the class and decided to spend their time some other way.  But it's all possible.  There's tons of people in these majors, but they're the ones who often buckled down, or maybe had a few low grades, but turned shit around and are now better students for it. 

The reward to all of this is then entrance into your major, knowing what it takes to succeed in college, and a relatively smooth rest of your time at OSU because of it. A decent GPA to get an internship, then a degree and hopefully the job of your dreams to give you the life you always wanted.  Huge reward for a little more planning your first semester.

Have fun and best of luck to all the new incoming freshman.  You're in more control over how the next four years pan out, and consequently your whole life, than you realize, and that's pretty damn empowering if you ask me.

Welcome to OSU :)"
6qeq1g,13,2017-07-29,"Decided to get a Gastric Balloon, a lot of information included, many aspects discussed. Will update this thread every step of the way :)",SecretsStar_Isabelle,wls,https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/6qeq1g/decided_to_get_a_gastric_balloon_a_lot_of/,"Hey all :)


Let me introduce myself first. **I am a Doctor, fresh graduate, from Egypt. Female, began packing on the weight about 12 years ago.** I was a pretty healthy and active child, but I guess I learnt some bad eating habits at puberty, along with the lack of exercise and my hatred for sports later on. My mental and psychological problems have been the major contributor since I was 16.


I have tried a lot of diets, going to the gym, pretty much everything. But now between therapy, preparing for new exams, being an intern, and caring after a lot of people in my family, **I am not doing well at all regarding weight loss. All my plans seem to be crashing.**

A few days ago, I was advised by a family member to get a **gastric balloon**, particularly my mother. She was also struggling with weight loss, mainly because of her hypothyroidism and failing to lose her recent baby weight. Taking thyroxine helped but still not enough to lose weight, just maintenance of current one. She refused invasive procedures, so her doctor suggested a gastric balloon and she lost about 10 kg in a 3 months period despite having a very very weak metabolism.

**At first I did refuse. Quite aggressively. I am a firm believer in diet and exercise.**  On rethinking, I asked myself, do I even exercise now ? Last time in the gym I got my treadmill to a brisk walk and I fell over, hurting my arms. Can I even maintain a healthy diet now ? My whole day is pretty whacked up, and it would definitely helped if at least I ate smaller portions. The balloon actually helps you in implementing this change of a healthy eating and working out.

**Bottom line is I went for it and I am doing it this week.**

There are **many aspects, however, of my journey** that I'd like to get off my chest, and maybe help others in the process. These are my personal notes, related to body image, my previous attempts in weight loss and finally some information on my new decision:  



1- **Never completely surrender to other people's opinions about your body and health.** I am 164 cm, 95 kg. On some people, that would look severely obese, but on me, I have never looked that fat. I am usually perceived as a very attractive person. Yet other people have told me the exact opposite. Some days I'd wear a top or a skirt that showcases my curves and I'd get compliments. Other days I'd wear tights and get serious inquiries about my health and weight.

I suggest you set your own standards. You are the one who should define if you're comfortable or not. If you feel overweight and struggling, then try to lose weight. Doesn't matter how many compliments you get. **But all within the healthy range of course. **


2- **We are beautiful at every size, but not healthy at every size.** Trying to prove anything different will take its toll on your mental and physical health, and you will regret it later in life.



3- **But that doesn't mean you should be rude, unwelcoming or discriminatory to any obese individual.** Their life choices AND conditions are only theirs. **You are not helping either.** Some people, I included at some points, have had a very negative reaction to such comments that promoted my self-harming policy even more. Just stay away, unless you're a friend/family/spouse.



4- **Speaking of which, kindness is free.** It never hurts to be compassionate. Do not judge others. You never know what kind of life they have.

Medical research has showed that obesity is a horrible problem that is very multi-factorial in origin. **Genetics, family habits, physical conditions and mental health are all factors to take in consideration.** Things you may have not experienced, and I wish you don't because they are not as easy to get rid of as you think. **Some people here argue that they were raised within fat families and taught horrible habits and yet they managed to change it for themselves. That's excellent, but it is not an excuse for you to treat other people who can't or are medically incapable of, without interference, poorly. Or even blame them. It is none of your business to start with. **



5- **What defines obesity ? What defines 'healthy' ?**

There are a lot of factors that you can take in, and others are not that reliable. If you're conflicted, then ask yourself these questions:

a- Am I fully functional ? Do I find great difficulty walking the distances other people my age find easy ?

Personal example: I am short of breath after two flights of stairs in the hospital I was trained in. My colleagues never were.

b- Do I have any obesity-related conditions ? What if I have a risk factor that I don't know of ? You can do a full body check up (offered by labs here in Egypt, don't know about other countries) and it will give you a pretty objective result.

Personal example: I never suffered DM or hypertension. But I know it is a very good possibility once I cross 40 (Estrogen in females are protective from heart disease till menopause, that's when the risk is equl to that of males). I did a check up and I found I have hyperlipidemia. That is not normal or healthy.

c- Am I enjoying myself ? Or Am I limited to a certain lifestyle ? Would I like to change that ?

Personal example: I always have to wear stuff I don't like. I can't run. I can't enjoy athletic events with my friends because I cn't keep up ( and they're pretty normal, not professionally athletic or anything ) .. I always wear long shorts under skirts and dresses because of chaffing.



5- **If you have come to a conclusion that you are obese/overweight, and need some change, then you have to set your priorities straight:**


a- Check on your mental and psychological health. If you feel that you have a problem, seek therapy. It's more than half of the solution.

b- Talk to a GP and exclude any conditions contributing to obesity as Cushing's and hypothyroidism.

c- Evaluate your lifestyle, and go for changes. Diet and working out are the pillars of course.

d- I always always always recommend the traditional route of diet and exercise. But if you have failed for a number of times, without the presence of any conditions as previously stated, then you should visit a specialist and consider bariatric surgery/gastric balloons (which I prefer to surgery)



6- **Speaking of lifestyle changes, everyone's different. Very different actually.** That's why a lot of us have previously failed in our attempts of weight loss. The usual advice we get is 'gym and healthy eating', and I second that. But the details of that kind of lifestyle, is very very variable from one person to another. Knowing this would have saved me a lot of wasted time, money and effort. You have to think a little about what's comfortable and actually doable for you.

A doctor who works 48 hours shifts in a critical care unit has a routine that is completely different from a bank manager who works an 8 hours shift in an air conditioned office. Their body needs are different, and so are they as individuals.

For example when a friend first started a diet, someone recommended she should start by counting my calories. She got depressed pretty quickly and it was very hard for her. So she just went for healthy choices (ex: eating grilled fish instead of fried, and not paying attention to the calories for now) , and she lost a lot of weight back then. Later on, the calorie thing worked for her, when she got more accustomed to the whole routine. She kept the weight off for a very long time (till now).

**Learn what you love, think outside of the box.**


7-** A little push is not wrong.** Never judge another person, or yourself, for considering gastric balloons or surgeries. It is ,in many cases, life-saving. It gets you on your feet, helps you to taste a little of the life you have been missing on. Of course learning self-control and good habits is crucial, but what if your lifestyle/conditions are not helping ? What if you lack incentive ? What if you have difficulty exercising at your current weight ?



8- **And lastly, some information on gastric balloons**:

These are inflatable balloons inserted into your stomach. They are usually made of silicone (inert) and filled with saline. That way, they take up a lot of your stomach, and you get full pretty early.

They can be done using general or local anaesthesia, according to your preference, your condition and your doctor. It is done without any cutting, so it is not invasive. Inserted by an upper endoscope, that goes from your mouth to your stomach. Done by a gastroenterologist, who of course, should have some expertise in this field.

They are put in place for about 6 to 12 months then removed, they are not permanent and do not interfere with your normal anatomy.

You eat a liquid diet for about 7-10 days post procedure, in which you lose about 4 kg, then you are slowly transitioning back to the normal food you usually eat. There are no food restrictions. However, very rich food can cause some discomfort.

Your appetite will be severely affected and that's part of the objective. You won't feel hungry as often and you will tolerate less portions. It is very suitable for people struggling with hunger and portion control. It is a matter of taking it as a habit afterwards (i.e after removal) to maintain the weight loss.

Some medical researches state that it helps in losing 30% of your excess body weight in the 6 months period, but many people have experienced losing most or all of their excess body weight in that period. It differs from one person to another, I think.


**So I'll be doing it this week. I will keep this thread updated on any changes I feel after the procedure, and of course, on my weight on a weekly basis.**

Any comments, questions or discussions are very welcome. Thank you :)


**Update 1: I went to my Dr today. He did a full general and local examination, which means he made sure my vital signs are good, have no respiratory or cardiac problems and no abdominal conditions. I was already suffering from IBS, but he told me it was irrelevant. No endoscopy involved in this examination. Procedure scheduled for next Sunday.**


**Update 2: Woke up from anaesthesia a few hours ago. The whole procedure didn't take more than half an hour. A canula is first inserted then you go to the OR where the anesthesiologist gives you Halothane, then an upper GIT endoscopy specialist operates. You don't feel a thing. After I went home, I felt some discomfort (a lot of belching and some nausea). I was prescribed an antiemetic and an antispasmodic.**

6qevjz,2,2017-07-29,"I need your help, we’re giving each other space, but I don’t know what to do and the timing is wrong.",quick201290,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/6qevjz/i_need_your_help_were_giving_each_other_space_but/,"A few weeks ago my girlfriend told me that her feelings changed, that she wasn’t feeling as strongly as she did to begin with, but she still has feelings for me. 

She’s 21 and I’m 26, I’m her first boyfriend, first kiss, first date etc., mutual friends have told me that she’s never had any interest in getting into a relationship with anyone, she’s always been happy being single, she’s the first girl that I could officially call my girlfriend, but I’ve been involved with other girls before, so a proper relationship is new for me, but not as new as it is for her. We met at uni (university), so we were friends for at least a year before we started dating, which I think could be one of the main reasons things aren’t great at the moment, that progression from a friendship to a relationship.

Early on in our relationship she introduced me to her extended family, introduced me to her friends, I’ve shown her a lot of new places and experiences, we’ve been incredibly happy together, she’s got a lot of picture of us on her Instagram and facebook, her family thinks we’re really good together, particularly her sister who she does everything with, family is everything to her, she does a lot with her family, so her family and sister thinking we’re really good together is a big deal to her. She’s told me that she’s missed me, she thinks we’re compatible, I make her laugh, happy etc. everything sounds perfect.

We’ve had a couple of talks about her feelings changing, the first talk we didn’t really get anywhere, she told me that I’m her bestfriend and she didn’t want to lose me, she cares for me, I make her happy, she’s happy and comfortable around me, I ‘tick all the boxes’ and I’m everything she could ever want in a boyfriend, so understandably that left me confused as to why we were even having this talk. A few things I did get out of it though was that she said her feelings changed a couple of months ago after I got into a little bit of road rage (I didn’t get out of the car or roll my window down, it was nothing violent or overly aggressive, just annoyance), she said that wasn’t what caused her feelings to change, but after then she said that she just started thinking of me differently. This talk went around in circles, and we were both crying at the thought of losing each other, we obviously both care about each other a lot, so talk ended with me say “I still want you to be my girlfriend, do you still want me to be your boyfriend?” she said “yes, but I just want things to be good again”, and that’s where we left it.

We went out that weekend to dinner, and we both had a really good time as I dropped her home she was laughing and smiling, kissed me and hugged me goodbye. The following Friday (a week after the first talk) we had another talk, we covered a lot of the same ground, going around in circles again. This time I stressed that we really needed to figure out what exactly went wrong considering we’re happy with each other and there’s no negativity. I thought I was being a little needy and that could’ve caused a bit of an issue, I asked her this before, because I’m a much more emotional and affectionate person than she is, when I’ve asked her this before she’s said no, but this time she said a little, but she said not like a typical needy person, just like when we’re at uni together, she said I didn’t have to sit next to her all the time and I could’ve sat with my friends, things like that. We also both came up with communication being an issue, and to go with that space; when we were on uni breaks we’d normally see each other anywhere from once to three times a week, and when uni’s on may five days a week, something came up about her every now and then hesitating about wanting to go out, and she thought that was a problem, I asked her why she might’ve hesitated, and she said that she either has things to do or just needs to rest, I told her that if she just came out and said that to me that wouldn’t have been a problem, and that’s when I said she needs to communicate more, she agreed with me; we also brought up space, saying that we’ve just been doing things together, ignoring our friends, not going to the gym anymore, and just not doing things for ourselves. So that when I said maybe we just need to give each other some space for a bit to see our friends and get our lives back on track.

We didn’t give each other a timeframe for this space, so far it’s been three weeks. I told her that we can still message each other when we feel like it, but just not as much as we normally do, she mentioned something about keeping our ‘snapstreak’ on snapchat, I said yeah we’ll still do that, and we’d still tag each other in facebook posts when we feel like it. So we’ve been keeping all that going still, over the past three weeks we’ve probably tagged each other once each week and sent good morning snapchats to keep that streak. I’ve been posting in my snapchat story to slyly show her I’m going out and enjoying myself. We’ve got a couple of group chats, a facebook one, and a snapchat one, and she’s been messaging things in those that she’d normally just send to me, and we’d start a conversation just between us in these chats, I think everyone else knows what’s going on there.

I know this is a very long post, and I’ve left out a lot of details, but this part is my main issue. At the moment we’re both on very stressful 10 week internship, she gets very very stressed, which I’m thinking is what caused her to say what she said when she did, because that was our last week of uni with a lot of assignments due. So what I’m trying to get at is that this ‘giving space’ couldn’t have come at a worse time, we’re are both very stressed, and this internship is her biggest focus at the moment, she’s not going to have time to think about me, she’s not going to have that time to miss me or think about us. There’re are eight weeks left of this internship, and I don’t want to wait that long to know where we stand, but I also feel like me doing or saying something soon is going to end it all for good, and I really don’t want that. She’s shown plenty of signs of reaching out to me over these past three weeks, like the group chats, and on Friday we were messaging for a very long time about our internship, she asked me for help in the morning, but got held up, so we started talking about that later in the day, so she’s wanting to talk to me, I’m just in a really hard place at the moment, everything is there for us to have a really good relationship, I just want her to realise that feelings do change, but that could be for any number of reasons, and not bad reasons, things could just be becoming normal now, or she could be trying to figure out how I fit into her life, and like she said, I’m everything she wants in a boyfriend, she needs the time to see how good we are, but the timing’s all wrong.

Please help.

TL;DR My girlfriend and I are trying to give each other space, to fix our relationship, but a 10 weeks internship and stress is not giving us time to think about each other or our relationship."
6qew2r,6,2017-07-29,"Decided to get a Gastric Balloon, a lot of information included, many aspects discussed. Will update this thread every step of the way :)",SecretsStar_Isabelle,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6qew2r/decided_to_get_a_gastric_balloon_a_lot_of/,"Hey all :)

Let me introduce myself first. **I am a Doctor, fresh graduate, from Egypt. Female, began packing on the weight about 12 years ago.** I was a pretty healthy and active child, but I guess I learnt some bad eating habits at puberty, along with the lack of exercise and my hatred for sports later on. My mental and psychological problems have been the major contributor since I was 16.

I have tried a lot of diets, going to the gym, pretty much everything. **But now between therapy, preparing for new exams, being an intern, and caring after a lot of people in my family, I am not doing well at all regarding weight loss. All my plans seem to be crashing.**

A few days ago, I was advised by a family member **to get a gastric balloon, particularly my mother.** She was also struggling with weight loss, mainly because of her hypothyroidism and failing to lose her recent baby weight. Taking thyroxine helped but still not enough to lose weight, just maintenance of current one. She refused invasive procedures, so her doctor suggested a gastric balloon and she lost about 10 kg in a 3 months period despite having a very very weak metabolism.

**At first I did refuse. Quite aggressively. I am a firm believer in diet and exercise.** On rethinking, I asked myself, do I even exercise now ? Last time in the gym I got my treadmill to a brisk walk and I fell over, hurting my arms. Can I even maintain a healthy diet now ? My whole day is pretty whacked up, and it would definitely helped if at least I ate smaller portions. The balloon actually helps you in implementing this change of a healthy eating and working out.


**Bottom line is I went for it and I am doing it this week.**

There are **many aspects, however, of my journey** that I'd like to get off my chest, and maybe help others in the process. These are my personal notes, related to body image, my previous attempts in weight loss and finally some information on my new decision:


1- **Never completely surrender to other people's opinions about your body and health.**  I am 164 cm, 95 kg. On some people, that would look severely obese, but on me, I have never looked that fat. I am usually perceived as a very attractive person. Yet other people have told me the exact opposite. Some days I'd wear a top or a skirt that showcases my curves and I'd get compliments. Other days I'd wear tights and get serious inquiries about my health and weight.

**I suggest you set your own standards.** You are the one who should define if you're comfortable or not. If you feel overweight and struggling, then try to lose weight. Doesn't matter how many compliments you get. **But all within the healthy range of course.**


2- **We are beautiful at every size, but not healthy at every size.** Trying to prove anything different will take its toll on your mental and physical health, and you will regret it later in life.


3- **But that doesn't mean you should be rude, unwelcoming or discriminatory to any obese individual**. Their life choices AND conditions are only theirs. **You are not helping either.** Some people, I included at some points, have had a very negative reaction to such comments that promoted my self-harming policy even more. Just stay away, unless you're a friend/family/spouse.


4- **Speaking of which, kindness is free.** It never hurts to be compassionate. Do not judge others. You never know what kind of life they have.

Medical research has showed that obesity is a horrible problem that is very multi-factorial in origin. **Genetics, family habits, physical conditions and mental health are all factors to take in consideration**. Things you may have not experienced, and I wish you don't because they are not as easy to get rid of as you think. **Some people here argue that they were raised within fat families and taught horrible habits and yet they managed to change it for themselves. That's excellent, but it is not an excuse for you to treat other people who can't or are medically incapable of, without interference, poorly. Or even blame them. It is none of your business to start with**


5- **What defines obesity ? What defines 'healthy' ?**
There are a lot of factors that you can take in, and others are not that reliable. If you're conflicted, then ask yourself these questions:

a- Am I fully functional ? Do I find great difficulty walking the distances other people my age find easy ?

Personal example: I am short of breath after two flights of stairs in the hospital I was trained in. My colleagues never were.

b- Do I have any obesity-related conditions ? What if I have a risk factor that I don't know of ? You can do a full body check up (offered by labs here in Egypt, don't know about other countries) and it will give you a pretty objective result.

Personal example: I never suffered DM or hypertension. But I know it is a very good possibility once I cross 40 (Estrogen in females are protective from heart disease till menopause, that's when the risk is equl to that of males). I did a check up and I found I have hyperlipidemia. That is not normal or healthy.

c- Am I enjoying myself ? Or Am I limited to a certain lifestyle ? Would I like to change that ?

Personal example: I always have to wear stuff I don't like. I can't run. I can't enjoy athletic events with my friends because I can't keep up ( and they're pretty normal, not professionally athletic or anything ) .. I always wear long shorts under skirts and dresses because of chaffing.

5- **If you have come to a conclusion that you are obese/overweight, and need some change, then you have to set your priorities straight:**

a- Check on your mental and psychological health. If you feel that you have a problem, seek therapy. It's more than half of the solution.

b- Talk to a GP and exclude any conditions contributing to obesity as Cushing's and hypothyroidism.

c- Evaluate your lifestyle, and go for changes. Diet and working out are the pillars of course.

d- I always always always recommend the traditional route of diet and exercise. But if you have failed for a number of times, without the presence of any conditions as previously stated, then you should visit a specialist and consider bariatric surgery/gastric balloons (which I prefer to surgery)


6- **Speaking of lifestyle changes, everyone's different. Very different actually.** That's why a lot of us have previously failed in our attempts of weight loss. The usual advice we get is 'gym and healthy eating', and I second that. But the details of that kind of lifestyle, is very very variable from one person to another. Knowing this would have saved me a lot of wasted time, money and effort. You have to think a little about what's comfortable and actually doable for you.

A doctor who works 48 hours shifts in a critical care unit has a routine that is completely different from a bank manager who works an 8 hours shift in an air conditioned office. Their body needs are different, and so are they as individuals.

For example when a friend first started a diet, someone recommended she should start by counting my calories. She got depressed pretty quickly and it was very hard for her. So she just went for healthy choices (ex: eating grilled fish instead of fried, and not paying attention to the calories for now) , and she lost a lot of weight back then. Later on, the calorie thing worked for her, when she got more accustomed to the whole routine. She kept the weight off for a very long time (till now).
Learn what you love, think outside of the box.


7-**A little push is not wrong.** Never judge another person, or yourself, for considering gastric balloons or surgeries. It is ,in many cases, life-saving. It gets you on your feet, helps you to taste a little of the life you have been missing on. Of course learning self-control and good habits is crucial, but what if your lifestyle/conditions are not helping ? What if you lack incentive ? What if you have difficulty exercising at your current weight ?


8- **And lastly, some information on gastric balloons:**


These are inflatable balloons inserted into your stomach. They are usually made of silicone (inert) and filled with saline. That way, they take up a lot of your stomach, and you get full pretty early.


They can be done using general or local anaesthesia, according to your preference, your condition and your doctor. It is done without any cutting, so it is not invasive. Inserted by an upper endoscope, that goes from your mouth to your stomach. Done by a gastroenterologist, who of course, should have some expertise in this field.


They are put in place for about 6 to 12 months then removed, they are not permanent and do not interfere with your normal anatomy.

You eat a liquid diet for about 7-10 days post procedure, in which you lose about 4 kg, then you are slowly transitioning back to the normal food you usually eat. There are no food restrictions. However, very rich food can cause some discomfort.

Your appetite will be severely affected and that's part of the objective. You won't feel hungry as often and you will tolerate less portions. It is very suitable for people struggling with hunger and portion control. It is a matter of taking it as a habit afterwards (i.e after removal) to maintain the weight loss.

Some medical researches state that it helps in losing 30% of your excess body weight in the 6 months period, but many people have experienced losing most or all of their excess body weight in that period. It differs from one person to another, I think.



**So I'll be doing it this week. I will keep this thread updated on any changes I feel after the procedure, and of course, on my weight on a weekly basis.**

Any comments, questions or discussions are very welcome. Thank you :)



**Update 1: I went to my Dr today. He did a full general and local examination, which means he made sure my vital signs are good, have no respiratory or cardiac problems and no abdominal conditions. I was already suffering from IBS, but he told me it was irrelevant. No endoscopy involved in this examination. Procedure scheduled for next Sunday.**

**Update 2: Woke up from anaesthesia a few hours ago. The whole procedure didn't take more than half an hour. A canula is first inserted then you go to the OR where the anesthesiologist gives you Halothane, then an upper GIT endoscopy specialist operates. You don't feel a thing. After I went home, I felt some discomfort (a lot of belching and some nausea). I was prescribed an antiemetic and an antispasmodic.**"
6qexm1,4,2017-07-29,Running out of energy,imperfectbiologic,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/6qexm1/running_out_of_energy/,"I feel drained. I feel like biologically I'm past my prime, and all those years going through college, preparing for medical school, going through medical school, and going through intern year, on top of all of life's stresses, has essentially drained me and I feel like I'm running on fumes. I don't know how I'm going to continue keeping this up for the rest of residency (not to mention the years after). I see people around me who seem unaffected by all of this when I just feel utterly drained and just yearn for a long long time off to just recuperate, do silly things, and sleep. My body isn't getting any younger and I wake up feeling exhausted, go home feeling numb, and repeat the cycle all over the next day. It's also very hard to study and retain things in this state and it even leaves me wondering if my brain is still even able to keep up with all of this knowledge/information I'm expected to retain. It's now 2-3 cups of coffee/day, which now is essentially just for the taste as I still nod off during conference, coffee or not. I also feel like I missed out on so much and gave so many years of my life due to the tremendous training period and I'll never get them back. And sadly for my specialty I still have many years left. Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences. "
6qf1fx,1,2017-07-29,20 [M4R] Boston - Gym buddy,FatRoman,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/6qf1fx/20_m4r_boston_gym_buddy/,"
What I'm looking for:

Title says it all - someone to work out with. I'd prefer someone in the same general weight range so half the workout isn't changing weights but have no problem doing so for someone serious about their workout. The only issue is that I'm only in the area for the summer and don't have access to a car so I can't really travel to a gym. There's a gym close to where I live so that's the only place I can really workout atm. 

Some more info about me:

I say Boston but I'm in the Allston area for an internship.  I've always exercised but it wasn't till the last 2-3 months that I got serious about it. I'm decently strong (275 squat, 225 bench) for my body weight (185) but I definitely still have a lot of work to do. I'm used to working out in a team environment or with a friend so it feels strange to be working out alone.
  
I've looked around and never seen a r4r ad about gym buddies so let me know if this kind of post isn't kosher. Also, don't be thrown off by anything I said. I'm still very much a beginner so if you're a nice person feel free to reach out. PM me if interested and I can share the location of the gym I go to. Thanks!

I just got to the am I the asshole about the gay guy getting the woman fired. Woody said hitting on someone at the office is very innapropriate, however if you really wanna go out with a work friend how do you then approach them? I would guess best case scenario is yall share a group of friends and when yall hangout outside of work you flirt with her. If this isn't the case however what would you do? I'm majoring in Comp Sci and will me starting an office job in the next few years maybe sooner with internships and would like to know the answer to this before I make a mistake.

I heard somewhere around here or /r/wakingtitan about the Blue decoder disk outer ring's new things around the edges.  Something about melting points of things.

Some of these looked like years of note to me.  And the others, I don't know why, but I thought maybe they were mentioned in sci fi or had some astronomical/scientific importance... So I went a diggin' to see what I could find for any of 'em.

I bet it has no correlation to anything, but... it's still *very* interesting to see what shows up when one does some digging on the numbers...  

I will list them in order, 4-9, A-F, and they're correlating number on the outer wheel.  Oh yeah, of course 0 - 3 just have the two dots which means nothing (unless you use Morse, then it's an I.)

9 has 2157, again not a year.  But the story by Issac Asimov, 'The Fun They Had', takes place in this year.  It's a short story about kids in that time who go to a special room of the house to do their learning.  One of them finds a book that tells about an earlier time when kids went to 'school' and had a 'teacher'.  They then imagine what it must have been like, and 'what fun they must have had.'

B has 961.  It is a perfect square, the largest square with strictly decreasing digits, and a lot of other mathematic things of note.  But it seems NOTHING much happened, and nothing that would relate to NMS or Atlas or such.  Very strange.

But as an experiment, I went with 'BC' to see what happens... and there we go:

961 BC, Rama is born, according to Hindu Astronomy, or so this one source I found said.  Let us say it's truth, and therefore it's obviously a reference to the book 'Rendevous with Rama'.  

Other interestings of 961 I found:

Country code of Lebanon

Get this, in Lebanon today, there's a place/entity called 'WOW event'. It is very similar to the 'WOW Signal', so I'm choosing to believe it's not a coincidence. 

XKCD 961 is about Steve Jobs who died the day earlier to its posting.  It's called Eternal Flame.

KOI-961 is now called Kepler 42, and is a red dwarf 126 LY away.

C has 3414.  Again not a year.  Still, stuff can be assigned to it:

Part of the number SDSS J1531+3414, which is a mass in the universe that produces gravitational lensing (bending of light around it).  

3414 BTU is 1000 watts. (ok, fine, 1000.545, geez)

Nature.com's article 3414 is about quasiparticle dynamics and spin-orbital texture of the SrTiO3 2D electron gas.  Say that 3 times fast. :p  I figure it has something to do with the universe so maybe it's important.  It also has Ti in it, so...

---

D has 3033  Not a year.  But stuff:

AST 3033 is a particular astronomy course at unis, however, the subject and material can be different at each university.  I guess its some sort of default code in their computers...?

NIH 3033 is a Mercury related safety of handling/acquiring/disposing policy.

RFC 3033 is a request for comments in 2001 regarding	networking... stuff.  I'm lazy.  It crossed my eyes.  It really doesn't have importance to me enough to read it, sorry.  It's about networking though. 
:p  Go read it if you want, but it seems to count to me.

DD3033 is a Department of Defense (USA) Pathways Program Internship Program Participant Form and Agreement.  Perhaps needed to be part of that Pentagon Program, Titanwatch...?

IBM 3033 ""The Big One"".  IBM's 1977 top of the line processor at the time.  Big stuff, took up a room.  Relevant.

E is 1768.  Yay, back to a year!:

August 26, The HMS Endeavour first sets sail.  Later, James Cook would command her his later voyages.

---

F has -38.  I took it to mean '38 BC':

This correlates to Year 1 of the Spanish Era Calendar.  Aka, 'time is relative', I think.

Also, it's the beginning of the Pax Romana.

Not much else of note happened as relates to Atlas.

6qfob4,6,2017-07-30,Anyone other INFJ leaders here? Do you have leader burnout?,ikonoklastic,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/6qfob4/anyone_other_infj_leaders_here_do_you_have_leader/,"Hi yall, long-time lurker. 


I've led several crews, and while there are things I love (being able to teach people new skills, seeing them grow and when they start to 'get it', seeing them come to love the work I love, seeing the crew come together) at the moment and in the past there have been moments where I've struggled with feeling unappreciated and, after a point, hearing a lot of complaining (our work is outdoors, physically demanding, and we live in the elements. this crew is young and new to the work, so a lot of it I understand and sympathize with, but after a point it becomes a drain and i find i have little patience for extensive complaining even if that's how some people need to cope with a situation. although on some level i prefer to hear complaints than have a silent suffering crew). 


So I'm wondering if anyone else here is in a leadership position, and what specifically do you do when you begin to feel burned out or unappreciated? sometimes my boss tells me i'm doing a good job, but it doesn't provide me with a sense of confirmation/satisfaction even though i can tell he's being genuine. (and with that, i can see where maybe if i found a way to take those compliments more to heart, then i might feel less burned out) if you are a leader, and don't ever feel unappreciated, what do you recommend? 


I'll add that in some respects part of my feeling unappreciated is likely amplified by how stretched thin I've been this summer (doing an internship for grad school and a part-time job on top of my day job, but after this week  it will only be my day job) and that normally it doesn't get to me. "

The best way to predict what an experience will be like is to ask people who have been through that experience to describe it.

That's why experts say it's critical for prospective MBA students to visit business schools while classes are in session so they can speak with current students.

Harvard Business School alumna Betsy Massar says it is important for prospective MBA students to appreciate how challenging business school can be before they apply.

""Most of it is fabulously good, and some of it is not so good, and it’s important to have a realistic picture of what this experience is like,"" says Massar, the founder of Master Admissions, a California-based graduate school admissions consulting firm.

She says that, when prospective MBA students visit business school campuses, they should come prepared with tough questions. “It’s big ticket item,"" says Massar. ""You should really know as much as you can, and most people don’t.""
Here are eight questions that experts say prospective MBA students should ask when they visit business school campuses.

Questions for Current Students

What surprised you most about business school?

Massar says this open-ended question gives current students the opportunity to tell you whether their MBA program met or exceeded their expectations. It also can pinpoint areas where the business school's sales pitch is inconsistent with the student experience and areas where the school could use improvement.

How accessible are professors?

Kari Graham, director of graduate admissions at the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business, says current students are the best-equipped people on campus to answer questions about how approachable MBA professors are and whether those professors serve as mentors.

Is the culture of the school more collaborative or competitive?

Graham says MBA applicants should inquire about whether business schools rank students. “Some MBA programs have a more competitive edge than a collaborative edge, and that’s going to work really well for some people, but for other people, that’s not going to be a great learning environment for them,"" she says. ""So I think you have to look at yourself and see what’s going to motivate you to be your best and do your best.""

Jeff Magnuson, an independent marketing and brand consultant, says the advice and encouragement of his former MBA classmates at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill, was instrumental in allowing him to break into the marketing industry. He says prospective students should ask current students whether the atmosphere is cutthroat or supportive.

Question for Admissions Officers

Given my grades, test scores, work experience, and career goals, do you think I am a good fit for your MBA program?

Graham says it's rare for prospective MBA applicants to directly ask about their admissions chances and whether they fit a business school's typical student profile during campus visits, but they shouldn't be afraid to ask.

It invites the admissions officer to give honest feedback and strategic advice, Graham says

Question for Financial Aid Officers

What kinds of financial aid am I eligible to receive at your business school?

It's important to ask financial aid questions before creating your business school short list so that you apply to the right schools and maximize your chances of receiving scholarship offers, says Joseph Vijay Ingam, the head coach at the California-based Interview SOS, a college and graduate school admissions consulting company.
“You may end up going to a school that wasn’t your first, second or third choice, because you can’t say no to money,"" he says.

Questions for Career Services Counselors

What kinds of courses and clubs does the school offer in my target industry? Do MBA students get internships in that industry, and where do they work? What percentage of recent graduates work in my target industry?

Ingam says every business school has strengths and weaknesses and that prospective MBA students need to identify schools whose academic strengths align with their career goals.

""If you're interested in a specific subfield of business, which almost everyone is, you want to see that your school has strength in that particular field,"" Ingam says. ""Otherwise you could literally end up going to a school, spend $100,000 on your education or more and find out that you're not getting advancement within the subspecialty of business that you're interested in."""

As peculiar as it sounds, One Piece is a compelling and inspirational story that really has simple answers to what we might face in real life sometimes.

Started smoking weed at age 14, Sophomore Year(skipped a grade) of High School. Alcohol and Cigarettes enter the scene at age 15 along with Meth. Two years later, at age 17 I was smoking multiple joints per day, tried Cocaine then did it once every weekend, meth strictly once a month. GPA never fell below 3.9 for two and a half years. Took bunch of AP classes; requested to be moved up another grade and take the SAT sooner; cause high school was boring. I was on the Cross Country, Soccer, Swimming, and Wrestling team, to earn ""participation points"" for the Ivy League Schools.

Began learning how to code at age 16 every night after Kickboxing class with a fat blunt before going to sleep. At age 17, got accepted into UCLA for Masters in Software Engineering. Met new rich friends who liked doing drugs, fancy parties, and shiny objects. I dropped out of college my first year: at age 18 was smoking multiple joints and Cigarettes a day, doing cocaine 2-3 times a week, going to parties and replaced the yay with  Meth. Lost interest in Music, Sports, Games, TV, hanging out with friends, etc. Was working at an internship I got while in school for web development, making $25.66/hour. After another two years, I was declining. My mind couldn't understand code concepts as quickly, still in shape but lost muscle, motivation gone, felt physically weaker, and stopped going out. 

At age 20 in Barnes &amp; Nobles,  I noticed a One Piece manga and remembered watching it back in the day. Started reading it, Got obsessed. 50-60 chapters a day after work was finished and during my spare time for like three weeks straight.

In those 3 weeks, I didn't do any drugs besides smoke weed and Cigarettes, ate healthier, and exercised more.

ONE PIECE:

Luffy is a man with a single dream, to become King Of The Pirates in the golden era of piracy. He's not the brightest person, but is very determined and  relentless in achieving his goal. No matter how bad his situation is, he constantly takes action and pushes through with boundless optimism. You can't be the best at everything, so along his life journey; he meets his Nakama with varied skill sets that are incredibly loyal and fully support him. Whatever he lacks, they fill in  for his ""not so strong"" points. The Strawhats all have their own DREAMS/LIFE PURPOSE, and strive to achieve it with the people they love the most. Coming from a hard past, looking ahead to the future: fearlessly chasing their own dreams together with people they hold the closest, while travelling the World. Saving a few countries for the hell of it; standing up for what they think is Justice no matter the odds against them. Shanks with his life lessons on what a true Man is, etc.

Today; age 23. Up to date with chapter 873; re-read the series like 5 times. Haven't done any drugs including alcohol for 3 years, only smoke weed on weekends.Graduated from The Start Up Institute(coding school), got a full time position as a Web Developer for 37.30$/Hour, learned how to fix computers/phones/tablets  &amp; Web Design on the side for an extra $300-$500 per week. Also help local businesses around me set up their websites/social media traffic for more $$$, monthly. My diet closely resembles the Food pyramid. Living with my fiancee rent free, her house was inherited and she's an Accounting Manager. Got my six pack And 5:30 mile run time back haha. Gave my parents $2500 each on their Birthday this year. 

As I was going through a rough time in my life; reading the next chapter of One Piece had me excited when I woke up. It showed me that the world is bigger than my problems and to immediately start taking action even though I don't have a plan. Bought a plane ticket to Venice, and stayed there for a month with no access to drugs. Came back, stayed sober; filled the void with Coding &amp; Sports, plus enrolled in any seminars/classes held in my area. Investment classes, Entrepreneur Meetings, Historical Art shows, and ""The Vegetarian Life"" seminars( I know, what the fuck is that? You name it I was there. One day I woke up and had no desire to do anything but express myself; and then realized that I was unconsciously internalizing what I read from One Piece and was acting upon  it."

I have some conclusions drawn from my own experience and interactions:

- Smaller pool of companies
- Fewer success stories and thus less people who've done it before
- More usage of interns to reduce cost vs to aid hiring
- Less access to equity and profit sharing for regular employees
- Companies are more honest about commercial goals (in the Bay everything is a missionary project for the good of humanity)
- Software developers are less revered and business people more valued

What are some other big differences?"
6qglm4,16,2017-07-30,Finally posting here!,LoseItThrowaway6,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/6qglm4/finally_posting_here/,"So I've been on this sub for a year and a half. In that time, I lost 20 pounds, gained 25, and lost 25. This sub has been a huge help in losing that weight (not in gaining though. That was my fault). And I've finally made an account just to post here! Flair included!

I'm looking forward to interacting with you guys so we could all make a permanent, positive change in our lives. 

And since I'm posting, I might as well share my story. 

Growing up, I was always a bit overweight. But the only one that ever thought so was my doctor, everyone else was surprised when I told them my weight because I never looked that big. I was broad shouldered and the extra fat placed itself nicely, so I didn't look too bad. Plus, wearing baggy, loose fitting clothes helped. 

I was 140 when I started high school. I don't remember my height, but I knew I was a bit overweight, but not enough to take immediate action. I joined the robotics team, which oddly enough, made me gain weight. I'd go to McDonald's or Taco Bell after class and before heading to the workshop, plus dinner when I got back home at 9 or 10. Over the years, the weight accumulated. I was about 170 when I graduated high school. I'd gained weight, but I also got taller; still wasn't too worried. 

Then college happened. I'm sure you've all heard of the Freshman 15. But actually, I only gained about 5 pounds my freshman year. It was Sophomore and Junior year when I ballooned up. I spent the summer before each year working at internships that I didn't enjoy. That's probably an understatement, because they both made me profoundly unhappy with myself and my life choices. My family was spending a shitload on tuition, all so I could get a degree that would get me a job that I'm gonna hate. Plus, friends were starting to get distant for unrelated reasons. 

So being unhappy, I used food as a comfort. I was on a University meal plan, which meant unlimited, buffet style food for every meal. Sadness and unlimited food is not a good combo. So I gained weight--lots of it. I felt good when I was eating, so I won't eat til I felt sick. It wasn't uncommon for me to throw up after a meal. And I think it was the first time I really liked overweight. You could see the extra fat in my face, but I didn't care. 

So it was near the end of my Junior year of college. By now, I was 215 pounds, well into an obese BMI. I went to the doctor (unrelated to weight) and he was really concerned. He was alarmed by my weight gain and urged me to lose weight. That was when reality really hit me. I gained 50 pounds and I still had another year of college. 

This was around the time I found this sub. I read the wiki and learned about calories and weight loss. I was still on the University meal plan, but I started making better choices. I'd get salad instead of pizza, not go back for seconds (or thirds), and I'd even try to eyeball how many calories were in my food (nutrition info was posted). 

That was a year and a half ago. Since then, I found a career path that I'm excited about and got into a grad school program that I start in a month. My weight has fluctuated a lot since that doctor's appointment. I've had my hurdles, but I'm finally ready to lose the weight and keep it off. I'm down 20 pounds from my highest weight and I have no plans to stop. Wish me luck!"

It’s a recent Wednesday afternoon, and Barbara Lee’s communications director is trying to find her. She’s scheduled to give a speech in nine minutes, and she hasn’t read it yet.

The anti-war congresswoman — from an ultra-liberal congressional district that includes Berkeley, California — has somehow managed to spark an uprising, joined by rank-and-file Republicans, against House Speaker Paul Ryan. Their demand: Repeal the 2001 war authorization against Al Qaeda and begin debating a new authorization better suited for the wars of today. This strange alliance is all the more remarkable because Lee, one of the leftmost denizens of Capitol Hill, was famously the only member of Congress to vote against the original authorization of force, a vote held just three days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Explaining her decision at the time, she warned, in language that rankled many as the smoke still curled from the ruins of the World Trade Center, “As we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore.”

For Republicans, who have routinely opposed Lee’s past efforts to repeal the 2001 war authorization, something has changed — but their motivations differ. Some, like Rep. Scott Taylor of Virginia, say that after three presidents and 16 years of constant war, they had simply reached a breaking point. “It’s time that the American people, via their representatives, are engaged in this debate,” says Taylor, a former Navy SEAL who was injured while fighting in Iraq. Others, like Utah Rep. Chris Stewart, a former Air Force pilot, say that with the election of President Donald Trump, Republicans have a chance to craft a new authorization that will not constrain the U.S. military in its war against the Islamic State. “The reason Republicans didn’t really push this in the Obama administration was because many of us feared that he would have a confined AUMF,” says Stewart, using the acronym for authorization for use of military force. “We think we have a president now who would take a more aggressive stand.”

Taylor, Stewart and other Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee stunned Congress-watchers last month for lining up behind an amendment by Lee to repeal the 2001 AUMF. After all, for the better part of two decades, Republicans had ignored Lee’s frequent efforts to rein in an executive branch that many feel has too much freedom to wage war around the globe. They rolled their eyes at ideas like her proposal to create a “Department of Peacebuilding” or to de-fund U.S. war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, they were signing on to an amendment that would, over Ryan’s objections, give Congress an eight-month window to debate and pass a new war resolution against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. And it had Barbara Lee’s name on it.

The amendment was ultimately blocked this month from coming to the House floor for a vote. But the willingness of rank-and-file Republicans to support it has sent an unmistakable message to congressional leaders: They can no longer keep ducking this issue. The bipartisan support for Lee’s amendment has also made her a central player in the high-wire negotiations over the next steps — giving her some leverage, a rare commodity for a lawmaker on the far left in a Congress that for years has been veering right. The big question is whether she can capitalize on it. Can the pent-up frustration she has exposed within the Republican ranks translate into full-fledged debate to repeal the 2001 war resolution?

It’s now three minutes until Lee’s speech, in which she’s expected to tackle this question head on. But her communications director, Christopher Huntley, still can’t find her. In Huntley’s hands is a blue folder containing a copy of the speech, which Lee is supposed to review on her walk to the venue — a podium just outside the Capitol in the 94-degree heat.

Just then, Huntley gets a call. The congresswoman has been located. She has apparently walked to the podium herself — without a chance to read over her speech in advance. It doesn’t really matter, though, because it’s a speech she’s been giving since Sept. 14, 2001.
   
***

In an interview in her Capitol Hill office, Lee describes the moment she decided to vote against the 2001 war resolution. A self-described military brat whose father and ex-husband served in the Army and Air Force, Lee had been agonizing over the decision to authorize war against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Her then-chief of staff, Sandré Swanson, was mourning the death of his cousin, who had been on United Airlines Flight 93.

“Growing up with stories and being in a military family, I understand that we don’t want to send our young men and women into harm’s way if we can avoid that,” Lee says. She insists she’s not a pacifist and prefers the label “pro-peace” to “anti-war,” explaining that she “just grew up looking for alternatives to military solutions.” She says there needed to be some military response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but she was concerned Congress was rushing to put its stamp of approval on a war without a clear strategy or end-game.

She made up her mind the day of the vote at the memorial service at the National Cathedral attended by then-President George W. Bush and former Presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. The Reverend Nathan Baxter led the congregation in prayer, calling upon the country’s leaders, as they “consider the necessary actions for national security,” to “not become the evil we deplore.”

It was those words, which she would go on to repeat, that sealed Lee’s decision. After that, she felt at peace. “I was very calm about it,” she says. “It didn’t faze me after that.”

Lee edited her speech by hand on her way to the vote. On the House floor, she implored her colleagues, “We must be careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target.” She compared the 2001 AUMF, written in vague terms with no end date or geographic limitations, to the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that paved the way for Lyndon Johnson’s escalation in Vietnam. “There must be some of us who say: Let’s step back for a moment and think through the implications of our actions today,” she pleaded. “I do not want to see this spiral out of control.”

Lee didn’t realize until the voting was underway that she would be the only one of 431 House members and 100 senators to oppose the measure. Once that had become clear, some of Lee’s closest House colleagues, including fellow California Democrat Nancy Pelosi, approached her in the cloakroom to urge her to change her mind before the voting closed, as Lee recounts in her 2008 memoir. “They were concerned about me personally,” Lee says, explaining that her colleagues believed the vote could cause her to lose reelection. The entire country was rallying around Bush and his pledge “to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.”

But Lee wouldn’t budge.

Her first phone call after the vote was from her dad, then 77, a veteran of World War II and Korea. As she walked through the tunnel from the Capitol to her office in the Rayburn House Building, he told her it “was the right vote and to never do anything that was irrational — that we had to be thoughtful and understand the implications of our actions.”

The immediate reaction from the public was very different. Lee’s office was soon fielding thousands of calls and emails, some of them denouncing her as a traitor to her country. She was receiving death threats. The Capitol Police decided she needed a 24-hour security detail, and officers were soon parked outside her offices and house. They accompanied her everywhere, she says, even to church and the grocery store.

“There were a lot of haters out there,” she recalls now. “There were a lot of Barbara Lee haters.” But it quickly became clear that there were also plenty of supporters. People opposed to the U.S. war in Afghanistan — and the growing drumbeat for war in Iraq — began using the slogan, “Barbara Lee speaks for me.” A 2002 Democratic primary challenger seeking to capitalize on Lee’s AUMF vote dropped out of the race. Lee ended up winning reelection that year with 82 percent of the vote — and hasn’t faced a serious electoral challenge, either in a primary or general election, since.

“My district,” she says, “it didn’t take long for them to get it.”
   
***

Lee now finds herself improbably back in the national spotlight, thanks to Republican rebels like Stewart and Taylor.

The uprising began during the most mundane of events, the annual House Appropriations Committee markup of the Pentagon’s budget. Lee, like she does most years, put forward an amendment to repeal the 2001 AUMF, which has since become the legal underpinning for the global war on terror — cited now by three presidents as justification for U.S. military operations the world over, from the Philippines to the Horn of Africa, and even on the “high seas,” according to the Congressional Research Service.

In past years, like clockwork, Republicans and hawkish Democrats had come together to defeat Lee’s repeal amendment, along with other amendments she routinely offers, and move on with a markup session that can stretch three hours or more as lawmakers vote on dozens of amendments to the Pentagon’s budget. This year’s markup was different, though, featuring the rarest of congressional spectacles: an earnest debate in which minds were changed, followed by a vote no one could have predicted.

Dutch Ruppersberger, a centrist Democrat from a military-heavy Maryland congressional district, was among those who decided his vote in real time. He had planned to oppose the amendment, just as he had in years past. But he felt moved when Stewart and Taylor rose to voice support. “When two respective members of the military stand up and make a comment,” he said at the time, “I’m listening.”

Taylor, too, had a change of heart that morning. He had not planned to speak in support of Lee’s amendment but “felt compelled to,” he later explains, in the heat of the moment. “I don’t think any of us in that committee room thought that it was going to go like it did,” says the freshman representative, whose Virginia Beach district includes the world’s largest naval station. “Congressman Stewart and I, when we got up, that changed everything, quite frankly.”

Just one Republican, Kay Granger of Texas, voiced opposition to Lee’s amendment, which was adopted with overwhelming support from the 52 members of the Appropriations Committee, Democrats and Republicans alike. Its passage elicited a surprised smile from the committee’s Republican chairman, Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, and applause from the other lawmakers in the room.

Suddenly Lee’s quixotic mission to repeal the 2001 AUMF had taken on a new life. Cable news networks that once ignored her were calling for interviews. She was headlining press conferences with fellow anti-war lawmakers. And she was negotiating with some of the most powerful Republicans in a GOP-controlled Washington.

Lee was also forming some unlikely alliances. Earlier this month, she went on the radio in Virginia with talk-show host John Fredericks, a staunch Trump backer. The odd pair found common cause over their mutual opposition to military adventurism, and by the end of the interview Fredericks had concluded that Lee made “a lot of sense.”

“We’re going to start a ‘draft Lee for Democratic minority leader’ right here on my radio show,” said the conservative host. “Lee for minority leader. I’m going to start that rumor.”

The uprising has put Ryan in a tough spot. The Wisconsin Republican was elected House speaker in 2015 on a pledge to return to what’s called “regular order” — with power over legislation dispersed among House committees, rather than concentrated in the speaker’s office. But Ryan, who quickly made clear he opposed Lee’s amendment, was forced this month to defy the bipartisan will of the Appropriations Committee, stripping out the amendment before it could come before the full House for debate — a move almost certainly at odds with the spirit of “regular order.”

“Removing the provision this way was in the institutional interest of the House since it removed a distraction to the consideration of these important appropriations bills,” a spokeswoman for Ryan, AshLee Strong, said after the decision. “The Lee amendment was an irresponsible measure that would have … left service members in the field without an authorization to defeat al-Qaeda and ISIS and could have led to the release of the prisoners at Guantanamo.”

Lee, for her part, denounced Ryan’s move as “undemocratic” and “underhanded.”

“Stripping my bipartisan amendment to repeal the 2001 AUMF — in the dead of night, without a vote — may be a new low from Speaker Ryan,” she said in a statement after learning of the decision. “Congress has been missing in action on matters of war and peace for nearly sixteen years. Republican leadership showed last night that they will do anything to maintain this status quo.”

Lee says her upbringing prepared her for the lonely fight she would later wage in Congress against what she calls “perpetual war.”

She was born in El Paso, Texas, where schools at the time were segregated. So her parents sent her and her two sisters to Catholic school, where they “were the only black kids,” she recalls, and “always had to kind of go against the grain.”

The history textbooks at the school glossed over the horrors of slavery, she explains — horrors evident in the light-skinned complexion of many of Lee’s maternal relatives, as she says in her memoir. Her great-grandmother, a slave, had been raped repeatedly by her white owner, bearing several of his children, including Lee’s grandmother. “It’s heart-wrenching to think of the fear and pain exacted on the women of my family by violent, predatory bigots,” she writes.

She says she grew up feeling self-conscious about her appearance and lacking self-esteem. But she had gained some confidence — and a penchant for standing up to authority — by the time she attended high school in Southern California’s San Fernando Valley, where she ran in what she calls her “first election.”

The school had never before had a black cheerleader, she writes in her memoir, with selections for the cheerleading squad made by a “small committee of white folks.”

“You had to be blonde, blue-eyed and look right to be a cheerleader,” she says. “I didn’t look right.” She enlisted the help of the NAACP and got the rules changed, so that the entire student body could vote to select its cheerleaders. She then auditioned in front of about 800 students, doing “cheers and cartwheels and, you know, all that,” she says. “And I did it.” She was selected — becoming the school’s first black cheerleader, but not without some opposition. “People were angry,” she recalls. “People were bringing chains to school. It created a little dicey situation in the community where there was almost a riot.”

The next few years, for Lee, were a whirlwind. She got pregnant at 16, which she attributes in her memoir to her lack of sexual education and Catholic teachings on contraception. She got married, in secret, and then had a miscarriage. She then followed her husband, who was in the Air Force, to England, and had two sons. At age 20, she got divorced. That’s the moment, she says, when “all hell broke loose” — with Lee ending up “sort of homeless” with no job.

She went on welfare and eventually received federal assistance to go to Mills College in Oakland. She couldn’t afford child care and often dragged her two boys — both of them now in the insurance industry — to classes with her. “I hauled them everywhere,” she says, including to the Black Panther Party meetings she was then attending. She became friends with Black Panther co-founders Bobby Seale and Huey Newton — and at one point even came under FBI surveillance because of her association with the group, whose alleged acts of violence she says she did not and never has condoned. She later submitted a public-records request for the FBI’s file on her and writes in her memoir that it was “hard to believe what I read — and yes, quite scary to see that they had spied on me.”

Lee went on to get a master’s degree in social work at the University of California, Berkeley and became active in the failed presidential campaign of Democrat Shirley Chisholm, the first black candidate to seek a major party’s nomination (slogan: ""unbought and unbossed""). Lee then got an internship with then-Rep. Ron Dellums, an anti-Vietnam activist who became Lee’s mentor. She worked her way through the ranks in Dellums’ office and was eventually named his chief of staff. And when Dellums resigned from Congress in 1997, Lee ran in a special election for his seat.

It was Dellums, also a social worker, whom she turned to for advice in the days after 9/11, when she was agonizing over the upcoming AUMF vote.

Her former boss, who had served in the Marine Corps, did not tell her how he thought she should vote, Lee says, but instead walked her through the implications of the decision.

“We talked about the emotional state of the country, as social workers, as clinical social workers, which he is, in terms of how you make rational decisions,” Lee recalls. “One is you don’t do it in the heat of emotion, in fear. Because you’re always going to make the wrong decision if you’re doing stuff based on fear.”
   
***

Sixteen years later, many of the things Lee warned about in her speech ahead of the AUMF vote have come to pass — as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle now concede.

The United States remains at war in Afghanistan, locked in a stalemate with the Taliban. The Pentagon is preparing a new strategy that could involve thousands more U.S. troops. The country is also at war in Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State. Congress never voted to authorize this war, instead relying on the 2001 AUMF, even though ISIS did not exist when the authorization was passed.

The 2001 resolution stands at just over 300 words, authorizing the president “to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons” responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks, along with those who harbored them. The resolution’s spare language has since been stretched to encompass potential terrorist threats all over the world — and it is often described as authorizing war against Al Qaeda and “associated forces,” even though those words do not appear in the resolution. It has been used as justification for drone strikes and other military operations in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. It’s been cited by the Supreme Court as the legal basis for the detention of so-called enemy combatants at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where terrorist suspects are being held indefinitely without access to civilian courts.

“The original AUMF has been stretched I think beyond the breaking point when you’re literally fighting enemies that didn’t exist in places that you never intended to fight,” says Republican Tom Cole, one of Ryan’s staunchest allies in Congress. The Oklahoma congressman decided last month to support Lee’s amendment during the committee markup. He now says he never intended Lee’s amendment to become law and that the purpose was to “get the attention of people, and that seems to have succeeded.”

“I think members of Congress, regardless of where they’re at on the ideological or partisan spectrum, are very uncomfortable with the erosion of congressional warmaking power,” Cole adds.

There are signs Congress might be preparing to reassert itself.

   
When he stripped Lee’s amendment, Ryan replaced it with a provision by Cole designed to get the ball rolling on a new AUMF. The measure orders the Trump administration to submit, within 30 days of its passage, a strategy to defeat Al Qaeda, the Taliban and the Islamic State, along with an analysis of the current legal framework for doing so. The House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing last week on the 2001 AUMF. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is holding similar hearings, and two senators — Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) — are pushing a bipartisan measure that would repeal existing war resolutions while authorizing force specifically against ISIS, Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Their proposal has a five-year sunset date.

“I think there is bipartisan recognition that we never intended the 2001 [resolution] to cover the military campaign in Syria,” says Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel.

But many of the partisan divisions that stymied previous efforts to pass a new AUMF remain. Republican defense hawks are unwilling to agree to terms that they say would constrain the military, such as geographic limitations. And many Democrats, who still remember the political backlash over their votes in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War, are unwilling to support anything that doesn’t impose tight restrictions, such as a prohibition on the use of ground U.S. combat troops against ISIS. A handful of more libertarian-minded Republicans are united with Democrats in demanding strict limitations, further complicating the politics of the issue. And in the Senate, a new AUMF would likely require 60 votes for passage, meaning it would need support from members of both parties.

The Trump administration so far has not made any official request for Congress to pass a new AUMF to cover the war against ISIS. But Trump’s defense secretary, retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis, wrote a 2015 blog post for the Hoover Institution calling for exactly that. A new resolution, ""supported by a majority of both parties in both houses of Congress, will send an essential message of American steadfastness to our people and to the global audience."" He argued for a broad resolution with no deadlines, geographic limits or restrictions on potentially using ground combat troops.

Lee, for her part, is vowing to keep up the fight. She’s been in talks with Cole about next steps and already has plans for more amendments, more attempts to stoke the unrest within the Republican ranks. “We’re going to win this eventually,” says the 71-year-old congresswoman. Asked if she believes the 2001 AUMF will be repealed by the time she leaves Congress, she laughs.

“By the time I leave Congress?” she says. “I don’t have any plans to leave Congress.”

6qi6gh,2,2017-07-30,Question: Ever since I switched to programming I've gotten offers for tons of tech support jobs. Where as before I couldn't find work at all in tech support (being the main reason I made the switch.) Why?,hpwu,web_programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_programming/comments/6qi6gh/question_ever_since_i_switched_to_programming_ive/,"Bit of backstory: years ago I got out of the US Army with 3 certifications (A+ Network+ and Security+) 

I looked for work *incredibly, incredibly* hard. I applied to every tech opening w/in 50 miles of my home town, being roughly 500, some out of date but I still applied. I had absolutely no luck. So not only do I have 4 years of experience (with AD, Microsoft server (several different editions) Windows XP-8 ect.) a 2 year degree (philosophy not tech), and 3 certifications. And NO LUCK. 

I got tons of excuses: 
""Well we would hire you but you have a degree in philosophy and not technology. We need to know you can do this job.""

""I'm not hiring you because you are millennial"" (Not actually true, millennials are the 90's forward. I know lots of older people tried to expand it to the 80's but thats not sensible, every 10 years gets a name. Does someone born in 1980 sound like a millennial? A 35 year old?)

""You don't have enough experience to work here.""

After 2 years of trying my certs were about to fall off and I said ""fuck it."" I got a job in healthcare making more than I expected to in IT but working about 5x's more too.

Well recently I've been practicing programming. I capstoned myself with a programming bootcamp (Not half bad, if you are trying to break into programming either place this at the beginning or end of your learning! If you have the money that is.) So I started applying to internships for programming (one of which I got.)

Well I sit down about a week ago and go through my emails...holy fuck. I got about 5 job offers (only having updated a few online resumes with my experience programming.) I start to look ""Ok I applied here in early 2013, yeah heres my log of it."" 3 of the five places are places I applied.

I sit down with one guy I remember telling me I don't know enough to work as a tier 2 admin we sit down ""So I see you have experience in programming?"" 

I reply ""Yes, I've got about a year of practice on my own out of interest and I went to [boot camp x]"" 

He begins smiling ""Great! Great! Well this position pays 10 an hour. Would you be willing to take it?""

I stop ""Wait, you aren't going to check for my experience or certifications?""

He replies ""Well if you can program you can fix any computer!""

I cut him off ""You are aware you interviewed me like 5 years ago when I was actually qualified for this job right?""

He goes on ""Yes but programming is a huge leap above simple installation and network configuration.""

I pause for a moment ""Those are two totally different skills. I know quite a few programmers who don't know anything about networking, IP addresses, or how to setup/run a network, none know  best practices.""

He looks a bit flustered ""Yes but we are going to hire you to work in TECH"" 

I wait ""Ok so why should I take a job here over a position as an unpaid intern at [where I applied]?"" 

He looks at me incredibly annoyed at this point and says ""Because ***WE WILL PAY YOU***""

I pause ""Ok but an internship that lasts a year in programming might not pay me but after one bad year I will be making a minimum of 50k in this area. Are you willing to put in a contract that after a year you will pay me a minimum of 50k a year for each year I work after the first, and that you can't fire me for at least 4 years?""

At this point he looks at me and says ""I just don't get it. I NEED SOMEONE I KNOW CAN DO THE WORK! YOU CLEARLY CAN BECAUSE YOU CAN #PROGRAM!""

I reiterate (shocked he didn't end the interview there) ""Then for 10 and hour in our area you are looking for a brand new A+, Network+, Security+, Certified person. Like me 5 years ago when you interviewed me then. I understand if you didn't want to pay me 10 an hour but 5 years ago you were advertising 15. I highly recommend you look for someone that is beinging their career for 10 an hour. If you want someone more professional you need to pay at least 15 an hour. You might be able to get away with 8, and I say that because walgreens starts you out at 9.50 here. You aren't paying much of a markup for certifications. Look my going rate is going to be $25 an hour if you want me because I am a #Programmer.""

He ends up throwing me out after that little 'rant.' while using a few obscenities. I'm sorry, but I don't want to work with someone so unprofessional they can't take advice from someone they 'know' knows what they are talking about. More than that someone who can't ***NOT CUSS*** during an interview. I have a place to work, yes its unpaid, but its going to help my career. Honestly I wasn't angry nor did I yell. I was professional (in so much as I could be) and tried to give him honest advice. But he wanted someone ""Better"" than beginner who could ""undoubtedly"" do the job. Which translates to (apparently) someone who doesn't know the job really at all, and is in a related profession. Despite looking for someone in a totally different career field. You want a physicist? Pay a mathematician kind of logic. I'll be blunt, I went to the interview to hear effectively what he told me.

So seriously what the fuck, why are these people looking for the wrong field to do a job that really only requires minimal knowledge of computer topics?

6qirv9,19,2017-07-30,My Experiences after Breaking Up with LTR,nancha,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6qirv9/my_experiences_after_breaking_up_with_ltr/,"After lurking and seeking advice here for a long time, I want to contribute and share the story of my last weeks.

My LTR of one and a half years started to feel bad at the beginning of the year. When we first got together, I knew about some affairs that she had in the past with guys from our university and it took a lot of effort not to think about it so that it doesn't get in the way of our relationship. This worked for me for quite a long time. But at a certain point, it came up in me again and again and I started to feel bad about having to live with knowing that my GF had these affairs. One morning I felt particularly miserable and went through her phone to find out more about what happened back then.

Don't get me wrong, the relationship was fine, she was being a great girl, sex was most of the time awesome. However, it wasn't satisfactory for me anymore, feeling like I didn't stand up enough for myself. 

So I go through her snapchats and see that she exchanged snaps with this one guy some weeks ago. I check the chat and swipe down to see saved messages. There I find something (dated before our relationship) that reads like this:

She: ""I am bored and want to fuck.""
He: ""No, you say that it hurts all the time. It's no fun.""
She: ""What!? Come over now and you can fuck me as hard as you want, until it hurts.""

Clearly, this gave me the last push needed to decide to end the relationship. She wasn't cheating or anything (as far as I know), but knowing so specifically about what a slut she was in the past for someone else really turned me off. She was even a greater slut for me and I did things with her that she had never done before. But I just couldn't stand the feeling of disgust.

So the day before she was going to fly home again (she was visiting me for a longer period of time during my exchange semester), I broke up with her. Did it at a restaurant in the city. I showed no emotions and just stayed calm. She broke out in tears, we finished our drink and then left. That night, I slept on the couch and left my bed to her, in order to minimise physical contact. I didn't offer any kind of explanation that she could have challenged and did not tell her about the shit I read in her phone. So the next day she left early for her plane, still crying a lot. After she walked through the door I briefly felt sad, thinking of the good times that we had together. Two hours later I received a call, that informed me that my application for an internship was accepted. This was exactly one month ago.

Since then I am still in that country, doing that internship. In the last four weeks, I hooked up with four different girls (all via Tinder but hey, you gotta start somewhere). The first was seeking emotional validation after having sex the second time and I failed to provide it to her, out of fear of accidentally giving away committment. The second one was not really hot and in hindsight kind of a mistake. The other two I kept as plates, with one of them actually being pretty smart and interesting. So I am going to fly to an exotic place with her over the coming weekend and have a good time.

Overall, I feel like I found my self-respect again after breaking up. I am always pretty flirty around hot chicks, but always felt like in a cage while in this relationship. Now I enjoy fooling around with my hot co-worker and spinning plates. I try to work out regularly but I still carry some bad habits around:
- Bad eating (no cooking at all)
- Watching too much porn
- Not sleeping enough
- General laziness 

In the coming weeks I want to improve first of all by working out at least three times a week and not eating anymore late at night. Next thing is probably getting a healthy sleep rhythm.

Apart from that, I am extremely confident in how things are going. I hope, you guys appreciate me sharing my experiences, and if I missed something important or you have any comments, I'd be happy to read them.

EDIT: Getting a lot of hate, and whatever guys, that's your opinion. All I said was that I couldn't deal with the situation how it was anymore. There were many reasons I didn't want to have the relationship anymore, but what I mentioned just fucked with my head. How can you rationalize yourself into thinking you're alright when clearly this shit is bothering you? Seriously, if someone knows, just tell me. 
However I am way on top since I broke up, so it was the right decision."

6qj9p6,21,2017-07-30,"Boyfriend [28M] of 1 year say sex with me [24F] feels incestuous, has agreed to see a counselor",Chalula56896,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/6qj9p6/boyfriend_28m_of_1_year_say_sex_with_me_24f_feels/,"Hi, I've been skulking around, debating whether to post or not post for months.

Since about three months into our relationship, it's been like this: I try to initiate sex, he says, ""Not now,"" ""Not tonight,"" ""Maybe next time,"" and unless I get more upset or beg for hours, he won't do it.

My libido isn't so high to begin with. I prefer quickies, maybe 2-3 times a month or more. He prefers longer sessions, but never actually wants to have sex. 29 days out of the month, I couldn't care less if we never had sex again, but one or two days, something within me is triggered and I care a lot, and think I'm delusional if I think our relationship could ever survive long-term. Usually, it starts off as me thinking about the sex issue, and coming on DB which makes me feel even worse. I've started avoiding DB during those times, which has helped.

He tells me having sex with me feels like having sex with a close family member, which grosses him out and makes him feel guilty.

Scheduling sex (i.e. me telling him, ""Let's plan to have sex this weekend, you can choose which day,"" works with mixed results, ranging from him really enjoying it, to it being clearly forced.

I have asked him to go to a counselor, and he has agreed. He doesn't really think it'll be helpful, but since he knows how much it means to me (and because it's free through his school,) when he comes back from his overseas internship, he says he'll go.

By the way, it's the typical ""Our relationship is fantastic otherwise"" situation. I know lack of sex is a perfectly valid reason to break up. But this relationship is definitely worth putting the effort into fixing rather than scrapping it and starting anew. I'm sure someone will say, ""You're only a year in, just break up, you'll find someone else."" I know I could, but I would highly prefer not to. At the end of the day, he's more important to me than sex, but I'd prefer to have both.

I hate to mention this, but he's Japanese. I don't want that fact to influence the conversation in the wrong way (i.e. No ""Oh of course, Japan is a sexless country"" bullshit please,) but I just want the fact to be out there.

More about his background: He's heterosexual, has no past sexual trauma, one past girlfriend who was his only sexual partner (the relationship was unremarkable,) and he grew up without his mother. He loves cuddling and is okay with a quick kiss on the lips, but making out is too much for him. He watches porn but is definitely not an addict.

I'm posting for two reasons:
1) I want to know if there's any way I can support him during his counseling and help it be more effective, besides just being there for him and being open to whatever he needs to do to help.
2) I guess I just want to talk.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: The title. Also want to know how to best support him to help counseling be as effective as possible, and just to talk.

Edit: He has expressed a desire to fix the issue, but has put in zero effort, and dislikes even talking about the issue (he will talk about it when I bring it up, but unwillingly.) At least his agreeing to go to counseling is a start. And he's never tried to make me feel like it was anyone's issue but his own, which I really respect.

I also forgot to mention that he thinks that if the rest of the relationship is great (which it is,) it can compensate for the lack of sex.

Edit: Woah, thanks for giving your much-more-sensible-than-mine opinions without downvoting me to hell. I know that it makes pretty much no damn sense to stay with a guy I'm not married to, have been with for less than a year, and with whom I've had sex problems for 75% of that &lt;1 year. However, out of an average of ~480 waking hours a month, I spend 2-3 of them (~0.5%) of them upset about this. The other 99.5% of the time, I'm happy. I only consider ending things during that 0.5% of the time, but it hits hard. I don't know if it's worth breaking up and looking for someone else to patch a gap of half a percent."
6qjfae,16,2017-07-30,ICND1 Passed,tmoneyfish,ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/6qjfae/icnd1_passed/,I passed my CCENT during a summer internship. I'm excited to move on to the second half. Can I have a cat too?
6qjuvj,1,2017-07-30,"I don't HAVE to relocate, but I think I want to?",aunclesquishy,AmeriCorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmeriCorps/comments/6qjuvj/i_dont_have_to_relocate_but_i_think_i_want_to/,"I just got accepted to a VISTA program within my state, and it's within a half-hour drive of my house (I'm 24 and I live at home). Since I live &lt;50 miles away, I wouldn't be provided with a relocation allowance but I do still get the living allowance that, in theory, would be enough to cover utilities and such.

Since I live close enough to the area that I don't really need to live there (unlike if I were to be working like, across the country or something), I could just live at home and keep my provided 'living allowance' in my savings account to use for whatever else.

But then again, according to the VISTA website, they strongly suggest that you move into the area regardless, and basically live like the people you'd be serving. I think it would be a good experience to at least try and live there using my allowance and such, and most likely go on food stamps. It would be my first time living on my own, which up until now I have been unable to do. And then if something comes up, I guess I could always just move back home but remain in the VISTA program. Then again, I don't really know how apartment leases work, isn't there one where like you sign a contract so you have live in the apartment for a year or something? If nothing else I at least have a safety net because my family is so close by anyway.

On the one hand, I think since I have the option of just saving the money for the future, that might be good. But if I do that, I wouldn't get ~the full experience~ and I think I would miss out on something. Like, if I don't really get fully into it, I might as well just be doing a paid internship or something. One of the people who interviewed me told me he was a volunteer in the 70s and he LOVED it. He got a place, went on food stamps (""I was able to eat duck, where before that I was living on noodles""), and he said the whole thing was an amazing experience for him.

I'm gonna talk to my boyfriend and see if he might be interested in moving in with me (which would really help with rent since he's got a part-time job). But regardless of what he says, idk. I feel like both options have advantages and disadvantages. I'm open to moving there even though it is VERY different than how I'm living now, I'm just not sure if it's smart in the long run."
6qjxg4,6,2017-07-30,I am in dire straits and need help. This is my do or die moment.,DoOrDieTime,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6qjxg4/i_am_in_dire_straits_and_need_help_this_is_my_do/,"I committed one of the greatest sins and relied on my partner for financial support. When I met her, I had already been working as a stagehand for nearly a decade, and had made an ok living of it, as far as only needing to support myself. However, when we started dating it was 2008 and the economic crash had a profound effect on entertainment work, so I had spent the better part of that year on unemployment or using my savings (she came into my life on the tail end of this period). 

Naturally, this worried my partner to no end, and after we'd been together about 2 years, she and I and her mother sat down and decided that I would go to college and they would support me fully for the first two years and for the last couple of years I'd work full time and study part time. Things did not go quite that way.

The first year I was fully supported financially.    

The second year I started to take little bits of freelance work and was able to provide for myself for meals and transport for most of the year.  

Third year, I was now working freelance a little more often, and could contribute a few hundred here and there to the household. I was paying my own meals and transport but as far as paying for dates and planning vacations, this stuff was completely out of my range. 

----Mind you, we didn't pay rent. The house belonged to my partner's mother, who paid the mortgage, so we were only responsible for an $800 monthly maintenance payment and utilities.----

Now here's where we get to my present situation. After the third year at school I got a paid internship, making $15/hr at 30 hrs a week. They loved me there and asked me to stay on. The CTO offered to keep rolling my internship over until I got my degree at which point they'd hire me outright. 

To me, this changed the situation significantly, because with that amount of money I could cover my costs and contribute regularly to the house. I also got some bonus payments which I used to put money towards vacations with the ex, since she could never stop griping about how we could never go on vacations. Her financial situation was that she was working a job that she hated but towards a field she loved and was making about $60k for it. By the time we broke up she was in a new job she loved and at $72k. She'd also never struggled for anything since her mom had set her up with a job while she was in college.

So I sat down with my partner and explained to her:
We didn't have to rely on your mom anywhere as long as we expected. I've incrementally increased my ability to contribute to the home. I have this amazing opportunity with this internship that wants to snatch me up and the sooner I finish school the faster I'll be an equal if not greater earner (her job is in non-profit sector, my degree in data science). In my eyes, everything made sense for me to barrel through school, finish it up and be a full partner to her. But this was a suggestion, which she unfortunately took to mean that I'd already decided and this was the way it was going down. 

Well, it took a while but she got fed up with it, and after many solid years of being together, of being faithful and devoted and committed, she sits me down and tells me she's worried about my lack of ambition and that she wants to be alone to focus on her career and how much she resents me for keeping her from going for her Masters. Oh btw, this was two weeks before christmas. 

Later that week I get a call from my supervisor, saying HR has a problem with rolling an intern over and over, they'd already done it twice and they weren't going to do it again. So I was out on my ass. 

At this point, I have lost the partnership, which also means I've lost the comfortable home financial situation. I have lost the internship and so goes stable income. I still have stagehand work but it's woefully slow and not something I want to do as I get older, plus it's not reliable work. I have a $3000 loan with Navient that I have to start paying this month. I still owe $900 in tuition from last semester, which blocks me from registering, which in turn means I may have to reapply when and if I go back. I spent every last dime on moving out to a room I can't afford and have tapped myself out just making the rent through these months so I have about $25 in cash to my name. I'm too poor to even afford to open a checking account right now because it would immediately be overdrawn. No credit cards, bad credit history, no family.

Now the thing I have to consider is, my colleagues at my internship - people with decades of experience working in private and municipal sectors - tell me that the work I produce is on par with theirs. That literally the only thing keeping me from being in their shoes is that little piece of sheepskin. I've even had grad level course professors tell me I was one of the sharpest students in the class. I have a few options to explore:

Option 1.    
I have a friend in California who can put me to work immediately as a stagehand. To consider: living in California has always been my dream.   

Option 2.   
Bury myself in loans, if I can even get any with my shit credit history and no co-signers, finish my degree and not freak out about repayment because my earning potential is high.  

Option 3.

6qkaad,7,2017-07-30,Moved to New York - rate my plan,abiogenesistheory,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/6qkaad/moved_to_new_york_rate_my_plan/,"**About Me**

I'm a 22 year old recent graduate in Brooklyn. I do not have a job in hand. I'm going to detail my plan, and I'd like you to critique it. I majored sociology with a  focus in statistics (multivariate regression analysis/statistical programming). I also have a 1.5 year internship doing data management (data cleaning, variable coding, small project management) work at a well known University run study using SAS. I'm also familiar with SQL and am currently working on JavaScript with plans to be at the level of being able to pass a Junior Dev interview in 3-6 months.

I have finances to last 3 months without employment.

**My Strategy**

**A Strat**) Look for market research/data jobs. Specific field doesn't matter. I just like playing with numbers. This would go on for 2-3 weeks and if no bites after then, I’m going to continue applying to these jobs and move to the B strat.

**B Strat**) These two things would be my source of income if I can’t find work within the first month and need income to last until I get to Web Dev level.

1) Temp agencies - I've read solid things about a few of them on this sub and it seems like it could be the experience I need to get over the lack of experience hurdle since my only employment is the college data management internship.

2) Kaplan Tutoring - pretty self explanatory. Solid income for a shorter term arrangement.

**C Strat**) This is my long term plan.

A) Apply to financial institutions when recruiting begins leveraging my Excel/Accces knowledge and familiarity with statistical analysis techniques.

B) If I still don't have anything gainful by January/February of 2018 I will have enough of a portfolio in JavaScript/Bootstrap/CSS and hopefully experience with some back end tools like node/react/angular so that I could nail a coding interview.

*Questions I have*

1) Any tips for breaking into marketing research/data analyst roles, financial analyst roles, or web dev roles specific to New York? I know what applies in general, but with the uniquely competitive atmosphere in New York, anything could help, for example, which meetups I should attend and which skills I should focus on.

2) For things like marketing/ad agencies or even financial institutions do you think I'd have better luck targeting bigger or smaller firms? Any in particular that stand out in terms of offering entry level positions with my skill set? 

3) I don’t expect this from anyone at all, but if anyone in a marketing/ad agency or finance industry would be willing to run over my resume and/or chat about how I can brand myself in a more appealing fashion in New York and maybe even grab coffee sometime, that would be amazing. 

Any critique/advice/help would be welcome. Thanks!

(More focused on plot, if possible guys thanks)",Emma-O-Donallie,Roleplaykik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/6qlcbw/f4a_basic_zombie_apocalypse_with_some_sex_more/,"I want to do a basic role-play, orientated around a zombie apocalypse. I'll be twenty four and name is Charlotte. I'll be an intern at a science facility. You'll be an older male/female, working for the FBI. 

With our knowledge, together, we can teach each other about fire-arms, medicine and create a romance plot in the middle of all that chaos.

I don't want to rush to sex scenes, I want the plot to unravel as well. I want you to write well, be a nice guy but confident; and we wont be know-it-alls. Some times we will not have enough ammunition, or food, or medicine; some times we both get lost, some times we get taken hostage. Who knows?

I write in first person, you can too please; but we can add third person writing now and again.

And I prefer stealth, going and avoiding the zombies.

EmOGosh is my Kik to talk to me about the role-play. And please for christ sakes, don't start with ""hey"", use ""i""'s as ""I""'s and don't be like ""lemme ask you something first"". 

Start with a description of you; I'll just be a basic girl. Brown hair, brown eyes, 5'6, C cups and tight ass. Average people. Okay? 

I like realism. I played a game round a male friends a while back, called the last of him or the last of us, or something? Quite like that, mix it with Fear The Walking Dead and The Walking Dead; but only as context, not content please. I don't want to play any of the characters. 

Thanks xx"

""Hand up higher on your waist Shannon! And tilt your head back more! Do you call that seduction Jessica? I've seen more seductive looks from my grandmother..... And that was at the funeral!"" The three girls, Shannon, Jessica, and.... I honestly don't remember the third's name, I haven't worked with her before, must be tired, they had been posing for hours under the heat of the camera lights. They were framed with the backdrop of a gritty warehouse in lower New York. The clothing company thought that a raw urban setting would help sell this batch of summer items better. The idea lacked taste to me, but money doesn't argue and there weren't any fashion shows for the next couple of weeks. I bent down low, almost laying on my back, as I turned my camera up to take the shot. ""Ahhhhh that's what I was looking for!"" With a few more snaps of my camera I've finished for the set. ""Good work girls we're done for the day!"" They squeal and make their way over to the low carb snack table, giddy to be done. Amateurs really. No beauty or grace in them. They probably got the gig from mommy, pulling a few strings to give her daughter and her friends the dream of being a fashion model they always wanted. I sneer slightly as I begin breaking down the tripods for the lights, that was the problem with the fashion industry. Too many willing models and not enough talent. ""Um Mr. Dalton..."" I swing around in the direction of the voice to see a homely girl, barely in her twenties by the looks of it, standing in front of me. ""What is this Rebecca?"" I shout for my assistant, ""Are we just letting anyone walk around on set now?"" Rebecca rushes up behind the girl. ""I'm sorry sir she just slipped past me."" ""Well see that she's escorted out now! I've got to get everything packed and get back to editing tonight."" ""But sir"", Rebecca shrills, ""she's supposed to be here. Don't you remember that meeting a few weeks ago with the board? You said you'd take on a new intern to model."" I growl angrily, shoving a camera lens into my bag ""They were serious about that!?"" ""Yes sir they were...."" An awkward silence hangs in the air as I hold my head in my hands and sigh. ""What's your background girl?"" Hesitantly, in a shaky voice ""Um I took a photography class in college. I... I just moved to the city and.... Well I needed the job."" Fantastic. No experience.  And what's worse she doesn't look like she has a bone of style in her body. What is this frumpy sweater and jeans look? ""The board says we'll find her a place to stay and you'll train her for at least a month"" Rebecca chimes in. ""Fine! But you listen to me! You'll do everything I say. Exactly how I say it and as soon as I say it. No questions asked. Is that clear? If you can't do that I'll have you back on a plane to Nebraska or wherever the fuck you came from faster than you can say prairie dog."" She positively shouts as she begins jumping up and down. ""Oh thank you oh thank you oh thank you! You won't regret it. I'll do everything you say!"" ""Good now carry this box. We need to take this all back to my studio first.""

Sorry for the long start I like tend to ramble on by myself at the start of an idea. I would love to make this long term, but if you'd like to jump in for just a few days that would be ok too. I'm not very picky about grammar and sentence structure as long as you're doing it because you want to. I'm also not too pick about length as long as it's not all one sentence responses. As far as where we take this, that's up for us to decide. I personally love long stories with a good build up, possible romance, passion, and well developed characters, but I would be ok with a short, right to the action story too. As far as kinks go I'm pretty vanilla. If you want a short story just continue where I left off, if you'd like a long story message me with a bit about yourself and some ideas of your own and we'll go from there.   "
6qmcww,533,2017-07-31,My brother (29m) is on trial for a very serious crime and I (25f) need a break from the situation however I live with my parents (60's) and they are treating me horribly.,jakabab,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qmcww/my_brother_29m_is_on_trial_for_a_very_serious/,"Straight up, my brother got accused of probably the worst thing you can be accused of. Trials been pushed back for years. When this all went down, I wasn't living at home. I moved back home about 2 years ago because my parents said they wanted me to live with them and not work as much if they were going to pay for my schooling.



My brother is a drug dealer. He's addicted to ketamine. He's a giant fuck up and however, off and on, hes my favorite human. I go through these phases where I party too but the last few months, I'm watching my family fall apart. My OTHER brother got busted for child porn (14+ apparently) on top of this shit with my brother. 



I backed off doing drugs and drinking, I buckled down in school, I started exercising and doing different things. I started getting really resentful of my brother because he's living this fucking wild party lifestyle and not even considering my parents who have POSTED HIS BAIL AND ALMOST HAD TO PUT A 2nd MORTGAGE ON THE HOUSE. On top of this, his gf was my best friend but I can never hang out with her without her doing ketamine so I told them I need them to both back off a bit.



So now.. I've asked for space and I can't get it. My parents always are inviting them over when I just ask for space. For instance, tonight I wanted to have dinner with my folks and they invited brother and gf. I got frustrated and mad, I did. like wtf dude you guys talk about him 24/7. You baby him, you put him first all the fucking time.. Anytime I'm around them, he's the topic of conversation. My dad even told me tonight when I got upset that I shouldn't think I'm so special because I'm not.



I have nowhere to go. I just got two very important interviews for internships this week. They didnt even say congratulations. They tell me I'm a bitch and I'm tearing up the family when I just want respect and space and to be important to them too. 



I'm definitely not playing like I'm the nicest in the situation but it's just gotten progressively worse. I just asked for space in the beginning. I just wanted a break and they couldn't give me that. My parents have threatened to kick me out because sometimes I just yell at them fucking please, let me be important too. I'm your godamn daughter. I'm the child who isn't probably going to federal prison. Take care of me too. 



Literally the situation is so bad that they want to help me change my last name. That's how fucked up the situation is. Anytime I do anything good, it just falls by the wayside. I want to be important to my parents. I want them to treat me nicely. I just want space away from my brothers and the drugs and the lawsuits and how it consumes my entire life when I dont even want to be apart of it.



I have no money. Nowhere to go. I dont know what to do. What should I do in this situation? Can they kick me out if they wanted too? 




  **tl;dr**:  My brother is a drug dealer on trial for some heavy shit. I need space and time from him but I live with my parents who are completely 24/7 consumed with him and they treat my like shit. "
6qmd6n,1,2017-07-31,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend [26M] of 1.5+ years, should we break up or work through it?",ConflictedAnd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6qmd6n/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_15_years_should/,"It kills me to type this question.  We started dating in December of 2015 and the first six months or so were so perfect.  I had had small fwb situations but this was my first relationship.  I was skeptical (especially because I wasn't looking to be in a relationship at all) but everything was so good.  He is incredibly sweet and respects me and makes a huge effort to get along with my friends and family.  Basically, he's the perfect boyfriend and all of my friends and family love him (as they should.)

We started fighting about stuff about six months into dating.  At that point, I had an internship in the States and he was taking care of some business in his home country (10,000 miles away.)  I was trying to dive into my internship, leaving him feeling neglected in an LDR.  (His last relationship had been almost entirely LDR and went horribly wrong so he was extra jumpy about this one.)  He visited me at the beginning but once he went home he was wildly insecure all summer, even going as far as to text my roommate for the summer to try to get her to have me talk to him after I had said goodbye and turned off my phone and computer because I had an extremely early morning and it was 3am and I couldn't fight with him anymore that night.

This put a huge strain on the relationship but once we were back in the same city things seemed to be better (this time, practically living together-our apartments this year were adjoining which is convenient.)  He apologized for causing me so much stress and I assured him that I would communicate better.  We fought over small stuff during the year but nothing huge.

Fast-forward to May 2017.  A couple months before, we impulse-bought some insanely cheap tickets to Europe for May.  His sister lives there so we went to visit her.  This was my dream city to visit and I was so excited to be there with him.  However, due to some weird and difficult circumstances (severe illness, luggage drama) the trip ended up being sort of stressful.  At one point, I thought we had broken up- we got to this point during one particular conversation where he wasn't willing to live apart from me and I wasn't willing to compromise my goals and career trajectory for this relationship.  We both just stopped and realized that maybe we weren't compatible.  We put the discussion away for a while until we weren't in Europe on a ""dream"" vacation anymore but it's come up a couple times since and always been murky.

We both work as musicians on the same instrument.  I've devoted 18 years of my life to this career so far and only 1.5 years to this relationship so we've talked about how at this point I need to put my career goals first.  He doesn't always seem to do the same even though he claims he feels the same way which scares me- I don't want him resenting me down the road if he puts me over his career (I've told him this too.)

Also, he swore he would be different this summer when we were in practically the same situation (I was at an internship and he was doing concerts in his home country) but he still couldn't stop freaking about communication even though I was texting/calling/skyping him way more often.  It seemed like nothing I did was good enough.  We got into an enormous fight after about 3 weeks and I wanted to break up with him right then and there but didn't want to do it from 10,000 miles away.  Since then, the tension has cooled and I'm glad I didn't break up with him in the heat of the moment, but every time we fight I get closer and closer to ending it.

What always stops me from ending things is that he is my best friend in the world and I'm his best friend.  I tell him everything and he's the only person I've felt completely comfortable with in my entire life.  He's an extremely good guy and I love him so much.  I just wonder if we would have been better off to not even start dating but just be best friends.  Things are so complicated and I can't even think about not having him in my life anymore, but I'm not sure if we could ever move past a breakup to be friends.  I don't necessarily want to break up with him either, but we don't seem to be compatible as a couple even though we love each other so much.  Any advice or insight you could give would be so helpful.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Bf and I seem to have recurring issues that might mean we're not compatible but he's my best friend in the world and I can't stand the thought of not having him in my life (and vice versa).  "
6qmfme,27,2017-07-31,Another month coming to an end,smelerby,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/6qmfme/another_month_coming_to_an_end/,"I'm glad to say that July has been a positive month for me. I've done a lot of things that I wouldn't have done if I were still in the relationship with my ex. I've gone outside my comfort zone. 

What have I done?

* I took a holiday job at the company I interned for instead of having the usual 2 month summer break
* I went out to bars a lot more the past month than I had ever done before in my life
* I've been more social in general which lead to meeting new people
* Been reading a lot more which has given me a lot of strength and insights
* I've continued to hit the gym religiously and I'm getting in the best shape of my life
* **I've been working hard on living in the moment, instead of dwelling on the past and trying to figure out the future**

Another thing: during the past couple of weeks my ex has reached out on multiple occasions and it didn't affect me. I found out that nothing has changed on her side over the past 5 months and that we're 100% finished. She doesn't see a future for us and I'm pretty sure she doesn't love me anymore. I wish I could say the same, but I'm afraid I still do love her and that's okay. We reached the point to where we can be ""acqaintances"" I guess. We added eachother back on instagram and facebook a little while ago and while it hurt in the beginning, it gets way easier over time. I'm fine with seeing new pictures or whatever now.

During this month I've also met a girl at a bar and we've been texting more and more the past couple of days. She's not as hot as my ex was, but she seems like a very kind and loving person. I don't know what will come of it, but it's good to see that there's other girls out there. Even if it doesn't work out with this one, I'm sure another good person will cross my path.

Looking back on July I can say that I've made some real progress and it gives me a lot of motivation for the weeks/months to come. I have a short summer break coming up, a new internship after that and a potential new girl in my life. 

I'm sure there's still going to be bad days, but I'm stepping into August with my head held high and so should you! Trust me when I say it's all going to be better from here. I didn't believe I could ever get over my ex and I'm still not completely there yet, but I know that someday I will. For the people that know my story and know in what a bad place I've been for months, I hope this can serve as a little bit of motivation for a better future. If I could drag myself out of the shithole I was in, so can you. Stay strong friends. Better days are ahead of us &lt;3"
6qmmqq,4,2017-07-31,Got myself into a very tight spot. How to move on?,Germaniac123,askMRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/askMRP/comments/6qmmqq/got_myself_into_a_very_tight_spot_how_to_move_on/,"Hello Guys,

I registered here after being recommended to do some reading in to Red Pill by some guys at Shrink4men Forum after I posted my story there.


Small introduction about myself and the shit that I've got myself into:


I'm 33 years old, married to a 34 year old wife. I come from a ""good"" home, hers was kinda fucked up. Born much later than her brother/sister, dad being a tard, etc. We met in 2009 during my graduation internship, after which we stayed together. She was single for 1-2 years, after being in a 8 year long relationship with some guy who didn't do shit. As far as I can aware (not that it actually matters), he's still a deadbeat who lives at his parents with his wife/kid.


I was a very introvert guy when I was young (&lt;21). My mom noticed I was just playing video games and not doing shit so she dragged my ass to the doctor/psychologist and it seemed I had indeed some very introvert behavior, mainly because of being insecure about myself (tall, skinny). A couple of psychology sessions and a assertivity training further, I was a reborn man. Especially the assertivity training still helps me to this day. Decided to go to the gym and eat proteine like a mofo and my confidence got a boost. 


Regardless of being more assertive/extravert I was not able to pick up girls. Not sure what caused it, I guess I just wasn't the kind of guy that would pick girls up at the club. I dated some girls that I met online, but it never turned out to be anything too serious as they were moving for their studies etc. etc. 


So basically speaking, my current relationship/marriage is my first LTR that I have been in. And to be honest, I am not feeling it anymore and I have come to the conclusion that I have been feeling unhappy for quite some time. There have been some major red flags that I have ignored in the past, for which my mom has warned me. At that time I was in love and told my mom it was all going to be OK and that we had talked it over.... in fact turns out we didn't and still don't talk shit over.


These red flags were: 

- OCD shit;
- Controlling behavior accompanied by a high amount of inflexibility. I come from a family where a lot happened spontaniously, there was no more room for that and that currently still is an issue.
- Not being able to communicate properly without just simply lashing out in order to hurt the other one and end the discussion.
- Very black &amp; white in a lot of things.
- Very dominant.


Anyway, as time passed I in all honestly thought every relation had this kind of shit. Boy was I wrong and should I have taken action a lot sooner.


Due to me thinking, ""this is normal, and guess that's what its going to be like in the future"" i just settled with it and went on. We moved in together after I lived on my own for a year, that's when the shit started. I wasn't allowed to decorate shit in my house (not that I actually cared that much, but it gives some indication on controlling behavior). Sex got a lot less and she stopped smoking. Stopping to smoke isn't a bad thing, but apparently in some women's mind stopping to smoke gives them a free card to eat a lot more candy. 


During that period I think she gained like 5 KG or so. She never had a model figure, but I didn't really care. Skinny girls weren't my kind of thing, but the fat ones aren't either. FYI - her family are all fatties. Her sister weighs like 110-120kg, same goes for her brother although he's a tall guy. None of them work out and they just like to eat all the shit that makes sick. She worked out (spinning classes at work) in the first few years, but after they moved to a new office location they quit offering those classes..... and thus she didn't work out anymore. She doesn't like a gym, just wants to do spinning and those spinning classes were offered at shitty times for her (which is bullshit, i know). Fine by me, but just do it then. We were able to buy one of those spinning bikes from her employer once they quit, but as it probably goes in a lot of these situations, it's not being used.


Fast forward, we bought a house in 2014. The house is perfectly livable in, but needs work as a lot of stuff is outdated. Since I'm too much of a cheapskate I decide to do it all by myself. It's a welcome addition to do my daily IT-job and doing this gets my mind of things and makes me feel more manly. You're actually building something yourself that I never imagined that I could. I never did any of this so it makes me fucking proud, although it takes a while since I'm on a full-time job. 


During all this time her controlling shit kept happening but for some reason I still thought, oh fuck it. I'll be okay and even decided to propose to her. Before I did this I informed my mom, and the first thing she said, ""are you sure that you want this? you can still back out you know"". And again I was fucking naive.


Ever since we moved in together, the sex has gotten (a lot) less. One of the reasons was me coming quite soon, the other one is that she has just gained too much weight and I have began to lose my appetite in her. When I talked to her about her needing to go to the gym and eat less crap, I immediately got shit like ""i know i would be hurt again"", ""you're talking me into some minority complex"" bullshit and I even felt sorry for her. Also she explictely said, ""you cant force me to do shit"".


Still, after all this red flagging I got married and fucked myself over. On top of that, I managed to get her pregnant as well. 


The pregnancy / cheating:

This whole pregnancy period has been fucking terrible to me. Obviously hormones play a role every now and then, but her unhealthy behavior (mindgames as well as eating) has just seem to have gotten a whole lot worse. Basically pregnancy in her eyes is an excuse to gain more weight, eat/drink a lot of the good (soda, ice cream, snacks, candy, whatever) and exercise even less. Result, she now weighs 98 KG, which is like 8 more than me. My mom told her, ""when i was pregnant, ice cream was my guilty pleasure"" which my wife immediately interpreted as ""fuck yeah ice cream every day!"". Of course being pregnant is a free card to be a dick. When I say something about her being a dick i get shit like ""fuck you i'm not that bad compared to other women"".

During this dark period, something I never thought myself of being capable of happened. We got an intern at our firm and we immediately clicked. 10 years younger, smart and makes sure she stays in shape. Since I was in a dark period with my wife, I thought fuck it and made a move. This shit made me feel so good, I haven't felt like that in years. My testosterone was pumping and I couldn't care less about my wife's feelings. She has been making me feel like shit for a longer period and I needed this. 

Anyway, we (me and the girl) decided that well, although we have an incredible click (basically we share a lot more interests than I do with my wife, such as traveling or other life goals), I cannot do anything because:

a) I'm married;
b) I'm expecting a baby.

Well, my wife continued to give me shit while I was working full-time, renovating a house and not getting ANY sexual shit at all so I took it one step further. I ended up fucking this girl a couple of times and it was incredible. My wife just told me in front of our friends that I'm not getting any while she is pregnant and that I just need to use my hand for a couple of more months. Not even a HJ or a BJ, just nothing. So I thought to myself if you're going to give me that much shit and not anything sexual, I'll get it elsewhere. Over the past 2 months I think we had sex like 4 times or so.

Now this girl was (and I think) still is in love with me, but told me that she wasn't going to be waiting there forever. She either wanted me to leave, or give her some sort of time span on when I think its gonna happen. I told her that I can't do that, because leaving just before the baby is born is a dick move, but leaving during breastfeeding period probably is as well. Well cheating probably is too, but I did what I did and this topic here I can relate to: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4c8e2b/the_cheaters_script/ .... ""you never this, you always that"" and more of that shit. 

We decided to be friends and now she is trying to close this chapter with the note that ""if it is meant to be, it will all work out"". Now she told me that she's dating some other guy and I am fucking jealous. Never thought I could be, but I don't like it just one bit. Obviously we have less contact now, and I find that really hard to deal with. My wife's not giving me proper attention and now I have lost the one thing that was giving me positive energy as well. Sidenote though - I am not entirely sure if she really is GF/Wife material. Just after 2 weeks she started sending me nudes and shit. Perhaps it was all fun for the time being, but this kinky shit is nice. My wife is just plain boring on all levels.

I haven't read the books mentioned in the sidebar yet, but I did try some of the other things (even before the pregnancy) but it didn't work out. Perhaps her personality just doesn't allow it? If I imply dread it completely backfires.

Do you even lift brah? 

Yes, I lift. I have been going to the gym for weightlifting for years as I think staying in shape is good. I do it for myself, but also for her. She tells me that she doesn't give a fuck and would rather see me with more fat other than looking like fucking wolverine. I'm making good gains but due to my metabolism I'm having a very hard time gaining in terms of weight. I'm 2.05meters and weigh around 90KG. I'm not skinny at all and decently muscular. Due to my tall body deadlifting and that sort of stuff makes me prone to injuries so I can't do those. 

Did you try fix her feelz? 

Well I have been trying to be a nice guy. But if you're a dick in house and just keep eating shit I dont want you to eat, don't expect any mercy from me. Responding with love and care when you are a dick is awarding dick behavior in my eyes. I am (or used to be) a BluePill guy. She always refers back to ""you are not that kind and sweet anymore"". Also comparing me to others which is BS.

Have you tried working out together? 

Yes, and I cannot get her ass off the couch. Netflix &amp; Chill all the way. She's been saying that she wants to start spinning once the baby is out, but I call BS. She has ""i will start spinning again"" before and never did. Regardless of that, once she actually manages to work out she believes that she needs a reward and eats those calories she just lost back on. I cannot get her to go running with me or go to the gym. She doesn't like it and I can't force her. An occasional walk doesn't get her to lose any significant amount of weight. 

Did you try changing the eating habits?

Yeah I tried. I get bullshit like ""I'm an adult. i can do whatever the fuck i want"". When we're in the supermarket and I want to put the candy back in the shelf, ""dont you dare put that back in the shelf."". Proudly says that she knows that she's good with candy.

I discussed this with her a few weeks ago, she immediately went into the crying mode. She says she hasn't changed since we met and things like that. I told her that I am changing and that I am seriously done with more and more of her bullshit. 

Seriously guys I am lost for words. I'm currently in the mode of not giving a fuck anymore. I tried using arguments like too much sugar is bad for the baby, but those are all thrown overboard with shit like ""you cant look through the eyes of a pregnant woman"" and other bullshit. 

FYI - there is nothing wrong with my eating habits. I hardly eat candy and in the evening i just eat unsalted cashew nuts for max gains.

Oh yeah before I forget to add, I discussed ALL my shit with my parents and brother/sister in law. The first thing they said was ""we thought you liked her behavior."" and ""we were thinking of warning you"".

Should I imply more dread? Work out even more? What about this other girl? Should I avoid contact with her at all? Is my marriage dead already?

So, to summarize: 

I am unhappy in my marriage and can't seem to turn it around as my wife doen't want to play ball. In my eyes she feels like she has it all: house, guy with a good job, baby on its way. what could go wrong? I notice that I am changing (figuring out what i do and do not want in work/life and being very productive in/around the house), and her behavior is one of those things. Also I cheated and would probably do it again if I could. Obviously I wasn't aware of the levels of dread, and i went from 0 to 11 straight away. What to do with this baby? I really am looking forward to this little girl, but cannot see it working out in the long run. Furthermore our communication just sucks. I am unable to have a rational discussion with this woman AT ALL. If it gets even slightly tense she just says very hurtful things and nothing gets spoken out.

Also I really like this RedPill materialand I will swallow it. I've noticed that I am already changing in how I behave towards others, this Red Pill material suits it just fine. I'm already watching the video's and will read the books that go with it.

Oh and no - i'm not looking for confirmation on whether or not I should cheat. I did what I did for (in my eyes) obvious reasons. 

Before I forget, I also have plenty of other hobbies myself. I love biking, photography, occasional gaming, restoring old volvo's. She on the other hand has none. She says she likes drawing every now and then but she doesn't get off the couch at all. If she does anything with her ""decorative"" hobby once a year, it is already much. I tried talking her into getting another hobby and the first thing i get is ""stop talking me to take on a hobby""."

- Family business between my dad and his sibling isn't working out because my uncle sucks at his part of the deal and he turned out to be stealing money from my dad. 

- That uncle's son is dying and we can't be around him in his time of need because of the conflict between our families caused by my uncle's greed.

- Me and my brother can't afford to BOTH go to university at the same time, my younger brother doesn't want to go to community college like me and it breaks my heart since he worked hard to get into his uni. We are avoiding student loans but I feel bad for not being able to pay for my own education without my parents' aid. 

- My grandpa has brain tumor and he lives in another country. I feel bad that my mom has to be away from her dad at this point to be around us in ""the land of opportunity"". I want my parents to be happy but that would mean having them leave the country, but neither one of my siblings is willing to move back there, and my parents are trying to keep the family together. 

- My mental health has severely deteriorated in the past year due to the loss of two close friends who stopped suddenly talking to me, and I can barely function in day to day basis anymore. I'm at a point where I can't eat, sleep or concentrate on anything. 

- I put myself in very stupid and reckless positions and got myself entangled with an asshole who sexually molested me and I feel more fuckin worthless than I was before. 


I just feel like my very presence is too much of a reliability on my family than it is worth. Like it was proven before over and over again, I am easily replaceable and forgettable to people. I feel bad not having my brother go to uni because my parents can only afford my tuition. I should be up on my feet working my ass off to pay for uni but I was too occupied with college and in a non-pay internship to get a part time job. I just feel exhausted and completely burned out. I want to disappear, not exist for a while. These days I can't tell what's happening around me, I feel like I'm floating outside my body.

""Omg why are you being so childish and irresponsible""


Some background. I'm a student live at hostel with my mates. Last year, they didn't pay the bills for like 3/4 months. During that month, I was away from the hostel because I was doing my internship. After I finished my internship, I came back and check the bills they didn't pay. I had to terminate my contract immediately. 


I've terminated the contract in May. Returned all the equipment. They gave a penalty of RM500 which transfer to my outstanding bill. If I recall correctly, the penalty was for terminating less than a year. 


Alright everyone. Call me a fucking irresponsible cunt or anything you want because I didn't pay the bills. 

So, I have an outstanding unifi bill of RM1400+. Now this guy keep calling me to settle the bill and I'm just like I don't have the money. He's said just find a way to settle or else we have to take action against you. I said, ""Just blacklist me I don't care just do it."" He replied, ""no, more than that. Go to court blah blah blah we'll take action against you.""


Now, what should I do? 

""Of course la you inform your parents you irresponsible cunt""


Yeah yeah, of course they'll pay. But I don't want them to babble and shit. Plus, I'm on my last semester now. They don't have that much money though. 


""Why didn't you contact your housemates?""


They ran away don't know where the fuck they go still finding them. If I find them, should I drag them?


""Actually, to make things easier, why don't you just end yourself?""

Planning to."

The problem is, the report system is too easy to abuse, just TAB during a game and 3 clicks send a report. How do you want Blizzard to go through all those reports? They just can't unless they hire an army of interns.

We need a full detailed report system with mandatory timestamps, screenshots, and whatnot. It will discourage people from reporting every player they don't like and ease the job for Blizzard to review reports.

They could even ask the community for moderators if they don't want to spend money on this, I'm sure people here would be happy to help.

    Dear Mr. YYY,
    
    at first, we regrettably don't offer any student internships at the moment.
    Not speaking German would not be a problem if we had an offer, but I really see a big problem in your application.
    To call a stranger, maybe your future supervisor, by his first name is really not ""best practice"" in Germany.
    Even if you only wanted some detailed information about the internship, be aware your contact person
    may always be expecting a suitable level of etiquette.

I'm 19 years old and I was recently (3 months ago) hired as an intern for what's basically my dream job. However, because it's located in a different city, I was forced to move out of my parent's house. I'm not gonna lie, my salary is more than decent for an intern, but I'm having trouble deciding where to spend my money. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

* Half of my paycheck is spent on rent (+ internet, which I need to work)
* Food and health + life insurance are covered by the company I work for, so that's not a problem
* I don't need / want a car at the moment
* Saving for if / when I lose my job shouldn't be an issue, as I can just move back in with my parents

That leaves me with half of my paycheck (~R$500) free to spend as I please. My mom tells me to save that money for when I decide to get a car, but I don't see that happening in the near future. As of now that money is going towards semi-luxury things (last month I bought a TV, for example, as I don't have one at my apartment atm) and going out with friends and stuff. I understand I should be looking to save for retirement and stuff, but considering I'm just an intern living at pretty much borderline ideal conditions (my bedroom is literally a bed and a desk), I don't know if I should be looking to increase my comfort or saving my money for later. Because I've always been sort of an impulse spender, I would like some opinions from others.

Thanks :)"

My mom and I have never gotten along all that well, but it's been ok the last few years. I moved home in 2015.

Recently though I've had enough. No matter what I do, I get constant drama. I live at home but take care of a lot of stuff. She is always telling me I need to stay near her and my step dad and my sister. I don't want to. She flipped out on me the other day and I just lost all hope in building a better relationship. I don't want to deal with her. I have PTSD from my childhood and have been having trouble with it lately. I feel so suffocated and stressed. My commute to school is about an hour each way. I don't have a dedicated space to study at home but generally have quiet weekends available when I do. I don't pay rent and my cat is comfortable here which is why I am reconsidering NOT moving. Plus I only have to work part time. I just want to finish my degree so I can start working.

I'm in the STEM field and although I do struggle with math, I do ok after studying. I'm taking three math-related classes next semester and frankly I'm scared. The last few days I've been thinking of dropping back to one math class and enrolling in a few major-related others. I can fill my schedule with classes that won't be too bad on me. And I can probably get a full time or part time job that pays enough. My internship offered me a part-time job next semester with a significant raise so I may ask if they have more hours available. My boss also knows many other companies so I may be able to get something else.

But I am just so frustrated and stressed. I could probably deal one more semester but I still have a few more left before I transfer, and I will not be able to deal with staying at home the next few years. I'm not interested much in dating, so I don't have a boyfriend to move in with.

I'm struggling with this decision and I wanted to see if anyone had recommendations. I'm not sure how I could handle the commitment of work + school. My expenses are low, gas, insurance, phone. I have a credit card but don't use it much and I'd want to pay it off before I move.

TL;DR: Having trouble deciding on what to do due to my living situation: if I should take fewer classes and get a better job or stay where I am and take my current schedule. Or if I should suck it up and finish the next few semesters before I transfer. Kind of frustrated. "

We've still talked every day and he's called me and checked on me, etc. He's out of state right now for an internship so I haven't seen him in 3 weeks. I thought long and hard, did a lot of soul searching and came to the conclusion that I want him in my life and that I want to work this out. I just believe that we need to establish a solid friendship. I talked to him yesterday and we both agreed that we need to establish a friendship and work on that aspect first and see what happens. 
I asked him if he was going to be dating or seeing anyone in this time and he said no and I told him I wouldn't be either. I also asked him if we would be sleeping together and he didn't have a problem with that, I don't necessarily either but I'm wondering how it's going to work.

While he hasn't done anything more than steal a glance when he thinks no one is looking, his wife has picked-up on his interest. Although she is bothered at first, eventually she realizes that she can use this attraction to liven their sex-life. She starts to drop hints that she knows, tease her husband, and eventually indulge in roleplaying as the daughter, complete with wearing her clothes (or athletic uniform) and fucking on her bed. This could proceed slowly if you like, with one or both characters having second thoughts about their actions before giving in to depravity. We could also actually involve the daughter or not, depending on your desire.


2) Family Vacation. A family of four takes a trip to a lovely tropical resort. Mom and dad of course use the time to connect, while their teen kids are off on their own. Things change, however, when the kids walk in by accident and see everything, apologize embarrassed, and leave. What happens next? Do the parents keep going at it? Is one turned on by the exhibitionism of the moment? Or are they too embarrassed to continue? What about the kid(s)? Turned on? Interested in listening/seeing again? A new sexual awakening occurs, with incestuous temptations facing each family member.


3)A wealthy husband/wife are developing a naughtier relationship that eventually leads to a taboo threesome. I especially like the idea of ""keeping up appearances"": a seemingly upper class, perfect couple, happily married, beautiful home, golf &amp; country club, etc. ... but behind closed doors, they are into something darker, like infidelity, light BDSM, and so forth. I feel that in the proposed social setting, our characters have certain behaviors expected of them as a well-off couple, and it would be fun to bend and break those rules...perhaps working additional characters along the way. Broadly, our couple develops an interest in attractive younger girl, maybe their neighbors' daughter. Perhaps they're intrigued by her because she's exotic, either due to her youth, race, accent, or some combination. I was thinking she could be high school, college, or early post-college aged. Each of us could court a relationship with her, perhaps sharing a fitness class or having her work an internship. Her parents would of course be our friends (or rivals?) so there'd be some tension, and maybe flirtation with them too as things develop. Other friends and co-workers could be added too. The neighbor's daughter could be young-ish (high school/college) in age, and from a different ethnicity - perhaps our characters, to keep up with the upper class theme, are stereotypical WASPs, whereas she might be more exotic (such as Asian/Filipina/Hispanic). Her parents should be in the picture too, as friends, but not close friends, of the couple. The wife could take a fitness class with her, and the husband get her an internship at his office: the two together would work on her and over time bring her into their lives. Over time, other characters can then feature.


4) Mom/Son. I don't have a specific plot for this, but would love to hear your ideas.

5) I am looking to play a young teen boy (11-14) opposite an older girl (16-20) who could be his sister, cousin, tutor, or neighbor. My character is just starting to experience the raging hormones of adolescence and turns to your character for advice on school, dating, and sex. He of course has a crush on you, which you humor by occasionally letting him see or touch you. But, only if he does things for you first. You indulge your manipulative side, enjoying the power trip of making him do your homework, strip for you, or maybe embarrass him by making him try on your panties in your room. Or, maybe you're simply a loving sister getting your brother to expand his boundaries. Eventually, you press him to include another boy in your play; this could again be a brother, cousin, or friend. Things start off innocently enough with stripping, but you also get us to touch and play with one another. There's a lot of reluctance and adolescent insecurity at first, but this eventually gives way to some deep curiosity. You can decide how directly you want to be involved. Are you simply getting off on watching two boys fool around with one another at your command? Or do you want us both to pleasure you as well? It's your choice. So, if you ever wanted two young, naive boy toys to boss around, send me a message! Likes: I'm a sucker for good descriptions, particularly of visual appearance. I don't mind using pictures, either of celebrities, models, or amateurs, but I don't really like anime pictures. I wouldn't say I'm a sub, but I do often appreciate a strong woman. I'm OK with sub women in the bedroom, but I do not like the complete submissive that just has the man in control of everything; overall, there's nothing sexier than a woman with a mind of her own. I don't go for supernatural stuff very much, though a bit of mind-control might be fun. I prefer realistic roles set in the present, particularly for incest and taboo roles. Nothing sexier than a naughty family amidst the presumed boredom of suburbia. My favorite themes are bisexuality, incest, inter-racial, experimentation/pushing boundaries, voyeurism, exhibitionism, sexy clothes/outfits, multiple characters.

I'm happy to substitute step-siblings or parents if your prefer to play that way.

6qqizb,1,2017-07-31,Talia's Suicide.avi,Lilia_24,TrollpastaArchives,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrollpastaArchives/comments/6qqizb/talias_suicideavi/,"I was an intern for Zodiak Kids Studios (formerly Marathon Media Group) and worked as an animator for different television shows, including the worldwide famous classic Totally Spies!. However, there was also a new girl show that I was so much in love with. It's name was LoliRock. I would at times obsess over it and think about new adventures the girls who are actually princesses would go on. Something exciting about the show was that it had 2 seasons with a number of 26 episodes in which they are together 52. However, there was a planned 53rd episode that never went on air on television, not even around the world.

One day, the crew and I were given a mysterious CD cover by our head director and creator, Jean-Louis Vandestoc. He said that he was given it by an anonymous producer. It had no picture of the main girls on it, but it had a text which had the handwriting to that of a child. The text said ""TALIA'S SUICIDE"". We thought that it was just another crappy fanfiction from a fan. Legend says that if you watch the episode, you will have severe nosebleeds, deafness and feel like you're being watched; but then we were curious of knowing what was inside this cover, so we put the CD inside our main computer. When the episode was about to start, we expected an awesome episode with a new song and action-themed fight scenes, but what we got instead was undoubtedly one of the eeriest and most disturbing things a human being could ever experience.

The opening theme song started out as normal, but things began to go darker when we noticed that halfway the intro was distorted and the song ""Higher"" being more slower and slower. The intro then ended with a static with the sound of a woman screaming.

The episode started with Izira, Talia's older sister, being in the hellish prison fortress Krozak in Ephedia, in which several other of the imprisoned people standing in line. One of the police officers then shouted ""Take what white-haired n***er away!"", implying Izira. She then gets thrown into infinite burning lava, killing her and what is left is her skeleton.

Meanwhile, when Talia got a recorded message from her mother, she announced that Izira was dead, and she became depressed. Talia then when out of her room and went out of Aunt Ellen's house to find an alone place to cry in. Iris, Auriana, Carissa and Lyna then saw Talia walking, and Auri asked why she looked so depressed. No one answered, but Lyna then admitted that maybe it has something to do with her sister.

The girls then run to the blue diamond girl, curious to know what actually happened to her. Talia is then seen at a cliff, ready to jump to her death. Iris runs to Talia, and tells her what happened. Talia then said that her sister was killed earlier, and she starts jumping to her death to have the people of both Ephedia and Earth. Carissa then casts a crystal spell to save her, but the spell gets broken and Talia falls. The girls then start crying and kill theirselves as well.

The next scene then cuts to Talia as a ghost, flying to outer space and to Ephedia to find her dead sister. After finally making it to the planet, she finds Krozak, and realizes that her sister is not there, but she is lurking there somewhere.

Talia then dives into the lava to find Izira's skeleton, and it was there, but she couldn't pick it up since she is a ghost now. Talia suddenly hears a voice from Izira that she is there. Talia gets excited, and both she and her sister hugged, showing their sisterly love. The sisters then proceed to end all human, plant, animal and alien life by going into many different planets to kill the creatures there.

After watching the episode, we began to face serious consequences just like the legend, and one of our crew got even nightmares and quit their jobs. The producer who gave Vandestoc the suicide episode has since been fired and sentenced to at least 5 years in prison for making his colleagues feel ill due to his said episode.

So I am going to be a fourth year physics student at a public university. I am one of two females in a class of 30 physics majors in my year. For the last three years I have dealt with several total assholes who have made a lot of comments regarding my abilities to do physics and it is getting annoying. It could be anything small like ""Need a man to do those conversions for you?"" to something very hurtful like ""I heard you got your affirmative action acceptance"" when I got accepted to an internship for NASA. Normally I brush these things off and tell myself that these guys are just insecure assholes who will feel threatened by anyone regardless of race or sex. But sometimes it starts to creep on me and I worry that it affects me on an unconscious level. I used to have very little support from my parents growing up. I wanted to do CS when I was in middle school and my mom used to tell me that CS is for either for men or for ""ugly women"". My dad discouraged me from university and didn't help me pay for the first two years on the grounds that I ""wouldn't be able to hack it"". He also genuinely believed that women were intellectually inferior. I know it sounds very whiny and stupid but sometimes I think that (outside of other external factors) my GPA was affected by my own subconscious bias in my first and second year of university. I got a low 3.0 overall if anyone is curious. It wasn't until third year when I attended a conference for women in physics, I was incredibly inspired that my self confidence sky rocketed and I killed my third year ending with an overall 3.8 avg. Even so, sometimes I still have a hard time believing in myself. So sometimes this really affects my productivity and my outlook on things. I got a department award for being an outstanding physics student but I immediately dismissed it. I think that this is mostly just low self esteem. I wish I could develop much thicker skin, but sometimes it's hard. I have started going to therapy to deal with this on an internal level, but I want to also try to deal with this on an external level. I want to start sticking up for myself. Does anyone have any advice on doing so? I want to enjoy my physics program more. "

Her bra dangled from the chair. She snatched it up. Clipped it on. He sprawled on the bed. She envied his spent peace. She had school. That annoyed her. 

She pulled on her tank top. Her shorts followed. Then her flip-flops. She checked her hair in the mirror. Beautiful. She wiped away a mascara smear on her cheek. Blew a breath into a cupped hand. She stuck a piece of spearmint gum in her mouth, chewed loudly until most of the flavor saturated into her cheeks and spit it out.

On the sidewalk, she watched three men cross the street. She waved, smiled. One young man turned red. She laughed. His number had never been reset. It was high. So high. He must be close to twenty-five. Pathetic? Yes. Religious?  Probably. He blushed too easily.

She crossed the street. A girl walked by her. The translucent red number ticked up in seconds, minutes then hours. An eight?  Eight hours. She couldn’t have been more than seventeen. A low shirt and a high skirt. Half a whore. 
 
The warm breeze caressed her legs as he had moments ago. He had run his hands up and down, her legs smooth and soft, trailing kisses along the backside of her knees and over her thighs.

Turning, she moved towards campus. The breeze ran gentle fingers across her bare skin. No hurry. She didn’t mind if she was a little late. She wanted to bask like her man, lying on the bed, blissfully tired, sticky. He would fall asleep. His number would tick up until she returned. Then back to zero. Sinful zero.

The sidewalk curved around a large maple and a man passed her. Lawyer type. Nerd. Fifty-three days, seven hours, and twelve minutes. No self-respecting man would let their number get so high. Embarrassing.

On the outskirts of campus, along the bushes with pollen-laden flowers, bees hummed. Red numbers blinked above each tiny minion head. Poor little bugs.
  
The sidewalk kneed left and she walked onto campus. She passed her fellow students, eyeing their numbers. Some were devoted to school. She didn’t need the numbers to know that, only their bulging backpacks. Others were only learning to lower their numbers. 

She walked by a boy on a bench. He hooted at her. Damn hot, he said. Wanted her. She shot him a smile, all teeth and no sugar. Then turned her back and walked on. He was rude. Uncouth. Unfortunate he had a low number. She knew his type. He treated girls like he treated a toilet after a night of drinking. No regard for aim.

In class. Two minutes early. She could have lingered next to him longer. The chair was damp with someone’s sweat. Sweat. She remembered the liquid beading across his forehead like a clear war paint, a paint of victory and exhaustion. 

She never let her number go above twenty-four hours. Shameful. And today was her easy day. One class. No work. Her number could be as low as she wanted. She should have skipped.

She stood and took a dry seat. The clock ticked at the far end of the classroom, a sad reminder. The number above her own head, the number she could never see, ticked higher. She had to get back to him. He could trace a finger along her breasts, run his hands over her hips and across her shoulder blades, kissing her skin with each touch of a finger. She could tangle her fingers in his hair, squeeze his ass. She could press kisses across his chest to the flat panes of his stomach and beyond. 

Classmates came in. Mostly high numbers. Her professor walked through the door, old, dressed in a blinding soirée of color. Above the white, crinkled hair a two followed by the ticking hours, minutes and seconds. Two?  She sat up straight. Two days? Impressive. 

Every second her number rose. She felt her anxiety tick up a notch like steam building in a porcelain teakettle. She didn’t like high numbers. Not designed to handle the heat. She needed her number reset four times a day. Kept her invigorated and fresh. Kept her thinking she was sexy. Later, her man would show her how quickly a number could drop; it would be fast, and rough, like a mechanical bull. A wild thrill with potential for pain.

The professor’s voice rose. It cracked with the dust of crypts. She had one of the lowest numbers. Astonishing. Commendable. But students always hit a mid-week snag. Hump day indeed. She shouldn’t be surprised. 

She laughed to herself. If only others could see the numbers, the days, the hours, the minutes. Oh, those ever-ticking upward minutes. Students scratched away in their notebooks. Doodling. Takings notes. Half had numbers so high they obviously didn’t care. Scary. She couldn’t imagine.

A student hurried through the door flushed from his chin to his hairline with a lopsided grin. Eleven minutes. Envy shot through her but she tried to squash it once she took a closer look. A shirt in disarray, not tucked in. Unbuttoned. Half-way zipped pants. Disgusting. Hot. With who?  The grad student with the matching number, dressed like a dead tree, walking in two steps behind.

The professor gave a clipped reprimand about tardiness. 

She shifted in her seat. Uncomfortable. Her number was always the lowest. Not today. That surprised her. Made her itch. Annoyed. Turned her on. So risky, so hot. She wished her man shared a class with her. She could only imagine what they could do in the rooms before class. Another surge of envy. She should have the lowest number. Not a dingy grad and a disheveled boy.

The professor talked. Droned on about the philosophy of ethics. 

Where had the grad student done it?  Closet?  No. Bathroom?  Too many people peed. Her office. It had to be there. The student had pushed the papers off. Took her there. She could imagine her man doing the same – sweeping the papers and books off the desk and pushing her onto the cool tabletop. The mood would be urgent, rough, with choking, strangled kisses. Damn. She needed to get to him. 

She twisted in her seat. She wanted to go. Now. She couldn’t just leave; she paid for the crinkled, over-used paper bag to teach her. She could feel the steam rise. Another five minutes and she would reach her boiling point. Too much heat and porcelain would crack. She needed to get back to him. Her number *had* to be the lowest.

Nearly time. She perched on the edge of the chair. The seconds dragged. She needed to lower her number. Time. She jumped from her seat. She froze and looked up. Someone had called her name. Her stomach dropped as if she had just heard the breaking snap of the condom. The professor wanted to speak with her in the office. Fucking fantastic. 

The grad student ran out the door. The student toy followed as if tugged on a leash. Her number ticked up. She hated the grad student. So unfair. How long had it been?  She tried to do the math. Too long. 

She turned down the hall for the professor’s office. The student sat outside the TA’s adjacent door. Eagerly. She imagined the heavy, zesty, intoxicating scent of sex soaking the room. She gritted her teeth.

The professor sat at her desk, smiled in greeting and offered her a seat. She smiled politely in turn. She needed to get this done. Needed to get back to him. She imagined him cupping her face gingerly, tracing a finger down the length of her back. He would smile and kiss her lips, touching his tongue to hers and trail kisses down her check and jaw to nip her neck. She would giggle as he lightly touched the deep inside of her thigh or traced the smooth skin of her wrist. Wrist play. She shivered.

The professor talked. She wanted to tell the woman her shriveled husband waited. Don’t you want him?  She almost said it so the professor would excuse her. She had to get back.

She stopped listening. It was about an internship. Cool. She would do it. Agreement made people shut up faster. Email her the information. Got it. The professor wanted to discuss her future. Grad school?  Sure. She would say anything to zip the teacher’s jabbering mouth. She ached for him. Her fingernails dug into her palms, her feet itched to run so she could reach him sooner. She would tug off his pants and shirt, grind her hips against his pelvis in a sharp circular motion and mark his chest with nail-shaped battle wounds. 

The babble stopped. The professor smiled and gestured to the door. Free. She thanked the professor and walked out. Gave the waiting student a smile. Then she winked. She made sure he looked at her ass. Swayed it like she walked on a ship’s rolling deck. There was nothing better than watching something you couldn’t have. She had learned that dirty wisdom long ago.

She went down the hall. Her flip-flops clopped against her as she tried to hurry. Flip-flops were a poor choice. The three girls in front of her laughed. One whispered about last night but her number was too high. Cock tease. 

A girl with large glasses, so bug-like, passed the three partiers. She wore long sleeves even in such temperatures. Five hours. Shit. A queen bee dressed like a minion.

She walked out of the building and across the green. Students lounged there, letting their numbers rise and rise. She wanted to run. Didn’t want to look ridiculous.

Down the sidewalk and off campus. The birds above her chirped. Their voices were thick in the air, heavy like gooey honey. It reminded her of a night with liquid sugar drizzled across her stomach and hips. He licked up the honey with a hot mouth. So sweet, so dark. A top ten memory.

A fat orange cat watched her as she cut across a lawn. Above its head, numbers that had never been reset ticked forever up. Poor thing. Neutered.

Another girl passed her. Never reset either. She should meet up with that religious blusher. Perfect match of celibacy. The walking signal flashed. The time to lower her number had finally arrived. Home never felt so good.

She opened the door. He sat on the couch wearing only black boxers, flipping through his dissertation, numbers ticking higher, waiting. He looked up, smiled at her.

She took off her shirt. Unhooked her black bra.


**Strangled**

The door clicked shut behind her. The smell of her spearmint gum lingered like frost in morning shadows. He groaned and stretched. Spent. Exhausted. Oddly relaxed. Tired. God, was he tired. 

He lay sprawled across the bed – he should be working on his dissertation, heading out to the gym, anything – but he couldn’t quite muster the strength to pull himself off the sweat-damp sheets. Not yet. He dragged his hands over his face.  

His phone pinged in warning. He had one hour until her class finished. One hour tick off a box on his long list of to-dos. One hour to recover. Recharge. 

*One* hour.

He willed himself to shake off the sex-calm, where his mind, free from lust and want, thought logically. Rationally. Rationally, he should leave her. She was murder to his life. In everything. He revolved around her and those damned numbers she saw above everyone’s – everything’s – head. 

The moment of weakness passed like a flicker from a near battery-dead flashlight. He was living a dream. The dream of any man.  

A dream. But kind of a nightmare, too. Things could get so raw so quickly.

He turned his face into the pillow. It smelled of her. Of them. Sweat and her citrus shampoo, her rose and green tea body wash. Sleep tugged. Beckoned. Sunlight streamed into the room between the broken blinds. She refused to get them fixed. Said the memory was too good. Too rough-sweet.

He had heard rumors of her before he met her. That chick who would try anything. Who was greedy in bed. Who did everything right between the sheets. Or on top of them. But who believed those kinds of rumors in college?  It was always some frat boy’s lie or a stoner’s best high. Never true. Never real.

And then he’d met her. At the grocery store standing in the self-checkout line. Snapping her gum like a ditzy teen. He’d asked her stop. The sound drove him mad. She looked at him, snapped her gum again – a pink pop in her mouth – and asked him to dinner.

The phone pinged a second time in warning. 

He rugged his eyes. So little time. He could call his brother. That was long overdue. And he was an uncle now. Still shocked him his brother was a dad. He could send in that abstract that was due yesterday.  Or fix his bike.  The wheels squeaked and clanged too much anymore.  Or he could work on on his soul-sucking dissertation that was never good enough for his adviser. It was due too soon.

He rolled off the bed, grabbed his boxers from the floor and jerked them on. The elastic band snapped against his skin. She always said that was her favorite sound. He preferred the sound of a bra strap plucked against a naked collarbone or the whisk of lacy panties sliding down freshly waxed legs.

He cracked his back and idly checked the long finger nail tracks running red and angry from his chest to his navel. She was always ever so proud of the battle wounds she inflicted. He’d left a few of his own on her. A hard bite. A little too much suction to leave a smudged hicky against her flawless neck.

A gurgle twisted up from his stomach. Hunger. The sharp and dizzy kind. That was another problem with her. Unless it involved melted chocolate drizzled in forbidden places or a promised aphrodisiac, food was an afterthought. Much like school or water. He, however, was always very aware when he needed to eat. Or piss. Or sleep. Or work. Except when she was around. Then…he just forgot everything else.

He tossed on his yesterday-shirt and a ratty pair of cargo shorts. Stuffed his feet into cracked flipflops. Remembered to grab his wallet. Then he was out the door into the muggy heat of late summer. 

He veered right, aiming for the sandwich dive on the far corner that served drunk college students at all hours of the day. He was hungry enough that even a sloppy sandwich with wilted toppings would taste good. Slightly satisfying. He wasn’t desperate enough to trek any farther. 

What a waste. He should have been working on his dissertation.

A couple passed him. Mid-twenties. To him they looked cute, happy. Effortless. Had she been with him, she would have leaned close, her spearmint breath tickling his ear, and whispered that the girl was cheating or that they’d never actually done the deed and so *couldn’t* be that happy. 

He preferred to think of them as a happy couple.

Inside the sandwich shop, he listed the toppings he wanted. Green peppers. Black olives. He loaded up the sandwich.  He ordered a Dr. Pepper and a bag of sea salt and vinegar chips. The right tang to complement the Pepper.

He paid. The boy working the cash register grinned.  Told him it looked like an awesome sandwich, dude. He squinted at the kid, trying to see numbers that had, for him, forever been elusive. 

Nothing. For all he knew, the boy had grabbed a quickie with the manager before his shift and then had sworn himself to eternal celibacy. 

Tucking the chips into a pocket and the sandwich into the other, he headed back to the apartment. He sipped the pop as he went. Quickly. Time ticked down. And down. 

His drink was nothing but chunks of ice when he reached the apartment building. He shook it once.  It sloshed.  That sound of ice on plastic cups. He wished he had a second drink. Or maybe a coffee. 

He *was* tired.

He hurried up the walk. A fat orange cat slunk from beneath the bushes pressed against their brick apartment complex and bee-lined for campus. He hoped a car didn’t hit it.

Running up the stairs, he quickly unlocked the door and sat down on the couch. He scarfed his sandwich and the chips until he felt mildly sick and then pulled out his laptop. He had to get at least a page written before she came home. When she was home, their lives revolved around hot honey, feathers, sweat, condoms, and, on occasion, role play. It did not revolve around deadlines.

One page. That was all he needed. It was a decent goal. 

He cracked his jaw yawning. He tried to organize his thoughts.  He felt like he was bumbling through an old attic.

Shit. He needed a break. A real break. Maybe he would ask her. Just once to see if she could let her numbers inch above twenty-four hours. It sounded nice. Irritated, he stripped down to his boxers. He worked better that way. Free and open and oddly exposed. Kept the mind on-edge. Adrenaline pumping.  Mind racing.

He bent forward and frowned at his screen. Write.

He was five words short of a page when the door opened. She smiled at him, flushed from her walk. Her skin glistened with tiny translucent beads of sweat. Her hair, thick and rich, was tousled around her face like streamers from a wind-tossed kite. 

Shit again. Who was he kidding?  He couldn’t resist her for twenty-four hours.

Her smile turned wicked, as if she knew his thoughts, could trace them as easily as she did the numbers ticking above his head. 

She closed the door with her foot. Then, biting her lip, white teeth pulling against red lips, she took off her shirt. Dropped it unceremoniously on the ground. She unhooked her bra.

He was undone.

6qs62s,1,2017-07-31,Resume Help - Returned to same company after short while for better position,PalestinianPlverizer,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6qs62s/resume_help_returned_to_same_company_after_short/,"Hello PF,
I am looking for a bit of help in how to write my resume for a job I am interested in.

I was an intern at company A for 1.5 years, and when I was about to graduate from university, they did not have a position for me, but told me they would stay in touch. I got a job at company B, however they promised me one job, then the department ""restructured"" right before I started, so I was not doing the job they gave me. Company A contacts me after being at company B for 4 months and offers me a job, and I accept. I've been back at company A for about 6 months, however with new management they are becoming a bit unbearable. 

I always browse open positions around me, and I found a position that is a better position/better pay/etc. that I would like to apply for. My question is: How do I summarize my employment history on my resume to appear the best that it can? I feel it would look awkward if I write:

Company A - (mid 2014- end of 2016)

Company B - (end 2016 - start 2017)

Company A - start 2017 - present

Should I write it like:

Company A (mid 2014- end of 2016, start 2017 - present)

Company B (end 2016 - start 2017)

Or, should I write it some other way? I feel like it would be awkward to give two job descriptions, especially when my duties were mostly the same (I was an information security intern, then they created a full-time position for me).

Should I address the two time periods in the description?

Thanks!"
6qs67v,5,2017-07-31,Utopia: Cell Two-Thirteen,Sin_Crow_7,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/6qs67v/utopia_cell_twothirteen/,"There was once a minimum security prison that promised the world to its prisoners. At one point there were so many empty cells the warden used them to reward good behavior. It wasn't much, but a few things to make the inmates feel like they weren't there. The warden implemented a reward system for inmates who helped in various ways. Some helped other inmates either to read or learn skills to help them on the outside. Others maintained the grounds, either in the yard or cleaning throughout the halls.

The warden believed it was the obligation of his prison to better its inhabitants. Charles Hadlin believed that everyone deserved an opportunity to improve themselves. He believed that a prison was a school for humanity, meant to strengthen those at a disadvantage. Through this philosophy, he helped hundreds of men receive various degrees and diplomas. Some learned skills that would help them provide for their families on the outside. Former prisoners sent him letters all the time to thank him. Prison provided opportunities that they never would've found on the outside. They had to come to prison to become a better person. 

Inspired by his philosophy, Charles Hadlin always did what he could to keep people out of trouble. One day, he stood between two gang-members in the hallway. One pulled a knife out of his pocket and Charles tried to stop him. The knife stabbed him in the jugular and when the man tried to pull it out he cut right through.

Hundreds of inmates attended his funeral and paid their respects to his widow. They presented her with a check for ten-thousand dollars. The check was inside an envelope with five cards signed by hundreds of inmates. They also signed a petition to have the name of the prison changed to ‘Charles Hadlin Memorial Prison’, to honor his promise of a better life to any and all who walked through these gates. 

Joseph Reinlein became the warden. He had his own philosophy on rehabilitation and the human condition. He worked for a company that bought out the lease for the prison. Charles Hadlin labored against any prison being run in the name of profit. When Joseph Reinlein took over, he helped the company ‘strip it for parts’. They outsourced the lunchroom to ‘Bioprotein’, who owned slaughterhouses out in Ohio. Several investigations had found a litany of health code infractions. Some, if not all workers occupied their time using the chickens as entertainment. They'd tear off their heads and throw their bodies into the walls. 

Somehow, along with these abuses, various animals were fed their own flesh. It led to various diseases spreading through the slaughterhouse. None of these slaughterhouses closed as a result of any of these investigations. 

The library was also stripped and the books shipped away. They left a few books, but none above a twelfth-grade reading level. Several coloring books remained, but most were full of obscenities and crudely drawn genitalia. 

The cells meant for ‘reward’ were torn apart as well. Some became integral in punishing the prisoners. They'd sit in darkness for hours, if not days, before the warden called them in for questioning. Their screams could be heard throughout the halls. It presented an ominous question to everyone who heard it, 'What was happening in their prison?' 

Charles Hadlin believed that a prison belongs to its inhabitants. Joseph Reinlein believed that it belonged to him. The prisoners understood that the prison as they knew it no longer belonged to them. Doom sank into the prisoners who’d admired their former warden and it only got worse with every new prisoner. They understood that existence was all about survival now. It couldn’t be dreams of improvement and paying for your sins. Survival meant finding comfort in primitive torture methods, psychological devices and biblical justice. 

This first class assimilated well with the new regime. Within those first few hours, they fought, not only with themselves, but with those who'd been in the prison. Their savagery terrified everyone who clung to the ideologies of their fallen warden. The promise of improving their lives dwindled to a faint memory and, although it brought them great joy, it came with a price. The prisoners turned on each other. They fashioned schivs to protect themselves, as their enemies multiplied over night. Everyone followed the new philosophy of the Charles Hadlin Memorial Prison, which was ‘protect oneself over those who would harm it’. ‘Kill or be killed’ came much later, but the simple necessity of such a belief resonated with a succinct wisdom for all to follow. 

It was a time to prepare. The horizon was dark and the stars were plentiful. Bright lights shining in the distance meant the doom and extinction of the human race. They went wild with desire. That mentality was hard to suppress. Once you left the wilds it was hard to return. They took that philosophy with them. The streets didn’t look the same. They were the place that sent them to the jungle! Prisoners were realizing the jungle is everywhere. The nightmare is real. They live it every day and so the cycle continues. 

Fear became the strength of many a man who would survive in prison. When, if in accordance with the state’s sentence, he is freed, this mentality is strong enough that it will never leave. It’s imbedded in his every fear, like a parasite. In a sudden flash, it can take control and make a man do crazy things. A prisoner could overcome his fear of returning to prison if his instincts kicked in much harder, as if to outdo the wave of terror. It becomes addictive to the point that the spirit breaks and a prisoner makes his return. 

Returning prisoners always walk in like they own the place and fought their way to the top of the food chain. They became natural leaders to the freshly terrified masses. Gangs formed with greater intensity, as fiercer leaders fought their way to the top. They became kings, controlling vast resources that led to more infighting. Gangs separated and formed more gangs. They fought for resources, which meant an influx of drugs and contraband. The influx of contraband meant the prisoners had to bribe some of the guards. A private company took over for the guards who'd worked their entire lives in this prison. Those who stuck around lost benefits and earned a little more than minimum wage. The prisoners helped the guards pay their bills if they performed a few favors. 

Everyone knew the philosophy in one way or another. The guards were underpaid for their field and under-trained. They were susceptible to the same fears as the prisoners. It was easier for them to empathize with their plight and want to offer support. Some formed a strong enough bond that they did favors for each other’s families. It was the first step toward an 'internship' into their lucrative drug business.

Joseph Reinlin concerned himself with humanity only when necessary. The influx of drugs became an epidemic and leaked over to the outside world. It became so much of an issue that Joseph decided to act. It became an issue to maintain good behavior, but he knew the rewards of the past could never return. It was barbarism that they dealt with and he dealt as he saw fit. 

He told no one of his plans, but offered a simple proposition. If they followed the rules for the entire month, by the end they would receive a reward. No one knew what the reward would be, but the next day a sheet covered the inside of Cell Two-Thirteen. The guards had only rumors to share with the prisoners. Reinlein's proposition intrigued them. They decided they could lay off the drugs and violence for a month. The drugs disappeared after about a week, as so few could find the strength to flush their stash. They had a good week of debauchery and parted with their drugs. 

The end of the month came and no one had complained about the shitty food or unfair treatment. The invasive 'pat-downs' had no affect on the prisoners or the random cell checks. Their minds centered on the prize. It was a promise that they thought no more than a fable. They hoped and, if after a month, the warden didn’t give them what they wanted, well… there was always a chance for a return!

On the morning of August thirty-first, a piece of paper on a clip-board was placed in the middle of the lunchroom. At the top it read “Sign another prisoner’s name. Sign at any number you want. One name per prisoner.” 

Night seemed insistent on never making a return. The prisoners paced in their cells and waited for anything. Nothing happened, so they assumed the warden reneged. They kept on alert, as any sound was enough to set them off. They felt like children on Christmas morning. 

A cell opened. The prisoner asked what was happening, but the guards didn’t answer. No one knew what happened after that, as they heard the guard’s tossing his cell. They pummeled him, until he collapsed and then dragged him down the corridor. The man didn’t fight, as he was dragged along the ground.

The guards tied him up in Cell Two-Thirteen and left him for the night. They brought each prisoner down to Cell Two-Thirteen and promised this: “Ten minutes. Don’t kill him.” The guards stayed up all night, working in shifts. Even the warden assisted and took over when one of his guards needed a break. Constant cries echoed for the first hour, before the man lost the energy. Nothing compared to the sound of fists pummeling raw meat. He went numb after several hours of torture and considered it a blessing. 

The blessing came in the infirmary, where the nurses gave him his own room, as well as anything he wanted to (or could) eat. The guards brought in a television set and several DVDs that they brought from home. The nurses provided plenty of painkillers and let him rest in his coma. There was no fear. There was no pain. It felt like, well, as close to heaven as he’d ever get. 

When he returned, it wasn’t as a pariah, as he expected. It was as… something of an oddity. They looked at him, not as the ‘fresh-meat’ of a new prisoner, but as a friend who’d been abducted by aliens. They wanted to know all about where he’d been and what happened to him. Somehow, they all seemed to forget about the incident and expected him to do the same or at least gloss over the portion that involved them. It felt right to embrace the moment and deny his immutable terror. He told them that he could hardly remember his night of suffering, but that it was the greatest experience of his life. The drugs took all the pain away, even erasing his memory of the night before. It all went by in a flash, which only returned when he woke up the next day. 

Reality asserted itself, as he made his way to his cell. It became engrained all the more, as he lost his ticket to heaven and would most likely never, ever get it back. He wasn't alone. Prisoners obsessed over the possibility of inflicting vengeance on their enemies. Others dreamt of feeling the pain and collapsing into a comatose state for a few days. ‘Protect oneself from the one who would harm it’ took on new meaning, as the atavistic nature of the human spirit assumed its true form. 

Mysterious bruises, painful wounds and scars appeared every month on one prisoner. Some had scars on their knuckles or hands, while others had busted jaws or closed black eyes. Nobody said a word, but their family members would always ask. Not everyone could keep from mentioning Cell Two-Thirteen. It didn’t take long for word to get around. Family members wouldn’t be able to control themselves. They’d obsess over the idea, this possibility of achieving the ‘all-impossible’ specter of revenge. 

While the violence and drugs disappeared in the prison, it was multiplying on the outside. Prisoners would leave the prison and tell their stories, always centered on Cell Two-Thirteen. Only the bravest would risk a venture, even for curiosity, within the walls of the prison. Still, if they knew the right people and knew who to vote for at the end of the month, anyone could get in. People who'd never been in prison committed petty crimes. All they had to do was vote for one person and their family would receive thousands of dollars.

When violence and crime went down in prison, it multiplied on the outside. It became necessary to fill the prison with people who would help them torment their foes. The outside world molded around this obsession for Cell Two-Thirteen. The mentality of everyday people matched those in prison with suspicion and curiosity. They realized their enemies were waiting to see weakness, before they struck. It became necessary to collect weapons of all varieties. Underground gun sales skyrocketed. Personal munitions alliances formed between industry leaders and group advocates. The violence on the streets helped them exploit the fear of the ‘everyday citizen’. 

It became necessary and almost mandatory for every citizen to have a gun. Paranoia spread much faster among the everyday citizen. The media fed them stories of crime on every street and war in every city. Fear was spread through the mind of the everyday citizen and then followed along like a virus in a repetitive cycle between coworkers, family and friends. They followed simple taglines, as the media and public officials provided simple solutions, sayings that people could remember, so they might carry them longer and spread their falsehoods.

Cell Two-Thirteen became an augury of doom in some circles. Gang members would write it on the front doors of people's houses who they would want to hunt. Once the neighborhood saw it on your door they knew you were ‘fair game’. Families would abandon their homes in the middle of the night, leaving their things behind, packing up what they could and moving on with their lives. They’d quit their jobs and move across country. They changed their names and forgot their lives, hoping for the best, but once you’re marked by Cell Two-Thirteen there’s no going back."
6qscpa,1,2017-07-31,[M4f] Young office intern/Bimbo Slut/Celebs/First Massage and more,CZ2Collin,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/6qscpa/m4f_young_office_internbimbo_slutcelebsfirst/,"I have a number of prompts today, mostly ideas I have seen on here and I really liked. 

1)	You are an intern at my office. You are not even close to qualified, but I told you that if you were willing to go above and beyond, I would hire you and give you a good recommendation for your next job or maybe college. You would be my personal secretary and would have to do what I tell you to, or risk an unfavorable recommendation.

2) I have never RP’d a bimbo scenario but I would like to try. Maybe you are my little sister or my daughter. I decide, after not having much romantic luck lately, to try to turn you in to my perfect bimbo slut. I don’t think I would want to make this a super extreme transformation, fyi. I think you would be about 13 and you already seem to tease me a little wearing slightly more revealing outfits, or just a towel after a shower. 

3) Celebs. A little known Hollywood secret is that all of those sexy female celebs and starlets that never seem to age, you ever wonder why? It’s because they use the cum of young boys to keep their skin looking flawless. You would play a celebrity and I would play your “cum dispenser”. 

4)	A young girl gets her first massage, or her first private yoga lesson, etc…

5)	Private tutoring for a young girl

6)	You are one of my sister’s friends and we decide on a scenario where I seduce you, maybe you come over to hang out with my sister but she isn’t home yet so I suggest you wait. Maybe I offer you a beer or something….

For a number of these I would be fine with reversing the roles and genders if you want to play the older character. And if you are interested in tweaking one of these, feel free to give me your suggestion!

Kinks: Cumplay, age play, lingerie, instructions, oral (giving/receiving), other vanillaish stuff

Limits: The usual, scat, gore, violence, rape, death, futa, furry, group, etc

Its been almost a year since I left for college. Its almost summer break and time for me to come visit again. As I get to your door with my suitcase in hand to knock on your door. You open it with a smile. I drop my suitcase an lean into a hug with you. I step inside and look around.
